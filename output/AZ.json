(\"A2Z\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:AZ)(FRA - WKN:A3CSQ), a global leader in innovative technology solutions, is pleased to announce that its subsidiary Cust2Mate Ltd., a leading provider of smart shopping cart solutions, has submitted a patent application for its **Shopping Cart Inventory Change Indicator System** , a solution designed to address inventory shrinkage issues in retail through the application of advanced technologies, powered sophisticated proprietary artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nIn 2023, U.S. retailers suffered an estimated $142 billion in losses due to inventory shrink, 25% more than in 2022, according to a WSJ report, citing figures from investment bank [William Blair](https://pr.report/2iyi).\n\nThe core of the Shopping Cart Inventory Change Indicator System is its AI-driven anomaly detection module. This module employs deep learning algorithms to monitor and analyze shopper behavior in real-time, identifying patterns that may indicate theft or other irregular activities. Complementing this, the system includes a barcode scanner for item tracking, a computer vision system with high-resolution cameras for product recognition, and a security scale that measures item weight to detect discrepancies.\n\nA key feature of the system is its advanced change detection solution using a camera system. The high-resolution cameras are strategically positioned to capture detailed images of items placed into or removed from the shopping cart. The computer vision system processes these images to detect any changes, ensuring accurate product recognition and real-time inventory updates. This precise monitoring capability enables the system to identify discrepancies and potential theft attempts, thereby significantly improving inventory accuracy and security.\n\nMr. Gadi Graus, CEO of A2Z, commented, \"A2Z focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence to provide sophisticated solutions for retail challenges. The patent-pending Shopping Cart Inventory Change Indicator System exemplifies this approach, offering an advanced method for inventory management and theft mitigation. As the retail sector evolves, Cust2Mate is committed to developing technologies that enhance operational efficiency and security.\"\n\n**About A2Z Cust2Mate Solutions Corp.**\n\nA2Z Cust2Mate Solutions Corp. brings innovation, ease, excitement and value to retailers and shoppers.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present\nfairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to\nperform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but\nnot for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Ziv Haft\nCertified Public Accountants (Isr)\nBDO Member Firm\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since year 2017.\nTel Aviv, Israel\nMarch 27, 2023\nF-1\nA2Z SMART TECHNOLOGIES CORP.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n(In Thousands of US Dollars, except per share data)\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 2,616 $ 8,470\nDeposits 8 60\nInventories (note 5) 375 1,147\nTrade receivables, net (note 6) 1,373 857\nOther accounts receivable (note 8) 2,570 434\nTotal current assets 6,942 10,968\nIntangible asset -

(the “Company” or “A2ZST”) was incorporated on January 15, 2018 under the laws of British Columbia. The head office is located at\n1600 – 609 Granville Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V7Y 1C3, and the records and registered office is located at 2200 HSBC Building 885 West Georgia Street, British\nColumbia, V6C 3E8.\nThe Company was listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) starting January 22, 2022, and trades under the symbol “AZ” and on the TSX Venture Exchange\n(“TSX Venture”) and trades under the symbol “AZ.V”.\nThe Company owns 79.49% of the common shares of Cust2Mate Ltd (“Cust2Mate”), a technology company focused on providing retail automation solutions, in particular for\nlarge grocery stores and supermarkets. The Company’s primary product is the Cust2Mate system which incorporates a “smart cart” which automatically calculates the value of\nthe customers purchases in their smart cart, without having to unload and reload their purchases at a customer checkout point.\nThe Cust2Mate system offers various features for shoppers and retailers such as product information and location, an on-cart scale to weigh items and automatically calculate\ncosts, bar-code scanner and on-board payment system to bypass checkout lines. In addition, the product includes big data smart algorithms and computer vision capabilities,\nallowing for customer specific targeted advertising. (“The Cust2Mate Platform”).\nThe Cust2Mate Platform is being rolled out in Israel and is being marketed throughout the world, with pilots in North and South America and in the Middle East.\nThe Company’s other activities include the provision of maintenance services utilizing the application of advanced engineering capabilities to the military and security markets\nas well as the development of related products for the civilian markets. Such services include providing maintenance services and container leasing. The Company also provides\nmaintenance services for complex electronic systems and products.\nOn February 3, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Isramat Ltd. This strategic acquisition vertically integrates certain manufacturing capabilities for the production\nof A2Z’s Cust2Mate smart cart while complementing existing contract manufacturing partnerships to support anticipated worldwide growth. See also note 6.\nThe Company, through its 80% owned subsidiary, Advanced Automotive Innovations Inc., (“AAI”) continues the development of a product for the automotive market - the\nFTICS or Fuel Tank Inertia Capsule System which activates automatically in the event of a vehicle collision. This eliminates the danger of fuel tank combustion thereby saving\nlives and reducing damage.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had four subsidiaries, all of which are companies incorporated under the laws of Israel: (1) Cust2mate Ltd. (“Cust2mate”); (2) A2Z\nAdvanced Military Solutions Ltd (“A2Z MS”); (3) A2Z Advanced Solutions (“A2Z AS”); and (4) Isramat Ltd, the “Subsidiaries”).\nThe Company had a net loss of approximately $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, $39.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and $7.2 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2020. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $67 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company has incurred negative cash from operation\nand net losses for current and recent years. The Company financed its operation up do date by issuance of shares and warrants, The Company does not have any material\nfinancial obligations as of the balance date The company believes that it has sufficient resources to operate in the foreseeable future with the support of its officers.\nOn March 13, 2023, the Company closed, in escrow, the issuance of 1,783,561 units (“Units”) at a price per Unit of US$1.46 (CAD$1.95), for gross proceeds of US$2,604 (See\nalso note 32(b)).\nThese consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on March 27, 2023.\nF-7\nA2Z SMART TECHNOLOGIES CORP.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in Thousands of US Dollars, except per share data)\nNOTE 2 – BASIS OF PREPARATION:\nA. Basis of preparation\nThe principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out above. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical\ncost convention except for certain derivatives. The Company has elected to present the statement of comprehensive income using the function of expense method.\nB. Basis of consolidation\nWhere the Company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial\nstatements from the date that control commenced until the date control ceases. The Company controls an investee if all three elements are present: power over the investee,\nexposure to variable returns from the investee, and the ability of the investor to use its power to affect those variable returns. Control is reassessed whenever facts and\ncircumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company and its Subsidiaries as if they formed a single entity. Any intercompany\ntransactions were eliminated in full.\nC. Basis of Measurement\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, under the historical cost basis, except for financial instruments which have been measured\nat fair value.\nD. Functional and foreign currency\nThe Company’s functional currency is the New Israeli Shekel (“NIS”), since the Company’s primary economic environment is in Israel. However, the presentation currency is\nin US Dollars (“USD”) due to expected future expansion. Transactions and balances in foreign currencies are converted into US Dollars in accordance with the principles set\nforth by International Accounting Standard (IAS) 21 “The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”. Accordingly, transactions and balances have been converted as\nfollows:\n● Monetary assets and liabilities - at the rate of exchange applicable at the statements of financial position date.\n● Exchange gains and losses from the aforementioned conversion are recognized in the statement of comprehensive loss.\n● Expense items - at exchange rates applicable as of the date of recognition of those items.\n● Non-monetary items are converted at the rate of exchange at the statements of financial position date.\nF-8\nA2Z SMART TECHNOLOGIES CORP.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in Thousands of US Dollars, except per share data)\nNOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:\nA. Cash and cash equivalents\nCash equivalents are considered by the Company to be highly liquid investments, including, inter alia, short-term deposits with banks, the maturity of which do not exceed three\nmonths at the time of deposit, and which are not restricted.\nB. Short term deposits\nA short term deposit is cash held in a short-term deposit (between three months and one year) or in a long-term deposit (with a maturity of more than one year from the date of\ninvestment). Short term deposits are deposits designated to secure the Company’s car lease agreements and its credit cards.\nC. Loss per share\nBasic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period.\nDiluted loss per share is computed similarly to basic loss per share except that the weighted average number of shares outstanding is increased to include additional shares from\nthe assumed exercise of stock options and warrants, if dilutive. The average number of shares is calculated by assuming that outstanding conversions were exercised and that the\nproceeds from such exercises were used to acquire common shares at the average market price during the reporting period. For the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020,\npotentially dilutive common shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants and options were not included in the computation of loss per share because their effect was anti-\ndilutive.\nD. Provisions\nProvisions are recognized when the Company has a legal or constructive obligation, as a result of past events, for which it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will\nresult and that outflow can be reliably measured. Provisions are measured using the best estimate of the amounts required to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting\nperiod.\nE. Fair value measurement\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n1. In the principal market for the asset or liability, or\n2. In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Company.\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market\nparticipants act in their economic best interest.\nF-9\nA2Z SMART TECHNOLOGIES CORP.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in Thousands of US Dollars, except per share data)\nNOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):\nE. Fair value measurement (cont.)\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or\nby selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances\nand for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.\nClassification of fair value hierarchy\nThe financial instruments presented in the statement of financial position at fair value are grouped into classes with similar characteristics using the following fair value\nhierarchy which is determined based on the source of input used in measuring fair value:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3 - Inputs that are not based on observable market data (valuation techniques which use inputs that are not based on observable market data).\n1. Financial assets\nThe Company classifies its financial assets into one of the following categories, based on the business model for managing the financial asset and its contractual cash flow\ncharacteristics. The Company’s accounting policy for the relevant category is as follows:\nAmortized cost: These assets arise principally from the provision of goods and services to customers (e.g. trade accounts receivable), but also incorporate other types of\nfinancial assets where the objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest.\nThey are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the\neffective interest rate method, less provision for impairment. Impairment provisions for trade accounts receivable are recognized based on the simplified approach within IFRS\n9 using a provision in the determination of the lifetime expected credit losses. During this process the probability of the non-payment of the trade receivables is assessed. This\nprobability is then multiplied by the amount of the expected loss arising from default to determine the lifetime expected credit loss for the trade receivables. For trade\nreceivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate provision account with the loss being recognized within general and administrative expenses in\nthe consolidated statement of comprehensive income. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against\nthe associated provision.\nF-10\nA2Z SMART TECHNOLOGIES CORP.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in Thousands of US Dollars, except per share data)\nNOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):\nE. Fair value measurement (cont.):\n2. Financial Liabilities\nThe Company classifies its financial liabilities into one of two categories, depending on the purpose for which the liability was acquired. The Company’s accounting policy for\neach category is as follows:\nFair value through profit or loss: Warrants are initially recognized at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument. Such liabilities are\nsubsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.\nOther financial liabilities include the following items: Bank borrowings are initially recognized at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the\ninstrument. Such interest-bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that any interest expense over\nthe period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the consolidated statement of financial position. For the purposes of each financial liability,\ninterest expense includes initial transaction costs and any premium payable on redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding. Trade\naccounts payable and other accounts payable, which are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.\nAnother financial liability recognized at fair value is due to a commitment to the selling shareholders of Isramat (See also note 7) that if the aggregate proceeds received by a\nselling shareholder from the sale of its acquisition shares during the lockup period, together with the value of its unsold acquisition shares as of the end of such period, is lower\nthan its pro rata portion in the equity consideration, the Company will pay the difference in cash to such selling shareholder.\n3. Issue of a unit of securities:\nThe issue of a unit of securities involves the allocation of the proceeds received (before issue expenses) to the securities issued in the unit based on the following order: financial\nderivatives and other financial instruments measured at fair value in each period. Then fair value is determined for financial liabilities that are measured at amortized cost. The\nproceeds allocated to equity instruments are determined to be the residual amount. Issue costs are allocated to each component pro rata to the amounts determined for each\ncomponent in the unit.\n4. Derivative liability - Warrants:\nWarrants that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company are considered a derivative liability and are classified as financial liabilities at\nfair value through profit or loss. Accordingly, these warrants are measured at fair value and the changes in fair value in each reporting period are recognized in profit or loss.\n5. Derecognition\n● Financial assets - The Company derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the\nrights to receive the contractual cash flows.\n● Financial Liabilities - The Company derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire.\nF-11\nA2Z SMART TECHNOLOGIES CORP.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in Thousands of US Dollars, except per share data)\nNOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):\nE. Fair value measurement (cont.):\n6. Impairment of financial assets\nECL and their measurement\nECL are measured as the unbiased probability-weighted present value of all cash shortfalls over the expected life of each financial asset. For receivables from financial services,\nECL are mainly calculated with a statistical model using three major risk parameters: probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. The estimation of these\nrisk parameters incorporates all available relevant information, not only historical and current loss data, but also reasonable and supportable forward-looking information\nreflected by the future expectation factors. This information includes macroeconomic factors (e.g., gross domestic product growth, unemployment rate, cost performance index)\nand forecasts of future economic conditions. For receivables from financial services, these forecasts are performed using a scenario analysis (base case, adverse and optimistic\nscenarios).\nAs of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, ECL for trade and other account receivables are not material, and as such are not disclosed, in accordance IFRS 9.\nDefinition of default, including reasons for selecting the definition\nPrior to commencing a business relationship, the Company will enter into an agreement with the customer. The agreement or contract typically includes details of the terms of\npayment to which the customer is entitled. In most cases, the customer updates the Company if there is a delay in the payment beyond the terms of the agreement. Any delays in\npayment for more than two months are subject to approval of management. If a customer’s scheduled payment is delayed by more than two months and such delay is not\napproved by the Company’s management, the CEO will typically make direct contact with the customer’s management and inform them of the overdue obligation and that\nCompany will pursue remedies available to collect the overdue payment. If the customer and the Company are not able to resolve the matter at that time, the receivable is\nconsidered to be in default as the collectability is no longer certain. If the collection effort is not successful, the Company will retain legal counsel in the applicable country to\nassist with collection and sends a demand letter to that effect.\nWrite-off policy\nThe Company writes off its financial assets if any of the following occur:\n● Inability to locate the debtor.\n● Discharge of the debt in a bankruptcy.\n● It is determined that the efforts to collect the debt are no longer cost effective given the size of receivable.\nThe collections department must comply with the collection efforts outlined in the policy to collect on delinquent customer accounts before any write-offs are made.\nF-12\nA2Z SMART TECHNOLOGIES CORP.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in Thousands of US Dollars, except per share data)\nNOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):\nE.

The three-level matrix contains the following groups and balances:\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nGovernment institutions $ 279 $ 296\nIndustrial customers 1,052 -\nOther customers 42 561\nTotal $ 1,373 $ 857\nF-13\nA2Z SMART TECHNOLOGIES CORP.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in Thousands of US Dollars, except per share data)\nNOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):\nF. Operating Segment:\nn operating segment is a component of the Company that meets the following three criteria:\n1. Is engaged in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses;\n2. Whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about allocated resources to the segment and\nassess its performance; and\n3. For which separate financial information is available.\nSegment revenue and segment costs include items that are attributable to the relevant segments and items that can be allocated to segments. Items that cannot be allocated to\nsegments include the Company’s financial income and expenses and income tax. The Company has three operating segments; Precision Metal Parts, Advanced Engineering and\nSmart Carts.\nG. Share-based compensation:\nWhere equity settled share options are awarded to employees and service providers, the fair value of the options calculated at the grant date is based on the market share price\nand is charged to the statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity\ninstruments expected to vest at each reporting date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognized over the vesting period is based on the number of options that\neventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted. As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made\nirrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied. The cumulative expense charged is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition.\nH. Deferred taxes\nDeferred taxes are recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the amounts attributable\nfor tax purposes. Significant judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the estimated timing and level of future\ntaxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.\nDeferred taxes are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the temporary differences are reversed based on tax laws that have been enacted or\nsubstantively enacted at the end of the reporting period. Deferred taxes are recognized in Profit or loss, except when they relate to items recognized in other comprehensive\nincome or directly in equity. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is not probable that they will be utilized. In\naddition, temporary differences (such as carry forward losses) for which deferred tax assets have not been recognized or reassessed are recognized to the extent that their\nrecoverability is probable. Any resulting reduction or reversal is recognized as “income tax” within the statement of comprehensive income. All deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are presented in the statement of financial position as non-current items, respectively.\nDeferred taxes are offset in the statement of financial position if there is a legally enforceable right to offset a current tax asset against a current tax liability and the deferred\ntaxes relate to the same taxpayer and the same taxation authority.\nThe current tax liability is measured using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date as well as adjustments required in\nconnection with the tax liability in respect of previous years.\nDeferred tax assets in respect to carryforward losses have not been recognized in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available\nagainst which the group can utilize the benefits therefrom.\nF-14\nA2Z SMART TECHNOLOGIES CORP.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in Thousands of US Dollars, except per share data)\nNOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):\nI. Defined benefit schemes\nThe Company contributes towards the state pension in accordance with local legislation where required. The only obligation of the Company is to make the required\ncontributions. Costs related to such contributions are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.\nThe Company has several employee benefits plans as to its employees:\n1. Short-term employee benefits: Short-term employee benefits include salaries, paid annual leave, paid sick leave, recreation and social security contributions and are\nrecognized as expenses as the services are rendered. A liability in respect of a cash bonus or a profit-sharing plan is recognized when the Company has a legal or\nconstructive obligation to make such payment as a result of past service rendered by an employee and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.\n2. Post-employment benefits: The plans are normally financed by contributions to insurance companies and classified as defined contribution plans or as defined benefit plans.\nThis liability is calculated based on actuary measurement.\nContributions to the defined contribution plan in respect of severance or retirement pay are recognized as an expense simultaneously with receiving the employee’s services and\nno additional provision is required in the financial statements except for the unpaid contribution. The Company also operates for some employees an immaterial defined benefit\nplan in respect of severance pay pursuant to the Severance Pay Law. The Company presents the accrued severance pay liability net from severance pay fund.\nJ. Property, plant and equipment\nItems of property, plant and equipment are initially recognized at cost. Cost includes directly attributable costs and the estimated present value of any future costs of dismantling\nand removing items. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method, based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:\nEstimated useful lives\nComputers and electronic equipment 3\nMachines and manufacturing equipment 10\nFurniture and equipment 7\nVehicles 6.67\nERP system and R&D expenses 3-6\nLeasehold Improvement 10\nF-15\nA2Z SMART TECHNOLOGIES CORP.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in Thousands of US Dollars, except per share data)\nNOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):\nJ. Revenue recognition\nRevenue is recognized based on the five-step model outlined in IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. IFRS 15 sets out a single revenue recognition model,\naccording to which the entity shall recognize revenue in accordance with the said core principle by implementing a five-step model framework:\n1. Identify the contracts with a customer.\n2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract.\n3. Determine the transaction price.\n4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.\n5. Recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\ni. Revenue from services is derived from contracts with customers pursuant to which the Company provides maintenance for various electronic systems. Revenues on these\ncontracts are recognized using the straight-line method, based on the period of time passed.\nii. Revenues generated in Isramat are recognized from sale of goods in profit or loss at the point in time when the control of the goods is transferred to the customer, generally\nupon delivery of the goods to the customer.\nPerformance obligations and timing of revenue recognition\nThe majority of the Company’s revenue is derived from selling goods with revenue recognized at a point in time when control of the goods has transferred to the customer.\nThis is generally when the goods are delivered to the customer. However, for export sales, control might also be transferred when delivered either to the port of departure or\nport of arrival, depending on the specific terms of the contract with a customer. There is limited judgement needed in identifying the point control passes: once physical\ndelivery of the products to the agreed location has occurred, the Company no longer has physical possession, usually will have a present right to payment (as a single\npayment on delivery) and retains none of the significant risks and rewards of the goods in question.\nThe Company has a segment which carries out maintenance and leasing services for clients, with revenue recognized typically on an over time basis. This is because the\ndesigns created have no alternative use for the Company and the contracts would require payment to be received for the time and effort spent by the Company on\nprogressing the contracts in the event of the customer cancelling the contract prior to completion for any reason other than the Company’s failure to perform its obligations\nunder the contract. On partially complete service contracts, A Layout (International) recognizes revenue based on stage of completion of the project which is estimated by\ncomparing the number of hours actually spent on the project with the total number of hours expected to complete the project (i.e. an input based method). This is considered\na faithful depiction of the transfer of services as the contracts are initially priced on the basis of anticipated hours to complete the projects and therefore also represents the\namount to which the Company would be entitled based on its performance to date.\nDetermining the transaction price\nA substantial amount of the Company’s revenue is derived from Smart Cart segment – fixed price contracts and therefore the amount of revenue to be earned from each\ncontract is determined by reference to those fixed prices. Exceptions are as follows:\n● For one key customer, the Company accepts orders and is paid up in advance of delivering the products.\nK. Share based payment transactions\nThe Company’s employees and other service providers are entitled to remuneration in the form of equity-settled share-based payment.\nThe cost of equity-settled transactions is recognized in profit or loss together with a corresponding increase in equity during the period which the performance and/or service\nconditions are to be satisfied ending on the date on which the relevant employees become entitled to the award (“the vesting period”). The cumulative expense recognized for\nequity-settled transactions at the end of each reporting date includes the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.\nThe cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted at grant date. The fair value of option granted is\ndetermined using the Binomial Lattice option-pricing model (“Binomial model”). The Binomial model takes into account variables such as volatility, dividend yield rate, and\nrisk-free interest rate and also allows for the use of dynamic assumptions and considers the contractual term of the option, the probability that the option will be exercised prior\nto the end of its contractual life, and the probability of termination or retirement of the option holder in computing the value of the option.\nL. Research and development expenses\nResearch expenses are recognized in profit or loss when incurred. An intangible asset arising from a development project or from the development phase of an internal project is\nrecognized if the Company can demonstrate all of the following: the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale; the\nCompany’s intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it; the Company’s ability to use or sell the intangible asset; how the intangible asset will generate future\neconomic benefits; the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the intangible asset; and the Company’s ability to measure reliably the\nexpenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. Through December 31, 2022, costs in the amount of $219 have been capitalized and relate to the\nCompany’s ERP system. All other development expenses have not met all the aforementioned criteria and therefore all development costs have been recognized in profit or\nloss.\nF-16\nA2Z SMART TECHNOLOGIES CORP.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in Thousands of US Dollars, except per share data)\nNOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):\nM. Standard not yet effective\nThere are a number of standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations which have been issued by the IASB that are effective in future accounting periods that the\nCompany has decided not to adopt early.\nThe following amendments are effective for the period beginning 1 January 2023:\n- Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2);\n- Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8); and\n- Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12)\nThe following amendments are effective for the period beginning 1 January 2024:\n- IFRS 16 Leases (Amendment – Liability in a Sale and Leaseback)\n- IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (Amendment – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current)\n- IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (Amendment – Non-current Liabilities with Covenants)\nThe Company is currently assessing the impact of these new accounting standards and amendments. The Company does not believe that the amendments to IAS 1 will have a\nsignificant impact on the classification of its liabilities, as the conversion feature in its convertible debt instruments is classified as an equity instrument and therefore, does not\naffect the classification of its convertible debt as a non-current liability.\nThe Company does not expect any other standards issued by the IASB, but not yet effective, to have a material impact on the Company.\nChanges in accounting policies\nThe following amendments are effective for the period beginning 1 January 2022:\nLeases\nThe majority of the Company’s accounting policies for leases are set out in note 12.\nIdentifying leases\nThe Company accounts for a contract as a lease when it conveys the right to use an asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Leases are those contracts that\nsatisfy the following criteria:\n- There is an identified asset;\n- The Company obtains substantially all the economic benefits from use of the asset; and\n- The company has the right to direct use of the asset\nThe Company considers whether the supplier has substantive substitution rights. If the supplier does have those rights, the contract is not identified as giving rise to a lease.\nIn determining whether the Company obtains substantially all the economic benefits from use of the asset, the Company considers only the economic benefits that arise use of\nthe asset, not those incidental to legal ownership or other potential benefits.\nIn determining whether the Company has the right to direct use of the asset, the Company considers whether it directs how and for what purpose the asset is used throughout the\nperiod of use. If there are no significant decisions to be made because they are pre-determined due to the nature of the asset, the Company considers whether it was involved in\nthe design of the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose the asset will be used throughout the period of use. If the contract or portion of a contract does not\nsatisfy these criteria, the Company applies other applicable IFRSs rather than IFRS 16.\nF-17\nA2Z SMART TECHNOLOGIES CORP.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in Thousands of US Dollars, except per share data)\nNOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):\nIAS - 1 Presentation of Financial Statements\nIn January 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1, which clarify the criteria used to determine whether liabilities are classified as current or non-current. These\namendments clarify that current or non-current classification is based on whether an entity has a right at the end of the reporting period to defer settlement of the liability for at\nleast twelve months after the reporting period. The amendments also clarify that ‘settlement’ includes the transfer of cash, goods, services, or equity instruments unless the\nobligation to transfer equity instruments arises from a conversion feature classified as an equity instrument separately from the liability component of a compound financial\ninstrument. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022. However, in May 2020, the effective date was deferred to annual\nreporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023.\nThe Company evaluated the expected impact of the IAS 1 amendments on its financial position as December 31, 2022, as a reclassification of its derivative liability - warrants\nin the amount of $1,142 from Non – Current Liabilities to Current Liabilities.\nOnerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37)\nIAS 37 defines an onerous contract as a contract in which the unavoidable costs (costs that the Group has committed to pursuant to the contract) of meeting the obligations\nunder the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.\nThe amendments to IAS 37.68A clarify, that the costs relating directly to the contract consist of both:\n● The incremental costs of fulfilling that contract- e.g., direct labor and material; and\n● An allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts: e.g. Allocation of depreciation charge on property, plant and equipment used in fulfilling the\ncontract.\nThe Company, prior to the application of the amendments, did not have any onerous contracts. The Company estimates that the initial application of the Amendments is not\nexpected to have a material impact on its financial statements.\nNOTE 4 - CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS:\nThe areas requiring the use of estimates and critical judgments that may potentially have a significant impact on the Company’s earnings and financial position are the useful\nlife of property and equipment and income tax.\nThe useful life of property, plant and equipment\nProperty and equipment are amortized or depreciated over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on management’s estimates of the period that the assets will generate\nrevenue, which are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness. Changes to estimates can result in significant variations in the amounts charged to the consolidated\nstatement of comprehensive income in specific periods.\nF-18\nA2Z SMART TECHNOLOGIES CORP.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in Thousands of US Dollars, except per share data)\nNOTE 4 - CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONTINUED):\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication of impairment. The carrying value of intangibles with definite lives is reviewed\neach reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If there are indications of impairment the impairment analysis is completed and if the carrying\namount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and impairment loss is recognized.\nGoing concern\nIn order to assess whether it is appropriate for the company to continue as a going concern, management is required to apply judgment and make estimates with respect to future\ncash flow projections. In arriving at this judgment, there were several assumptions and estimates involved in calculating these future cash flow projections. This includes\nmaking estimates regarding the timing and amounts of future expenditures and the ability and timing to raising additional financing.\nFunctional currency\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are required to determine their functional currencies based on the primary economic environment in which each entity operates. In order to do\nthat, management has to analyze several factors, including which currency mainly influences the cost of undertaking the business activities, in which currency the entity has\nreceived financing, and in which currency it keeps its receipts from operating activities. Management uses its judgment to determine which factors are most important when the\nabove indicators are mixed and the functional currency is not obvious.\nImpairment of non-financial assets\nImpairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually at the financial year end. Other non-financial assets are\nsubject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying value of an asset\nexceeds its recoverable amount (i.e., the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell), the asset is written down accordingly.\nWhere it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the smallest group of assets to which it belongs for which\nthere are separately identifiable cash flows; its cash generating units (‘CGUs’). Goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to each of the Company’s CGUs that are expected to\nbenefit from a business combination that gives rise to the goodwill.\nImpairment charges are included in profit or loss, except to the extent they reverse gains previously recognized in other comprehensive income. An impairment loss recognized\nfor goodwill is not reversed.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Company’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets,\nliabilities and Contingent liabilities of the subsidiary or jointly controlled entity recognized at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognized as an asset at cost and is\nsubsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.\nDerivative liability - Warrants\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate fair value at each reporting date. The key assumptions used in the model are the expected future\nvolatility in the price of the Company’s shares and the expected life of the warrants.\nDetermining the fair value of share-based payment transactions:\nThe fair value of share-based payment transactions is determined upon initial recognition by the Binomial model. The Binomial model is based on share price and exercise price\nand assumptions regarding expected volatility, term of share option, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate.\nF-19\nA2Z SMART TECHNOLOGIES CORP.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in Thousands of US Dollars, except per share data)\nNOTE 5 - INVENTORIES:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2022 2021\nRaw materials $ 38 $ 93\nSmart cart electrical equipment - 909\nSmart cart parts 337 145\n$ 375 $ 1,147\nNOTE 6 – TRADE RCEIVABLES, NET:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2022 2021\nCustomers $ 1,383 $ 857\nExpected credit losses (10) -\n$ 1,373 $ 857\nNOTE 7 – ACQUISITION\nOn February 3, 2022, the Company announced it has completed the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of Isramat Ltd (“Isramat”), an Israeli manufacturer of precision\nmetal parts. In connection with closing of the acquisition, the Company paid NIS 2,800,000 (approximately $879) in cash and issued the selling shareholders of Isramat 273,774\ncommon shares in the capital of the Company at a price per share of $7.6311. The company has committed to the selling shareholders that if the aggregate proceeds received by\na selling shareholder from the sale of its acquisition shares during the lockup period, together with the value of its unsold acquisition shares as of the end of such period, is lower\nthan its pro rata portion in the equity consideration, the Company will pay the difference in cash to such selling shareholder. Such payment shall be made at the end of the\nlockup period after submission of a report by the selling shareholder.\nIFRS 13 favors the use of quoted prices and limits the inclusion of restrictions (such as lockup) in the calculated fair value. Based on the provisions of IFRS 13, the Company\nhas recognized a provision for the commitment to the selling shareholders on the day of the acquisition in the amount of $343. On December 31, 2022, the Company revaluated\nthe commitment to the selling shareholders in the amount of $1,447, and finance expenses in the amount of $1,105 were recognized and charged to the Consolidated Statement\nof Comprehensive Loss.\nThe table below summarizes the fair value of the commitment at the purchase date:\nBalance at January 1, 2022 $ -\nAcquisition date February 3, 2022 343\nRevaluation 1,190\nEffect of changes in foreign exchange rates (86)\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ 1,447\nThe purchase consideration has been allocated between the acquired tangible assets and intangible assets, based on their fair values.\nManagement is fully responsible for the valuation made of the assets.

The objective of financial risk management is to\ncontain, where appropriate, exposures in these financial risks to limit any negative impact on the Company’s financial performance and position.\nThe Company’s financial instruments are its cash, trade and other receivables, payables, other payables and loans. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise\nfinance for the Company’s operation. The Company actively measures, monitors and manages its financial risk exposures by various functions pursuant to the segregation of\nduties and principals. The risks arising from the Company’s financial instruments are mainly credit risk and currency risk. The risk rate on loans is fixed. The risk management\npolicies employed by the Company to manage these risks are discussed below.\nNOTE 30 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED):\nA. Credit risk:\nCredit risk arises when a failure by counterparties to discharge their obligations could reduce the amount of future cash inflows from financial assets on hand at the balance\nsheet date. The Company closely monitors the activities of its counterparties and controls the access to its intellectual property which enables it to ensure the prompt collection\nof customers’ balances. The Company’s main financial assets are cash and cash equivalents as well as other receivables and represent the Company’s maximum exposure to\ncredit risk in connection with its financial assets.\nWherever possible and commercially practical the Company holds cash with major financial institutions in Israel. Credit risk arises when a failure by counterparties to discharge\ntheir obligations could reduce the amount of future cash inflows from financial assets on hand at the balance sheet date. The Company closely monitors the activities of its\ncounterparties and controls the access to its intellectual property which enables it to ensure the prompt collection of customers’ balances.\nAlthough we maintain incident management and disaster response plans, in the event of a major disruption caused by a natural disaster or man-made problem, or outbreaks of\npandemic diseases, including COVID-19, we may be unable to continue our operations and may experience system interruptions and reputational harm. Acts of terrorism and\nother geo-political unrest, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, could also cause disruptions in our business or the business of our customers, partners, vendors, or the\neconomy as a whole. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate.\nThe Company’s main financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable as well as marketable securities and represent the Company’s maximum\nexposure to credit risk in connection with its financial assets. Wherever possible and commercially practical the Company holds cash with major financial institutions In Israel.\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2022 2021\nCash and Cash Equivalents $ 2,616 $ 8,470\nDeposits 8 60\nTrade receivables 1,373 857\nOther Accounts Receivable 2,570 434\nTotal $ 6,567 $ 9,821\nF-36\nA2Z SMART TECHNOLOGIES CORP.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in Thousands of US Dollars, except per share data)\nNOTE 30 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED):\nB. Liquidity risks:\nLiquidity risk is the risk that arises when the maturity of assets and the maturity of liabilities do not match. An unmatched position potentially enhances profitability, but can\nalso increase the risk of loss. The Company has procedures with the object of minimizing such loss by maintaining sufficient cash and other highly liquid current assets and by\nhaving an available adequate amount of committed credit facilities. The following tables detail the Company’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities. The\ntables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Company can be required to pay\nContractual\nCarrying amounts Within 1 year over 1 year\nTrade payables $ 2,224 $ 2,224 $ -\nOther accounts payable $ 956 $ 956 $ -\nLoans $ 1,744 $ 1,403 $ 341\nLease liability $ 886 $ 281 $ 605\nC. Market risks:\nThe Company’s’ business of maintenance services of various electronic systems is highly competitive and involves a certain degree of risk. The Company’s business operations\nwill depend largely upon the outcome of continued sales and services to security establishments and the initiation of sales of their products to the civilian markets.\nThe Company’s Cust2Mate business is new, and the Company is aware of competitors in the market. In addition to the regular management oversight and skills required,\nsuccess in this segment will require the Company to penetrate the market as rapidly as possible.\nAs of December 31, 2022, if the Company’s functional currency (ILS) had strengthened/ weakened by 5% against the USD, with all other variables held constant, the loss for\nthe year would decrease /increase by approximately $97.\nD. Interest rate risks:\nThe Company is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk from long-term borrowings at variable rate. It is currently Company policy that between 50% and 75% of Company\nborrowings are fixed rate borrowings. This policy is managed centrally. Although the board accepts that this policy neither protects the Company entirely from the risk of\npaying rates in excess of current market rates nor eliminates fully cash flow risk associated with variability in interest payments, it considers that it achieves an appropriate\nbalance of exposure to these risks.\nDuring 2022 and 2021, the Company’s borrowings at variable rate were denominated in NIS.\nThe Company analyses the interest rate exposure on a quarterly basis. A sensitivity analysis is performed by applying a simulation technique to the liabilities that represent\nmajor interest-bearing positions. Various scenarios are run taking into consideration refinancing, renewal of the existing positions, alternative financing, and hedging. Based on\nthe simulations performed, the impact on profit and loss and net assets of a 100 basis point shift (being the maximum reasonable expectation of changes in interest rates) would\nbe approximately $100.\nE. Capital management\nThe Company considers its capital to be comprised of shareholders’ equity. The Company’s objectives in managing its capital are to maintain its ability to continue as a going\nconcern and to further develop its business. To effectively manage the Company’s capital requirements, the Company has a planning and budgeting process in place to meet its\nstrategic goals. In order to facilitate the management of its capital requirements, the Company prepares expenditure budgets that are updated as necessary depending on various\nfactors, including successful capital deployment and general industry conditions. Management reviews the capital structure on a regular basis to ensure the above objectives are\nmet. There have been no changes to the Company’s approach to capital management during the year ended December 31, 2022. There are no externally imposed restrictions on\nthe Company’s capital.\nF-37\nA2Z SMART TECHNOLOGIES CORP.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Expressed in Thousands of US Dollars, except per share data)\nNOTE 31 – OPERATING SEGMENTS:\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are engaged in the following three segments:\na.

(formerly A2Z Smart Technologies Corp.) (A2Z or the Company) is prepared\nas of August 14, 2024, and relates to the financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. Past performance may not be\nindicative of future performance. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Companys audited consolidated annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023,\nand with the Companys condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2024, which have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS).\nAll amounts are presented in United States dollars (USD or $), the Companys presentation currency, unless otherwise stated.\nStatements are subject to the risks and uncertainties identified in the Risks and Uncertainties, and Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements sections of this document.\nReaders are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nCOMPANY OVERVIEW\nThe Company was incorporated on January 15, 2018, under the laws of British Columbia. The head office is located at 1600  609 Granville Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V7Y\n1C3, and the records and registered office is located at 2200 HSBC Building 885 West Georgia Street, British Columbia, V6C 3E8. Effective July 31, 2024, the Company changed its\nname from A2Z Smart Technologies Corp. to A2Z Cust2Mate Solutions Corp.\nOur common shares (the Common Shares) are listed for trading on the TSX Venture Exchange (the TSXV) under the trading symbol AZ, and in the United States, on the Nasdaq\nCapital Market (Nasdaq) under the trading symbol AZ.\nWe are an innovative technology company operating the following four complementary business lines through our subsidiaries: (i) development and commercialization of retail smart\ncart solutions designed primarily for use in large grocery stores and supermarkets (Cust2Mate Carts or Cust2Mate Products); (ii) manufacture of precision metal parts; (iii) provision\nof maintenance services in Israel (Maintenance Services); and (iv) development of our Fuel Tank Inertia Capsule System (FTICS) technology and a vehicle device cover for the\nmilitary and civilian automotive industry (collectively, Automotive Products).\nIn 2020, we began to rapidly develop smart carts for the retail industry, with the aim of becoming the leading mobile checkout system in the international market by providing the optimal\nsolution for shoppers and supermarket retailers. We have since focused the majority of our strategic planning, investment, research, development and marketing efforts on our Cust2Mate\nProducts, as management currently believes our operational capabilities are most effectively leveraged by growing market share in the smart cart industry.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares of Isramat, a privately held Israeli company. This acquisition vertically integrates certain\nmanufacturing capabilities for the production of the Cust2Mate Products, such as precision metal fabrication of parts, while complementing existing contract manufacturing partnerships to\nsupport the Companys growth.\nThe raw materials required by the Companys subsidiaries are readily available from multiple suppliers worldwide and their purchase costs do not fluctuate more than standard raw\nmaterials.\nSmart Cart Products and Services\nCust2Mate is a mobile self-checkout shopping cart solution that streamlines the retail shopping experience. With a user-friendly smart algorithm, touch screen and computer vision\ntechnology, our Cust2Mate smart cart scans, recognizes and adds to a displayed shopping list, each item placed in the cart, providing the shopper with real-time information regarding\nitems in the cart and tabulating the total cost of purchase. Our in-cart solution also enables shoppers to use the cart as the point of sale by use of mobile payment applications, e-wallets and\nother financial services. Cust2Mates point of sale feature effectively increases overall efficiency of the shopping experience, by expanding payment options for shoppers and retailers\nalike, reducing the need for cashiers, and reducing checkout wait times, which ultimately leads to improved customer engagement and satisfaction.\nWe combine scanning, computer vision, security scales and other anti-fraud/theft technologies, with a large screen tablet capable of relaying real-time shopping information and value-\nadded digital services. Our solution is stackable and lightweight, with a robust recognition platform that provides a higher level of accuracy in product identification, leveraging in-store\nWi-Fi and cutting-edge software.\nFor retailers, Cust2Mate enables improved inventory management, increased efficiency, reduced labor costs, increased anti-fraud protection, reduced theft and real-time data analytics and\ninsights regarding consumer behavior. Our solutions are designed to easily integrate with existing store systems.\nThe Cust2Mate touch screen allows for the display of advertisements, promotions and other digital services which can bring added value to shoppers and additional revenue sources to\nretailers.\nWe have launched a modular version of the Cust2Mate smart cart, allowing local set-up with modular parts, making mass production and deployment of our smart carts faster and more\nefficient. With a detachable control unit, our new generation cart will employ the same technologies as our previous offerings, presently deployed in the Yochananof retail chain in Israel\nand in pilot programs throughout the world.\nOur largest smart carts are available in 212 liter and 275 liter sizes, as customized at the discretion of retailers.\nWe also offer smaller, lighter smart carts, available in 180 liter and 75 liter sizes, with the same touch screen, detachable control panel and security features of our larger carts. Our smaller\ncarts are ideal for urban groceries and supermarkets, drugstores and duty-free shops, where aisles space tends to be limited.\nWe leverage third-party partners for the manufacture of our Cust2Mate Products in the locations we serve.\n2\nOur Customers\nM. Yochananof and Sons (1988) Ltd., or Yochananof, a large Israeli retailer, has been our largest Cust2Mate customer to date. Yochananof placed an initial order for an aggregate of 1,300\nCust2Mate smart carts which we are in the process of fulfilling. As of September 30, 2023, we have delivered all the smart carts in connection with Yochananofs initial purchase order.\nOn April 27, 2023, Yochananof delivered a non-binding letter of intent to purchase up to an additional 1,700 smart carts on terms and conditions to be agreed by definitive agreement. In\naddition, we have entered into a maintenance and support agreement with Yochananof. Our Maintenance Services division handles the maintenance and support services required for\nCust2Mate Products deployed in Israel.\nHaStok Concept Ltd., one of Israels leading home design and household essentials retail chain with approximately 40 stores across Israel, delivered a purchase order on April 20, 2023.\nThe agreement marked a significant expansion for our smart cart solution into a new vertical outside of grocery retail. The Hastok purchase order was for up to 1,000 smart carts and is\ncomprised of an upfront payment, a guaranteed monthly payment, and a revenue share agreement on added value solutions, such as advertising. On October 31, 2023, Hastok increased its\norder by an additional 1,000 smart carts, to a total of 2,000 smart carts.\nOn May 29, 2023, the Company signed an agreement with Morton Williams Supermarkets, a U.S. supermarket with locations throughout the New York City metropolitan area, for the\norder for up to 100 Cust2Mate smart carts. The Morton Williams order follows our successful pilot of Cust2Mate smart carts at the grocers West End Avenue store in Manhattan.\nOn June 13, 2023, the Company entered into a significant partnership with IR2S, which is intended to deploy 30,000 smart carts between 2023 and 2025 across renowned retail chains in\nFrance. With IR2S providing integration and other services, including Monoprix and the Casino Group (who operate over 700 and over 10,500 stores respectively), the logistics and\nservice support for the smart carts will be efficiently carried out. IR2S, a leading integrator of advanced retail technologies (including integration and other services) to many prestigious\nclients in France, will play a pivotal role in managing the installation, support, and maintenance of the smart carts. IR2S is well-positioned to manage and integrate Cust2Mates smart cart\nsolution, providing local hardware and software support to ensure a seamless customer experience. The definitive agreement with IR2S was signed in September 2023. The first purchase\norder to deliver 250 smart carts to Monoprix stores was received in October 2023, with anticipation for deployment at 20 select Monoprix locations. The first batch of smart carts is\nscheduled to be delivered to the Monoprix Monop Malakoff store near the Champs Elysées, Paris in the third quarter of 2024. In addition, on August 5, 2024 and as part of the IR2S\nagreement, the Company started deploying its smart carts at a Paris (17th quarter) Franprix store, allowing customers to shop and pay using the smart carts.\nOn September 14, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with HEX 1011, a leading integrator of technological solutions for retail chains, intended to deploy 20,000 smart\ncarts across Asia Pacific (APAC) from 2023 through 2025. The first delivery of Cust2Mates smart carts is scheduled for this year. HEX 1011 will ensure the efficient rollout and\nmaintenance of the carts for elite retail chains in Thailand and Malaysia.\nSince March 2023, as part of the Carrefours Connected Cart Project, the Cust2mate smart carts have undergone rigorous testing at Carrefours flagship Hypermarket store in Ste\nGenevieve Des Bois, near Paris, receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback and achieving excellent customer satisfaction reviews. We have currently entered the rollout stage of\nCarrefours Connected Cart Project.\nOur objective is to generate orders of several thousand Cust2Mate smart carts in Q4 2024 and 2025.\nOur Markets\nWe aspire to be the global leading provider of smart carts and associated technology solutions, providing a superior customer experience and cutting-edge platform for digital value-added\nservices, easing the pain points for all stakeholders in the retail industry.\nThe market for smart carts is large and diverse, and includes grocery stores, hardware stores, household essentials, do it yourself (DIY) retailers, discount stores, warehouse stores,\nconvenience stores, drug stores, duty free shops and similar outlets.\nWe have designed the range of our Cust2Mate smart carts to accommodate the needs of a varied customer base: large carts for hypermarkets or large stores, medium carts for supermarkets\nor medium sized stores, and small carts for city stores, drug stores, duty free shops, etc. We are also able to customize our carts with a look and feel unique to each retailer as requested.\n3"

(the “Company” or “A2ZST”) was incorporated on January 15, 2018\nunder the laws of British Columbia. The head office is located at 1600 – 609 Granville Street, Vancouver, British\nColumbia V7Y 1C3, and the records and registered office is located at 2200 HSBC Building 885 West Georgia\nStreet, British Columbia, V6C 3E8.\nThe Company was listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) starting January 22, 2022, and trades\nunder the symbol “AZ” and on the TSX Venture Exchange (“TSX Venture”) and trades under the symbol\n“AZ.V”.\nThe Company owns 76.78% of the common shares of Cust2Mate Ltd (“Cust2Mate”), a technology company\nfocused on providing retail automation solutions, in particular for large grocery stores and supermarkets. The\nCompany’s primary product is the Cust2Mate system which incorporates a “smart cart” which automatically\ncalculates the value of the customers purchases in their smart cart, without having to unload and reload their\npurchases at a customer checkout point.\nThe Cust2Mate system offers various features for shoppers and retailers such as product information and\nlocation, an on-cart scale to weigh items and automatically calculate costs, bar-code scanner and on-board\npayment system to bypass checkout lines. In addition, the product includes big data smart algorithms and\ncomputer vision capabilities, allowing for customer specific targeted advertising. (“The Cust2Mate Platform”).\nThe Cust2Mate Platform is being rolled out in Israel and is being marketed throughout the world, with pilot\nprograms in North and South America, Europe and in the Middle East.\nThe Company’s other activities include the provision of services in the field of services to the military and\nsecurity markets as well as the development of related products for the civilian markets. Such services include\nproviding maintenance services and container leasing. The Company also provides maintenance services for\ncomplex electronic systems and products.\nThe Company, through its 80% owned subsidiary, Advanced Automotive Innovations Inc., (“AAI”) continues the\ndevelopment of a product for the automotive market - the FTICS or Fuel Tank Inertia Capsule System which\nactivates automatically in the event of a vehicle collision. This eliminates the danger of fuel tank combustion\nthereby saving lives and reducing damage.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had four key subsidiaries, all of which are companies incorporated\nunder the laws of Israel: (1) Cust2mate Ltd. (“Cust2mate”); (2) A2Z Advanced Military Solutions Ltd (“A2Z\nMS”); (3) A2Z Advanced Solutions Ltd. (“A2Z AS”); and (4) Isramat Ltd., the “Subsidiaries”). On August 10,\n2023, Cust2mate announced the launch of Cust2mate USA Inc. (Cust2mate USA”), a subsidiary incorporated on\nJuly 12, 2023, under the laws of Delaware.\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company\nwill continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from\noperating activities since inception, such that as of September 30, 2023, the Company had accumulated losses of\n$79,841 and a net loss in the amount of $13,853 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of the date of\nthe issuance of these financial statements, the Company has not yet commenced generating sufficient revenues to\nfund its operations, and therefore depends on fundraising from new and existing investors to finance its activities.\nConsidering the above, the Company’s dependency on external funding for its operations raises a substantial\ndoubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial\nstatements for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 do not include any adjustments that might result from\nthe outcome of these uncertainties.\nAfter the balance sheet date, on October 7, 2023, an attack was launched against Israel by Hamas (a terror\norganization) which thrust Israel into a state of war (hereinafter: “The state of war”) in Israel and in the Gaza\nstrip. Revenues in the Company’s Isramat division have decreased in October 2023, but the Company has not yet\ndetermined if this is due to the effects of the state of war. The Company is continuing with its operations both in\nIsrael and globally. The Company continues to assess the effects of the state of war on its financial statements\nand business.\nThese Condensed Interim Consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors\non November 14, 2023.\n8\nA2Z SMART TECHNOLOGIES CORP.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n(Expressed in thousands of US Dollars)\nNOTE 2 – BASIS OF PREPARATION\n1. Significant accounting policy\nStatement of Compliance\nThese unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated financial statements of the Company are as of September\n30, 2023, and presented in US dollars, which is not the functional currency. The functional currency is the\nNIS. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance\nwith the requirements of International Accounting Standard IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” as issued\nby the IASB. They do not include all the information required in annual financial statements in accordance\nwith IFRS and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company for the year\nended December 31, 2022.\nThe policies applied in these Condensed Interim Consolidated financial statements are based on IFRS\neffective as of September 30, 2023, and are consistent with those included in the Company’s annual financial\nstatements for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe financial results of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that\ncontrol commences until the date that control ceases. Intercompany balances and transactions and any\nunrealized income and expenses arising from such transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.\nBasis of measurement\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, under the historical\ncost basis, except for financial instruments which have been measured at fair value.\n2. Critical Estimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of the Company’s financial statements requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements\nand reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual outcomes could differ from these\nestimates. The Company’s financial statements include estimates which, by their nature, are uncertain. The\nimpacts of such estimates are pervasive throughout the Company’s financial statements and may require\naccounting adjustments based on future occurrences. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the\nperiod in which the estimate is revised and also in future periods when the revision affects both current and\nfuture periods.\n9\nA2Z SMART TECHNOLOGIES CORP.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n(Expressed in thousands of US Dollars)\nThe functional currency for each of the Company’s subsidiaries is the currency of the primary economic\nenvironment in which the respective entity operates; the Company has determined the functional currency of\neach entity to be the New Israeli Shekel. Such determination involves certain judgements to identify the\nprimary economic environment. The Company reconsiders the functional currency of its subsidiaries if there\nis a change in events and/or conditions which determine the primary economic environment. During the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023, there have been no such changes. The Company’s\npresentation currency is the U.S. dollar.\nThe critical judgments and significant estimates in applying accounting policies that have the most\nsignificant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements are the same as at December 31,\n2022:\na) The useful life of property and equipment\nProperty and equipment are amortized or depreciated over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on\nmanagement’s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically\nreviewed for continued appropriateness. Changes to estimates can result in significant variations in the\namounts charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in specific periods.\nb) Determining the fair value of share-based payment transactions\nThe fair value of share-based payment transactions is determined upon initial recognition by the\nBinomial model. The Binomial model is based on share price and exercise price and assumptions\nregarding expected volatility, term of share option, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate.\nc) Intangible assets and goodwill\nIntangible assets and goodwill are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if three is an\nindication of impairment. The carrying value of intangibles with definite lives is reviewed each\nreporting period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If there are indications of\nimpairment the impairment analysis is completed and if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its\nrecoverable amount, the asset is impaired and impairment loss is recognized.\nd) Derivative liability – Warrants\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate fair value at each reporting date.\nThe key assumptions used in the model are the expected future volatility in the price of the Company’s\ncommon shares, no par value per share (the “Common Shares”) and the expected life of the warrants.\ne) Going concern\nIn order to assess whether it is appropriate for the Company to continue as going concern, management\nis required to apply judgements and make estimates with regards to future cash flow projections. In\narriving at this judgement there were several assumptions and estimates involved in calculating the\nfuture cash flow projections. These includes making estimates regarding the timing and amounts of\nfuture expenditures and the ability and timing to raising additional financing.\n3. New Accounting Standards\nA number of amended standards became applicable for the current reporting period. The Company and\nits subsidiaries did not have to change its accounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a\nresult of adopting these amended standards:\n1.Disclosure of Accounting Policies – Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2\n2.Definition of Accounting Estimates – Amendments to IAS 8\n3.Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction –\nAmendments to IAS 12\n10\nA2Z SMART TECHNOLOGIES CORP.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n(Expressed in thousands of US Dollars)\nNOTE 3 – WARRANT LIABILITY\na) June 2023 Warrants\nOn June 15 and on June 20, 2023, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,909,134 June 2023 Registered Direct\nOfferings Warrants (as defined below) as part of registered direct offerings (see also note 5(g)).

Past performance may not be indicative of future\nperformance. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated annual financial\nstatements for the year ended December 31, 2022, and with the Company’s condensed consolidated interim financial\nstatements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, which have been prepared using accounting policies\nconsistent with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board\n(“IFRS”).\nAll amounts are presented in United States dollars (“USD” or “$”), the Company’s presentation currency, unless\notherwise stated.\nStatements are subject to the risks and uncertainties identified in the “Risks and Uncertainties”, and “Cautionary Note\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements” sections of this document. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on\nforward-looking statements.\nCOMPANY OVERVIEW\nThe Company was incorporated on January 15, 2018, under the laws of British Columbia. The head office is located at\n1600 – 609 Granville Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V7Y 1C3, and the records and registered office is located at\n2200 HSBC Building 885 West Georgia Street, British Columbia, V6C 3E8.\nOur common shares (the “Common Shares”) are listed for trading on the TSX Venture Exchange (the “TSXV”) under the\ntrading symbol “AZ”, and in the United States, on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the trading symbol “AZ”.\nWe are an innovative technology company operating the following four complementary business lines through our\nsubsidiaries: (i) development and commercialization of retail “smart cart” solutions designed primarily for use in large\ngrocery stores and supermarkets (“Cust2Mate Carts” or “Cust2Mate Products”); (ii) manufacture of precision metal parts;\n(iii) provision of maintenance services in Israel (“Maintenance Services”); and (iv) development of our Fuel Tank Inertia\nCapsule System (“FTICS”) technology and a vehicle device cover for the military and civilian automotive industry\n(collectively, “Automotive Products”).\nIn 2020, we began to rapidly develop smart carts for the retail industry, with the aim of becoming the leading mobile\ncheckout system in the international market by providing the optimal solution for shoppers and supermarket retailers. We\nhave since focused the majority of our strategic planning, investment, research, development and marketing efforts on our\nCust2Mate Products, as management currently believes our operational capabilities are most effectively leveraged by\ngrowing market share in the smart cart industry.\n1\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares of Isramat, a privately held\nIsraeli company. This acquisition vertically integrates certain manufacturing capabilities for the production of the\nCust2Mate Products, such as precision metal fabrication of parts, while complementing existing contract manufacturing\npartnerships to support the Company’s growth.\nThe raw materials required by the Company’s subsidiaries are readily available from multiple suppliers worldwide and\ntheir purchase costs do not fluctuate more than standard raw materials.\nSmart Cart Products and Services\nCust2Mate is a mobile self-checkout shopping cart solution that streamlines the retail shopping experience. With a user-\nfriendly smart algorithm, touch screen and computer vision technology, our Cust2Mate smart cart scans, recognizes and\nadds to a displayed shopping list, each item placed in the cart, providing the shopper with real-time information regarding\nitems in the cart and tabulating the total cost of purchase. Our in-cart solution also enables shoppers to use the cart as the\npoint of sale by use of mobile payment applications, e-wallets and other financial services. Cust2Mate’s point of sale\nfeature effectively increases overall efficiency of the shopping experience, by expanding payment options for shoppers\nand retailers alike, reducing the need for cashiers, and reducing checkout wait times, which ultimately leads to improved\ncustomer engagement and satisfaction.\nWe combine scanning, computer vision, security scales and other anti-fraud/theft technologies, with a large screen tablet\ncapable of relaying real-time shopping information and value-added digital services. Our solution is stackable and\nlightweight, with a robust recognition platform that provides a higher level of accuracy in product identification,\nleveraging in-store Wi-Fi and cutting edge software.\nFor retailers, Cust2Mate enables improved inventory management, increased efficiency, reduced labor costs, increased\nanti-fraud protection, reduced theft and real-time data analytics and insights regarding consumer behavior. Our solutions\nare designed to easily integrate with existing store systems.\nThe Cust2Mate touch screen allows for the display of advertisements, promotions and other digital services which can\nbring added value to shoppers and additional revenue sources to retailers.\nOur largest smart carts are available in 212 liter and 275 liter sizes, with or without a produce scale (for on-cart weighing\nof fruit, vegetables and other items priced based on weight), as customized at the discretion of retailers. Ideal for larger\nstores, our smart carts are presently deployed in the Yochananof retail chain in Israel and in pilot programs throughout the\nworld.\nWe also offer smaller, lighter smart carts, available in 180 liter and 75 liter sizes, with the same touch screen and security\nfeatures of our larger carts. Our smaller carts are ideal for urban groceries and supermarkets, drugstores and duty-free\nshops, where aisles space tends to be limited.\nWe are presently launching a modular version of the Cust2Mate smart cart, allowing local set-up with modular parts,\nmaking mass production and deployment of our smart carts faster and more efficient. With a detachable control unit, our\nmodular offering will employ the same technologies as our current offerings.\nWe leverage third-party partners for the manufacture of our Cust2Mate Products in the locations we serve.\n2\nOur Customers\nM. Yochananof and Sons (1988) Ltd., or Yochananof, a large Israeli retailer, has been our largest Cust2Mate customer to\ndate. Yochananof placed an initial order for an aggregate of 1,300 Cust2Mate smart carts which we are in the process of\nfulfilling. As of September 30, 2023, we have delivered all the smart carts in connection with Yochananof’s initial\npurchase order. On April 27, 2023, Yochananof delivered a non-binding letter of intent to purchase up to an additional\n1,700 smart carts on terms and conditions to be agreed by definitive agreement. In addition, we have entered into a\nmaintenance and support agreement with Yochananof. Our Maintenance Services division handles the maintenance and\nsupport services required for Cust2Mate Products deployed in Israel.\nHaStok Concept Ltd., one of Israel’s leading home design and household essentials retail chain with approximately 40\nstores across Israel, delivered a purchase order on April 20, 2023. The agreement marked a significant expansion for our\nsmart cart solution into a new vertical outside of grocery retail. The Hastok purchase order was for up to 1,000 smart carts\nand is comprised of an upfront payment, a guaranteed monthly payment, and a revenue share agreement on added value\nsolutions, such as advertising. On October 31, 2023, Hastok increased its order by an additional 1,000 smart carts, to a\ntotal of 2,000 smart carts.\nOn May 29, 2023, the Company signed an agreement with Morton Williams Supermarkets, a U.S. supermarket with\nlocations throughout the New York City metropolitan area, for the order for up to 100 Cust2Mate smart carts. The Morton\nWilliams order follows our successful pilot of Cust2Mate smart carts at the grocer’s West End Avenue store in Manhattan.\nOn June 13, 2023 the Company entered into a significant partnership with IR2S, which is intended to deploy 30,000 smart\ncarts between 2023 and 2025 across renowned retail chains in France. With IR2S providing integration and other services,\nincluding Monoprix and the Casino Group (who operate over 700 and over 10,500 stores respectively), the logistics and\nservice support for the smart carts will be efficiently carried out. IR2S, a leading integrator of advanced retail technologies\n(including integration and other services) to many prestigious clients in France, will play a pivotal role in managing the\ninstallation, support, and maintenance of the smart carts. IR2S is well-positioned to manage and integrate Cust2Mate’s\nsmart cart solution, providing local hardware and software support to ensure a seamless customer experience. The\ndefinitive agreement with IR2S was signed in September 2023. The first purchase order to deliver 250 smart carts to\nMonoprix stores was received in October, 2023, with anticipation for deployment at 20 select Monoprix locations. The\nfirst batch of smart carts is scheduled to be delivered to the Monoprix Monop Malakoff store near the Champs Elysées,\nParis in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nOn September 14, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with HEX 1011, a leading integrator of\ntechnological solutions for retail chains, intended to deploy 20,000 smart carts across Asia Pacific (APAC) from 2023\nthrough 2025. The first delivery of Cust2Mate’s smart carts is scheduled for this year. HEX 1011 will ensure the efficient\nrollout and maintenance of the carts for elite retail chains in Thailand and Malaysia.\nSince March 2023, as part of the Carrefour’s Connected Cart Project, the Cust2mate smart carts have undergone rigorous\ntesting at Carrefour’s flagship Hypermarket store in Ste Genevieve Des Bois, near Paris, receiving overwhelmingly\npositive feedback and achieving excellent customer satisfaction reviews. We have currently entered the rollout stage of\nCarrefour’s Connected Cart Project.\nOur objective is to generate orders of several thousand Cust2Mate smart carts in 2023.\nOur Markets\nWe aspire to be the global leading provider of smart carts and associated technology solutions, providing a superior\ncustomer experience and cutting-edge platform for digital value-added services, easing the pain points for all stakeholders\nin the retail industry.\nThe market for smart carts is large and diverse, and includes grocery stores, hardware stores, household essentials, “do it\nyourself (DIY)” retailers, discount stores, warehouse stores, convenience stores, drug stores, duty free shops and similar\noutlets.\nWe have designed the range of our Cust2Mate smart carts to accommodate the needs of a varied customer base: large carts\nfor hypermarkets or large stores, medium carts for supermarkets or medium sized stores, and small carts for city stores,\ndrug stores, duty free shops, etc. We are also able to customize our carts with a “look and feel” unique to each retailer as\nrequested.\n3\nBusiness Model\nWe envision deriving several distinct revenue streams from our Cust2Mate Products:\n● Outright Purchase Model. The outright purchase of the smart carts by customers and payment of a monthly\nmaintenance fee has been the business model to date. For example, the first 1,300 carts ordered by Yochananof\nwere sold to it outright with revenue recognized upon delivery. We intend to move away from this model,\nhowever it will remain available as some retailers prefer this option.\n● Subscription Based Model. We intend to retain title to our smart carts and make them available to customers on a\nmultiyear subscription basis, against payment of a one-time up-front payment and monthly fees to cover\nhardware and software maintenance, service and version updates. The length of the subscription period depends\non many variables unique to each customer, including the design and customization required by the customer,\nand the size of the up-front payment. We intend to fund the manufacture of our smart carts at scale, against\norders, through loans against receivables from such orders, whilst looking to lower per unit manufacturing costs\nand increase margin as unit sales increase. The subscription model would also enable us to charge additional fees\nfor add-on features such as store navigation maps, shopping lists, etc. The subscription model should also\nfacilitate the provision of the smart carts to customers and, as revenue would be recognized monthly, would allow\nfor a sustained increase of revenue in conjunction with the increase in the installed base of the smart carts.\n● Digital Services. As our smart carts are fully integrated into the retailers’ systems, we envision them serving as a\nde-facto marketplace, which we refer to as a Smart Cart Marketplace, for all retail directed apps and digital\nservices. Our Cust2Mate smart carts incorporate a large touch screen, and can present to the shopper additional\ninformation at the discretion of the retailer, such as details of the shopper’s purchases, ingredients of goods\npurchased, allergy information, shopping lists, in-store navigation for goods, and many more applications, while\nsimultaneously facilitating the provision of real-time personalized and directed promotions, advertisements,\ne-coupons and other digital services by all stakeholders in the retail industry (such as the retailer, consumer\nproduct and other manufacturers and advertisers and any third party service provider that joins the Smart Cart\nMarketplace). As these promotions, advertisements, coupons, etc., are displayed to the shopper when the shopper\nis deciding what to buy (and not, for example, when the shopper is paying for products already purchased), we\nbelieve that digital services will be of considerable value to shoppers, retailers, manufacturers and other third\nparties. We intend to enter into revenue sharing agreements with stakeholders, allowing us, our customers and\nrelevant third parties to all enjoy increased revenue streams, whilst simultaneously providing shoppers with\nsignificant added value. We believe that digital revenues from the Smart Cart Marketplace can become\nconsiderable. As the revenue to retailers from digital services increases, the net cost of our smart carts to retailers\nis expected to decrease.\n● Big Data Analytics. At present, in many instances the retailer has limited information regarding the actions and\ndecisions of the shopper until the actual time of payment. The retailer may often not know when a shopper has\nentered the store, how much time a shopper has spent in the store, the route the shopper takes, or where a shopper\nspends most or as little time in the store, how decisions are actually made by the shopper, and similar customer\nbehavioral information. We are developing software for our smart carts to generate a wealth of data on such\nshopping behavior which can be mined, analyzed and monetized through data as a service or product offerings\ntailored to each of the stakeholders in the retail industry.\nCompetition and Competitive Strengths\nThere are a number of companies currently offering smart carts to the retail industry in one form or another. Our\nCust2Mate Products, and a small minority of other industry players, offer mobile self-checkout smart carts in which goods\nare scanned when placed in the smart cart. Most other industry participants offer solutions based on “Scan and Go” or\nimage recognition technologies. We believe we are only smart cart providing a full end-to-end turnkey solution for all\ncustomers. Below is a brief summary of the various technologies:\n● “Scan and Go” comprises a scanner and small screen, either on cart or connected to an app on the mobile\nphone. These solutions generally come without large screens and thus cannot efficiently provide information\nand digital services, without on cart anti-fraud protection and without on cart payment capabilities. Though\ninexpensive, the scan and go carts do not provide the full user experience and retailer added value offered by\nour Cust2Mate Products.\n4\n● Image Recognition. Many companies are trying to offer smart carts which do not require the scanning of\nproducts but instead claim to utilize software which recognizes the products as they are being placed in the\nsmart cart (“one to many”). We believe that there remain technological hurdles to adopting image\nrecognition software both on a practical and conceptual level. On a practical level, every store contains at\nleast several tens of thousands of SKUs which have to be accurately recognized every time in all\nconfigurations, from all angles and in different lighting backgrounds, within a very short time without\ncharging the shopper for products not purchased, while charging the shopper for all products purchased. This\nis a significant technological challenge. On a conceptual level, we believe many types of products are not\neasily adapted to image recognition, such as clothing size, and meats and cheeses purchased over the counter.\nIn addition, in an attempt to mitigate the increasing frustration of shoppers at the lengthening queues in the stores, many\nretailers have installed self-checkout (SCO) stations with the aim that these would lead to a quicker checkout and reduced\nlabor cost. However, these SCO stations have not adequately solved such problems, as check-out queues have not\ndisappeared, and the SCO stations have been accompanied by equipment issues, high up-front costs, consumer confusion,\nsub-optimal use of space and increased risk of theft.\nWe believe that our Cust2Mate Products have, and can further develop, the following competitive strengths:\n● our smart carts utilize existing technologies proven to work—there is no technological risk to overcome;\nbarcode scanning is a tried and tested, easy to use technology which can easily be adapted for use in a smart\ncart;\n● our software, hardware and customer success teams have, among them, decades of experience in retail\ntechnology, supporting our efforts to design one stop shop smart cart solutions which answer the needs of the\nshopper, retailer and other stakeholders in the retail industry;\n● our smart carts have a proven track record with hundreds of smart carts deployed in multiple sites and\nmarkets, enabling us to provide the most comprehensive working solution, customer experience and digital\nplatform;\n● our smart carts have multiple anti-fraud/theft capabilities which significantly reduce shrinkage from the\ncarts without harming the shopping experience;\n● we have successfully completed an initial trial of a computer vision product recognition solution, capable\nof matching the product put into our smart cart with the product scanned (“one to one” as opposed to “one to\nmany”);\n● we intend to continue the development of “one to one” computer vision software and incorporate the\nsolution in future Cust2Mate smart cart offerings. The solution will supplement the smart car’s other anti-\ntheft and fraud protection components;\n● a barcode can provide additional information, over and above product identification; for example, by\nproviding details of the expiry or best before date which could allow dynamic pricing based on proximity of\nsuch date;\n● our smart carts can provide the retail industry with new revenue streams and insights; and\n● our contemplated installed base subscription model allows for consistent revenue growth in a very large\naddressable market.\nWe continue to improve our smart carts. We have developed a lighter and easier to maneuver model of the Cust2Mate\nsmart cart. In addition, as our carts are expensive, retailers do not allow carts to leave a store’s premises. To alleviate this,\nwe have developed a modular smart cart with a detachable control unit, allowing the cart, without its expensive\ncomponents, to leave the store premises.\nMarketing and Sales\nWe are currently marketing directly to targeted customers and indirectly through local partners. In Israel, we sell our\nCust2Mate Products directly to our retailer customers. Outside of Israel, our local partners are responsible for support,\ntraining, implementation and sales of our Cust2Mate Products, while we focus on product development and direct\nmarketing with strategic customers.\nWe currently have local distribution and service partners in the United States, Mexico, France and Romania. In the United\nStates, we have a non-exclusive relationship with our distributor, who provides products and services to several thousands\nof stores nationally. On July 12, 2023, Cust2mate established a wholly owned subsidiary Cust2mate USA Inc.\n(“Cust2Mate USA”) as a strategic move to serve the thriving U.S. retail market more effectively and appointed Joe Szala\nas General Manager. Joe Szala brings a wealth of experience in retail, grocery, and consumer packaged goods.\n5\nThroughout Mexico, our non-exclusive distributor provides information technology services and information technology\nconsulting to stores. In France, our distributor (exclusive for certain chains) is a leading supplier and integrator of retail\ntechnologies throughout the country. Lastly, in Romania, we have an exclusive distributor relationship with a leading\nrecognized information technology provider to the retail industry in Romania.\nOur go-to-market strategy is built on the retail, grocery, and DIY markets, with a focus on supermarkets and hypermarket\nfood chains within Tier 1 (thousands of stores) and Tier 2 (hundreds of stores). We will manage targeted customers for\nCust2Mate Products in selected regions directly, leveraging select local partners for sales and distribution to chains in Tier\n2 and Tier 3 (tens of stores). Our local partners will take full responsibility for support, training, implementation and sales,\nwhile we will focus on product development and direct contact with strategic customers.\nWe presently contemplate that Cust2Mate would (directly or through subsidiaries which it would establish for each\ncountry), be the provider of the smart carts to the retailers and that Cust2Mate would enter into a revenue share or other\ncommercial arrangement with its local distribution and service partners.\nPilot Projects\nThe Company is presently in deployment and scale up stage and no longer views pilots, to the extent any are run, as part\nof its sales strategy or as significant to its business overview.\nௗC.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company raised net proceeds of $8,556\nthousand, of which approximately $5,870 thousand has been used for this purpose and the balance will be used over the\nnext 12 months.\nThe Company has negative cash flow from operating activities and has historically incurred net losses. To the extent that\nthe Company has negative operating cash flows in future periods, it may need to deploy a portion of its existing working\ncapital to fund such negative cash flows. The Company may be required to raise additional funds through the issuance of\nadditional equity securities, through loan financing, or other means, such as through partnerships with other companies\nand research and development reimbursements. There is no assurance that additional capital or other types of financing\nwill be available if needed or that these financings will be on terms at least as favorable to the Company as those\npreviously obtained.\nThe expected use of proceeds represents the Company’s current intentions based upon its present plans and business\ncondition, which could change in the future as its plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of the\nactual use of the net proceeds will depend on multiple factors and there may be circumstances where, for sound business\nreasons, a reallocation of funds may be necessary in order for the Company to achieve its stated business objectives. The\nCompany may also require additional funds in order to fulfill its expenditure requirements to meet existing and any new\nbusiness objectives, and the Company expects to either issue additional securities or incur debt to do so. As a result,\nmanagement will retain broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on\nmanagement’s judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds.\nThe actual amount that the Company spends in connection with each of the intended uses of proceeds will depend on a\nnumber of factors, including those listed under “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information”.\n8\nDISCUSSIONS OF OPERATIONS\nNine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022\nRevenues\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022\nServices 1,520 1,224\nSmart Carts 6,142 1,415\nPrecision Metal Parts 2,394 2,887\n10,056 5,526\nRevenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were $10,056 thousand as compared to $5,526 thousand for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase is due primarily to the increase in sales from the Company’s smart\ncart segment as the Company continues delivering its purchase order to Yochananof. Revenues from the Company’s smart\ncart segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were $6,142 thousand as compared to $1,415 thousand for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2022. Revenues from the Company’s traditional operations have increased as well\nin comparison with the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Revenues from the Company’s precision metal parts\nsegment have decreased in comparison with the nine months ended September 30, 2022.\nWhile revenues from the smart cart division are currently derived from only one customer, revenues from the Company’s\nservices and precision metal parts segments are derived from hundreds of customers.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was $8,029 thousand as compared to $4,609 thousand for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase is due primarily to the increase in sales from the Company’s\nsmart cart segment. Cost of revenues in the Company’s smart cart segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2023,\nwere $5,350 thousand as compared to $1,047 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Cost of revenues\nfrom the Company’s precision metal parts segment remains largely consistent with the nine months ended September 30,\n2022.\nThe Company’s gross margin in the services segment fluctuates depending on the level of revenue, since a large\ncomponent relates to fixed payroll costs, and the nature of the project, as some project types have higher margins than\nothers.\n9\nResearch and development expenses\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022\nPayroll and related expenses 1,281 814\nSubcontractor and outsourced work 2,073 2,151\nOther 90 414\n3,444 3,379\nResearch and development expenses related to the Company’s Cust2Mate product.

The increase is mainly due to the increase in marketing expenses\nrelating to the smart cart segment, particularly in North America and Europe.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022\nPayroll and related 3,177 2,243\nProfessional fees 1,637 1,572\nShare-based compensation 4,098 4,046\nDepreciation and amortization 345 244\nRent and related expenses 550 320\nInvestor relations 174 -\nTravel 109 164\nPublic company related expenses 781 311\nOther 675 518\n11,546 9,418\n10\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $11,546 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared\nto $9,418 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase is primarily due to the increase in payroll\nand related expenses which amounted to $3,177 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to\n$2,243 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in payroll is mainly due to the growth of\noperating activities of the Company’s smart cart segment. Another significant factor to the rise in general and\nadministrative expenses is the increase in public company related expenses, which amounted to $780 thousand for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, compared to $311 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The\nincrease in public company related expenses is due mainly to private placement expenses from the private placements that\noccurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nLoss on revaluation of warrant liability\nLoss on revaluation of warrant liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was $84 as compared to a loss of\n$nil for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.\nFinancial expenses\nFinancial expenses, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were $49 thousand as compared to financial\nexpenses of $132 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

The decrease is due primarily to the decrease in sales from the Company’s\nprecision metal parts segment. Revenues from the Company’s traditional operations have decreased as well in comparison\nwith the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nWhile revenues from the smart cart division are currently derived from only one customer, revenues from the Company’s\nservices and precision metal parts segments are derived from hundreds of customers.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023, was $2,220 thousand as compared to $2,220 thousand\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2022. Cost of revenues in the Company’s smart cart segment for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, were $1,335 thousand as compared to $886 for the three months ended September 30,\n2022. Cost of revenues from the Company’s precision metal parts segment remains largely consistent with the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2022.\n11\nThe Company’s gross margin in the services segment fluctuates depending on the level of revenue, since a large\ncomponent relates to fixed payroll costs, and the nature of the project, as some project types have higher margins than\nothers.\nResearch and development expenses\nThree months ended\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022\nPayroll and related expenses 550 311\nSubcontractor and outsourced work 640 745\nOther 11 152\n1,201 1,208\nResearch and development expenses related to the Company’s Cust2Mate product.

If any of these risks occurs, our financial\nperformance, share price, business prospects and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nREVIEW OF QUARTERLY RESULTS\n(In Thousands) 30/09/2023 30/06/2023 31/03/2023 31/12/2022\nTotal revenues $ 2,588 $ 2,860 $ 4,608 $ 3,825\nGross profit (loss) $ 368 $ 638 $ 1,021 $ 917\nTotal comprehensive loss $ (2,290) $ (6,394) $ (4,192) $ (5,600)\nBasic and diluted loss per share $ (0.06) $ (0.19) $ (0.11) $ (0.19)\n30/09/2022 30/06/2022 31/03/2022 31/12/2021\nTotal revenues $ 2,650 $ 1,430 $ 1,446 $ 487\nGross profit $ 430 $ 211 $ (276) $ (554)\nTotal comprehensive loss $ (6,009) $ (2,955) $ (2,919) $ (3,380)\nBasic and diluted loss per share $ (0.21) $ (0.11) $ (0.09) $ (0.14)\nThe loss per quarter and related net loss per share is a function of the level of activity that took place during the relevant\nquarter. Operating losses in the first three quarters of 2023 and throughout four quarters in 2022 remained consistent. The\nreason for the losses is due to increased research and development expenses and general and administrative costs, largely\ndue to the Company’s expansion ahead of expected increased revenues in future periods.\n13\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity is a measure of a company’s ability to meet potential cash requirements. The Company has historically met its\ncapital requirements through the issuance of Common Shares and securing bank loans.\nThe Company’s financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.\nThe Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception, such that as\nof September 30, 2023, the Company had accumulated losses of $79,841 and a net loss in the amount of $13,853 for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. As of the date of the issuance of these financial statements, the Company has not\nyet commenced generating sufficient revenues to fund its operations, and therefore depends on fundraising from new and\nexisting investors to finance its activities.\nConsidering the above, the Company’s dependency on external funding for its operations raises a substantial doubt about\nthe Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these\nuncertainties.\nWorking capital (In Thousands)\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2023 2022\nCash and cash equivalents 1,656 2,616\nRestricted cash 72 8\nInventories 340 375\nTrade receivables 1,466 1,373\nOther accounts receivable 1,504 2,570\nTotal current assets 5,038 6,942\nShort term loan and current portion of long-term loans 1,115 1,403\nLease liability 257 281\nTrade payables 2,641 2,224\nDeferred revenues - 1,373\nOther accounts payable 856 956\nTotal current liabilities 4,869 6,237\nWorking capital 169 705\n14\nCash flow (In Thousands)\nNine months ended September\n30,\n2023 2022\nNet cash used in operating activities (9,133) (8,069)\nNet cash used in investing activities (255) (1,410)\nNet cash provided from financing activities 8,587 2,238\nIncrease (decrease) in cash (801) (7,241)\nCash position\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company’s overall cash position decreased by $801 thousand as\ncompared to a decrease of $7,241 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This increase can be attributed\nto the following activities:\nOperating activities\nThe Company’s net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was $9,133\nthousand as compared to $8,069 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.\nInvesting activities\nCash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was $255 thousand as compared to\n$1,410 thousand used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Cash used in investing\nactivities for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, was due primarily to the acquisition of Isramat, a newly\npurchased subsidiary.\nFinancing activities\nCash provided from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was $8,587 thousand, and was\nmainly due to the issuance of shares and warrants in the amount of $9,058, offset by repayment of loans in the amount of\n$519 thousand. Cash provided from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, was $2,238\nthousand, and was mainly due to the exercise of warrants in the amount of $1,377 thousand and proceeds from receipt of\nloans in the amount of $1,094 thousand, offset by repayment of loans in the amount of $394 thousand.\n15\nCapital resources\nThe Company’s financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.\nThe Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception, such that as\nof September 30, 2023, the Company had accumulated losses of $79,841 and a net loss in the amount of $13,853 for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. As of the date of the issuance of these financial statements, the Company has not\nyet commenced generating sufficient revenues to fund its operations, and therefore depends on fundraising from new and\nexisting investors to finance its activities.\nConsidering the above, the Company’s dependency on external funding for its operations raises a substantial doubt about\nthe Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these\nuncertainties.\nOn March 20, 2023, the Company closed a private placement for gross proceeds of $2,604 through the issuance of\n1,783,561 units (“March 2023 Units”) at a price per March 2023 Unit of US$1.46 (CAD$1.95). Each March 2023 Unit\nconsists of one Common Share and one half of one Common Share purchase warrant (each whole such warrant a “March\n2023 Investor Warrant”). An aggregate of 891,778 March 2023 Investor Warrants were issued with an exercise price of\nCAD$2.35 (US$1.75) The Warrants have a term of two years and if fully exercised, will result in the issuance of an\nadditional 891,778 Common Shares (“March 2023 Private Placement Warrants”). A finder’s fee of $208 (CAD$290) was\npaid and 142,685 March 2023 Private Placement Warrants were issued in connection with the private placement.\nOn June 15 and on June 20, 2023, the Company closed registered direct offerings for gross proceeds of $6,873 through the\nissuance of 3,818,275 units (“June 2023 Units”) at a price per June 2023 Unit of US$1.80 (CAD$2.41). Each June 2023\nUnit consists of one Common Share and one half of one Common Share purchase warrant (each whole such warrant a\n“June 2023 Warrant”). An aggregate of 1,909,134 June 2023 Warrants were issued with an exercise price of CAD$2.93\n(US$2.20) The June 2023 Warrants have a term of two years and if fully exercised, will result in the issuance of an\nadditional 1,909,134 Common Shares (“June 2023 Registered Direct Offerings Warrants”). A finder’s fee of $550\n(CAD$733) was paid and 305,462 June 2023 Registered Direct Offerings Warrants were issued in connection with the\nRegistered Direct Offerings.\nShort-term borrowings\nShort term borrowing relates to bank loans which will be repaid in over the following 12 months. The Company requires\nshort-term borrowing from time to time to accommodate urgent requests from customers that require an initial outlay of\ncash by the Company.\nLong-term borrowings\nLong-term borrowing relates to bank loans which will be repaid after the following 12 months. Currently, the nature of\ncash requirements by the Company can fluctuate greatly from year to year as the Company is reliant on a relatively small\npool of customers that have shifting needs. As contracts can vary greatly from year to year the Company is sometimes\nrequired to take on long term debt.\nNo history of dividends\nSince incorporation, the Company has not paid any cash or other dividends on its Common Shares and does not expect to\npay such dividends in the foreseeable future.\nManagement of Capital\nThe Company’s main use for liquidity is to fund the development of its programs and working capital purposes. These\nactivities include staffing, and administrative costs. The primary source of liquidity has been from financing activities to\ndate. The ability to fund operations, to make planned capital expenditures and execute the growth/acquisition strategy\ndepends on the future operating performance and cash flows, which are subject to prevailing economic conditions,\nregulatory and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond the Company’s control.\n16\nThe Company intends to grow rapidly and expand its operations within the next 12 to 24 months. This growth, along with\nthe expectation of operating at a loss for at minimum the next 12 months, will diminish the Company’s working capital.\nAs such, substantial additional financing may be required if the Company is to be successful in continuing to develop its\nbusiness, meet ongoing obligations and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. No assurances can be\ngiven that the Company will be able to raise the additional capital that it may require for its anticipated future\ndevelopment. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to investors and debt financing, if available, may involve\nrestrictions on financing and operating activities. There is no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms\nacceptable to the Company, if at all. If the Company is unable to obtain additional financing as needed, it may be required\nto reduce the scope of its operations or anticipated expansion.\nThe Company defines its capital as share capital plus warrants. To effectively manage the Company’s capital\nrequirements, the Company has a planning and budgeting process in place to ensure that adequate funds are available to\nmeet its strategic goals. The Company monitors actual expenses to budget to manage its costs and commitments. The\nCompany manages liquidity risk by reviewing, on an ongoing basis, its sources of liquidity and capital requirements. In\nevaluating the Company’s capital requirements and its ability to fund the execution of its business strategy, the Company\nbelieves that it has adequate available liquidity to enable it to meet its working capital and other operating requirements,\nand other capital expenditures and settle its liabilities for at least the next 12 months. The Company’s objective is to\nmaintain sufficient cash to fund the Company’s operating requirements and expansion plans identified from time to time.\nWhile the Company expects to incur losses for at minimum the next 12 months, management of the Company continues to\nwork towards the success and eventual profitability of the business.\nThe Company’s capital management objective is to maximize investment returns to its equity-linked stakeholders within\nthe context of relevant opportunities and risks associated with the Company’s operations. Achieving this objective\nrequires management to consider the underlying nature of research and development and sales and marketing activities,\nthe availability of capital, the cost of various capital alternatives and other factors. Establishing and adjusting capital\nrequirements is a continuous management process.\nThe Company’s ability to access both public and private capital is dependent upon, among other things, general market\nconditions and the capital markets generally, market perceptions about the Company and its business operations, and the\ntrading prices of the Company’s securities from time to time. When additional capital is required, the Company intends to\nraise funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities. Other possible sources include the exercise of stock options\nof the Company. There can be no assurance that additional funds can be raised upon terms acceptable to the Company, or\nat all, as funding for early-stage companies remain challenging generally. Given the nature of the Company’s business as\nof the date of this MD&A, and in particular, the fact that its operations are undertaken exclusively within a foreign\njurisdiction, the Company may face difficulty in accessing traditional sources of financing, notwithstanding that its\nbusiness operations are conducted in a regulatory environment within which the Company’s activities are neither illegal\nnor subject to conflicting laws.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThere are no off-balance sheet arrangements to which the Company is committed.\n17\nTRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES\nParties are considered to be related if one party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise\nsignificant influence over the other party in making operating and financial decisions. This would include the Company’s\nsenior management, who are considered to be key management personnel by the Company.\nParties are also related if they are subject to common control or significant influence. Related parties may be individuals\nor corporate entities. A transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources or\nobligations between related parties.\nThe following transactions arose with related parties: (in Thousands of US$)\nNine months ended September 30, 2023\nAmounts\nowing by\n(to)\nthe\nCompany\nas of\nConsulting Share September\nDirectors Fees / based 30,\nFees Salaries awards Total 2023\nDirector, CEO and companies\ncontrolled by the CEO $ - $ 1,068 $ - $ 1,068 $ (33)\nCFO - 69 - 69 (9)\nDirectors 24 247 264 535 (28)\n$ 24 $ 1,384 $ 264 $ 1,672 $ (70)\nThree months ended September 30, 2023\nAmounts\nowing by\nthe\nCompany\n(to) as of\nConsulting Share September\nDirectors Fees / based 30,\nFees Salaries awards Total 2023\nDirector, CEO and companies\ncontrolled by the CEO $ - $ 404 $ - $ 404 $ (33)\nCFO - 27 - 27 (9)\nDirectors 8 80 139 227 (28)\n$ 8 $ 511 $ 139 $ 658 $ (70)\n18\nNine months ended September 30, 2022\nAmounts\nowing by\nthe\nCompany\n(to) as of\nConsulting Share September\nDirectors Fees / based 30,\nFees Salaries awards Total 2022\nDirector, CEO and companies\ncontrolled by the CEO $ - $ 784 $ - $ 784 $ (628)\nCFO - 84 22 106 (7)\nDirectors 18 - 69 87 (2)\n$ 18 $ 868 $ 91 $ 977 $ (637)\nThree months ended September 30, 2022\nAmounts\nowing by\nthe\nCompany\n(to) as of\nConsulting Share September\nDirectors Fees / based 30,\nFees Salaries awards Total 2022\nDirector, CEO and companies\ncontrolled by the CEO $ - $ 271 $ - $ 271 $ (628)\nCFO - 21 5 26 (7)\nDirectors 6 - 46 52 (2)\n$ 6 $ 292 $ 51 $ 349 $ (637)\n(1) The Company’s CEO has a consulting agreement with the Company pursuant to which he earns $70,000 per month.\n(2) The Company’s CFO has a consulting agreement with the Company pursuant to which he earns $9,000 per month.\n(3) The Company’s president has a consulting agreement with the Company pursuant to which he earns $30,000 per\nmonth.\n(4) Three non-executive directors earn directors’ fees of $1,000 per month\nFinancial Instruments and Financial Risk Exposure\nThe Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks, which results from its financing, operating and investing activities.\nThe objective of financial risk management is to contain, where appropriate, exposures in these financial risks to limit any\nnegative impact on the Company’s financial performance and position.\nThe Company’s financial instruments are its cash, trade and other receivables, payables, other payables and loans. The\nmain purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Company’s operation. The Company actively\nmeasures, monitors and manages its financial risk exposures by various functions pursuant to the segregation of duties and\nprincipals. The risks arising from the Company’s financial instruments are mainly credit risk and currency risk. The risk\nrate on loans is fixed. The risk management policies employed by the Company to manage these risks are discussed\nbelow.\n19\nLiquidity Risk:\nThe Company’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities as\nthey come due. As of September 30, 2023, the Company has a working capital balance of $169 thousand (December 31,\n2022 – working capital of $705 thousand). The table below presents the maturity profile of the Company’s financial\nliabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments:\nContractual\nCarrying\namounts Within 1 year over 1 year\nTrade payables $ 2,641 $ 2,641 $ -\nOther accounts payable 856 856 -\nLoans 1,388 1,115 273\nLease liability 536 257 279\nTotal $ 5,421 $ 4,869 $ 552\nCredit risk:\nCredit risk arises when a failure by counterparties to discharge their obligations could reduce the amount of future cash\ninflows from financial assets on hand at the balance sheet date. The Company closely monitors the activities of its\ncounterparties and controls the access to its intellectual property which enables it to ensure the prompt collection of\ncustomers’ balances. The Company’s main financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, as well as\nother receivables and represent the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk in connection with its financial assets.\nWherever possible and commercially practical the Company holds cash with major financial institutions in Israel.\nMarket risks:\nThat part of the Company’s business of providing maintenance services of various electronic systems is highly\ncompetitive and involves a certain degree of risk. The Company’s business operations will depend largely upon the\noutcome of continued sales and services to security establishments and the commercialization of its products and services\ncurrently in development.\nThe Company’s Cust2Mate smart cart platform is new and the Company is aware of competitors in the market. In addition\nto the regular management oversight and skills required, success in this segment will require the Company to penetrate the\nmarket as rapidly as possible.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company’s financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of\nexpenses during the reporting period. Actual outcomes could differ from these estimates. The Company’s financial\nstatements include estimates which, by their nature, are uncertain. The impacts of such estimates are pervasive throughout\nthe Company’s financial statements and may require accounting adjustments based on future occurrences. Revisions to\naccounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised and also in future periods when the\nrevision affects both current and future periods.\n20\nThe functional currency for each of the Company’s subsidiaries is the currency of the primary economic environment in\nwhich the respective entity operates; the Company has determined the functional currency of each entity to be the new\nIsraeli Shekel. Such determination involves certain judgements to identify the primary economic environment. The\nCompany reconsiders the functional currency of its subsidiaries if there is a change in events and/or conditions which\ndetermine the primary economic environment. The Company’s functional and presentation currency is the U.S. dollar.\nThe critical judgments and significant estimates in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the\namounts recognized in the financial statements are the same as at December 31, 2022:\na) The useful life of property and equipment\nProperty and equipment are amortized or depreciated over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on management’s\nestimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed for continued\nappropriateness. Changes to estimates can result in significant variations in the amounts charged to the consolidated\nstatement of comprehensive income in specific periods.\nb) Determining the fair value of share-based payment transactions\nThe fair value of share-based payment transactions is determined upon initial recognition by the Binomial model. The\nBinomial model is based on share price and exercise price and assumptions regarding expected volatility, term of share\noption, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate.\nc) Intangible assets and goodwill\nIntangible assets and goodwill are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if three is an indication of\nimpairment. The carrying value of intangibles with definite lives is reviewed each reporting period to determine whether\nthere is any indication of impairment. If there are indications of impairment the impairment analysis is completed and if\nthe carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and impairment loss is recognized.\nd) Derivative liability – Warrants\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate fair value at each reporting date. The key\nassumptions used in the model are the expected future volatility in the price of the Company’s Common Shares and the\nexpected life of the warrants.\ne) Going concern\nIn order to assess whether it is appropriate for the Company to continue as going concern, management is required to\napply judgements and make estimates with regards to future cash flow projections. In arriving at this judgement there were\nseveral assumptions and estimates involved in calculating the future cash flow projections. These includes making\nestimates regarding the timing and amounts of future expenditures and the ability and timing to raising additional\nfinancing.\n21\nNew Accounting Standards\nAmendments to IAS 12, Income Taxes\nOn May 6, 2021, the IASB released Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction\n(Amendments to IAS 12). The amendment relates to the recognition of deferred tax when an entity accounts for\ntransactions, such as leases or decommissioning obligations, by recognizing both an asset and a liability. The objective of\nthis amendment is to narrow the initial recognition exemption in paragraphs 15 and 24 of IAS 12, so that it would not\napply to transactions that give rise to both taxable and deductible temporary differences, to the extent the amounts\nrecognized for the temporary differences are the same. The adoption of the amendments as of January 1, 2023 did not\nhave an impact on the Company’s financial statements.\nInitial and early application of new accounting standards and interpretations in the reporting standards\nAmendments to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2, Making Materiality\nJudgement\nOn February 11, 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice\nStatement 2, Making Materiality Judgement, to provide guidance in determining which accounting policy to disclose. The\namendments require entities to disclose material accounting policies rather than significant policies. The amendments\nclarify that accounting policy information is material if users of an entity’s financial statements would need it to\nunderstand other material information in the financial statements. In assessing the materiality of accounting policy\ninformation, entities need to consider both size of the transaction, other events or conditions and the nature of them, even\nif the related amounts are immaterial. The adoption of the amendments as of January 1, 2023 did not have an impact on\nthe Company’s financial statements.\nMANAGEMENTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure\ncontrols and procedures for the Company. As such, we maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to\nensure that information required to be disclosed in filings is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the\ntime periods specified by the Canadian Securities Administrators rules and forms. In designing and evaluating the\ndisclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well\ndesigned and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and\nmanagement necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls\nand procedures.\nManagement’s report on internal controls over financial reporting\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal\ncontrols over financial reporting. Our internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with IFRS. Because of their inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent\nor detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance\nwith respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nAs identified in the Company’s MD&A as of December 31, 2022, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nevaluated the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, and identified the material weakness outlined\nbelow and therefore concluded our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective. Management identified\nthat we did not have sufficient accounting resources with relevant technical accounting skills to address issues related to\nthe financial statement close process because of the size of the Company and its staff complement. We were also not able\nto sufficiently design internal controls to provide the appropriate level of oversight regarding the financial recordkeeping\nand review of the Company’s financial reporting. This weakness is being addressed in 2023 with external consultants who\nare advising the Company in these matters.\n22\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting\nTo remediate the material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting described above, during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, the Company has initiated remedial measures and are taking additional measures to\nremediate this material weakness. First, the Company is continuing to roll out an enhanced financial and accounting\nsystem. Second, the Company has hired additional personnel. Third, the Company is strengthening the controls over\nfinancial reporting, with the assistance of outside consultants and experts in the controls and procedures over financing\nreporting. Consistent with the Company’s stage of development, the Company continues to rely on risk-mitigating\nprocedures during the financial closing process in order to provide comfort that the financial statements are presented\nfairly in accordance with IFRS.\nThere were no other changes in internal control over financial reporting during the most recent interim period that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nCURRENT SHARE DATA\nA2Z is authorized to issue an unlimited number of Common Shares. As of the date of this MD&A there were 36,964,991\nCommon Shares issued and outstanding. In addition, the following warrants and options were outstanding:\nOutstanding as of Exercise price\nthe date of this report Date of expiry USD\n2,658,313 Warrants November 10, 2025 $ 1.87\n1,366,631 Warrants December 24, 2025 $ 1.87\n221,100 Warrants April 18, 2026 $ 7.59\n1,084,562 Warrants May 28, 2026 $ 7.59\n1,634,366 Warrants November 8, 2024 $ 1.60\n1,034,463 Warrants March 13, 2025 $ 1.75\n2,214,596 Warrants June 15, 2025 $ 2.20\n543,333 Options August 20, 2025 $ 1.11\n33,333 Options January 28, 2025 $ 2.23\n50,000 Options June 3, 2026 $ 6.24\n16,677 Options October 28, 2026 $ 5.95\n900,000 Options August 2, 2032 $ 2.65\n300,000 Options August 21, 2032 $ 2.97\n4,125 Options January 4, 2033 $ 1.23\n550,000 Options January 4, 2033 $ 1.23\n250,000 Options January 4, 2033 $ 1.23\n100,000 Options November 25, 2027 $ 1.49\n423,750 Options April 18, 2033 $ 1.19\n245,000 Options June 28, 2028 $ 1.82\n13,630,249\nRISKS\nDilution\nThe Company has limited financial resources and has financed its operations primarily through the sale of securities such\nas Common Shares. The Company will need to continue its reliance on the sale of such securities for future financing,\nresulting in dilution to the Company’s existing shareholders.\nCapital and Liquidity Risk\nThe amount of financial resources available to invest for the enhancement of shareholder value is dependent upon the size\nof the treasury, profitable operations, and a willingness to utilize debt and issue equity. Due to the size of the Company,\nfinancial resources are limited and if the Company exceeds growth expectations or finds investment opportunities it may\nrequire debt or equity financing. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional financial\nresources that may be required to successfully finance transactions or compete in its markets on favorable commercial\nterms\n23\nAcquisition and Expansion Risk\nThe Company intends to expand its operations through organic growth, adaptation of its technology and products to the\ncivilian markets, development of new technologies and depending on certain conditions, by identifying a proposed\nacquisition.\nDependence on Key Personnel\nLoss of certain members of the executive team or key operational leaders of the company could have a disruptive effect on\nthe implementation of the Company’s business strategy and the efficient running of day-to-day operations until their\nreplacement is found. Recruiting personnel is time consuming and expensive and the competition for professionals is\nintense.\nThe Company may be unable to retain its key employees or attract, assimilate, retain or train other necessary qualified\nemployees, which may restrict its growth potential.\nGlobal economic uncertainty and financial market volatility\nThe Company’s ability to raise capital is subject to the risk of adverse changes in the market value of the\nCompany’s share price. Periods of macroeconomic weakness or recession and heightened market volatility caused by\nadverse geopolitical developments could increase these risks, potentially resulting in adverse impacts on the Company’s\nability to raise further capital on favorable terms.

Ltd (“Acquireco”) and A2Z Ad-\nvanced Solutions Ltd (“A2ZAS”), a company incorporated in Israel, entered into an arrangement agreement (“Ar-\nrangement Agreement”), pursuant to which ECC1, through a court-approved plan of arrangement: (i) initially acquired\n99.46% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of A2ZAS through Acquireco, with the remaining shares of\nA2ZAS (“Remaining Shares”) being acquired following the receipt of regulatory approvals under Section 350 of the\nIsrael Companies Law; (ii) completed a share consolidation of its common shares on a 1.4 to 1 basis; (iii) issued\n41,690,578 post-consolidation common shares of ECC1 to the shareholders of A2ZAS; and (iv) changed its name to\n“A2Z Technologies Canada Corp.”\nOn December 16, 2019, Acquireco announced the completion of a non-brokered private placement of 1,000,000 sub-\nscription receipts (each a “Subscription Receipt”) at a price of $0.50 per Subscription Receipt for aggregate gross\nproceeds of $500,000. Upon the satisfaction of the escrow release conditions, each Subscription Receipt automatically\nconverted into common shares for no additional consideration. The offering of Subscription Receipts was completed\nin connection with the Company’s Qualifying Transaction with A2ZAS. On December 18, 2019, the transactions\ncontemplated by the Arrangement Agreement (except for the acquisition of the Remaining Shares) were completed.\nOn the same day, the common shares commenced trading on the TSXV under the symbol “AZ”.\n2\nA2ZAS is the parent company of Advanced Military Solutions Ltd. (“A2ZMS”).

Revenues from the advanced engineer-\ning segment are generated from numerous customers, and account for 18%, 72% and 100% of the Company’s revenues\nfor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Revenues from the precision metal parts segment are gener-\nated from dozens of customers, and account for 18%, 0% and 0% of the Company’s revenues for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nBusiness of the Company\nThe Company is an innovative technology company specializing in the application of the Company’s existing military\nand civilisation technology for supermarket “smart carts” (the “Cust2Mate Carts”). The Company, through its sub-\nsidiaries, has four main business lines: (i) the development and commercialization of retail automation solutions, in\nparticular for large grocery stores and supermarkets, including the Cust2Mate Carts (the “Cust2Mate Products”); (ii)\nmanufacturing of precision metal parts (following the acquisition of a new subsidiary, Isramat, as outlined in further\ndetail below); (iii) the provision of maintenance services utilizing the application of advanced engineering capabilities\n(the “Maintenance Services”); and (iv) the development of the Company’s FTICS technology and a vehicle device\ncover for the military and civilian automotive industry (collectively, the “Automotive Products”).\n5\nHistorically, the Company’s revenues were principally generated from the maintenance services that are provided to\nthe Israeli military/security market. The Company’s products, which have historically been sold to the Israeli mili-\ntary/security markets, include unmanned remote-controlled vehicles of various sizes and capabilities designed for\nintricate bomb disposal, counter terrorism, and firefighting, as well as energy storage power packs, all of which are\nfully commercialized for military use.\nDuring 2020, the Company began to rapidly adapt its existing technology and know-how for the civilian markets,\nincluding the development of its Cust2Mate Products. This was in addition to the continuation of the Company’s\nexisting sales to the Israeli military/security markets. The expansion into the civilian markets led to significantly in-\ncreased expenditures which the Company was able to finance through a series of equity raises in 2021 and 2022. The\nCompany has not, and does not intend to, export any military or defense related technology and accordingly, no ap-\nprovals are required.\nIn 2022, and through 2023, the Company continues to focus its attention on its Cust2Mate Products division and aims\nto become the leading mobile self-checkout system in the international market, providing the optimum solution which\nsimultaneously meets the needs of both shoppers and supermarket retailers. The Company will continue to sell its\nMaintenance Services in Israel only and has suspended the further development of its military products. The Mainte-\nnance Services division of the Company is self-sustaining financially. It provides a steady base for the Company’s\noperations and the Company intends to maintain this operation and expand it to cover the maintenance and support\nservices required by the Cust2mate Products. To the extent that future research, development and marketing expend-\nitures are concerned, the Company currently intends on investing the majority of its resources in the smart cart industry\nand towards the development of the Cust2Mate Products. The Company believes its current technological and opera-\ntional capabilities are most effectively focused on growing the Company’s position in the smart cart industry.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares of Isramat, a privately\nheld Israeli company. This acquisition vertically integrates certain manufacturing capabilities for the production of\nthe Cust2Mate Products, such as precision metal fabrication of parts, while complementing existing contract manu-\nfacturing partnerships to support the Company’s growth.\nThe raw materials required by the Company’s subsidiaries are readily available from multiple suppliers worldwide\nand their purchase costs do not fluctuate more than standard raw materials.\nCust2Mate Products\nThe move to reduce consumer friction in all aspects of the shopping experience is a main driver for ongoing technology\ndevelopment and greater awareness of the need for an automated “smart cart” product, like the Company’s Cust2Mate\nProducts.\nProduct and Technology\nCust2Mate’s solution combines scanning and computer vision technology. The solution is stackable and lightweight,\nwith a robust recognition platform that provides a higher level of accuracy in product identification, leverages in-store\nWi-Fi and utilizes cutting edge computing. Our recent partnership with SensePass Ltd. (“SensePass”), allowing the\nCompany to utilize SensePass’ “SensePay” Platform, a payment network connecting mobile payment applications, e-\nwallets and other financial and complementary services to points of sale (“SensePay”), also expands the accepted\npayment capabilities, to further reduce consumer and integration friction.\nThe three-layer solution integrates mobile self-checkout (“MSCO”), app marketplace and big data capabilities, and is\ndesigned to increase revenue opportunities from payments, personal advertisements, e-coupons, analytics, and more.\nThe Cust2Mate Carts will be manufactured in various sizes to accommodate the needs of a varied customer base: large\ncarts for hypermarkets, medium carts for supermarkets, and small carts for city stores. We project manufacturing costs\nwill drop within 1-2 years.\n6\nAs part of the Company’s application marketplace strategy, the Company is seeking additional partnerships with ap-\nplications that contribute to the retailer business in order to create additional revenue streams. In each of these part-\nnerships, and additional partnerships the Company is seeking, the Company’s MSCO is integrated into its partners’\nsoftware and is jointly marketed to other types of retailers that could benefit from those combined applications with\nthe Company and its partners, sharing the revenue generated from the ultimate customer in agreed upon percentages.\nMarketing and Sales\nWe are currently marketing directly to targeted customers and indirectly through local partners. Our local partners\ntake full responsibility for support, training, implementation and sales of the Cust2Mate Cart, while Cust2Mate focuses\non product development and direct contact with strategic customers.\nAs of the date hereof, the Company’s official local partners include distributors in the United States, Mexico, Ger-\nmany, and Romania. In the United States, we have a non-exclusive relationship with our distributor, who provides\nproducts and services to several thousands of stores nationally. Throughout Mexico, our distributor, who we have a\nnon-exclusive relationship with, provides information technology services and information technology consulting to\nstores. In Germany, our distributor, who we have a non-exclusive relationship with, is a retail produce provider\nthroughout the country. Lastly, in Romania, we have an exclusive distributor relationship with a recognized infor-\nmation technology leader to the retail industry in Romania.\nOur go-to-market strategy is built on the retail, grocery, and do-it-yourself (“DIY”) markets, with a focus on super-\nmarkets and hypermarket food chains within Tier 1 (thousands of stores) and Tier 2 (hundreds of stores). Cust2Mate\nwill manage targeted customers in selected regions directly, using select local partners for sales and distribution to\nchains in Tier 2 and Tier 3 (tens of stores). The local partners will take full responsibility for support, training, imple-\nmentation and sales, while Cust2Mate will focus on product development and direct contact with strategic customers.\nBusiness Targets\nCust2Mate aims to generate orders of several thousand Cust2Mate Carts in 2023.2 The penetration strategy is to run\nseveral Pilot Projects (as defined herein), of which the Phase 4 – Pilot (as described below) of each Pilot Project will\nconsist of 10-15 Cust2Mate Carts used by shoppers in selected customer stores for a period of 30-90 days, fully\nintegrated with the store’s software. The pilots will be fully subsidized for strategic retailers and at least partially paid\nfor by other customers.\nCust2Mate is currently running seven Pilot Projects, with one store per Pilot Project. As of the date of this annual\nreport, Cust2Mate has completed one Pilot Project with Yochananof, which, following completion, became an order\nfor 1,000 Cust2mate Smart Carts which the Company is in the process of delivering, and on December 11, 2022 the\norder was increased by an additional 300 Smart Carts. In addition, the Company entered into a Maintenance and\nSupport Agreement with Yochananof, under which Cust2mate will supply customary maintenance and support for 36\nmonths after delivery, the first 12 months without extra charge and thereafter against annual payment of 8% of the\nvalue of each cart. The aggregate amounts due for the purchase of the carts and maintenance and support is approxi-\nmately US$13 million (including Value Added Tax). The Maintenance Services division of the Company will cover\nthe maintenance and support services required by the Cust2mate Products in Israel.\nPilot Project Phases\nAs part of our strategy for proof of concept implementation, Cust2Mate will follow a multi-phase pilot project evalu-\nation process (the “Pilot Projects”):\n1. Phase 1 - Discovery: Conduct a workshop with the customer to review, discuss, and analyze customer busi-\nness and requirements, which is key for the pilots success. Resources allocated by Cust2Mate for this phase\ninclude a project manager, product manager, and technology expert. The estimated time to complete the\ndiscovery stage is approximately 2 weeks.\n7\n2. Phase 2 - Integration: Together with customers, conduct remote integration into the retailer’s store systems.\nThe estimated time to complete the integration stage is approximately 10 weeks but depending on the cus-\ntomers’ environment and systems, can take several months.\n3. Phase 3 - Initial Evaluation: The customer, with the full support of Cust2Mate, will conduct an initial evalu-\nation test in the customer’s labs. The evaluation test will be planned and scheduled based on the customer’s\nprocesses. This is the final testing phase before the pilot. The estimated time to complete the initial evaluation\nstage is approximately 2 weeks.\n4. Phase 4 - Pilot: The customer, with the full support of Cust2Mate, will implement the solution in a single\npilot store, for a period of 30-90 days and will include 10-25 Cust2Mate Carts.\n5. Phase 5 - Roll Out: Following the successful completion of the pilot, rollout for the entire chain could replace\nbetween 30% and 80% of the current cart fleet.\nAll references herein to “Pilot Projects” relate to the above multi-phase pilot project evaluation process unless further\nspecified by references to particular phases of the Pilot Projects or unless the context specifies otherwise.\n2 See footnote 1.\nThe following table details the status of each of the Company’s current Pilot Projects:\nNumbers of Date Phase 4 –\nCust2Mate Date Phase 1 – Pilot is Ex- Length of\nSupermarket Name Carts in Pi- Discovery Be- pected to Phase 4 – Pi-\nand/or Country lot gan Begin(1) lot(2) Current Status\nUAE 12 Carts January 2021 Q4 2023 45 days Phase 1 - Discov-\nery(3)\nEvergreen 12 Carts January 2022 Complete 90 days Phase 4 – Pilot (4)\nMorton Williams 10 Carts July 2022 Complete 30 days Phase 4 – Pilot(4)\nChedraui 12 Carts March 2022 Q1 2023 60 days Phase 4 - Pilot\nSingapore 12 Carts April 2022 Q4 2023 60 days Phase 3 – Initial\nEvaluation\nMigros Ticaret 10 Carts August 2022 Q2 2023 60 days Phase 2 - Integration\nEuropean chain 14Carts August 2022 Q1 2023 120 days Phase 4 – Pilot\nNotes:\n(1) Based on correspondence with the customers and progress to date.\n(2) The length of the Phase 4 – Pilot portion of the Company’s multi-phase Pilot Project evaluation process refers to\nthe actual time period that the Cust2Mate Carts are fully operational at the client’s location and open to the use of the\nshoppers.

The increase is due primarily to the inclusion of revenues of Isramat ($3,958 thousand), a\nnewly acquired subsidiary, from February 3, 2022, which provides the Company with a new operating segment –\nprecision metal parts. Revenues from the Company’s smart cart segment for the year ended December 31, 2022, were\n$3,688 thousand as compared to $750 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021. The revenues in 2021 were\nfrom a one-time transaction; revenues from the supply of smart carts started in 2022, with the delivery of the first\nsmart carts to Yochananof, the Company’s first pilot project. Revenues from the Company’s traditional operations\nremain largely consistent with the year ended December 31, 2022.\nWhile revenues from the smart cart division is currently derived from only one customer, revenues from the Com-\npany’s advanced engineering and precision metal parts segments are derived from hundreds of customers.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, were $7,517 thousand as compared to $2,029 thousand for\nthe year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is due primarily to the inclusion of cost of revenues of Isramat\n($3,462 thousand). Cost of revenues in the smart cart segment for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $2,892\nthousand as compared to $nil for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe Company’s gross margin in the advanced engineering segment fluctuates depending on the level of revenue, since\na large component relates to fixed payroll costs, and the nature of the project, as some project types have higher\nmargins than others. The gross margin for smart carts is nil in the prior year as there were no revenues during that\nperiod.\nResearch and development expenses\nYear ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nPayroll and related expenses $ 867 $ 510\nSubcontractor and outsourced work 3,362 2,477\nLegal fees 20 99\nPilot expenses and other 212 136\n$ 4,462 $ 3,222\nResearch and development expenses related to the Company’s Cust2Mate product. Most of these expenses relate to\noutsourced software engineers that work on integrating future customers’ point of sales systems to the Company’s\nsoftware.\nResearch and development expenses were $4,462 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to\n$3,222 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily due to an increase in subcontractor\nand outsourced work costs for the development of the Company’s Cust2Mate smart cart.\n11\nSales and marketing\nSales and marketing expenses were $475 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $102 thou-\nsand for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily due to an increase in marketing costs for the\nmarketing of the Company’s Cust2Mate smart cart.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nYear ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nPayroll and related $ 3,990 $ 1,027\nProfessional fees 2,233 3,417\nShare-based compensation 4,868 842\nDepreciation and amortization 420 321\nOffice maintenance 437 275\nPublic company related expenses 316 254\nRent and related 126 96\nTravel 150 -\nDirectors and officers insurance 267 119\nDoubtful debts 382 -\nOther 410 143\n$ 13,599 $ 6,494\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $13,599 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to\n$6,494 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily due to the increase in share-based\ncompensation which amounted to $4,868 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $842 thousand\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021. Another significant factor to the rise in general and administrative expenses is\nthe increase in payroll which amounted to $3,990 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1,027\nthousand for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in payroll is mainly due to the growth of operating\nactivities of the Company’s smart cart segment and to the inclusion of payroll expenses of Isramat ($1,165 thousand).\nLoss on revaluation of warrant liability\nLoss on revaluation of warrant liability for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $254 as compared to a loss of\n$30,895 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The loss in 2021 relates to the increase in the value of the warrant\nliability as of December 31, 2021, which was subsequently charged to equity as certain warrant holders agreed to\nchange the exercise price of the warrants to the Company’s functional currency.\nFinancial expenses\nFinancial expenses, net for the year ended December 31, 2022, were $1,391 thousand as compared to $91 thousand\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in expenses is mainly a result of revaluation of the commitment\nto compensate former shareholders of Isramat. Financial expenses comprise interest on loans and leases, interest and\naccretion in respect of application of IFRS 16, revaluation of a provision, and credit card charges.\n12\nYear ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020\nRevenues\nYear ended December 31,\n2021 2020\nAdvanced Engineering $ 1,935 $ 1,068\nSmart Carts 750 -\n$ 2,685 $ 1,068\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $2,685 thousand as compared to $1,068 thousand for the year\nended December 31, 2020. The increase in revenues from the advanced engineering segment is due in part by the\nrecovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and initial revenues from the Cust2Mate smart cart segment\nwhich amounted to $750 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2021. While revenues from the smart cart division\nis currently derived from only one customer, revenues from the Company’s advanced engineering segment are derived\nfrom up to dozens of customers.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $2,029 thousand as compared to $853 thousand for the\nyear ended December 31, 2020. Cost of revenues in the advanced engineering segment for the year ended December\n31, 2021 were $1,794 thousand as compared to $853 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is\ndue to the increase in revenues. Cost of revenues in the smart cart segment for the year ended December 31, 2021 was\n$235 thousand as compared to nil for the year ended December 31, 2020, as there were no revenues in this segment\nin the prior year.\nThe Company’s gross margin in the advanced engineering segment fluctuates depending on the level of revenue, since\na large component relates to fixed payroll costs and the nature of the project, as some project types have higher margins\nthan others.\nResearch and development expenses\nYear ended December 31,\n2021 2020\nPayroll and related expenses $ 510 $ 410\nSubcontractor and outsourced work 2,477 -\nLegal fees 99 -\nOther 136 8\n$ 3,222 $ 418\nResearch and development expenses are for two projects. The primary project is the continued development of the\nCompany’s Cust2Mate product. Most of these expenses relate to outsourced software engineers that work on integrat-\ning future customers’ point of sales systems to the Company’s software. The second project relates to the Company’s\nAutomotive Products, the development of which is expected to be completed in 2023.\nResearch and development expenses were $3,222 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to\n$418 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to an increase in subcontractor\nand outsourced work costs for the development of the Company’s Cust2Mate smart cart.\nSales and marketing\nSales and marketing expenses were $102 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $108 thou-\nsand for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n13\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nYear ended December 31,\n2021 2020\nPayroll and related $ 1,027 $ 579\nProfessional fees 3,417 1,449\nShare-based compensation 842 -\nDepreciation and amortization 321 213\nOffice maintenance 275 23\nInvestor relations 254 101\nOther 358 -\n$ 6,494 $ 2,365\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $6,494 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to\n$2,365 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to the increase in professional\nfees which amounted to $3,417 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1,449 thousand for the\nyear ended December 31, 2020. The increase in professional fees is due to the listing of the common shares on Nasdaq.\nOther reasons for the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021, as com-\npared to the year ended December 31, 2020, is the increase in payroll and share-based expenses. The increase in\npayroll ($1,027 thousand in 2021 compared to $579 thousand in 2020) is mainly due to the growth of operating activ-\nities of the Company’s smart cart segment.\nLoss on revaluation of warrant liability\nLoss on revaluation of warrant liability for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $30,895 thousand as compared to\n$3,228 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The loss relates to an increase in the value of the warrant liability as of\nDecember 31, 2021.\nFinancial expenses\nFinancial expenses, net for the year ended December 31, 2021, were $91 thousand as compared to $32 thousand for\nthe year ended December 31, 2020. Financial expenses comprise interest on loans and leases, interest and accretion in\nrespect of application of IFRS 16, and credit card charges.\nAdditional annual financial information\nYear Ended December 31\n2022 2021 2020\nTotal assets $ 12,694 $ 14,131 $ 8,852\nTotal non-current financial liabilities 3,568 852 9,529\nDistributions or cash dividends declared per-share - - -\n14\nREVIEW OF QUARTERLY RESULTS\n(In Thousands) 31/12/2022 30/09/2022 30/06/2022 31/03/2022\nTotal revenues $ 3,825 $ 2,650 $ 1,430 $ 1,446\nGross profit (loss) $ 917 $ 430 $ 211 $ (276)\nTotal comprehensive loss $ (5,600) $ (6,009) $ (2,955) $ (2,919)\nBasic and diluted loss per share $ (0.19) $ (0.21) $ (0.11) $ (0.09)\n31/12/2021 30/09/2021 30/06/2021 31/03/2021\nTotal revenues $ 487 $ 278 $ 1,404 $ 516\nGross profit $ (554 $ 34 $ 901 $ 275\nTotal comprehensive loss $ (3,380) $ (1,747) $ (4,518) $ (29,724)\nBasic and diluted loss per share $ (0.14) $ (0.07) $ (0.18) $ (1.35)\nThe loss per quarter and related net loss per share is a function of the level of activity that took place during the\nrelevant quarter. Operating losses in the fourth quarter of 2022 and throughout four quarters in 2021 remained con-\nsistent. The reason for the losses is due to increased research and development expenses and general and administrative\ncosts, largely due to the Company’s expansion ahead of expected increased revenues in future periods.\nAnalysis of Fourth quarter results\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $3,825 thousand as compared to $2,650 thousand for third quarter of\n2022. The increase in revenues is mainly due to larger delivery of Smart Carts to Yochananof. Total sales in the Smart\nCart segment amount to $2,273 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2022, as compared to $1,218 thousand in the third\nquarter of 2022. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $917 thousand as compared to $430 thousand for the\nthird quarter of 2022. The increase is gross profit is mainly due to the increase in sales in the Smart Cart segment.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity is a measure of a company’s ability to meet potential cash requirements. The Company has historically met\nits capital requirements through the issuance of Common Shares and securing bank loans.\nThe Company had an accumulated deficit of $67,395 thousand as of December 31, 2022 ($50,838 thousand as of\nDecember 31, 2021), and the Company had negative cash flows from operations of $9,883 thousand for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 ($9,378 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021).\nWorking capital\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2022 2021\nCash and cash equivalents 2,616 8,470\nRestricted cash 8 60\nInventories 375 1,147\nTrade receivables 1,373 857\nOther accounts receivable 2,570 434\nTotal current assets 6,942 10,968\nShort term loan and current portion of long-term loans 1,403 158\nLease liability 281 126\nTrade payables 2,224 989\nDeferred revenues 1,373 -\nOther accounts payable 956 1,099\nTotal current liabilities 6,237 2,372\nWorking capital 705 8,596\n15\nCash flow\nYear ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nNet cash used in operating activities (9,431 ) (9,378)\nNet cash used in investing activities (1,559 ) (280)\nNet cash provided from financing activities 5,681 12,355\nIncrease (decrease) in cash (6,096 ) 2,697\nYear ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s overall position of cash decreased by $4,894 as compared\nto an increase of $2,697 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease can be attributed to the fol-\nlowing activities:\nOperating activities\nThe Company’s net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2022, was $9,431 thousand\nas compared to $9,378 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is due primarily to the increase\nin the research and development and general and administrative expenses for the period.\nInvesting activities\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $1,559 thousand as compared to $280\nthousand used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is due primarily to the\nacquisition of Isramat, a newly purchased subsidiary.\nFinancing activities\nCash provided from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $6,096 thousand, and was mainly\ndue to the issuance of share and warrants in the amount of $3,894 thousand, and the exercise of warrants in the amount\nof $1,379 thousand and proceeds from receipt of loans in the amount of $1,294 thousand, offset by repayment of loans\nin the amount of $342 thousand. Cash provided from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, was\n$12,355 thousand, and was mainly due an issuance of shares and warrants in a private placement which closed in June\n2021 in the amount of $8,358 thousand, and the exercise of warrants in the amount of $3,386 thousand.\nCapital Resources\nThe Company is an early-stage technology company focused on research and development of its products, and cur-\nrently does not generate significant cash flows from some areas of its operations. However, following the acquisition\nof the Isramat during the first quarter of 2022, the Company expects to generate profits and cash flows from this\nsegment (Isramat generated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2021 of $5 million and $4.9\nmillion, respectively, and profits of $500 thousand and $735 thousand, respectively).\nAs at December 31, 2022, the Company had an estimated positive working capital of $0.7 million including a cash\nbalance of $2,616 thousand. As of the date of this report, the company believes that it has sufficient resources to\noperate in the foreseeable future with the support of its officers.\n16\nOn March 13, 2023, the Company announced that it has closed, in escrow, the issuance of 1,783,561 units (“Units”)\nat a price per Unit of US$1.46 (CAD$1.95), for gross proceeds of US$2,604. Each Unit consists of one common share\nand one half of one common share purchase warrant (each whole such warrant a “Warrant”). An aggregate of 891,778\nWarrants will be issued upon final closing which when exercised in accordance with the terms of the warrant certifi-\ncates, and upon payment of an exercise price of CAD$2.35 (US$1.75), will result in the issuance of an additional\n891,778 common shares (March 2023 Private Placement Warrants”). A finder’s fee of $208 (CAD$290,000) is to be\npaid in respect of the closing, and 142,685 March 2023 Private Placement Warrants were issued in connection with\nthe March 2023 Private Placement with the same terms as the warrants issued to the investors.\nShort-term borrowings\nShort term borrowing relates to bank loans which will be repaid in over the following 12 months. The Company\nrequires short-term borrowing from time to time to accommodate urgent requests from customers that require an initial\noutlay of cash by the Company.\nLong-term borrowings\nLong-term borrowing relates to bank loans which will be repaid after the following 12 months. Currently, the nature\nof cash requirements by the Company can fluctuate greatly from year to year as the Company is reliant on a relatively\nsmall pool of customers that have shifting needs. As contracts can vary greatly from year to year the Company is\nsometimes required to take on long term debt.\nNo History of Dividends\nSince incorporation, the Company has not paid any cash or other dividends on its Common Shares and does not expect\nto pay such dividends in the foreseeable future.\nManagement of Capital\nThe Company’s main use for liquidity is to fund the development of its programs and working capital purposes. These\nactivities include staffing, preclinical studies, clinical trials and administrative costs. The primary source of liquidity\nhas been from financing activities to date. The ability to fund operations, to make planned capital expenditures and\nexecute the growth/acquisition strategy depends on the future operating performance and cash flows, which are subject\nto prevailing economic conditions, regulatory and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond the\nCompany’s control.\nThe Company intends to grow rapidly and expand its operations within the next 12 to 24 months. This growth, along\nwith the expectation of operating at a loss for at minimum the next 12 months, will diminish the Company’s working\ncapital. As such, substantial additional financing may be required if the Company is to be successful in continuing to\ndevelop its business, meet ongoing obligations and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. No assur-\nances can be given that the Company will be able to raise the additional capital that it may require for its anticipated\nfuture development. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to investors and debt financing, if available, may\ninvolve restrictions on financing and operating activities. There is no assurance that additional financing will be avail-\nable on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. If the Company is unable to obtain additional financing as needed,\nit may be required to and has the ability to reduce the scope of its operations or anticipated expansion.\nThe Company defines its capital as share capital plus warrants. To effectively manage the Company’s capital require-\nments, the Company has a planning and budgeting process in place to ensure that adequate funds are available to meet\nits strategic goals. The Company monitors actual expenses to budget to manage its costs and commitments. The Com-\npany manages liquidity risk by reviewing, on an ongoing basis, its sources of liquidity and capital requirements. In\nevaluating the Company’s capital requirements and its ability to fund the execution of its business strategy, the Com-\npany believes that it has adequate available liquidity to enable it to meet its working capital and other operating re-\nquirements, and other capital expenditures and settle its liabilities for at least the next 12 months. The Company’s\nobjective is to maintain sufficient cash to fund the Company’s operating requirements and expansion plans identified\nfrom time to time. While the Company expects to incur losses for at minimum the next 12 months, management of\nthe Company continues to work towards the success and eventual profitability of the business.\n17\nThe Company’s capital management objective is to maximize investment returns to its equity-linked stakeholders\nwithin the context of relevant opportunities and risks associated with the Company’s operations. Achieving this ob-\njective requires management to consider the underlying nature of research and development and sales and marketing\nactivities, the availability of capital, the cost of various capital alternatives and other factors. Establishing and adjusting\ncapital requirements is a continuous management process.\nThe Company’s ability to access both public and private capital is dependent upon, among other things, general market\nconditions and the capital markets generally, market perceptions about the Company and its business operations, and\nthe trading prices of the Company’s securities from time to time. When additional capital is required, the Company\nintends to raise funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities. Other possible sources include the exercise of\nstock options of the Company. There can be no assurance that additional funds can be raised upon terms acceptable\nto the Company, or at all, as funding for early-stage companies remain challenging generally. Given the nature of the\nCompany’s business as of the date of this MD&A, and in particular, the fact that its operations are undertaken exclu-\nsively within a foreign jurisdiction, the Company may face difficulty in accessing traditional sources of financing,\nnotwithstanding that its business operations are conducted in a regulatory environment within which the Company’s\nactivities are neither illegal nor subject to conflicting laws.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThere are no off-balance sheet arrangements to which the Company is committed.\nTRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES\nParties are considered to be related if one party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or\nexercise significant influence over the other party in making operating and financial decisions. This would include the\nCompany’s senior Management, who are considered to be key management personnel by the Company.\nParties are also related if they are subject to common control or significant influence. Related parties may be individ-\nuals or corporate entities. A transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of\nresources or obligations between related parties.\nThe following transactions arose with related parties:\nYear ended December 31, 2022\nAmounts\nowing by\n(to) as of\nConsult- Share Decem-\nDirectors ing Fees / based ber 31,\nFees Salaries awards Total 2022\nDirector and CEO $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 462\nCompany controlled by CEO - 1,224 - 1,224 (474)\nCFO - 84 160 244 -\nDirectors 28 - 64 92 -\n$ 28 $ 1,308 $ 224 $ 1,560 $ (12)\n18\nYear ended December 31, 2021\nAmounts\nowing by\n(to) as of\nConsult- Share Decem-\nDirectors ing Fees / based ber 31,\nFees Salaries awards Total 2021\nDirector and CEO $ - $ 43 $ - $ 43 $ 183\nCompany controlled by CEO - 958 - 958 (57)\nCFO - 94 59 153 -\nDirectors 31 - 11 42 -\n$ 31 $ 1,095 $ 70 $ 1,196 $ 126\nYear ended December 31, 2020\nAmounts\nowing by\n(to) as of\nConsult- Share Decem-\nDirectors ing Fees / based ber 31,\nFees Salaries awards Total 2021\nDirector and CEO $ - $ 31 $ - $ 31 $ -\nCompany controlled by CEO - 594 - 594 -\nCFO - 30 27 57 -\nDirectors 31 - 10 41 -\n$ 31 $ 655 $ 37 $ 723 $ -\nFinancial Instruments and Financial Risk Exposure\nThe Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks, which results from its financing, operating and investing\nactivities. The objective of financial risk management is to contain, where appropriate, exposures in these financial\nrisks to limit any negative impact on the Company’s financial performance and position.\nThe Company’s financial instruments are its cash, trade and other receivables, payables, other payables and loans. The\nmain purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Company’s operation. The Company actively\nmeasures, monitors and manages its financial risk exposures by various functions pursuant to the segregation of duties\nand principals. The risks arising from the Company’s financial instruments are mainly credit risk and currency risk.\nThe risk rate on loans is fixed. The risk management policies employed by the Company to manage these risks are\ndiscussed below.\nMarket risks:\nThat part of the Company’s’ business of providing maintenance services of various electronic systems is highly com-\npetitive and involves a certain degree of risk. The Company’s business operations will depend largely upon the out-\ncome of continued sales and services to security establishments and the commercialization of its products and services\ncurrently in development.\nThe Company’s Cust2Mate smart cart platform is new and the Company is aware of competitors in the market. In\naddition to the regular management oversight and skills required, success in this segment will require the Company to\npenetrate the market as rapidly as possible.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe areas requiring the use of estimates and critical judgments that may potentially have a significant impact on the\nCompany’s earnings and financial position are the useful life of property and equipment and income tax.\n19\nThe useful life of property, plant and equipment\nProperty and equipment are amortized or depreciated over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on management’s\nestimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed for continued appropri-\nateness. Changes to estimates can result in significant variations in the amounts charged to the consolidated statement\nof comprehensive income in specific periods.\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication of impairment. The\ncarrying value of intangibles with definite lives is reviewed each reporting period to determine whether there is any\nindication of impairment. If there are indications of impairment the impairment analysis is completed and if the car-\nrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and impairment loss is recognized.\nImpairment of non-financial assets\nImpairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually\nat the financial year end. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying value of an asset ex-\nceeds its recoverable amount (i.e., the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell), the asset is written down\naccordingly.\nWhere it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out\non the smallest group of assets to which it belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows; its cash\ngenerating units (‘CGUs’). Goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to each of the Company’s CGUs that are ex-\npected to benefit from a business combination that gives rise to the goodwill.\nImpairment charges are included in profit or loss, except to the extent they reverse gains previously recognized in\nother comprehensive income. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Company’s\ninterest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and Contingent liabilities of the subsidiary or jointly\ncontrolled entity recognized at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognized as an asset at cost and is sub-\nsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.\nDerivative liability - Warrants\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate fair value at each reporting date. The key\nassumptions used in the model are the expected future volatility in the price of the Company’s shares and the expected\nlife of the warrants.\nDetermining the fair value of share-based payment transactions:\nThe fair value of share-based payment transactions is determined upon initial recognition by the Binomial model. The\nBinomial model is based on share price and exercise price and assumptions regarding expected volatility, term of\nshare option, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate.\n20\nCURRENT SHARE DATA\nA2Z is authorized to issue an unlimited number of Common Shares. As of the date of this MD&A there were\n32,728,883 Common Shares issued and outstanding. In addition, the following warrants and options were outstanding:\nOutstanding as of Exercise price\nthe date of this report Date of expiry USD\n2,658,313 Warrants November 10, 2025 $ 2.03\n1,366,631 Warrants December 24, 2025 $ 2.03\n221,100 Warrants April 18, 2023 $ 8.29\n1,084,562 Warrants May 28, 2023 $ 8.29\n1,726,366 Warrants November 8, 2024 $ 1.60\n1,020,764 Warrants March 13, 2025 $ 1.75\n543,333 Options August 20, 2025 $ 1.11\n40,000 Options September 1, 2025 $ 1.66\n33,333 Options January 28, 2025 $ 2.21\n50,000 Options June 3, 2026 $ 6.20\n16,677 Options October 28, 2026 $ 5.90\n900,000 Options August 2, 2032 $ 2.63\n300,000 Options August 21, 2032 $ 2.95\n816,500 Options January 6, 2033 $ 1.22\n100,000 Options November 25, 2027 $ 1.50\n10,877,579\nResearch and Development, Patents and Licenses etc.\nOur success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our core technology and intellectual property\nrights. We generally rely on patent, trademark and copyright laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality agree-\nments to protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, we generally require employees and consultants to execute\nappropriate nondisclosure and proprietary rights agreements. These agreements acknowledge our exclusive ownership\nof intellectual property developed for us and require that all proprietary information remain confidential.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had seven of our patent applications were protected through pending applica-\ntions. We file patent applications in the United States and, when appropriate, certain other countries for inventions\nthat we consider significant.\nIn addition to patents, we also possess other intellectual property, including trademarks, know-how, trade\nsecrets, design rights and copyrights. We control access to and use of our software, technology and other proprietary\ninformation through internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors,\ncustomers and partners. Our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright, patent and trade secret laws.\nDespite our efforts to protect our software, technology and other proprietary information, unauthorized parties may\nstill copy or otherwise obtain and use our software, technology and other proprietary information. In addition, we have\nexpanded our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not\nbe available or may be limited in foreign countries.\nCompanies in the industry in which we operate frequently are sued or receive informal claims of patent\ninfringement or infringement of other intellectual property rights. We may receive such claims from companies, in-\ncluding from competitors and customers, some of which have substantially more resources and have been developing\nrelevant technology similar to ours. As and if we become more successful, we believe that competitors will be more\nlikely to try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe on our proprietary rights. It may also be\nmore likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our products infringe their proprietary rights. Suc-\ncessful claims of infringement by a third party, if any, could result in significant penalties or injunctions that could\nprevent us from selling some of our products in certain markets, result in settlements or judgments that require pay-\nment of significant royalties or damages or require us to expend time and money to develop non-infringing products.\n21\nWe cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party\npatents or other proprietary rights, but will not and have never done so intentionally.\nMANAGEMENTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDisclosure controls and procedures\nOur management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer are responsible for establishing\nand maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures (within the meaning of Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act).\nThese controls and procedures were designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we\nfile or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods spec-\nified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our manage-\nment, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure. We evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision of our chief\nexecutive officer and our chief financial officer as of December 31, 2022. Based upon that evaluation, our manage-\nment, including our CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022\nwere not effective.\nManagement’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting\nOur management, including our CEO, and our CFO, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate\ninternal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance re-\ngarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in ac-\ncordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and\nprocedures that:\n● pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transac-\ntions and asset dispositions;\n● provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of our\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;\n● provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with authori-\nzations of our management and board of directors (as appropriate); and\n● provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,\nuse or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nDue to its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstate-\nments. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls\nmay become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or pro-\ncedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO, and our CFO, we\nassessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the frame-\nwork for Internal Control-Integrated Framework set forth by The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO) (2013).\n22\nOur Management found our material weakness to be a result of a lack of sufficient accounting resources with\nrelevant technical accounting skills to address issues related to the financial statement close process, and because of\nthe size of the Company and its staff complement, we were not able to sufficiently design internal controls to provide\nthe appropriate level of oversight regarding the financial recordkeeping and review of the Company’s financial re-\nporting and accumulate and communicate such information to our management to allow timely decisions regarding\ndisclosure.\nTo remediate the material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting described above, we have initiated\nremedial measures and are taking additional measures to remediate this material weakness. First, we are continuing to\nroll out an enhanced financial and accounting system. Second, we have hired additional personnel. Third, we are\nstrengthening our controls financial reporting, with the assistance of outside consultants, experts in the controls and\nprocedures over financing reporting. Consistent with our stage of development, we continue to rely on risk-mitigating\nprocedures during our financial closing process in order to provide comfort that the financial statements are presented\nfairly in accordance with IFRS.\nDue to the material weakness described above, our management concluded that our internal control over\nfinancial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2022.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting\nThere were no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting, other than the remediation efforts\ndescribed above, for the quarter ended and the year ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nRISKS\nRisks Related to the Company’s Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nThe Company has incurred significant losses and there can be no assurance when, or if, the Company will achieve or\nmaintain profitability.\nThe Company realized a net loss of approximately $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, $39.8 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 and $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company has an\naccumulated deficit of $67 million as of December 31, 2022. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associ-\nated with the provision of the Company’s maintenance services and sale and development of the Company’s products,\nthe Company is unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when the Company will become profitable, if at\nall. Expected future operating losses will have an adverse effect on the Company’s cash resources, shareholders’\nequity and working capital. The Company’s failure to become and remain profitable could depress the value of the\ncommon shares and impair the Company’s ability to raise capital, expand its business, maintain its development ef-\nforts, or continue its operations. A decline in the Company’s value could also cause a holder of common shares to lose\nall or part of such holder’s investment in the Company.\nOur operations may not be profitable.\nThe Company may not be able to generate significant revenues in the future. In addition, we expect to incur substantial\noperating expenses in order to fund the expansion of our business. As a result, we may experience substantial negative\ncash flow for at least the foreseeable future and cannot predict when, or even if, the Company might become profitable.\nThe Company expects that it will need to raise additional capital to meet the Company’s business requirements in the\nfuture, which is likely to be challenging, could be highly dilutive and may cause the market price of the common shares\nto decline.\n23\nBased on the Company’s projected cash flows and the cash balances as of the date of this Annual Report, the Company\nbelieves that it has sufficient cash to fund the Company’s obligations for at least the next twelve months. However, in\norder to meet the Company’s business objectives in the future, the Company expects that the Company will need to\nraise additional capital, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nAdditional capital would be used to accomplish the following:\n● finance the Company’s current operating expenses;\n● pursue growth opportunities;\n● hire and retain qualified management and key employees;\n● respond to competitive pressures;\n● comply with regulatory requirements;\n● maintain compliance with applicable laws; and\n● acquire complementary businesses and technologies.\nConditions in the capital markets are such that traditional sources of capital may not be available to the Company\nwhen needed or may be available only on unfavorable terms. The Company’s ability to raise additional capital, if\nneeded, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions, the impact of any potential future\nhealth crisis, such as the COVID 19 pandemic, and a number of other factors, many of which are outside the Com-\npany’s control, and on its financial performance. Accordingly, the Company cannot assure that the Company will be\nable to successfully raise additional capital at all or on terms that are acceptable to the Company. If the Company\ncannot raise additional capital when needed, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results\nof operations and financial condition.\nTo the extent that the Company raises additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the\nissuance of such securities could result in substantial dilution for the Company’s current shareholders. The terms of\nany securities issued by the Company in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may\ninclude preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have\na further dilutive effect on the holders of any of the Company’s securities then-outstanding. The Company may issue\nadditional common shares or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for the common shares in\nconnection with hiring or retaining personnel, option or warrant exercises, future acquisitions or future placements of\nthe Company’s securities for capital-raising or other business purposes. The issuance of additional securities, whether\nequity or debt, by the Company, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of the common shares\nto decline and existing shareholders may not agree with the Company’s financing plans or the terms of such financings.\nIn addition, the Company may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment bank-\ning fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs.\nThe Company may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities the Company\nissues, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact the Company’s financial condition. Fur-\nthermore, any additional debt or equity financing that the Company may need may not be available on terms favorable\nto the Company, or at all. If the Company is unable to obtain such additional financing on a timely basis, the Company\nmay have to curtail its development activities and growth plans and/or be forced to sell assets, perhaps on unfavorable\nterms, or the Company may have to cease its operations, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe expect that we will need to invest significant time and raise substantial additional capital before we can expect to\nbecome profitable from sales of our products. This additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms, or at\nall. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product devel-\nopment efforts or other operations.\nWe expect that we will need to invest significant time and require substantial additional capital to commercialize our\nproducts. In addition, our operating plans may change as a result of many factors that may currently be unknown to\nus, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. Our future capital requirements will depend on\nmany factors, including but not limited to production and manufacturing costs (which are dependent on the costs of\nmechanical and electronic components of our products), research and development activities, sales activities including\ncompensation for salespersons, development of additional software and hardware products for our current offerings,\nand marketing costs related to expansion into new markets.\n24\nWe may not accurately forecast revenues, profitability and appropriately plan our expenses.\nWe base our current and future expense levels on our operating forecasts and estimates of future income and operating\nresults. Income and operating results are difficult to forecast because they generally depend on the volume of sales\nand timing, which are uncertain. Additionally, our business is affected by general economic and business conditions\naround the world. A softening in income, whether caused by changes in customer preferences in the markets we serve,\nor a weakening in global economies, may result in decreased net revenue levels, and we may be unable to adjust our\nexpenses in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in income. This inability could cause our\n(loss)/income after tax in a given quarter to be (higher)/lower than expected. We also make certain assumptions when\nforecasting the amount of expense we expect related to our share-based payments, which includes the expected vola-\ntility of our share price, and the expected life of share options granted. These assumptions are partly based on historical\nresults. If actual results differ from our estimates, our operating results in a given period may be lower than expected.\nExchange rate fluctuations between multiple foreign currencies may negatively affect our earnings, operating cash\nflow.\nOur reporting currency is the US Dollar and our functional currency is the New Israeli Shekel (“NIS”). Our key\nexpenses and revenues are currently primarily payable in NIS and U.S. In addition, we receive and have received\nfunding in CAD, U.S. dollars, and NIS. As a result, we are exposed to the currency fluctuation risks relating to the\nrecording of our expenses and revenues in U.S. dollars, and potential cash flow shortage. We may, in the future, decide\nto enter into currency hedging transactions. These measures, however, may not adequately protect us from material\nadverse effects.\nRisks Related to the Company and the Company’s Business\nThe Company’s business is subject to risks arising from a widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communi-\ncable disease, or any other public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted and could\ncontinue to impact the business.\nIn late 2019, a novel strain of COVID-19, also known as coronavirus, was reported in Wuhan, China. While initially\nthe outbreak was largely concentrated in China, it has now spread to Israel and the United States, and infections have\nbeen reported globally. Many countries around the world, including in Israel, have significant governmental measures\nimplemented to control the spread of the virus, including temporary closure of businesses, severe restrictions on travel\nand the movement of people, and other material limitations on the conduct of business. The nature of the Company’s\nwork in Israel is such that the Company is considered an essential service industry, and therefore, is generally able to\ncontinue all of its operations in Israel with little disruption. Initially, the Company implemented remote working and\nwork-place protocols for its employees in accordance with Israeli government requirements. The Company has now\nreturned to its regular work-place structure. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in delays in receiving\nservice orders from customers which has resulted in a decrease in revenues in recent periods.\nFailure to effectively develop and expand the Company’s sales and marketing capabilities could harm the ability to\ngrow the business and achieve broader market acceptance of the Company’s products.\nThe Company’s ability to achieve customer adoption of its retail automation solutions and civilian technology will\ndepend, in part, on the ability to effectively establish, focus and train a sales and marketing force. The Company’s\nCust2Mate retail automation solution only recently entered the commercialization phase. The Company’s ability to\nachieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend, in part, on the Company’s ability to recruit, train and\nretain a sufficient number of experienced sales professionals. In addition, even if the Company is successful in hiring\nqualified sales personnel, new hires require significant training and experience before they achieve full productivity,\nparticularly for sales efforts targeted at new markets. Because the Company only recently started sales efforts for the\nretail automation solutions, the Company cannot predict whether, or to what extent, the sales efforts will be successful.\n25\nThe Company expects the sales cycle to be long and unpredictable and require considerable time and expense before\nexecuting a customer agreement, which may make it difficult to project when, if at all, the Company will obtain new\ncustomers and when the Company will generate revenue from those customers.\nIn both the retail automation and civilian technology market, the decision to adopt the Company’s products may\nrequire the approval of multiple technical and business decision makers, including security, compliance, procurement,\noperations and information technology. In addition, the Company expects that while a customer may be willing to\ndeploy the Company’s products on a limited basis, before they will commit to deploying the products at scale, they\nwill require extensive education about the Company’s products and significant customer support time, engage in pro-\ntracted pricing negotiations and seek to secure readily available development resources. As a result, it is difficult to\npredict when the Company will obtain new customers and begin generating revenue from these customers. As part of\nthe sales cycle, the Company may incur significant expenses before executing a definitive agreement with a prospec-\ntive customer and before the Company is able to generate any revenue from such agreement. The Company has no\nassurance that the substantial time and money spent on the sales efforts will generate significant revenue. If conditions\nin the marketplace generally or with a specific prospective customer change negatively, it is possible that no definitive\nagreement will be executed, and the Company will be unable to recover any of these expenses. If the Company is not\nsuccessful in targeting, supporting and streamlining the sales processes and if revenue expected to be generated from\na prospective customer is not realized in the time period expected or not realized at all, the Company’s ability to grow\nits business, and its operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected. If the sales cycles lengthen,\nthe Company’s future revenue could be lower than expected, which would have an adverse impact on the operating\nresults and could cause the Company’s share price to decline.\nIf the Company is not able to enhance the brand and increase market awareness of the Company and products, then\nthe business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe Company believes that enhancing the “A2Z” and “Cust2Mate” brand identity and increasing market awareness\nof the Company and products is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of the Company’s products. The Com-\npany’s ability to penetrate its target markets may be adversely affected by a lack of awareness or acceptance of the\nbrand. To the extent that the Company is unable to foster name recognition and affinity for the brand, the growth may\nbe significantly delayed or impaired. The successful promotion of the Company’s brand will depend largely on the\nmarketing efforts, market adoption of the products, and the ability to successfully differentiate the Company’s prod-\nucts from competing products and services. The Company’s brand promotion may not be successful or result in reve-\nnue generation. Any incident that erodes consumer affinity for the brand could significantly reduce the brand value\nand damage the Company’s business. If consumers perceive or experience a reduction in quality, or in any way believe\nthe Company may fail to deliver a consistently positive experience, the brand value could suffer, and the business may\nbe adversely affected.\nIf the Company does not develop enhancements to the technology and introduce new products that achieve market\nacceptance, the business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe Company’s ability to attract new customers depends in part on the ability to enhance and improve the existing\ntechnology, increase adoption and usage of the solutions and introduce new products. The success of any enhance-\nments or new products depends on several factors, including timely completion, adequate quality testing, actual per-\nformance quality, and overall market acceptance. Enhancements and new products that the Company develops may\nnot be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, may contain errors or defects, may have interoperability diffi-\nculties with other products or may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue.\nFurthermore, the ability to increase the usage of the Company’s solutions and technology depends, in part, on the\ndevelopment of new use cases and may be outside of the Company’s control. If the Company is unable to successfully\nenhance the existing solutions and technology to meet evolving customer requirements, increase adoption and usage,\ndevelop new products, then the business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\n26\nThe technology markets in which the Company competes are both subject to rapid technological change and, to com-\npete, the Company must continually enhance its products and services.\nThe Company must continue to enhance and improve the performance, functionality and reliability of its technology.\nThe technology markets in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological change, changes in\nuser requirements and preferences, frequent new product and services introductions embodying new technologies and\nthe emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render its products obsolete. The Company’s success\nwill depend, in part, on the ability to both internally develop and enhance existing technology, develop new products\nthat address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of the Company’s customers, and respond to technological\nadvances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis. The development of the\nCompany’s technology involves significant technical and business risks. The Company may fail to use new technol-\nogies effectively or to adapt its proprietary technology and systems to customer requirements or emerging industry\nstandards. If the Company is unable to adapt to changing market conditions, customer requirements or emerging in-\ndustry standards, the Company may not be able to increase its revenue and expand its business.\nThe Company depends on one customer for the smart-cart sales, a major source of the Company’s current revenues;\nthe loss of this customer may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results.\nCurrently, one customer is responsible for a significant portion of the Company’s smart-cart revenues. During the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, this customer constituted 40%, 0% and 0% of the total revenues,\nrespectively. The percentage of the Company’s sales to the Company’s major customers may fluctuate from period to\nperiod, and the Company’s principal customers may also vary from year to year. Significant reduction in sales to any\nof the major customers, or the loss of a major customer, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations\nand financial condition.\nThe Company’s growth depends, in part, on the success of the strategic relationships with third parties.\nTo grow the business, the Company anticipates that the Company will continue to depend on relationships with third\nparties, such as the Company’s customers, suppliers and software providers. Identifying partners, and negotiating and\ndocumenting relationships with them, requires significant time and resources. If the Company is unsuccessful in es-\ntablishing or maintaining its relationships with third parties, the Company’s ability to compete in the marketplace or\nto grow the Company’s revenue could be impaired, and the results of operations may suffer. Even if the Company is\nsuccessful, the Company cannot assure you that these relationships will result in increased customer usage of the\nproducts or increased revenue.\nThe Company’s future profitability depends, in part, on subcontractor and supplier performance and financial viabil-\nity as well as component availability and pricing.\nThe Company relies on other companies to provide components and subsystems for its technology and to produce\nhardware elements and sub-assemblies, provide software and intellectual property, provide information about the parts\nthey supply to the Company, and to do so in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and contract terms.\nDisruptions or performance problems caused by the Company’s subcontractors and suppliers, or a misalignment be-\ntween the Company’s contractual obligations and the agreement with its subcontractors and suppliers, could have\nvarious impacts on the Company, including on the ability to meet the Company’s commitments to customers.\nThe Company’s ability to perform its obligations on time could be adversely affected if one or more of the Company’s\nsubcontractors or suppliers were unable to provide the agreed-upon products, materials or information, or perform the\nagreed-upon services in a timely, compliant and cost-effective manner or otherwise to meet the requirements of the\ncontract. Changes in political or economic conditions, including changes in defense budgets or credit availability or\nsanctions, or other changes impacting a subcontractor or supplier (including changes in ownership or operations), as\nwell as their ability to retain talent and other resources, and requirements or changes in requirements imposed on them\nby other customers, could adversely affect the financial stability of the Company’s subcontractors and suppliers and/or\ntheir ability to perform. The inability of the Company’s suppliers to perform, or their inability to perform adequately,\ncould also result in the need for the Company to transition to alternate suppliers, which could result in significant\nincremental cost and delay or the need for the Company to provide other resources to support its existing suppliers.\n27\nThis risk may increase as the demands grow for the Company’s subcontractors and suppliers to meet extensive gov-\nernment-related cyber and other requirements.\nIf the Company’s subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform or the Company is unable to procure, or experience\nsignificant delays in deliveries of, needed products, materials or services; or if they do not comply with all applicable\nlaws, regulations, requirements and contract terms, including if what the Company received is counterfeit or otherwise\nimproper, the Company’s financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely\naffected.\nInformation technology system failures or breaches of the Company’s network security could interrupt the operations\nand adversely affect the business.\nThe Company’s operations depend upon the ability to protect the Company’s computer equipment and systems against\ndamage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from\ninternal and external security breaches, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems. Any damage or failure of the\ncomputer systems or network infrastructure that causes an interruption in the operations could have a material adverse\neffect on the business and subject the Company to litigation or actions by regulatory authorities. Although the Com-\npany employs both internal resources and external consultants to conduct auditing and testing for weaknesses in the\nsystems, controls, firewalls and encryption and intend to maintain and upgrade the Company’s security technology\nand operational procedures to prevent such damage, breaches or other disruptive problems, there can be no assurance\nthat these security measures will be successful.\nReal or perceived errors, failures, or bugs in the technology could adversely affect the Company’s operating results\nand growth prospects.\nThe Company has discovered and expects that the Company will continue to discover errors, failures and bugs in its\ntechnology and anticipate that certain of these errors, failures and bugs will only be discovered and remediated after\ndeployment. Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in the platform could result in negative publicity, government\ninquiries, loss of or delay in market acceptance of the Company’s technology, loss of competitive position, or claims\nby customers for losses sustained by them. In such an event, the Company may be required, or may choose, for cus-\ntomer relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources in order to help correct the problem.\nThe Company could be harmed by improper disclosure or loss of sensitive or confidential Company, employee, or\ncustomer data, including personal data.\nIn connection with the operation of the business, the Company stores, processes and transmits data, including personal\nand payment information, about the Company’s employees and customers, a portion of which is confidential and/or\npersonally sensitive. Unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive or confidential data may occur through a variety of\nmethods. These include, but are not limited to, systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or\nunauthorized access to or through the information systems, whether by the Company’s employees or third parties,\nincluding a cyberattack by computer programmers, hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored or-\nganizations, who may develop and deploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs. Such disclosure, loss\nor breach could harm the Company’s reputation and subject the Company to government sanctions and liability under\nthe contracts and laws that protect sensitive or personal data and confidential information, resulting in increased costs\nor loss of revenues. It is possible that security controls over sensitive or confidential data and other practices the\nCompany and its third-party vendors follow may not prevent the improper access to, disclosure of, or loss of such\ninformation. The potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks may increase as the Company introduces new\nproducts and offerings. Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes\nconflict among the various jurisdictions in which the Company provides services. Any failure or perceived failure to\nsuccessfully manage the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related mat-\nters, or any failure to comply with changing regulatory requirements in this area, could result in legal liability or\nimpairment to the Company’s reputation in the marketplace.\n28\nA material breach in security relating to the Company’s information systems and regulation related to such breaches\ncould adversely affect the Company.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new tech-\nnologies and the use of the Internet, and the increased sophistication and activity of organized crime, hackers, terror-\nists, activists, cybercriminals and other external parties, some of which may be linked to terrorist organizations or\nhostile foreign governments. Cybersecurity attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include malicious software,\nransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to\ndisruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption\nof data, substantially damaging the Company’s reputation. Any person who circumvents the security measures could\nsteal proprietary or confidential customer information or cause interruptions in the Company’s operations. The Com-\npany incurs significant costs to protect against security breaches and may incur significant additional costs to alleviate\nproblems caused by any breaches. The Company’s failure to prevent security breaches, or well-publicized security\nbreaches affecting the Internet in general, could significantly harm the Company’s reputation and business and finan-\ncial results.\nThe Company’s contracts may contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities, are tech-\nnologically complex, require state-of-the-art manufacturing expertise or are dependent upon factors not wholly within\nthe Company’s control. Failure to meet the contractual obligations could adversely affect the Company’s profitability,\nreputation and future prospects.\nThe Company designs and develops advanced and innovative products and services, which are applied by the custom-\ners in a variety of environments, including some under highly demanding operating conditions. Problems and delays\nin development or delivery, or system failures, as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, intellectual\nproperty rights, labor, inability to achieve learning curve assumptions, inability to manage effectively a broad array\nof programs, manufacturing materials or components, or subcontractor performance could prevent the Company from\nmeeting requirements and create significant risk and liabilities. Similarly, failures to perform on schedule or otherwise\nto fulfill the contractual obligations could negatively impact the Company’s financial position, reputation and ability\nto win future business. If the Company is unable to meet its obligations, including due to issues regarding the design,\ndevelopment or manufacture of the products or services, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nreputation, the ability to compete for other contracts and the financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nThe Company’s insurance coverage, customer indemnifications or other liability protections may be unavailable or\ninadequate to cover all of the significant risks or the insurers may deny coverage of or be unable to pay for material\nlosses the Company incurs, which could adversely affect the Company’s profitability and overall financial position.\nThe Company endeavors to obtain insurance agreements from financially solid, responsible, highly rated counterpar-\nties in established markets to cover significant risks and liabilities. Not every risk or liability can be insured, and for\nrisks that are insurable, the policy limits and terms of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be suffi-\ncient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred. Even if insurance coverage is available, the Company may not\nbe able to obtain it at a price or on terms acceptable to the Company. Disputes with insurance carriers, including over\npolicy terms, reservation of rights, the applicability of coverage (including exclusions), compliance with provisions\n(including notice) and/or the insolvency of one or more of the insurers may significantly affect the availability or\ntiming of recovery, and may impact the Company’s ability to obtain insurance coverage at reasonable rates in the\nfuture.\nIn some circumstances the Company may be entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from its customers\nthrough contractual provisions, laws, regulations or otherwise. However, these protections are not always available,\ncan be difficult to obtain, are typically subject to certain terms or limitations, including the availability of funds, and\nmay not be sufficient to cover all losses or liabilities incurred. If insurance coverage, customer indemnifications and/or\nother legal protections are not available or are not sufficient to cover the risks or losses, it could have a material adverse\neffect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n29\nThe Company may face intense competition and expects competition to increase in the future, which could prohibit\nthe Company from developing a customer base and generating revenue.\nThe Company faces significant competition in every aspect of the business. Many companies that the Company com-\npetes with may already have an established market in the industries in which the Company competes and most of these\ncompanies have significantly greater financial and other resources than the Company and have been developing their\nproducts and services longer than the Company has been developing theirs. In addition, some of the Company’s larger\ncompetitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or\nincorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages potential customers from\npurchasing the Company’s products. Potential customers may also prefer to purchase from their existing solution\nproviders rather than a new solution provider regardless of product performance or features. These larger competitors\noften have broader product lines and market focus and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular\nmarket. Conditions in the Company’s market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological ad-\nvancements, partnering by the Company’s competitors or continuing market consolidation. New start-up companies\nthat innovate and large competitors that are making significant investments in research and development may invent\nsimilar or superior products and technologies that compete with the Company’s products. In addition, some of the\nCompany’s competitors may enter into new alliances with each other or may establish or strengthen cooperative rela-\ntionships. Any such consolidation, acquisition, alliance or cooperative relationship could lead to pricing pressure and\nthe loss of any future market share and could result in a competitor with greater financial, technical, marketing, service\nand other resources, all of which could harm the Company’s ability to compete. Furthermore, organizations may be\nmore willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing infrastructure from competitors than to replace their\nexisting infrastructure with the Company’s products. Any failure to meet and address these factors could harm the\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s business operations and future development could be significantly disrupted if the Company loses key\nmembers of its management team.\nThe success of the business continues to depend to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of the Com-\npany’s senior officers and key employees, both individually and as a group. The Company’s future performance will\nbe substantially dependent in particular on the ability to retain and motivate Bentsur Joseph, the Chief Executive\nOfficer, senior officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the business and plans for\nfuture development. The Company has no reason to believe that the Company will lose the services of any of these\nindividuals in the foreseeable future; however, the Company currently has no effective replacement for any of these\nindividuals due to their experience, reputation in the industry and special role in the Company’s operations. The Com-\npany also does not maintain any key man life insurance policies for any of its employees.\nThe Company’s ability to meet the needs of its customers depends, in part, on the Company’s ability to maintain a\nqualified workforce.\nThe Company’s operating results and growth opportunities are heavily dependent upon the ability to attract and retain\nsufficient personnel with security clearances and requisite skills in multiple areas, including science, technology, en-\ngineering and math. Additionally, as the Company grows its international business, it is increasingly important that\nthe Company is able to attract and retain personnel with relevant local qualifications and experience. In addition, in a\ntightened labor market, the Company is facing increased competition for talent, both with traditional defense compa-\nnies and commercial companies. If qualified personnel are scarce or difficult to attract or retain or if the Company\nexperiences a high level of attrition, generally or in particular areas, or if such personnel are unable to obtain security\nclearances on a timely basis, the Company could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract\nand retain necessary employees.\n30\nIf the Company is able to expand the operations, the Company may be unable to successfully manage its future growth.\nThe Company’s growth may strain the Company’s infrastructure and resources. Any such growth could place in-\ncreased strain on the Company’s management, operational, financial and other resources, and the Company will need\nto train, motivate, and manage employees, as well as attract management, sales, finance and accounting, international,\ntechnical, and other professionals. Any failure to expand these areas and implement appropriate procedures and con-\ntrols in an efficient manner and at a pace consistent with the Company’s business objectives could have a material\nadverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to certain Israeli, U.S. and foreign anti-corruption anti-money laundering and other trade laws and\nregulations. We can face serious consequences for violations.\nAmong other matters, Israeli, U.S. and foreign anticorruption, anti-money laundering and other trade laws and regu-\nlations, which are collectively referred to as Trade Laws, prohibit companies and their employees, agents, legal coun-\nsel, accountants, consultants, contractors and other partners from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, solicit-\ning or receiving, directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to or from recipients in\nthe public or private sector. Violations of Trade Laws can result in substantial criminal fines and civil penalties, im-\nprisonment, the loss of trade privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputa-\ntional harm, and other consequences. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of govern-\nment agencies or government-affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our\npersonnel, agents or partners, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have prior knowledge of such activities.\nThe Company may become subject to various investigations, claims, disputes, enforcement actions, litigation, arbi-\ntration and other legal proceedings that could ultimately be resolved against the Company.\nThe size, nature and complexity of the business make the Company susceptible to investigations, claims, disputes,\nenforcement actions, prosecutions, litigation and other legal proceedings, particularly those involving governments\n(including federal, state and outside the U.S.). The Company may become subject to investigations, claims, disputes,\nenforcement actions and administrative, civil or criminal litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings globally and\nacross a broad array of matters, including, but not limited to, government contracts, commercial transactions, false\nclaims, false statements, antitrust, mischarging, contract performance, fraud, procurement integrity, products liability,\nprivacy, warranty liability, the use of hazardous materials, personal injury claims, environmental, shareholder deriva-\ntive actions, prior acquisitions and divestitures, intellectual property, tax, employees, export/import, anti-corruption,\nlabor, health and safety, accidents, launch failures and employee benefits and plans, including plan administration,\nand improper payments. These matters could divert financial and management resources; result in administrative, civil\nor criminal fines, penalties or other sanctions (which terms include judgments or convictions and consent or other\nvoluntary decrees or agreements), compensatory, treble or other damages, non-monetary relief or actions, or other\nliabilities; and otherwise harm the business and the Company’s ability to obtain and retain awards. Government reg-\nulations provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government\ncontracts or suspension of export privileges for the company or one or more of its components. Suspension or debar-\nment or criminal resolutions in particular could have a material adverse effect on the company because of its reliance\non government contracts and export authorizations. An investigation, claim, dispute, enforcement action or litigation,\neven if not substantiated or fully indemnified or insured, could also negatively impact the Company’s reputation\namong its customers and the public, and make it substantially more difficult for the Company to compete effectively\nfor business, obtain and retain awards or obtain adequate insurance in the future. Investigations, claims, disputes,\nenforcement actions, litigation or other legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nfinancial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n31\nThe Company’s reputation, the ability to do business and the Company’s financial position, results of operations\nand/or cash flows may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees, agents, subcontractors, suppliers, business\npartners or joint ventures in which the Company participates.\nThe Company has implemented policies, procedures, and other compliance controls, and have negotiated terms de-\nsigned to prevent misconduct by employees, agents or others working on the Company’s behalf or with the Company\nthat would violate the applicable laws of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including laws governing\nthe protection of classified information, procurement integrity, information security and data privacy, or the terms of\nthe Company’s contracts. However, the Company cannot ensure that the Company will prevent all such misconduct\ncommitted by its employees, agents, subcontractors, suppliers, business partners or others working on the Company’s\nbehalf or with the Company. This risk of improper conduct may increase as the Company continues to expand globally\nand do business with new partners. Improper actions by those with whom or through whom the Company does busi-\nness (including the Company’s employees, agents, subcontractors, suppliers, business partners and joint ventures)\ncould subject the Company to administrative, civil or criminal investigations and enforcement actions; monetary and\nnon-monetary penalties; liabilities; and the loss of privileges and other sanctions, including suspension and debarment,\nwhich could negatively impact the Company’s reputation and ability to conduct business and could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nThe Company may not generate the expected benefits of the acquisition of Cust2Mate and Isramat, and the acquisition\nof same could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, distract management and increase the Company’s expenses.\nThe Company acquired a controlling interest in Cust2Mate and all of the issued and outstanding shares of Isramat\nwith the expectation that the acquisition of such entities will result in various benefits. Achieving the anticipated\nbenefits of the acquisition of Cust2Mate and Isramat is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the\nCompany’s business and the businesses of Cust2Mate and Isramat can be integrated in an efficient and effective\nmanner. The Company may not be able to accurately forecast the performance or ultimate impact of the acquisition\nof Cust2Mate and Isramat. It is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result\nin the loss of valuable employees, additional and unforeseen expenses, the disruption of the Company’s ongoing busi-\nness, processes and systems, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensa-\ntion arrangements, any of which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of\nthe acquisition of Cust2Mate and Isramat. There may be increased risk due to integrating financial reporting and\ninternal control systems. The integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties, and no assurance can be given\nthat the anticipated benefits, expense savings and synergies will be realized or, if realized, the timing of their realiza-\ntion. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected\nrevenues and could adversely affect the Company’s future business, financial condition, operating results and pro-\nspects.\nThe success of the acquisition of Cust2Mate and Isramat, depends upon effective integration and management of the\nacquired business into the Company’s operations, which is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realizing the\nanticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel, the diversion of management’s at-\ntention for other business concerns, and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the Cust2Mate and Isramat business\nor assets. The Company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrate the\nbusiness and operations of Cust2Mate and Isramat.\nThe Company may also in the future engage in further acquisitions to expand its product and service offerings. These\nacquisitions involve risks and uncertainties such as:\n● the Company’s pre-acquisition due diligence may fail to identify material risks;\n● significant acquisitions may negatively impact the Company’s financial results, including cash flow\nand financial liquidity;\n● significant goodwill assets recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet from prior acqui-\nsitions are subject to impairment testing, and unfavorable changes in circumstances could result in\nimpairment to those assets;\n32\n● acquisitions may result in significant additional unanticipated costs associated with price adjust-\nments or write-downs;\n● the Company may not integrate newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and cost-\neffective manner;\n● relocation or combination of facilities of acquired businesses may be more costly or time consuming\nthan planned;\n● the Company may fail to achieve the strategic objectives, synergies, cost savings and other benefits\nexpected from acquisitions;\n● the technologies acquired may not prove to be those needed to be successful in the Company’s\nmarkets or may not have adequate intellectual property rights protection;\n● the Company may assume significant liabilities and exposures that exceed the enforceability or other\nlimitations of applicable indemnification provisions, if any, or the financial resources of any indem-\nnifying parties, including indemnity for tax or regulatory compliance issues, such as anti-corruption\nand environmental compliance, that may result in the Company incurring successor liability;\n● the Company may fail to retain key employees of the acquired businesses;\n● the attention of senior management may be diverted from its existing operations;\n● the Company may be exposed to potential shareholder claims if the Company acquires a significant\ninterest in a publicly traded company; and\n● the Company could be subject to more restrictive regulations by the local authorities after the ac-\nquisition, including regulations relating to foreign ownership of local companies.\nThe Company cannot assure that these risks or other unforeseen factors will not offset the intended benefits of the\nacquisitions, and such risks could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of\noperation.\nIf the Company expands its operations into other parts of the world, the Company will face certain additional risks\nand challenges.\nThe Company may expand its operations into other jurisdictions around the world as part of the Company’s business\nexpansion plans, which will subject the Company to a variety of risks, including fluctuations in foreign currencies,\nchanges in the economic strength or greater volatility in the economies of foreign countries in which the Company\ndoes business, difficulties in enforcing contractual rights and intellectual property rights, theft or vandalism, economic\ninstability, taxes or government royalties by foreign governments, adverse changes in the regulatory environments,\nincluding in tax laws and regulations, of the foreign countries in which the Company does business, compliance with\nanti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investments, the ability to identify and\nretain qualified local managers and the challenge of managing a culturally and geographically diverse operation. The\nCompany cannot guarantee compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and violations could result in sub-\nstantial fines, sanctions, civil or criminal penalties, competitive or reputational harm, litigation or regulatory action\nand other consequences that might adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.\nThere are tax risks we may be subject to in carrying on business in Israel and Canada.\nWe are incorporated in British Columbia, with subsidiaries in Israel. Since we are operating in a new and developing\nindustry there is a risk that foreign governments may look to increase their tax revenues or levy additional taxes to\nlevel the playing field for perceived disadvantages to traditional brick and mortar businesses. There is no guarantee\nthat governments will not impose such additional adverse taxes in the future.\n33\nOur products may be subject to the recall or return.\nManufacturers and distributors of products are sometimes subject to the recall or return of their products for a variety\nof reasons, including product defects, safety concerns, packaging issues and inadequate or inaccurate labeling disclo-\nsure. If any of our products were to be recalled due to an alleged product defect, safety concern or for any other reason,\nwe could be required to incur unexpected expenses of the recall and any legal proceedings that might arise in connec-\ntion with the recall. We may lose a significant amount of sales and may not be able to replace those sales at an\nacceptable margin or at all. In addition, a product recall may require significant management time and attention. Ad-\nditionally, product recalls may lead to increased scrutiny of our products by our customers and regulators, requiring\nfurther management time and attention and potential legal fees, costs and other expenses.\nIf we release defective products or services, our operating results could suffer.\nProducts designed and released by us involve testing and verification, assembly processes, and quality and function-\nality inspection and are difficult to develop and manufacture. While we have quality controls in place to detect and\nprevent defects in our products and services before they are released, these quality controls are subject to human error,\noverriding, and reasonable resource constraints. Therefore, these quality controls and preventative measures may not\nbe effective in detecting and preventing defects in our products before they have been released into the marketplace.\nIn such an event, we could be required, or decide voluntarily, to suspend the availability of the product or services,\nwhich could significantly harm our business and operating results.\nOur products and services are complex and could have unknown defects or errors, which may give rise to legal claims\nagainst us, diminish our brand or divert our resources from other purposes.\nOur products are comprised of and rely on complex and sensitive electronic hardware, algorithms, software, user-\nfriendly interfaces and tightly integrated, electromechanical designs. Despite testing, our products could contain de-\nfects and errors and may in the future contain defects, errors or performance problems when first introduced, when\nnew versions or enhancements are released, or even after these products have been used by our customers for a period\nof time. These problems could result in expensive and time-consuming design modifications or warranty charges,\ndelays in the introduction of new products or enhancements, significant increases in our service and maintenance\ncosts, exposure to liability for damages, damaged customer relationships and harm to our reputation, any of which\ncould materially harm our results of operations and ability to achieve market acceptance. In addition, increased devel-\nopment and warranty costs could be substantial and could significantly reduce tour operating margins.\nThe existence of any defects, errors, or failures in our products or the misuse of our products could also lead to product\nliability claims or lawsuits against it. A defect, error or failure in one of our products could result in failure or damage\nto the products it is embedded in, or property damage, injury, death and/or significant damage our reputation and\nsupport for our services in general. We anticipate this risk will grow as more and more products using our products\nare deployed.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that we have or will have insurance adequate to protect us from material judgments\nand expenses related to potential future claims or that such insurance will be available in the future at economical\nprices or at all. Even if we are fully insured as it relates to a particular claim, the claim could nevertheless diminish\nour brand and divert management’s attention and resources, which could have a negative impact on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\n34\nOur senior management team has limited experience managing a public company listed on a U.S. or Canadian ex-\nchange, and regulatory compliance may divert its attention from the day to day management of our business.\nThe individuals who now constitute our senior management team have relatively limited experience managing a pub-\nlicly traded company listed on a U.S. or Canadian exchange and limited experience complying with the increasingly\ncomplex laws pertaining to public companies compared to senior management of other publicly traded companies\nlisted on a U.S. or Canadian exchange. Our senior management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our\ntransition as a recently listed public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations\nunder both Canadian and U.S. securities laws. In particular, these new obligations will require substantial attention\nfrom our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day to day management of our business.\nFailure to adhere to our financial reporting obligations and other public company requirements could adversely affect\nthe market price of our common shares.\nThe reporting and other obligations related to being a public company will place significant demands on our manage-\nment, administrative, operational and accounting resources. If we are unable to meet such demands in a timely and\neffective manner, our ability to comply with our financial reporting obligations and other rules applicable to reporting\nissuers could be impaired. Moreover, any failure to maintain effective internal controls could cause us to fail to satisfy\nour reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. If we cannot provide reliable\nfinancial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be materially adversely affected which\ncould also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could result in a reduction\nin the trading price of our common shares.\nIn addition, we do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting\nwill prevent all errors or fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and implemented, can provide only\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control\nsystem must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative\nto their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues within an organization are detected. The inherent limitations include the realities that\njudgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes.\nControls can also be circumvented by individual acts of certain persons, by collusion of two or more people or by\nmanagement override of the controls. Due to the inherent limitations in a control system, misstatements due to errors\nor fraud may occur and may not be detected in a timely manner or at all.\nFailure to remediate material weakness in internal accounting controls could result in material misstatements in our\nfinancial statements.\nOur management has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to lack of\nsufficient accounting resources with relevant technical accounting skills to address issues related to the financial state-\nment close process, and because of the size of the Company and its staff complement, we were not able to sufficiently\ndesign internal controls to provide the appropriate level of oversight regarding the financial recordkeeping and review\nof the Company’s financial reporting. Our management has concluded that, due to such material weakness, our internal\ncontrols over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2022.\nTo remediate the material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting described above, we have initiated\nremedial measures and are taking additional measures to remediate this material weakness. First, we are continuing to\nroll out an enhanced financial and accounting system. Second, we have hired additional personnel. Third, we are\nstrengthening our controls financial reporting, with the assistance of outside consultants, experts in the controls and\nprocedures over financing reporting. Consistent with our stage of development, we continue to rely on risk-mitigating\nprocedures during our financial closing process in order to provide comfort that the financial statements are presented\nfairly in accordance with IFRS.\n35\nSuch changes may not, however, be effective in establishing the adequacy of our internal control over financial re-\nporting. If the material weakness is not adequately remedied, or if we identify further material weaknesses in our\ninternal controls, our failure to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and a failure to meet our\nreporting and financial obligations, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and\nthe trading price of our securities. In addition, investors’ perceptions that our internal control over financial reporting\nis inadequate or that we are unable to produce accurate financial statements may materially adversely affect the price\nof our securities.\nWe may experience adverse effects on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting\nstandards or interpretations.\nOur implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules, including new accounting rules and inter-\npretations, could adversely affect our reported financial position or operating results or cause unanticipated fluctua-\ntions in our reported operating results in future periods.\nWe are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable\nto emerging growth companies may make our common shares less attractive to investors and, as a result, adversely\naffect the price of our common shares and result in a less active trading market for our common shares.\nWe are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions\nfrom various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth com-\npanies. For example, we have elected to rely on an exemption from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404\nof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act relating to internal control over financial reporting, and we will not provide such an attes-\ntation from our auditors for so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company.\nWe may avail ourselves of these disclosure exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We\ncannot predict whether investors will find our common shares less attractive because of our reliance on some or all of\nthese exemptions. If investors find our common shares less attractive, it may cause the trading price of the common\nshares to decline and there may be a less active trading market for our common shares.\nWe will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of:\n● the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.235 billion in annual revenue;\n● the last day of the fiscal year in which we qualify as a “large accelerated filer”;\n● the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-\nconvertible debt securities; and\n● the last day of the fiscal year in which the fifth anniversary of the completion of our first sale of common\nequity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act.\nWe will be affected by operational risks and may not be adequately insured for certain risks.\nWe will be affected by a number of operational risks and we may not be adequately insured for certain risks, including:\nproduct liability litigation, as we do not have product liability insurance; labor disputes; further workforce reductions;\ncatastrophic accidents; fires; blockades or other acts of social activism; changes in the regulatory environment; impact\nof non-compliance with laws and regulations; cyber-attacks and ransom requests; natural phenomena, such as inclem-\nent weather conditions, floods, earthquakes and ground movements. There is no assurance that the foregoing risks and\nhazards will not result in damage to, or destruction of, our technologies, personal injury or death, environmental dam-\nage, adverse impacts on our operation, costs, monetary losses, potential legal liability and adverse governmental ac-\ntion, any of which could have an adverse impact on our future cash flows, earnings and financial condition. Also, we\nmay be subject to or affected by liability or sustain loss for certain risks and hazards against which we cannot insure\nor which we may elect not to insure because of the cost. This lack of insurance coverage could have an adverse impact\non our future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition.\n36\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, which requires us to develop new\nproducts and product enhancements, and could render our existing products and technologies obsolete.\nContinuing technological changes in the market for our products could make our products less competitive or obsolete,\neither generally or for particular applications. Our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce\na variety of new technologies, innovations, capabilities and enhancements to our existing product and service offer-\nings, as well as introduce a variety of new product offerings, to address the changing needs of the markets in which\nwe offer products. Delays in introducing new products, technologies and enhancements, the failure to choose correctly\namong technical alternatives or the failure to offer innovative products or enhancements at competitive prices may\ncause existing and potential customers to purchase our competitors’ products.\nIf we are unable to devote adequate resources to develop new products or cannot otherwise successfully develop new\nproducts or enhancements that meet customer requirements on a timely basis, our products could lose market share,\nour revenue and profits could decline, and we could experience operating losses.\nIf critical components or raw materials used to manufacture our products become scarce or unavailable, then we may\nincur delays in manufacturing and delivery of our products, which could damage our business.\nWe obtain materials, mechanical parts, hardware and electronics components, various subsystems and manufacturing\nand assembly services from a limited group of suppliers and sub-contractors. We do not have long-term agreements\nwith any of these suppliers or sub-contractors that obligate them to continue to sell materials, components, subsystems,\nor provide manufacturing services to us. Our reliance on these suppliers or sub-contractors involves significant risks\nand uncertainties, including whether our suppliers or sub-contractors will provide an adequate supply of required\ncomponents, subsystems, or services of sufficient quality, will increase prices for the components, subsystems or\nservices and will perform their obligations on a timely basis. As of the date of this report, the Company has not\nexperienced any delays or shortages in the supply of critical components or raw materials used for manufacturing its\nproducts.\nIn addition, certain raw materials and components used in the manufacture of our products are periodically subject to\nsupply shortages, and our business is subject to the risk of price increases and periodic delays in delivery. Specifically,\nthe electronics components shortage crisis, a unique result of the COVID-19 pandemic, negatively affected our market\nsegment by increased delivery lead time and increased purchase prices of components used under certain of our prod-\nucts, which resulted in delay in delivery time of our products to our customers, and had negative effect on our revenues\nand profitability. Please see Risk Factors – The Company’s business is subject to risks arising from a widespread\noutbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis, such as the COVID-19\npandemic, which has impacted and could continue to impact the business. Similarly, the market for electronic com-\nponents is subject to cyclical reductions in supply, outside of COVID-19. If we are unable to obtain components from\nthird-party suppliers in the quantities and of the quality that we require, on a timely basis and at acceptable prices,\nthen we may not be able to deliver our products on a timely or cost-effective basis to our customers, which could\ncause customers to terminate their contracts with us, increase our costs and seriously harm our business, results of\noperations and financial condition. Moreover, if any of our suppliers or sub-contractors become financially unstable,\nthen we may have to find new suppliers or sub-contractors. It may take several months to locate alternative suppliers\nor sub-contractors, if required, or to redesign our products to accommodate components from different suppliers. We\nmay experience significant delays in manufacturing and shipping our products to customers and incur additional de-\nvelopment, manufacturing and other costs to establish alternative sources of supply if we lose any of these sources or\nare required to redesign our products. We cannot predict if we will be able to obtain replacement components within\nthe time frames that we require at an affordable cost, if at all.\n37\nIf we fail to successfully promote our product and brand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nprospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe that brand recognition is an important factor to our success. If we fail to promote our brands successfully,\nor if the expenses of doing so are disproportionate to any increased net sales we achieve, it would have a material\nadverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. This will depend largely on\nour ability to maintain trust, be a technology leader, and continue to provide high-quality and secure technologies,\nproducts and services. Any negative publicity about us or our industry, the quality and reliability of our technologies,\nproducts and services, our risk management processes, changes to our technologies, products and services, our ability\nto effectively manage and resolve customer complaints, our privacy and security practices, litigation, regulatory ac-\ntivity, and the experience of sellers and buyers with our products or services, could adversely affect our reputation and\nthe confidence in and use of our technologies, products and services. Harm to our brand can arise from many sources,\nincluding; failure by us or our partners to satisfy expectations of service and quality; inadequate protection of sensitive\ninformation; compliance failures and claims; litigation and other claims; employee misconduct; and misconduct by\nour partners, service providers, or other counterparties. If we do not successfully maintain a strong and trusted brand,\nour business could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to protect, or incur significant costs in defending, our intellectual property and other know-how or proprie-\ntary rights, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property, know-how and other proprietary\nrights. We rely primarily on patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets other contractual provisions, to protect our\nintellectual property and other proprietary rights. However, most of our technology and know-how is not patented,\nand we may be unable or may not seek to obtain patent protection for this technology. Moreover, existing U.S. legal\nstandards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights offer only lim-\nited protection, may not provide us with any competitive advantages, and may be challenged by third parties. The laws\nof countries other than the U.S. may be even less protective of intellectual property rights. Accordingly, despite our\nefforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property\nor otherwise gaining access to our technology. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer our\nproducts or portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property. Moreover, many of our\nemployees have access to our trade secrets and other intellectual property. If one or more of these employees leave to\nwork for one of our competitors, then they may disseminate this proprietary information, which may as a result damage\nour competitive position. If we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, then our business,\nresults of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed. From time to time, we may have to initiate\nlawsuits to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Pursuing these claims is time consuming and\nexpensive and could adversely impact our results of operations.\nIn addition, affirmatively defending our intellectual property rights and investigating whether we are pursuing a prod-\nuct or service development that may violate the rights of others may entail significant expense. Any of our intellectual\nproperty rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative processes or litigation. If we resort\nto legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual\nproperty or other proprietary rights of others, then the proceedings could result in significant expense to us and divert\nthe attention and efforts of our management and technical employees, even if we prevail.\n38\nThe Company may not be able to adequately protect its intellectual property, which, in turn, could harm the value of\nthe brands and adversely affect the business.\nPatent applications in prosecuting have no guarantee that they will be granted, or if granted that the scope of protection\nwill be adequate. A Freedom to Operate search has not been performed and there is no guarantee that the company is\nnot infringing other patents. The Company’s ability to implement the business plan successfully depends in part on\nthe ability to build brand recognition using the Company’s trademarks, service marks and other proprietary intellectual\nproperty, including the Company’s names and logos. The Company currently has no registered trademarks. While the\nCompany plans to register a number of its trademarks; no assurance can be given that the Company’s trademark\napplications will be approved. No assurance can be given that the Company’s patent applications which are in process\nwill be approved. If the Company’s patent applications are not approved, the ability to expand or develop the business\nmay be negatively affected.\nThird parties may also oppose the Company’s trademark or patent applications, or otherwise challenge the use of the\ntrademarks or patents. In the event that the trademarks or patents are successfully challenged, the Company could be\nforced to rebrand its goods and services or redesign its technology, which could result in loss of brand recognition,\nand could require the Company to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands and products.\nIf the Company’s efforts to register, maintain and protect its intellectual property are inadequate, or if any third party\nmisappropriates, dilutes or infringes on the intellectual property, the value of the Company’s brands may be harmed,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on the business and might prevent the Company’s brands from achieving\nor maintaining market acceptance. The Company may also face the risk of claims that the Company has infringed\nthird parties’ intellectual property rights. If third parties claim that the Company infringes upon their intellectual prop-\nerty rights, the Company’s operating profits could be adversely affected. Any claims of intellectual property infringe-\nment, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, require the Company to rebrand\nits services, if feasible, divert management’s attention and resources or require the Company to enter into royalty or\nlicensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property.\nAny royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all.\nA successful claim of infringement against the Company could result in the Company being required to pay significant\ndamages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements, or stop the sale of certain products or services, any of which\ncould have a negative impact on the operating profits and harm the Company’s future prospects.\nThe Company also relies significantly upon proprietary technology, information, processes and know-how. The Com-\npany typically seeks to protect this information, including by entering into confidentiality agreements with its employ-\nees and other parties such as consultants, teammates and subcontractors. These agreements and other measures may\nnot provide adequate protection for the Company’s trade secrets and other proprietary information. In the event of an\ninfringement of such intellectual property rights, a breach of a confidentiality agreement, a misuse or theft of the\nCompany’s intellectual property or divulgence of proprietary information, the Company may not have adequate legal\nremedies. In addition, the Company’s trade secrets, or other proprietary information may otherwise become known or\nbe independently developed by competitors.\nIf the Company is unable to adequately exploit its intellectual property rights, to protect its intellectual property rights,\nor to obtain rights to intellectual property of others, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputa-\ntion, ability to compete for and perform on contracts, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n39\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submis-\nsion, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could\nbe reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe United States Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) and various foreign national or international patent\nagencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other similar provisions\nduring the patent application process. Periodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO\nand various foreign national or international patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. While an\ninadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the\napplicable rules, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or\npatent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance\nevents that could result in abandonment or lapse of patent rights include, but are not limited to, failure to timely file\nnational and regional stage patent applications based on our international patent application, failure to respond to\nofficial actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees, and failure to properly legalize and submit formal\ndocuments. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our products, our competitors might be\nable to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWhile a patent may be granted by a national patent office, there is no guarantee that the granted patent is valid. Options\nexist to challenge the validity of a patent which, depending upon the jurisdiction, may include re-examination, oppo-\nsition proceedings before the patent office, and/or invalidation proceedings before the relevant court. Patent validity\nmay also be the subject of a counterclaim to an allegation of patent infringement.\nPending patent applications may be challenged by third parties in protest or similar proceedings. Third parties can\ntypically submit prior art material to patentability for review by the patent examiner. Regarding Patent Cooperation\nTreaty applications, a positive opinion regarding patentability issued by the International\nSearching Authority does not guarantee allowance of a national application derived from the Patent Cooperation\nTreaty application. The coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is\nissued, and the patent’s scope can be modified after issuance. It is also possible that the scope of claims granted may\nvary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nThe grant of a patent does not have any bearing on whether the invention described in the patent application would\ninfringe the rights of earlier filed patents. It is possible to both obtain patent protection for an invention and yet still\ninfringe the rights of an earlier granted patent.\nWe may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, which could be costly, time-\nconsuming and limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nWe may become subject to claims that our technologies infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary\nrights of third parties. Any claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive, and could divert\nour management’s attention away from the execution of our business plan. Moreover, any settlement or adverse judg-\nment resulting from these claims could require us to pay substantial amounts or obtain a license to continue to use the\ndisputed technology, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology. We cannot assure that we would be\nable to obtain a license from the third party asserting the claim on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, that we\nwould be able to develop alternative technology on a timely basis, if at all, or that we would be able to obtain a license\nto use a suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering, and our customers to continue using, our\naffected product. An adverse determination also could prevent us from offering our products to others. Infringement\nclaims asserted against us may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial con-\ndition.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting, and defending patents on all of our products throughout the world would be prohibitively expen-\nsive. Therefore, we have filed applications and/or obtained patents only in the United States. Competitors may use our\ntechnologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and their\nproducts may compete with our products.\n40\nRisks Related to the Company’s Operations in Israel\nThe Company’s principal offices and customers are located in Israel and, therefore, the business, financial condition\nand results of operation may be adversely affected by political, economic and military instability in Israel.\nThe Company’s operational offices and customers are located in Israel. In addition, all of the Company’s employees\nand officers, and one of the directors, are residents of Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions\nin Israel may directly affect the business. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed\nconflicts have taken place between Israel and its neighboring countries. Any hostilities involving Israel or the inter-\nruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners could adversely affect the Company’s operations\nand results of operations.\nDuring the Second Lebanon War of 2006, between Israel and Hezbollah, a militant Islamic movement, rockets were\nfired from Lebanon into Israel, including into the Haifa area, where the Company’s facility is located, causing casu-\nalties and major disruption of economic activities in northern Israel. An escalation in tension and violence between\nIsrael and the militant Hamas movement (which controls the Gaza Strip) and other Palestinian Arab groups, culmi-\nnated with Israel’s military campaign in Gaza in December 2008, in November 2012 and again in July and August\n2014 in an endeavor to prevent continued rocket attacks against Israel’s southern towns, as well as other tension and\nviolence between Israel and Palestinian Arab groups and individuals. It is unclear whether any negotiations that may\noccur between Israel and the Palestinian Authority will result in an agreement. In addition, Israel faces threats from\nmore distant neighbors, in particular, Iran, an ally of Hezbollah and Hamas, and the militant group known as the\nIslamic State of Iraq and Syria.\nPopular uprisings in various countries in the Middle East and North Africa are affecting the political stability of those\ncountries. Such instability may lead to deterioration in the political and trade relationships that exist between the State\nof Israel and these countries. Furthermore, several countries, principally in the Middle East, restrict doing business\nwith Israel and Israeli companies, and additional countries may impose restrictions on doing business with Israel and\nIsraeli companies if hostilities in the region continue or intensify. Such restrictions may seriously limit the Company’s\nability to sell its products to customers in those countries. Similarly, Israeli corporations are limited in conducting\nbusiness with entities from several countries. Parties with whom the Company may do business could decline to travel\nto Israel during periods of heightened unrest or tension. In addition, the political and security situation in Israel may\nresult in parties with whom the Company may have agreements involving performance in Israel claiming that they are\nnot obligated to perform their commitments under those agreements pursuant to force majeure provisions in such\nagreements. In addition, any hostilities involving Israel could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s facil-\nities including the corporate office or on the facilities of the Company’s local suppliers, in which event all or a portion\nof the Company’s inventory may be damaged, and the ability to deliver products to customers could be materially\nadversely affected.\nFurthermore, the war and terrorism insurance the Company maintains may not be adequate to cover the losses asso-\nciated with armed conflicts and terrorist attacks. Although the Israeli government in the past covered the reinstatement\nvalue of certain damages that were caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, the Company cannot assure you that this\ngovernment coverage will be maintained, or if maintained, will be sufficient to compensate the Company fully for\ndamages incurred. Any losses or damages incurred by the Company could have a material adverse effect on the busi-\nness.\nAny hostilities involving Israel, terrorist activities or political instability in the region or the interruption or curtailment\nof trade between Israel and its present trading partners, or significant downturns in the economic or financial condition\nof Israel, could adversely affect the Company’s operations and product development, cause the Company’s revenues\nto decrease and adversely affect the share price.\n41\nThe Company’s operations may be disrupted as a result of the obligation of management or key personnel to perform\nmilitary service.\nThe Company’s operations could also be disrupted by the obligations of personnel to perform military service. Some\nof the Company’s employees and independent contractors may be called upon to perform up to 54 days in each three-\nyear period (and in the case of military officers, up to 84 days in each three-year period) of military reserve duty until\nthey reach the age of 40 (and in some cases, depending on their specific military profession up to 45 or even 49 years\nof age) and, in certain emergency circumstances, may be called to immediate and unlimited active duty. In response\nto increases in terrorist activity, there have been periods of significant call-ups of military reservists and it is possible\nthat there will be similar large-scale military reserve duty call-ups in the future. The Company’s operations could be\ndisrupted by the absence of a significant number of employees related to military service, which could materially\nadversely affect the business and results of operations.\nIt may be difficult to enforce a judgment of a Canadian court against the Company, certain of the Company’s officers\nand directors or the Israeli experts named in this Annual Report are in Israel, to assert Canadian securities laws\nclaims in Israel or to serve process on certain of the officers and directors and these experts.\nThe Company is incorporated in British Columbia, Canada. Other than Alan Rootenberg, all of the executive officers\nand directors reside in Israel, and substantially all of the Company’s assets and a substantial portion of the assets of\nthese persons are located in Israel. Therefore, a judgment obtained against the Company, or any of these persons,\nincluding a judgment based on the civil liability provisions of Canadian securities laws, may not be collectible in the\nCanada and may not be enforced by an Israeli court. It also may be difficult to effect service of process on these\npersons in Israel or to assert Canadian securities law claims in original actions instituted in Israel. Israeli courts may\nrefuse to hear a claim based on an alleged violation of Canadian securities laws on the grounds that Israel is not the\nmost appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim. In addition, even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it\nmay determine that Israeli law and not Canadian law is applicable to the claim. If Canadian law is found to be appli-\ncable, the content of applicable Canadian. law must be proven as a fact by expert witnesses, which can be a time\nconsuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law. There is little binding\ncase law in Israel that addresses the matters described above. As a result of the difficulty associated with enforcing a\njudgment against the Company in Israel, one may not be able to collect any damages awarded by either a Canadian or\nforeign court.\nThe Company may become subject to claims for payment of compensation for assigned service inventions by the\nCompany’s current or former employees, which could result in litigation and adversely affect the business.\nUnder the Israeli Patents Law, 5727-1967, or the Patents Law, inventions conceived by an employee during the scope\nof his or her employment are regarded as “service inventions” and are owned by the employer, absent a specific\nagreement between the employee and employer giving the employee service invention rights. Section 134 of the Pa-\ntents Law provides that if no agreement between an employer and an employee exists that prescribes whether, to what\nextent, and on what conditions the employee is entitled to remuneration for his or her service inventions, then such\nmatters may, upon application by the employee, be decided by a government-appointed compensation and royalties\ncommittee established under the Patents Law, or the Committee. Although the Company’s employees have agreed to\nassign to the Company all rights to any intellectual property created in the scope of their employment and most of the\ncurrent employees, including all those involved in the development of the Company’s intellectual property, have\nagreed to waive their economic rights with respect to service inventions, the Company cannot assure you that claims\nwill not be brought against the Company by current or former employees demanding remuneration in consideration\nfor assigned service inventions. If any such claims were filed, the Company could potentially be required to pay\nremuneration to the Company’s current or former employees for such assigned service inventions, or be forced to\nlitigate such claims, which could negatively affect the business.\n42\nRisks Related to the Common Shares\nAn investment in the common shares is speculative and there can be no assurance of any return on any such\ninvestment.\nAn investment in the Company’s common shares is speculative, and there is no assurance that investors will obtain\nany return on their investment. Investors will be subject to substantial risks involved in an investment in the Company,\nincluding the risk of losing their entire investment.\nA more active, liquid trading market for the common shares may not develop, and the price of the common shares\nmay fluctuate significantly.\nAlthough the common shares are listed on the TSX Venture Exchange (“TSXV”) and the Nasdaq Capital Market,\nthey have only been traded on such platforms for a relatively short period of time. There has been relatively limited\ntrading volume in the market for the common shares, and a more active, liquid public trading market may not develop\nor may not be sustained. Limited liquidity in the trading market for the common shares may adversely affect a share-\nholder’s ability to sell its common shares at the time it wishes to sell them or at a price that it considers acceptable. If\na more active, liquid public trading market does not develop, the Company may be limited in its ability to raise capital\nby selling common shares and the Company’s ability to acquire other companies or assets by using common shares\nas consideration. In addition, if there is a thin trading market or “float” for the common shares, the market price for\nthe common shares may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without a large float, the\ncommon shares would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the\ntrading prices of the common shares may be more volatile, and it would be harder to liquidate any investment in the\ncommon shares. Furthermore, the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations, and the price\nof the common shares could fluctuate widely in response to several factors, including:\n● the Company’s quarterly or annual operating results;\n● changes in the Company’s earnings estimates;\n● investment recommendations by securities analysts following the Company’s business or the indus-\ntry;\n● additions or departures of key personnel;\n● changes in the business, earnings estimates or market perceptions of the Company’s competitors;\n● the Company’s failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts’ projections;\n● changes in industry, general market or economic conditions;\n● announcements of legislative or regulatory changes; and\n● natural disasters and political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, political unrest,\nresults of certain elections and votes, emergence of a pandemic, or other widespread health emer-\ngencies (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency, including for example, the COVID-\n19 pandemic), boycotts, adoption or expansion of government trade restrictions, and other business\nrestrictions.\nThe stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly af-\nfected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies. The changes often appear to occur without regard to\nspecific operating performance. The price of the common shares could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or\nnothing to do with the Company and these fluctuations could materially reduce the share price.\n43\nIf we are not able to comply with the applicable continued listing requirements or standards of the TSX Exchange or\nNasdaq, then the TSX Exchange or Nasdaq could delist our common shares.\nIn order to maintain the listing of our common shares on the TSX Exchange and the Nasdaq Capital Market, we must\nsatisfy minimum financial and other continued listing requirements and standards, including those regarding director\nindependence and independent committee requirements, minimum stockholders’ equity, minimum share price, and\ncertain corporate governance requirements. There can be no assurances that we will be able to comply with such\napplicable listing standards.\nWe are currently operating in a period of economic uncertainty and capital markets disruption, which has been sig-\nnificantly impacted by geopolitical instability due to the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by any negative impact\non the global economy and capital markets resulting from the conflict in Ukraine or any other geopolitical tensions.\nU.S. and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions\nand the start of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. On February 24, 2022, a full-scale military invasion\nof Ukraine by Russian troops was reported. Although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflict is highly\nunpredictable, the conflict in Ukraine could lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in credit and\ncapital markets.\nAdditionally, Russia’s prior annexation of Crimea, recent recognition of two separatist republics in the Donetsk and\nLuhansk regions of Ukraine and subsequent military interventions in Ukraine have led to sanctions and other penalties\nbeing levied by the United States, European Union and other countries against Russia, Belarus, the Crimea Region of\nUkraine, the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, and the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic, including agreement\nto remove certain Russian financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunica-\ntion, or SWIFT, payment system. Additional potential sanctions and penalties have also been proposed and/or threat-\nened. Russian military actions and the resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and financial\nmarkets.\nAny of the abovementioned factors could affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict,\nbut could be substantial. Any such disruptions may also magnify the impact of other risks described in this prospectus.\nAs of the date of this report the Company has not experienced any impact or effect to its business, prospects, financial\ncondition and operating results from the conflict in Ukraine.\nConcentration of ownership of the common shares may enable one shareholder or a small number of shareholders to\nsignificantly influence matters requiring shareholder approval.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, members of the Company’s management team beneficially own approximately\n31.36% of the issued and outstanding common shares, of which 31.26% are beneficially owned by Bentsur Joseph,\nthe Company’s Chief Executive Officer. As a result, Mr. Joseph may have the ability to control substantially all mat-\nters submitted to the shareholders for approval including:\n● election of the board of directors;\n● removal of any of the directors;\n● amendment of the articles; and\n● adoption of measures that could delay or prevent a change in control or impede a merger, takeover\nor other business combination involving the Company.\nIn addition, the above ownership composition may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or\notherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company, which in turn could reduce the share price or prevent the\nCompany’s shareholders from realizing a premium over the share price. Any additional investors will own a minority\npercentage of the common shares and will have minority voting rights.\n44\nSales by the Company’s shareholders of a substantial number of the common shares in the public market could ad-\nversely affect the market price of the common shares.\nA substantial portion of the total outstanding shares may be sold into the market at any time. A substantial portion of\nthese shares are held by Mr. Joseph, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. Although the Company believes that\nMr. Joseph has no current intention to sell a significant number of common shares, the Company cannot provide any\nsuch assurance. If Mr. Joseph was to decide to sell large amounts of common shares over a short period of time\n(presuming such sales were permitted) such sales could cause the market price of the common shares to drop signifi-\ncantly, even if the business is doing well. Further, the market price of the common shares could decline as a result of\nthe perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make\nit more difficult for the Company to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that the Company deems\nappropriate.\nThe exercise of outstanding warrants and options will have a dilutive effect on the percentage ownership of the com-\nmon shares by existing shareholders.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, the Company had outstanding warrants to acquire 8,077,737 of common shares\nand options to purchase 2,799,844 common shares. Warrants and options are exercisable for prices ranging between\n$1.18 and $9.33. The expiration of the term of such options and warrants ranges from November 8, 2024, to August\n21, 2032. If a significant number of such warrants and stock options are exercised by the holders, the percentage of\ncommon shares owned by the Company’s existing shareholders will be diluted.\nThe common shares will be traded on more than one market and this may result in price variations.\nThe common shares have been trading on the TSXV and Nasdaq.
