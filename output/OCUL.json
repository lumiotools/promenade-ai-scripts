(NASDAQ: OCUL, “Ocular”, the “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company committed to improving vision in the real world through the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for retinal diseases and other eye conditions, today announced that more than 300 patients have been randomized in the SOL-1 Phase 3 trial for AXPAXLI™ (axitinib intravitreal implant, also known as OTX-TKI), and the trial is expected to close randomization this week. This is the first registrational clinical trial of AXPAXLI in wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), which remains on track to report topline data in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\n“SOL-1 reaching target randomization in 2024 is a landmark event for Ocular. SOL-1 is an important trial for patients and the retina community as there is an urgent unmet need for durable therapies capable of maintaining visual acuity and improving long-term outcomes. Today’s milestone brings us one step closer to our goal of delivering the first wet AMD therapy potentially capable of being dosed as infrequently as every six to nine months. Achieving this progress reflects our positive engagement with the retina community, the dedication of our clinical sites, and the demand for a durable treatment option for wet AMD,” said **Pravin U. Dugel, MD, Executive Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer** of Ocular Therapeutix.\n\n**Dr. Dugel** continued, “Thanks to the excellent momentum from SOL-1, we recently ‘flipped the switch’, allowing active clinical sites to enroll patients directly into our second registrational study in wet AMD, SOL-R, further accelerating its pace of enrollment. Thanks to the palpable enthusiasm from the investigators and study site teams, we continue to make excellent progress with the enrollment of SOL-R, with a steady focus on our overall mission of improving vision for patients.”\n\nOcular’s second registrational clinical trial, the SOL-R repeat dosing trial, has benefited from the recruitment momentum of SOL-1. Earlier this quarter, Ocular allowed investigators to enroll their patients directly into SOL-R, whereas patients were previously required to be a SOL-1 loading or randomization failure. With all active clinical trial sites now enrolling subjects directly into SOL-R, the trial has seen an acceleration in recruitment which will be further amplified by an expected bolus of subjects that were enrolled but not ultimately randomized into SOL-1 because randomization targets are met. The Company continues to activate additional clinical trial sites worldwide to further bolster the speed of SOL-R enrollment.\n\n**Arshad M. Khanani, MD, MA, FASRS, Director of Clinic Research at Sierra Eye Associates, Reno, Nevada** commented, “I am thrilled to see the rapid completion of enrollment in the SOL-1 pivotal trial as it demonstrates strong enthusiasm among investigators and patients to contribute to the development of AXPAXLI, a potentially more durable treatment option for wet AMD. The SOL-1 and SOL-R pivotal trials, designed to inform real-world treatment decisions, have the potential to provide a robust data package that will help retina specialists understand the durability, repeatability, and flexibility of AXPAXLI dosing. One of the many compelling features of the SOL program is that my patients who were not ultimately randomized into SOL-1 have an opportunity to be seamlessly enrolled into SOL-R. I am looking forward to continuing to recruit patients for the pivotal SOL-R trial and appreciate the Ocular team’s dedication to patient care with careful ongoing attention to the rigorous standards for clinical trial execution expected by the retina community.”\n\nOcular’s wet AMD registrational program for AXPAXLI is comprised of two complementary studies, strategically designed with the intent of de-risking clinical outcomes, aligning with regulatory standards, enhancing each other’s enrollment, and providing a broad evaluation of AXPAXLI’s durability, repeatability, and flexibility. SOL-1 is a superiority study being conducted under a Special Protocol Agreement (SPA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In a written Type C response, the FDA agreed that the SOL-R non-inferiority study should be appropriate as a second adequate and well-controlled study to support a potential New Drug Application (NDA).\n\n**About AXPAXLI** AXPAXLI™ (axitinib intravitreal implant, also known as OTX-TKI) is an investigational, bioresorbable, hydrogel implant incorporating axitinib, a small molecule, multi-target, tyrosine kinase inhibitor with anti-angiogenic properties, being evaluated for the treatment of wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy, and other retinal diseases.\n\n**About the SOL-1 Study** The registrational Phase 3 SOL-1 trial (NCT06223958) is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AXPAXLI in a multi-center, double-masked, randomized (1:1), parallel group study that involves more than 100 clinical trial sites located in the U.S. and Argentina. The trial is intended to randomize approximately 300 evaluable treatment-naïve subjects with a diagnosis of wet AMD in the study eye.\n\nThe superiority study has an eight-week loading segment prior to randomization, a 9-month treatment segment, and a safety follow-up. During the loading segment, subjects who have 20/80 vision or better and who satisfy other enrollment criteria receive two doses of aflibercept (2 mg) at Week -8 and Week -4. Eligible subjects who achieve best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/20 at Day 1 or gain at least 10 early treatment diabetic retinopathy (ETDRS) letters at Day 1 are then randomized to receive a single dose of AXPAXLI or a single dose of aflibercept (2 mg) and assessed monthly for the duration of the study. The clinical trial protocol requires that, during the study, subjects in any arm meeting pre-specified rescue criteria will receive a supplemental dose of aflibercept (2 mg).\n\nThe primary endpoint of SOL-1 is the proportion of subjects who maintain visual acuity, defined as a loss of <15 ETDRS letters of BCVA, at Week 36. The study is being conducted under a Special Protocol Agreement (SPA) with the FDA.\n\n**About the SOL-R Study** The registrational Phase 3 SOL-R trial (NCT06495918) is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AXPAXLI in a multi-center, double-masked, randomized (2:2:1), three-arm study that will involve sites located in the U.S. and the rest of the world. The trial is intended to randomize approximately 825 subjects who are treatment-naïve or were diagnosed with wet AMD in the study eye within three months prior to enrollment.\n\nThe non-inferiority study reflects a patient enrichment strategy that includes multiple loading doses of aflibercept (2 mg) and monitoring to exclude subjects with significant retinal fluid fluctuations. Subjects in the first arm receive a single dose of AXPAXLI at Day 1 and are re-dosed at Week 24. Subjects in the second arm receive aflibercept (2 mg) on-label every 8 weeks. Subjects in the third arm receive a single dose of aflibercept (8 mg) at Day 1 and are re-dosed at Week 24, aligned with the AXPAXLI treatment arm for adequate masking. Subjects in any arm that meet pre-specified rescue criteria will receive a supplemental dose of aflibercept (2 mg).\n\nThe primary endpoint of SOL-R is non-inferiority in mean BCVA change from baseline between the AXPAXLI and on-label aflibercept (2 mg) arms at one year. In a written Type C response received in August 2024, the FDA agreed that the SOL-R repeat dosing wet AMD study should be appropriate as an adequate and well-controlled study in support of a potential New Drug Application and product label.\n\n**About Wet AMD** Wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) is a leading cause of severe, irreversible vision loss affecting approximately 14 million individuals globally and 1.65 million in the United States alone (2023 Market Scope® Retinal Pharmaceuticals Market Report). Wet AMD causes vision loss due to abnormal new blood vessel growth and hyperpermeability and associated retinal vascularity in the macula, which is primarily stimulated by local upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Without prompt and continuous treatment to control this exudative activity, patients develop irreversible vision loss. With proper treatment, patients may maintain visual function for a period of time and may temporarily regain lost vision. Challenges with current therapies include pulsatile, repeated intraocular injections, treatment-related adverse events and up to 40% patient discontinuation with continued disease progression. Taken together, these factors lead to undertreatment and a lack of long-term vision improvement for patients.\n\n**About Ocular Therapeutix, Inc.** Ocular Therapeutix, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company committed to improving vision in the real world through the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for retinal diseases and other eye conditions.

(NASDAQ: OCUL, “Ocular”, the “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company committed to improving vision in the real world through the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for retinal diseases and other eye conditions, today announced accelerated timelines for the SOL-1 Phase 3 registrational clinical trial of AXPAXLI in wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). The Company now expects the SOL-1 study to be fully enrolled with all patients randomized by the end of 2024. This is meaningfully ahead of prior guidance to complete enrollment by the end of the first quarter of 2025. With this update, topline data from the SOL-1 trial are now expected during the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nSOL-1 is a superiority study being conducted under a Special Protocol Agreement (SPA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Once a subject is enrolled in the study, they receive two loading doses of aflibercept (2 mg), one at Week -8 and another at Week -4. Subjects who achieve pre-defined visual acuity measures are then randomized (1:1) on Day 1 to receive either a single AXPAXLI implant (450 µg) or a single aflibercept (2 mg) injection. The Company plans to randomize approximately 300 subjects in the trial. The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects who maintain visual acuity, defined as <15 ETDRS letters of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) loss, at Week 36.\n\nOcular expects the ongoing Phase 3 clinical program, comprised of the SOL-1 superiority study and SOL-R repeat-dosing non-inferiority study, if successfully completed, would form the basis of the Company’s regulatory filing for AXPAXLI for the treatment of wet AMD.\n\n“Thanks to our phenomenal team and their relentless dedication, we are thrilled to announce the acceleration of our timeline for SOL-1, which is now expected to complete randomization by the end of 2024. With this update, we can now confirm that we expect topline data to be available during the fourth quarter of 2025,” said **Pravin U. Dugel, MD, Executive Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer** of Ocular Therapeutix. “The exceptional pace of SOL-1 recruitment reflects the strong continued interest from investigators and patients in AXPAXLI’s potential to significantly alter the wet AMD treatment paradigm. In total, the Ocular team activated over 100 clinical trial sites for SOL-1, and we are extremely grateful for the continued high-quality collaboration of our outstanding study sites. We are especially proud to provide this update given the initial perception that SOL-1 was going to be a difficult trial to enroll. Based on our feedback to date, there is even stronger enthusiasm to enroll patients in our repeat dosing study, SOL-R, and we believe the strength of our clinical team will be instrumental to the execution of both trials. This increasing momentum brings us closer to our goal of improving the lives of patients suffering from wet AMD.”\n\n**David A. Eichenbaum, MD, FASRS, Director of Research, Retina Vitreous Associates of Florida** commented, “Patients with wet AMD need treatment options that offer more durable improvements in visual outcomes. SOL-1 enrollment has advanced at such a rapid pace because AXPAXLI is seeking to directly address this critical unmet need, offering the promise of a significantly reduced treatment burden. SOL-1 and SOL-R are thoughtfully designed complementary trials, which have the potential to deliver meaningful insights on durability, repeat dosing, and comparability to standard-of-care treatment**,** while meeting FDA regulatory requirements. With SOL-1 soon to complete randomization, I am excited to now enroll patients in SOL-R. I believe patients in the SOL-R study will take comfort in knowing they are receiving an active treatment, regardless of which arm they are randomized to, while the study design mitigates the risk of unmasking from sham injections. I have enjoyed collaborating with the new clinical team at Ocular, whose dedication to patient care, regulatory alignment, and commitment to optimizing the clinical trial process creates an exceptional experience for patients and investigators. Assuming successful trial outcomes and approval, AXPAXLI would offer the promise of a durable treatment option without compromising the rigorous standards for safety and efficacy that the retina community has come to expect.”\n\n**About AXPAXLI** AXPAXLI™ (axitinib intravitreal implant, also known as OTX-TKI) is an investigational, bioresorbable, hydrogel implant incorporating axitinib, a small molecule, multi-target, tyrosine kinase inhibitor with anti-angiogenic properties, being evaluated for the treatment of wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy, and other retinal diseases.\n\n**About the SOL-1 Study** The registrational Phase 3 SOL-1 trial (NCT06223958) is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AXPAXLI in a multi-center, double-masked, randomized (1:1), parallel group study that involves sites located in the U.S. and Argentina.

(NASDAQ: OCUL, “Ocular”, the “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company committed to improving vision in the real world through the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for retinal diseases and other eye conditions, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and provided recent business highlights, including an update on the Phase 3 registrational program for AXPAXLI™ (axitinib intravitreal implant, also known as OTX-TKI) in development for wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD).\n\n“2024 has been a year of significant change and tremendous execution at Ocular, but this is all in anticipation of what’s ahead. We are making outstanding progress on enrollment in the two complementary studies in our registrational program for AXPAXLI in wet AMD, SOL-1 and SOL-R. I’m thrilled to share that SOL-1 has reached a key enrollment milestone, as we have now ‘flipped the switch’ to allow direct enrollment of subjects into SOL-R. We expect to complete SOL-1 randomization by year-end, with topline data to follow in the fourth quarter of 2025. As SOL-1 quickly approaches complete randomization, eligible subjects who are not ultimately randomized can seamlessly enroll in SOL-R, creating a streamlined and efficient pathway that capitalizes on recruitment momentum at our clinical sites,” said **Pravin U. Dugel, MD, Executive Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer** of Ocular Therapeutix.\n\n**Dr. Dugel** continued, “SOL-1 and SOL-R were strategically designed with the goals of de-risking clinical outcomes, aligning with regulatory standards, enhancing each other’s enrollment, and providing a broad evaluation of AXPAXLI’s durability, repeatability, and flexibility. Thanks to the team’s strong execution, attention to patient care, and long-standing relationships in the retina community, we have enrolled SOL-1 faster than we expected and continue to build enthusiasm for SOL-R. Supported by our dedicated team and strong financial resources, Ocular is on solid footing as we head towards what we expect will be an important milestone year in 2025.”\n\n**Recent Achievements and Upcoming Milestones:**\n\n  * **Accelerated timelines for SOL-1 AXPAXLI registrational trial (Phase 3, wet AMD).** The exceptional pace of recruitment in the SOL-1 superiority trial is expected to result in full randomization by the end of 2024. This is meaningfully ahead of prior guidance. Topline data from the SOL-1 trial are now expected during the fourth quarter of 2025. The study is being conducted under a Special Protocol Agreement (SPA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n  * **Direct enrollment open for SOL-R AXPAXLI repeat dosing registrational trial (Phase 3, wet AMD).** Initial subjects enrolling in SOL-R were previously required to be loading or randomization failures in SOL-1. As SOL-1 nears the completion of randomization, physicians can now directly enroll eligible subjects into SOL-R. This trial was designed to complement SOL-1 with repeat and flexible dosing while providing commercially meaningful data. In a written Type C response, the FDA confirmed in August of this year that the SOL-R trial should be appropriate for use as Ocular’s second adequate and well-controlled study to support a potential New Drug Application (NDA) and product label for wet AMD.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024, Financial Results:**\n\n**Total cash and cash equivalents** were $427.2 million as of September 30, 2024. Based on current plans and related estimates of anticipated cash inflows from DEXTENZA®, the Company believes that its current cash balance is sufficient to support its planned expenses, obligations, and capital expenditure requirements into 2028.\n\n**Total net revenue** was $15.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 2.3% increase over total net revenue of $15.1 million in the comparable period in 2023. This increase was driven by increased gross revenues from DEXTENZA sales offset by higher gross-to-net provisions in the 2024 period compared to the prior comparable period. The Company expects full-year 2024 total net revenues for DEXTENZA to be between $62.0 million and $67.0 million, compared to $57.9 million reported for 2023. Total net revenue includes both gross DEXTENZA product revenue, net of discounts, rebates, and returns, which the Company refers to as net product revenue, and collaboration revenue.\n\n**Research and development expenses** for the third quarter of 2024 were $37.1 million versus $15.0 million for the comparable period in 2023, reflecting an increase in overall clinical expenses associated with product development programs, specifically the SOL-1 and SOL-R Phase 3 clinical trials, as well as additional personnel and professional services to support these clinical trials.\n\n**Selling and marketing expenses** were $10.6 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $9.3 million for the comparable quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting an increase in professional fees and personnel costs, including stock-based compensation.\n\n**General and administrative expenses** were $12.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 versus $8.6 million for the comparable quarter of 2023, primarily due to an increase in professional fees and personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation.\n\n**Net loss for the third quarter of 2024** was $(36.5) million, or a net loss of $(0.22) per share on both a basic and diluted basis, compared to a net loss of $(0.5) million, or a net loss of $(0.01) per share on a basic basis and $(0.25) per share on a diluted basis, for the comparable period in 2023. The net loss in the third quarter of 2024 included a $7.6 million non-cash gain attributable to the change in the fair value of the derivative liability associated with the Barings Credit Facility, partially offset by $0.5 million expense related to royalty fees under the Barings Credit Facility, compared to a $7.1 million non-cash gain, net, attributable to the changes in the fair value of the derivative liability associated with the Barings Credit Facility and the derivative liability associated with the Company's convertible notes, partially offset by $0.4 million expense related to royalty fees under the Barings Credit Facility, for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Outstanding shares** as of November 11, 2024, were approximately 157.2 million.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information:** Ocular Therapeutix will host a conference call and webcast today at 8:00 AM ET to discuss recent business progress and third quarter 2024 financial results. To access the call, please dial: _1 (877) 407-9039 (United States)_ or _1 (201) 689-8470 (International)_.

A replay of the webcast will be archived for at least 30 days.\n\n**About AXPAXLI** AXPAXLI™ (axitinib intravitreal implant, also known as OTX-TKI) is an investigational, bioresorbable, hydrogel implant incorporating axitinib, a small molecule, multi-target, tyrosine kinase inhibitor with anti-angiogenic properties, being evaluated for the treatment of wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy, and other retinal diseases.\n\n**About the SOL-1 Study** The registrational Phase 3 SOL-1 trial (NCT06223958) is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AXPAXLI in a multi-center, double-masked, randomized (1:1), parallel group study that involves more than 100 clinical trial sites located in the U.S. and Argentina. The trial is intended to randomize approximately 300 evaluable treatment-naïve subjects with a diagnosis of wet AMD in the study eye.\n\nThe superiority study has an eight-week loading segment prior to randomization, a 9-month treatment segment, and a safety follow-up. During the loading segment, subjects who have 20/80 vision or better and who satisfy other enrollment criteria receive two doses of aflibercept (2 mg) at Week -8 and Week -4. Eligible subjects who achieve best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/20 at Day 1 or gain at least 10 early treatment diabetic retinopathy (ETDRS) letters at Day 1 are then randomized to receive a single dose of AXPAXLI or a single dose of aflibercept (2 mg) and assessed monthly for the duration of the study. The clinical trial protocol requires that, during the study, subjects in any arm meeting pre-specified rescue criteria will receive a supplemental dose of aflibercept (2 mg).\n\nThe primary endpoint of SOL-1 is the proportion of subjects who maintain visual acuity, defined as a loss of <15 ETDRS letters of BCVA, at Week 36. The study is being conducted under a Special Protocol Agreement (SPA) with the FDA.\n\n**About the SOL-R Study** The registrational Phase 3 SOL-R trial (NCT06495918) is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AXPAXLI in a multi-center, double-masked, randomized (2:2:1), three-arm study that will involve sites located in the U.S. and the rest of the world. The trial is intended to randomize approximately 825 subjects who are treatment-naïve or were diagnosed with wet AMD in the study eye within three months prior to enrollment.\n\nThe non-inferiority study reflects a patient enrichment strategy that includes multiple loading doses of aflibercept (2 mg) and monitoring to exclude subjects with significant retinal fluid fluctuations. Subjects in the first arm receive a single dose of AXPAXLI at Day 1 and are re-dosed at Week 24. Subjects in the second arm receive aflibercept (2 mg) on-label every 8 weeks. Subjects in the third arm receive a single dose of aflibercept (8 mg) at Day 1 and are re-dosed at Week 24, aligned with the AXPAXLI treatment arm for adequate masking. Subjects in any arm that meet pre-specified rescue criteria will receive a supplemental dose of aflibercept (2 mg).\n\nThe primary endpoint of SOL-R is non-inferiority in mean BCVA change from baseline between the AXPAXLI and on-label aflibercept (2 mg) arms at one year. In a written Type C response received in August 2024, the FDA agreed that the SOL-R repeat dosing wet AMD study should be appropriate as an adequate and well-controlled study in support of a potential New Drug Application and product label. \n\n**About Wet AMD** Wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) is a leading cause of severe, irreversible vision loss affecting approximately 14 million individuals globally and 1.65 million in the United States alone (2023 Market Scope® Retinal Pharmaceuticals Market Report). Wet AMD causes vision loss due to abnormal new blood vessel growth and hyperpermeability and associated retinal vascularity in the macula, which is primarily stimulated by local upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Without prompt and continuous treatment to control this exudative activity, patients develop irreversible vision loss. With proper treatment, patients may maintain visual function for a period of time and may temporarily regain lost vision. Challenges with current therapies include pulsatile, repeated intraocular injections, treatment-related adverse events and up to 40% patient discontinuation with continued disease progression. Taken together, these factors lead to undertreatment and a lack of long-term vision improvement for patients.\n\n**About Ocular Therapeutix, Inc.** Ocular Therapeutix, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company committed to improving vision in the real world through the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for retinal diseases and other eye conditions.

Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors. Such forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company’s preclinical and clinical development programs, future results, performance or achievements to differ significantly from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, the timing and costs involved in commercializing any product or product candidate that receives regulatory approval; the ability to retain regulatory approval of any product or product candidate that receives regulatory approval; the initiation, design, timing, conduct and outcomes of ongoing and planned clinical trials; the risk that the FDA will not agree with the Company’s interpretation of the written agreement under the Special Protocol Assessment for the SOL-1 trial; the risk that the FDA may not agree that the protocol and statistical analysis plan of SOL-R or the data generated by the SOL-1 and SOL-R trials support marketing approval, even if the trials are successful; uncertainty as to whether the data from earlier clinical trials will be predictive of the data of later clinical trials, particularly later clinical trials that have a different design or utilize a different formulation than the earlier trials, whether preliminary or interim data from a clinical trial will be predictive of final data from such trial, or whether data from a clinical trial assessing a product candidate for one indication will be predictive of results in other indications; availability of data from clinical trials and expectations for regulatory submissions and approvals; the Company’s scientific approach and general development progress; uncertainties inherent in estimating the Company’s cash runway, future expenses and other financial results, including its ability to fund future operations, including clinical trials; the Company’s existing indebtedness and the ability of the Company’s creditors to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness upon the occurrence of certain events of default; the Company’s ability to enter into strategic alliances or generate additional funding on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all; and other factors discussed in the “Risk Factors” section contained in the Company’s quarterly and annual reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
