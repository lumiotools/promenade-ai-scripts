(Nasdaq/NGS: PNFP) reported net income per diluted common share of $1.86 for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2024, compared to net income per diluted common share of $1.69 for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2023, an increase of approximately 10.1 percent. Net income per diluted common share was $4.08 for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024, compared to $5.99 for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 31.9 percent. \n\nAfter considering the adjustments noted in the table below, net income per diluted common share was $1.86 for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2024, compared to $1.79 for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2023, and $1.63 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, an annualized linked-quarter growth rate of 56.4 percent. Net income per diluted common share adjusted for the items noted in the table below was $5.02 for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024, compared to $5.34 for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023. \n\n**Three months ended** |  **Nine months ended**  \n---|---  \n**Sept. 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **Sept. 30, 2023** |  **Sept. 30, 2024** |  **Sept. 30, 2023**  \nDiluted earnings per common share  |  $  |  1.86  |  $  |  0.64  |  $  |  1.69  |  $  |  4.08  |  $  |  5.99   \nAdjustments, net of tax (1):   \nInvestment losses on sales of securities, net  |  —  |  0.71  |  0.10  |  0.71  |  0.19   \nGain on sale of fixed assets as a result of sale-leaseback transaction  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (0.84  |  )   \nRecognition of mortgage servicing asset  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (0.12  |  )  |  —   \nFDIC special assessment  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  0.07  |  —   \nFees related to terminating agreement to resell securities previously purchased and professional fees associated with capital optimization initiatives  |  —  |  0.28  |  —  |  0.28  |  —   \nDiluted earnings per common share after adjustments  |  $  |  1.86  |  $  |  1.63  |  $  |  1.79  |  $  |  5.02  |  $  |  5.34   \n(1): Adjustments include tax effect calculated using a marginal tax rate of 25.00 percent for all periods presented.   \n  \n\"The third quarter was another outstanding quarter for our firm, highlighted by double-digit linked-quarter annualized growth in earning assets, nearly double-digit linked-quarter annualized core deposit growth, and an expanding net interest margin,” said M. Terry Turner, Pinnacle's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Not only am I excited that we grew diluted earnings per share to $1.86 in the quarter, but this growth has also been largely built on our longstanding ability to leverage our differentiated service levels to take market share in our advantaged Southeastern markets. The recently released 2024 FDIC deposit rankings again show that our firm continues to gain market share across our footprint and our client satisfaction scores continue to outperform our larger competitors in virtually every category according to Coalition Greenwich. Lastly, and importantly, Forbes recently reported that our firm was ranked the third best place to work among financial services and insurance firms in the United States, which is ultimately the foundation of all our success. \n\n\"Our robust hiring continues, as we have added 126 new revenue producers thus far this year. Our hiring pipelines remain very active heading into the last quarter of 2024, and we fully expect 2025 to yield double-digit growth as well. I also believe we are well positioned to capitalize on what appears to be a declining interest rate environment. Should the yield curve find its way to a more favorable slope in the coming quarters, this could result in an even better 2025 revenue outlook for our firm.\" \n\n**BALANCE SHEET GROWTH AND LIQUIDITY:**\n\nTotal assets at Sept. 30, 2024, were $50.7 billion, an increase of approximately $1.3 billion from June 30, 2024, and $3.2 billion from Sept. 30, 2023, reflecting a linked-quarter annualized increase of 10.8 percent and a year-over-year increase of 6.7 percent.

Importantly, our C&I and owner-occupied commercial real estate loan portfolios grew by $705.6 million, while our non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio decreased by $186.9 million. We are pleased to report that our exposure to construction and land development loans in relation to our total risk-based capital decreased to 68.2 percent, which is now below our target of 70 percent. It is our intent to continue reducing our exposure to non-owner occupied commercial real estate, multifamily and construction and land development loans from its level at Sept. 30, 2024 of 243.3 percent of total risk-based capital to below 225 percent. We believe this target will also be achieved within the next few quarters. As a result, we are beginning to consider new projects with our high-quality developers in our markets. During this time of reducing our exposure to non-owner occupied CRE, our credit experience in these segments has been remarkable and a great tribute to our client selection and credit underwriting process. \n\n\"A real highlight for 2024 has been our focus on growing core deposits. Our core deposits are up more than $2.0 billion so far this year, and our pipelines point toward expected continued growth in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we have seen our noninterest bearing deposits grow, with end-of-period growth at Sept. 30, 2024 up $296.5 million over the previous quarter end, a linked-quarter annualized growth rate of 15.0 percent. Over the last two years, we have invested in 16 new office locations, representing a 13.3 percent increase in outlets. So, we expect this significant investment in new people and facilities should enable us to continue to grow our core funding.\" \n\n**PRE-TAX, PRE-PROVISION NET REVENUE (PPNR) GROWTH:**\n\nPre-tax, pre-provision net revenues (PPNR) for the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024, were $207.4 million and $488.4 million, respectively, an increase of 6.5 percent and a decrease of 26.3 percent, respectively, from the $194.8 million and $662.4 million recognized in the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023, respectively. \n\n**Three months ended** |  **Nine months ended**  \n---|---  \n**Sept. 30,** |  **Sept. 30,**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **% change** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **% change**  \nRevenues:   \nNet interest income  |  $  |  351,504  |  $  |  317,242  |  10.8  |  %  |  $  |  1,001,800  |  $  |  944,866  |  6.0  |  %   \nNoninterest income  |  115,242  |  90,797  |  26.9  |  %  |  259,633  |  354,165  |  (26.7  |  )%   \nTotal revenues  |  466,746  |  408,039  |  14.4  |  %  |  1,261,433  |  1,299,031  |  (2.9  |  )%   \nNoninterest expense  |  259,319  |  213,233  |  21.6  |  %  |  773,073  |  636,601  |  21.4  |  %   \nPre-tax, pre-provision net revenue (PPNR)  |  207,427  |  194,806  |  6.5  |  %  |  488,360  |  662,430  |  (26.3  |  )%   \nAdjustments:   \nInvestment losses on sales of securities, net  |  —  |  9,727  |  100.0  |  %  |  72,103  |  19,688  |  >100%   \nGain on the sale of fixed assets as a result of sale leaseback  |  —  |  —  |  NA  |  —  |  (85,692  |  )  |  (100.0  |  )%   \nRecognition of mortgage servicing asset  |  —  |  —  |  NA  |  (11,812  |  )  |  —  |  100.0  |  %   \nORE expense  |  56  |  33  |  69.7  |  %  |  162  |  190  |  (14.7  |  )%   \nFDIC special assessment  |  —  |  —  |  NA  |  7,250  |  —  |  100.0  |  %   \nFees related to terminating agreement to resell securities previously purchased and professional fees associated with capital optimization initiatives  |  —  |  —  |  NA  |  28,400  |  —  |  100.0  |  %   \nAdjusted PPNR  |  $  |  207,483  |  $  |  204,566  |  1.4  |  %  |  $  |  584,463  |  $  |  596,616  |  (2.0  |  )%   \n  \n**Three months ended** |  **Nine months ended**  \n---|---  \n**Sept. 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **Sept. 30, 2023** |  **Sept. 30, 2024** |  **Sept. 30, 2023**  \nNet interest margin  |  3.22  |  %  |  3.14  |  %  |  3.06  |  %  |  3.14  |  %  |  3.22  |  %   \nEfficiency ratio  |  55.56  |  %  |  74.04  |  %  |  52.26  |  %  |  61.29  |  %  |  49.01  |  %   \nReturn on average assets  |  1.15  |  %  |  0.41  |  %  |  1.08  |  %  |  0.85  |  %  |  1.35  |  %   \nReturn on average tangible common equity (TCE)  |  13.61  |  %  |  4.90  |  %  |  13.43  |  %  |  10.24  |  %  |  16.62  |  %   \nAverage loan to deposit ratio  |  84.99  |  %  |  84.95  |  %  |  82.80  |  %  |  84.89  |  %  |  83.88  |  %   \n  \nNet interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $351.5 million, compared to $332.3 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $317.2 million for the third quarter of 2023, a year-over-year growth rate of 10.8 percent.

The increase in wealth management revenues was attributable to several factors, but primarily is the result of an increase in capacity with more revenue producers and the placement of those producers in the areas of the firm's most recent strategic market expansions. \n  * Income from the firm's investment in Banker's Healthcare Group (BHG) was $16.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $18.7 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $25.0 million for the third quarter of 2023, a year-over-year decline of 34.4 percent. \n    * BHG's loan originations were $989 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $871 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $1.0 billion in the third quarter of 2023. \n    * Loans sold to BHG's community bank partners were approximately $521 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to approximately $467 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $435 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n    * BHG reserves for on-balance sheet loan losses were $237 million, or 9.1 percent of loans held for investment at Sept. 30, 2024, compared to 9.9 percent at June 30, 2024 and 6.4 percent at Sept. 30, 2023. \n    * BHG increased its accrual for estimated losses attributable to loan substitutions and prepayments to $454 million, or 6.2 percent of the unpaid balances on loans that were previously purchased by BHG's community bank network, at Sept. 30, 2024, compared to $415 million, or 5.9 percent, at June 30, 2024 and $350.3 million, or 5.5 percent, at Sept. 30, 2023. \n  * Other noninterest income was $48.6 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2024, an increase of $6.8 million from the second quarter of 2024 and $10.6 million from the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2024 other noninterest income was positively impacted by increased bank-owned life insurance revenues attributable to restructuring activities initiated last year, increased customer swap revenues and fair value adjustments related to the firm’s interest in other equity investments. \n\n\n\nNoninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $259.3 million, compared to $271.4 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $213.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**Three months ended** |  **Linked-quarter Annualized % Change** |  **Three months ended** |  **Yr-over-Yr****% Change**  \n---|---|---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **Sept. 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **Sept. 30, 2023**  \nNoninterest expense  |  $  |  259,319  |  $  |  271,389  |  (17.8  |  )%  |  $  |  213,233  |  21.6  |  %   \nLess:   \nORE expense  |  56  |  22  |  >100  |  %  |  33  |  69.7  |  %   \nFees related to terminating agreement to resell securities previously purchased and professional fees associated with capital optimization initiatives  |  —  |  28,400  |  (100.0  |  )%  |  —  |  NA   \nAdjusted noninterest expense  |  $  |  259,263  |  $  |  242,967  |  26.8  |  %  |  $  |  213,200  |  21.6  |  %   \n  \n  * Salaries and employee benefits were $160.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $150.1 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $130.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 22.9 percent. \n    * Full-time equivalent associates increased to 3,516.5 at Sept. 30, 2024 from 3,469.0 at June 30, 2024 and 3,329.5 at Sept. 30, 2023, a year-over-year increase of 5.6 percent. \n    * Cash and equity incentive costs in the third quarter of 2024 were approximately $5.2 million higher than the second quarter of 2024 due to the firm anticipating an increased payout percentage for its cash incentive plan than was anticipated at June 30, 2024 and $15.0 million higher than the amounts recorded in the third quarter of 2023 due to an increased number of personnel and the anticipated payout percentage for 2024 being higher than what was anticipated for the 2023 award at Sept. 30, 2023. \n  * Equipment and occupancy costs were $42.6 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $41.0 million in the second quarter of 2024, reflecting an increase of 3.7 percent, and $36.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 15.3 percent. Comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2023, several factors contributed to the increase of equipment and occupancy costs, including new equipment and facilities and rent escalators on various properties. \n  * Noninterest expense categories, other than those specifically noted above, were $56.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $80.2 million in the second quarter of 2024, reflecting a decrease of 29.6 percent, and $46.0 million in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 22.9 percent. Several factors contributed to the decrease in other noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024, including recognition of the $28.4 million fee related to terminating an agreement to resell securities previously purchased and professional fees associated with the firm's capital optimization initiatives completed in the second quarter of 2024 partially offset by increased lending-related expenses associated with the loss protection fee for the credit default swap which was also entered into in the second quarter of 2024. \n\n\n\n\"We anticipated margin expansion in the third quarter, due primarily to the securities portfolio restructuring initiatives we executed during the second quarter,\" said Harold R. Carpenter, Pinnacle's Chief Financial Officer. \"Also during the third quarter, our relationship managers focused on mitigating the impact of the recent reduction in the Federal funds rate. We are pleased to report that our deposit pricing was well contained throughout the quarter, aided by the stability of our noninterest bearing deposit balances. Furthermore, from Aug. 31, 2024, a few weeks prior to the FOMC meeting, through Oct. 11, 2024, our deposit pricing has decreased by 28 basis points, while our loan yields have dropped by 24 basis points, signaling to us that we are doing quite well in managing our net interest spreads here in the initial stages of this new interest rate environment. \n\n\"We are again very excited about our core fee performance during the third quarter. Expanding our fee revenues has been a key initiative for us this year, with many of our business lines experiencing the best performance in the history of our firm, particularly with respect to our wealth management unit. Fee revenues from BHG were less in the third quarter than we anticipated at the end of the second quarter, with BHG’s contribution now representing approximately 8 percent of our third quarter pre-tax, pre-provision revenues. \n\n\"Our expense results for the third quarter came in slightly higher than we originally anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, with most of this attributable to personnel costs. Our hiring has been better than anticipated as it continues to be a strong recruiting year for our firm, which should serve to bolster revenues in future periods. Another contributor to increased expense for the third quarter was that we increased our accrual for annual cash incentive plan payouts to approximately 90 percent of target level payouts as of the end of the third quarter.\" \n\n**CAPITAL, SOUNDNESS AND TAXES:**\n\n**As of**  \n---  \n**Sept. 30, 2024** |  **Dec. 31, 2023** |  **Sept. 30, 2023**  \nShareholders' equity to total assets  |  12.5  |  %  |  12.6  |  %  |  12.3  |  %   \nTangible common equity to tangible assets  |  8.7  |  %  |  8.6  |  %  |  8.2  |  %   \nBook value per common share  |  $  |  79.33  |  $  |  75.80  |  $  |  73.23   \nTangible book value per common share  |  $  |  55.12  |  $  |  51.38  |  $  |  48.78   \nAnnualized net loan charge-offs to avg. loans (1) |  0.21  |  %  |  0.17  |  %  |  0.23  |  %   \nNonperforming assets to total loans, ORE and other nonperforming assets (NPAs)  |  0.35  |  %  |  0.27  |  %  |  0.14  |  %   \nClassified asset ratio (Pinnacle Bank) (2) |  3.92  |  %  |  5.22  |  %  |  4.59  |  %   \nConstruction and land development loans as a percentage of total capital (3) |  68.20  |  %  |  84.20  |  %  |  83.10  |  %   \nConstruction and land development, non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multi-family loans as a percentage of total capital (3) |  243.30  |  %  |  259.00  |  %  |  256.40  |  %   \nAllowance for credit losses (ACL) to total loans  |  1.14  |  %  |  1.08  |  %  |  1.08  |  %   \n  \n(1):  |  Annualized net loan charge-offs to average loans ratios are computed by annualizing quarterly net loan charge-offs and dividing the result by average loans for the quarter.   \n---|---  \n(2):  |  Classified assets as a percentage of Tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses.   \n(3): |  Calculated using the same guidelines as are used in the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's Uniform Bank Performance Report.   \n  \n\"Net charge-offs to average loans for the third quarter of 2024 were 0.21 percent, down from 0.27 percent in the prior quarter,\" Carpenter said. \"Net charge-offs in the third quarter included a partial charge-off of a commercial and industrial loan of approximately $9.0 million. The remaining balance on this loan, which was previously classified, was downgraded to nonaccrual during the third quarter, which was the primary reason for the increase in nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets from the second quarter. In summary, from a credit perspective, thus far this year, we believe our credit performance has remained strong all year long. \n\n\"Lastly, our book value per common share increased during the quarter from $77.15 to $79.33, an annualized linked-quarter increase of 11.3 percent. Concurrently, our tangible book value per common share increased from $52.92 to $55.12 during the third quarter, a linked-quarter annualized increase of 16.6 percent. Additionally, the firm's common equity Tier one risk-based capital ratio increased to 10.8 percent at Sept. 30, 2024 from 10.3 percent at Dec. 31, 2023, which we also consider a great accomplishment.\" \n\n**BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARES DIVIDENDS**\n\nOn Oct. 15, 2024, Pinnacle Financial's Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per common share to be paid on Nov. 29, 2024 to common shareholders of record as of the close of business on Nov. 1, 2024.

Pinnacle Financial disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this press release, which speak only as of the date hereof, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Matters**\n\nThis release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, without limitation, total revenues, net income to common shareholders, earnings per diluted common share, revenue per diluted common share, PPNR, efficiency ratio, noninterest expense, noninterest income and the ratio of noninterest expense to average assets, excluding in certain instances the impact of expenses related to other real estate owned, gains or losses on sale of investment securities, gains associated with the sale-leaseback transaction completed in the second quarter of 2023, losses on the restructuring of certain bank owned life insurance (BOLI) contracts, charges related to the FDIC special assessment, income associated with the recognition of a mortgage servicing asset in the first quarter of 2024, fees related to terminating an agreement to resell securities previously purchased and professional fees associated with capital optimization initiatives in the second quarter of 2024 and other matters for the accounting periods presented. This release may also contain certain other non-GAAP capital ratios and performance measures that exclude the impact of goodwill and core deposit intangibles associated with Pinnacle Financial's acquisitions of BNC, Avenue Bank, Magna Bank, CapitalMark Bank & Trust, Mid-America Bancshares, Inc., Cavalry Bancorp, Inc. and other acquisitions which collectively are less material to the non-GAAP measure as well as the impact of Pinnacle Financial's Series B Preferred Stock. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, these non-GAAP financial measures, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies. \n\nPinnacle Financial believes that these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate making period-to-period comparisons and are meaningful indications of its operating performance. In addition, because intangible assets such as goodwill and the core deposit intangible, and the other items excluded each vary extensively from company to company, Pinnacle Financial believes that the presentation of this information allows investors to more easily compare Pinnacle Financial's results to the results of other companies.

AND SUBSIDIARIES**  \n---  \n**SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA – UNAUDITED**  \n1. Ratios are presented on an annualized basis.   \n2. Net interest margin is the result of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis divided by average interest earning assets.   \n3. Total revenue is equal to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income.   \n4. Efficiency ratios are calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income.   \n5. Annualized net loan charge-offs to average loans ratios are computed by annualizing quarter-to-date net loan charge-offs and dividing the result by average loans for the quarter-to-date period.   \n6. Capital ratios are calculated using regulatory reporting regulations enacted for such period and are defined as follows:   \nEquity to total assets – End of period total shareholders' equity as a percentage of end of period assets.   \nTangible common equity to tangible assets - End of period total shareholders' equity less end of period preferred stock, goodwill, core deposit and other intangibles as a percentage of end of period assets less end of period goodwill, core deposit and other intangibles.   \nLeverage – Tier I capital (pursuant to risk-based capital guidelines) as a percentage of adjusted average assets.   \nTier I risk-based – Tier I capital (pursuant to risk-based capital guidelines) as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets.   \nTotal risk-based – Total capital (pursuant to risk-based capital guidelines) as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets.   \nClassified asset - Classified assets as a percentage of Tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses.   \nTier I common equity to risk weighted assets - Tier 1 capital (pursuant to risk-based capital guidelines) less the amount of any preferred stock or subordinated indebtedness that is considered as a component of Tier 1 capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets.   \n7. Book value per common share computed by dividing total common shareholders' equity by common shares outstanding. Tangible book value per common share computed by dividing total common shareholders' equity, less goodwill, core deposit and other intangibles by common shares outstanding.   \n8. Amounts are included in the statement of income in \"Gains on mortgage loans sold, net\", net of commissions paid on such amounts.   \n9. At fair value, based on information obtained from Pinnacle's third party broker/dealer for non-FDIC insured financial products and services.   \n10. Core deposits include all transaction deposit accounts, money market and savings accounts and all certificates of deposit issued in a denomination of less than $250,000. The ratio noted above represents total core deposits divided by total funding, which includes total deposits, FHLB advances, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, subordinated indebtedness and all other interest-bearing liabilities.   \n11. Associate retention rate is computed by dividing the number of associates employed at quarter end less the number of associates that have resigned in the last 12 months by the number of associates employed at quarter end.   \n12. Adjusted pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue excludes the impact of ORE expenses and income, investment gains and losses on sales of securities, the impact of BOLI restructuring, the impact of the FDIC special assessment, the recognition of the mortgage servicing asset and fees related to terminating agreement to resell securities previously purchased and professional fees associated with capital optimization initiatives.   \n13. Represents investment gains (losses) on sales and impairments, net occurring as a result of gains or losses incurred as the result of a change in management's intention to sell a bond prior to the recovery of its amortized cost basis.   \n14. The dividend payout ratio is calculated as the sum of the annualized dividend rate for dividends paid on common shares divided by the trailing 12-months fully diluted earnings per common share as of the dividend declaration date.   \n15.

The firm held $19.7 billion in local deposits, which is 21.2 percent of the total market and 52.2 percent above the closest competitor, according to FDIC data as of and for the 12-months ended June 30, 2024. Pinnacle is No. 3 in deposit dollars added despite nearly a decade of dominance in the market. \n\n![Pinnacle is the No. 1 bank in Nashville with $19.7 billion and 21.2 percent market share. \\(Photo: Business Wire\\)](https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20240924302245/en/2252481/4/Nashville.jpg)\n\nPinnacle is the No. 1 bank in Nashville with $19.7 billion and 21.2 percent market share. (Photo: Business Wire)\n\n“We founded Pinnacle to be Nashville’s hometown bank,” Pinnacle’s President and CEO Terry Turner said. “We’ve grown parallel to and in partnership with our headquarters city for 24 years and are replicating that success in other high-growth Southeastern markets. The support from our communities, along with a competitive landscape that’s ripe for attracting clients from other regional banks, continues to allow us to grow rapidly and consistently over time.” \n\nPinnacle moved within striking distance of taking over the No. 1 spot in Tennessee with $858.1 million in deposit growth since June 30, 2023, for a total of $27.7 billion and 12.4 percent market share as of June 30, 2024. That’s the largest deposit total added within the state over that time period of any bank in the Tennessee. \n\nFirmwide, Pinnacle grew deposits in 21 out of 27 MSAs measured by the FDIC, including 12 with double-digit growth and one with triple-digit growth. The firm grew share in 20 of those markets, taking a greater percentage of overall local deposit pools, at a time when competition for bank deposits has been incredibly fierce. \n\n“Our associates have accomplished this with their tireless work to serve clients with a distinctive experience,” Turner said. “Every day our people demonstrate that Pinnacle provides a lot more than just an interest rate. JD Power has indicated that our net promoter score is literally the best of the largest 50 banks in the nation, with one of the highest rated digital banking experiences. Our people are experienced and empowered to meet their clients’ needs. And we’ve grown our capabilities into several specialized areas of deposits like escrow funds, public utilities and captive insurance. All of that together helped us significantly grow deposits in a difficult operating environment.” \n\nHighlights from other markets in the most recent FDIC report include*: \n\n**Washington, D.C., Virginia and Maryland**\n\nPinnacle’s largest year-over-year deposit growth came in the Washington, D.C., Arlington and Alexandria MSA. The team added $357.4 million in deposits during the 12 months ended June 30, 2024, for a total of $995.1 million and the second-highest growth rate in the MSA at 56.1 percent. Of 71 banks serving the area, Pinnacle has already climbed to No. 24 by deposits in less than three years serving the market. Just to the north in the Baltimore-Columbia-Towson MSA, Pinnacle ranked in deposit market share for the first time, thanks to its office in Columbia, notching $85.5 million for No. 32 out of 42 banks. The firm is No. 19 statewide in Virginia, up from No. 21 in 2023, with $1.9 billion in deposits and 0.6 percent of market share. In the Lynchburg MSA, deposits grew by 38.3 percent to $83.4 million, moving the firm up two spots to No. 12. \n\n**Atlanta, GA**\n\nPinnacle is now a top 25 bank by deposits in the sixth biggest MSA in the country. The firm is tied for the No. 25 spot in the Atlanta MSA, up from No. 30 in 2023, adding $212.3 million in deposits since June 30, 2023, for a $746.6 million total. That’s a growth rate of 39.7 percent both locally and statewide and market share of 0.3 percent in Atlanta. As an indication of the attractiveness of the Atlanta market, every bank in Atlanta’s top five lost both deposits and market share in the same period, giving up a combined $3.1 billion in local deposits and nearly 10 percent of their collective market share. \n\n**Chattanooga, TN**\n\nPinnacle is now the second-largest bank in the Chattanooga MSA by deposits at June 30, 2024, up from No. 3 at the same period in 2023, and has crossed the $2 billion threshold. The team added $258.9 million in deposits for a total of $2.2 billion and a growth rate of 13.4 percent. That’s the largest deposit dollar growth in the entire market for the 12 months ended June 30, 2024. The firm now holds 14.6 percent of market share at a time when some of the largest banks in the region and nation lost significant deposits in the MSA. In nearby Cleveland, TN, Pinnacle is now No. 1, passing First Horizon to claim the top spot for the first time. With just one office in town, the firm holds $490.8 million in deposits. \n\n**Knoxville, TN**\n\nPinnacle’s growth in the Knoxville MSA has been consistently strong, including $319.9 million added in the 12 months ended June 30, 2024, for a total of $2.9 billion and 11.4 percent market share. The firm is No. 4 overall by deposits at June 30, 2024, and No. 1 in deposit dollar growth for that period. Pinnacle is the fastest growing among the top five banks in the market: The overall pool of deposits grew by $1.0 billion to $25.0 billion total, and Pinnacle captured the largest share of that growth among all 43 banks. \n\n**North Carolina**\n\nPinnacle grew deposits by $230.5 million in the Charlotte MSA over the 12-month period ended June 30, 2024, for a total of $2.0 billion, coming in at No. 7 in the market. The firm’s growth rate in Charlotte was 13.1 percent during a period when two of the market share leaders saw double-digit deposit percentage losses in the area. \n\nIn the combined MSAs that make up Pinnacle’s Central North Carolina region, the firm holds more than $3.0 billion in total deposits. In Winston-Salem, Pinnacle grew by $122.7 million for a total of $1.0 billion and a growth rate of 13.7 percent. The firm is now the No. 6 largest in the area, up from No. 7 in 2023. Pinnacle also rose one spot in Greensboro-High Point to No. 3 with a total of $2.0 billion in deposits. \n\nStatewide, Pinnacle holds $6.5 billion in deposits, or 0.9 percent of market share, up by $289.8 million since June 30, 2023. That also includes $13.2 million in growth in Raleigh-Cary for a total of $692.6 million. \n\n**Upstate, SC**\n\nIn the combined MSAs that make up Pinnacle’s Upstate South Carolina region, the firm holds $519.5 million in deposits, up by $75.7 million for the 12 months ended June 30, 2024. In the Greenville MSA for that same period, Pinnacle grew deposits by $36.4 million, or 9.9 percent, to a total of $402.4 million. In nearby Spartanburg, it was $9.4 million in growth to $117.1 million, or 8.7 percent. \n\n*All according to FDIC data as of and for the 12 months ended June 30, 2024 \n\nPinnacle Financial Partners provides a full range of banking, investment, trust, mortgage and insurance products and services designed for businesses and their owners and individuals interested in a comprehensive relationship with their financial institution.

(Nasdaq/NGS: PNFP) reported net income per diluted common share of $1.86 for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2024, compared to net income per diluted common share of $1.69 for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2023, an increase of approximately 10.1 percent. Net income per diluted common share was $4.08 for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024, compared to $5.99 for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 31.9 percent. \n\nAfter considering the adjustments noted in the table below, net income per diluted common share was $1.86 for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2024, compared to $1.79 for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2023, and $1.63 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, an annualized linked-quarter growth rate of 56.4 percent. Net income per diluted common share adjusted for the items noted in the table below was $5.02 for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024, compared to $5.34 for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023. \n\n**Three months ended** |  **Nine months ended**  \n---|---  \n**Sept. 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **Sept. 30, 2023** |  **Sept. 30, 2024** |  **Sept. 30, 2023**  \nDiluted earnings per common share  |  $  |  1.86  |  $  |  0.64  |  $  |  1.69  |  $  |  4.08  |  $  |  5.99   \nAdjustments, net of tax (1):   \nInvestment losses on sales of securities, net  |  —  |  0.71  |  0.10  |  0.71  |  0.19   \nGain on sale of fixed assets as a result of sale-leaseback transaction  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (0.84  |  )   \nRecognition of mortgage servicing asset  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (0.12  |  )  |  —   \nFDIC special assessment  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  0.07  |  —   \nFees related to terminating agreement to resell securities previously purchased and professional fees associated with capital optimization initiatives  |  —  |  0.28  |  —  |  0.28  |  —   \nDiluted earnings per common share after adjustments  |  $  |  1.86  |  $  |  1.63  |  $  |  1.79  |  $  |  5.02  |  $  |  5.34   \n(1): Adjustments include tax effect calculated using a marginal tax rate of 25.00 percent for all periods presented.   \n  \n\"The third quarter was another outstanding quarter for our firm, highlighted by double-digit linked-quarter annualized growth in earning assets, nearly double-digit linked-quarter annualized core deposit growth, and an expanding net interest margin,” said M. Terry Turner, Pinnacle's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Not only am I excited that we grew diluted earnings per share to $1.86 in the quarter, but this growth has also been largely built on our longstanding ability to leverage our differentiated service levels to take market share in our advantaged Southeastern markets. The recently released 2024 FDIC deposit rankings again show that our firm continues to gain market share across our footprint and our client satisfaction scores continue to outperform our larger competitors in virtually every category according to Coalition Greenwich. Lastly, and importantly, Forbes recently reported that our firm was ranked the third best place to work among financial services and insurance firms in the United States, which is ultimately the foundation of all our success. \n\n\"Our robust hiring continues, as we have added 126 new revenue producers thus far this year. Our hiring pipelines remain very active heading into the last quarter of 2024, and we fully expect 2025 to yield double-digit growth as well. I also believe we are well positioned to capitalize on what appears to be a declining interest rate environment. Should the yield curve find its way to a more favorable slope in the coming quarters, this could result in an even better 2025 revenue outlook for our firm.\" \n\n**BALANCE SHEET GROWTH AND LIQUIDITY:**\n\nTotal assets at Sept. 30, 2024, were $50.7 billion, an increase of approximately $1.3 billion from June 30, 2024, and $3.2 billion from Sept. 30, 2023, reflecting a linked-quarter annualized increase of 10.8 percent and a year-over-year increase of 6.7 percent.

Importantly, our C&I and owner-occupied commercial real estate loan portfolios grew by $705.6 million, while our non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio decreased by $186.9 million. We are pleased to report that our exposure to construction and land development loans in relation to our total risk-based capital decreased to 68.2 percent, which is now below our target of 70 percent. It is our intent to continue reducing our exposure to non-owner occupied commercial real estate, multifamily and construction and land development loans from its level at Sept. 30, 2024 of 243.3 percent of total risk-based capital to below 225 percent. We believe this target will also be achieved within the next few quarters. As a result, we are beginning to consider new projects with our high-quality developers in our markets. During this time of reducing our exposure to non-owner occupied CRE, our credit experience in these segments has been remarkable and a great tribute to our client selection and credit underwriting process. \n\n\"A real highlight for 2024 has been our focus on growing core deposits. Our core deposits are up more than $2.0 billion so far this year, and our pipelines point toward expected continued growth in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we have seen our noninterest bearing deposits grow, with end-of-period growth at Sept. 30, 2024 up $296.5 million over the previous quarter end, a linked-quarter annualized growth rate of 15.0 percent. Over the last two years, we have invested in 16 new office locations, representing a 13.3 percent increase in outlets. So, we expect this significant investment in new people and facilities should enable us to continue to grow our core funding.\" \n\n**PRE-TAX, PRE-PROVISION NET REVENUE (PPNR) GROWTH:**\n\nPre-tax, pre-provision net revenues (PPNR) for the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024, were $207.4 million and $488.4 million, respectively, an increase of 6.5 percent and a decrease of 26.3 percent, respectively, from the $194.8 million and $662.4 million recognized in the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023, respectively. \n\n**Three months ended** |  **Nine months ended**  \n---|---  \n**Sept. 30,** |  **Sept. 30,**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **% change** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **% change**  \nRevenues:   \nNet interest income  |  $  |  351,504  |  $  |  317,242  |  10.8  |  %  |  $  |  1,001,800  |  $  |  944,866  |  6.0  |  %   \nNoninterest income  |  115,242  |  90,797  |  26.9  |  %  |  259,633  |  354,165  |  (26.7  |  )%   \nTotal revenues  |  466,746  |  408,039  |  14.4  |  %  |  1,261,433  |  1,299,031  |  (2.9  |  )%   \nNoninterest expense  |  259,319  |  213,233  |  21.6  |  %  |  773,073  |  636,601  |  21.4  |  %   \nPre-tax, pre-provision net revenue (PPNR)  |  207,427  |  194,806  |  6.5  |  %  |  488,360  |  662,430  |  (26.3  |  )%   \nAdjustments:   \nInvestment losses on sales of securities, net  |  —  |  9,727  |  100.0  |  %  |  72,103  |  19,688  |  >100%   \nGain on the sale of fixed assets as a result of sale leaseback  |  —  |  —  |  NA  |  —  |  (85,692  |  )  |  (100.0  |  )%   \nRecognition of mortgage servicing asset  |  —  |  —  |  NA  |  (11,812  |  )  |  —  |  100.0  |  %   \nORE expense  |  56  |  33  |  69.7  |  %  |  162  |  190  |  (14.7  |  )%   \nFDIC special assessment  |  —  |  —  |  NA  |  7,250  |  —  |  100.0  |  %   \nFees related to terminating agreement to resell securities previously purchased and professional fees associated with capital optimization initiatives  |  —  |  —  |  NA  |  28,400  |  —  |  100.0  |  %   \nAdjusted PPNR  |  $  |  207,483  |  $  |  204,566  |  1.4  |  %  |  $  |  584,463  |  $  |  596,616  |  (2.0  |  )%   \n  \n**Three months ended** |  **Nine months ended**  \n---|---  \n**Sept. 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **Sept. 30, 2023** |  **Sept. 30, 2024** |  **Sept. 30, 2023**  \nNet interest margin  |  3.22  |  %  |  3.14  |  %  |  3.06  |  %  |  3.14  |  %  |  3.22  |  %   \nEfficiency ratio  |  55.56  |  %  |  74.04  |  %  |  52.26  |  %  |  61.29  |  %  |  49.01  |  %   \nReturn on average assets  |  1.15  |  %  |  0.41  |  %  |  1.08  |  %  |  0.85  |  %  |  1.35  |  %   \nReturn on average tangible common equity (TCE)  |  13.61  |  %  |  4.90  |  %  |  13.43  |  %  |  10.24  |  %  |  16.62  |  %   \nAverage loan to deposit ratio  |  84.99  |  %  |  84.95  |  %  |  82.80  |  %  |  84.89  |  %  |  83.88  |  %   \n  \nNet interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $351.5 million, compared to $332.3 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $317.2 million for the third quarter of 2023, a year-over-year growth rate of 10.8 percent.

The increase in wealth management revenues was attributable to several factors, but primarily is the result of an increase in capacity with more revenue producers and the placement of those producers in the areas of the firm's most recent strategic market expansions. \n  * Income from the firm's investment in Banker's Healthcare Group (BHG) was $16.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $18.7 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $25.0 million for the third quarter of 2023, a year-over-year decline of 34.4 percent. \n    * BHG's loan originations were $989 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $871 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $1.0 billion in the third quarter of 2023. \n    * Loans sold to BHG's community bank partners were approximately $521 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to approximately $467 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $435 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n    * BHG reserves for on-balance sheet loan losses were $237 million, or 9.1 percent of loans held for investment at Sept. 30, 2024, compared to 9.9 percent at June 30, 2024 and 6.4 percent at Sept. 30, 2023. \n    * BHG increased its accrual for estimated losses attributable to loan substitutions and prepayments to $454 million, or 6.2 percent of the unpaid balances on loans that were previously purchased by BHG's community bank network, at Sept. 30, 2024, compared to $415 million, or 5.9 percent, at June 30, 2024 and $350.3 million, or 5.5 percent, at Sept. 30, 2023. \n  * Other noninterest income was $48.6 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2024, an increase of $6.8 million from the second quarter of 2024 and $10.6 million from the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2024 other noninterest income was positively impacted by increased bank-owned life insurance revenues attributable to restructuring activities initiated last year, increased customer swap revenues and fair value adjustments related to the firm’s interest in other equity investments. \n\n\n\nNoninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $259.3 million, compared to $271.4 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $213.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**Three months ended** |  **Linked-quarter Annualized % Change** |  **Three months ended** |  **Yr-over-Yr****% Change**  \n---|---|---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **Sept. 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **Sept. 30, 2023**  \nNoninterest expense  |  $  |  259,319  |  $  |  271,389  |  (17.8  |  )%  |  $  |  213,233  |  21.6  |  %   \nLess:   \nORE expense  |  56  |  22  |  >100  |  %  |  33  |  69.7  |  %   \nFees related to terminating agreement to resell securities previously purchased and professional fees associated with capital optimization initiatives  |  —  |  28,400  |  (100.0  |  )%  |  —  |  NA   \nAdjusted noninterest expense  |  $  |  259,263  |  $  |  242,967  |  26.8  |  %  |  $  |  213,200  |  21.6  |  %   \n  \n  * Salaries and employee benefits were $160.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $150.1 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $130.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 22.9 percent. \n    * Full-time equivalent associates increased to 3,516.5 at Sept. 30, 2024 from 3,469.0 at June 30, 2024 and 3,329.5 at Sept. 30, 2023, a year-over-year increase of 5.6 percent. \n    * Cash and equity incentive costs in the third quarter of 2024 were approximately $5.2 million higher than the second quarter of 2024 due to the firm anticipating an increased payout percentage for its cash incentive plan than was anticipated at June 30, 2024 and $15.0 million higher than the amounts recorded in the third quarter of 2023 due to an increased number of personnel and the anticipated payout percentage for 2024 being higher than what was anticipated for the 2023 award at Sept. 30, 2023. \n  * Equipment and occupancy costs were $42.6 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $41.0 million in the second quarter of 2024, reflecting an increase of 3.7 percent, and $36.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 15.3 percent. Comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2023, several factors contributed to the increase of equipment and occupancy costs, including new equipment and facilities and rent escalators on various properties. \n  * Noninterest expense categories, other than those specifically noted above, were $56.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $80.2 million in the second quarter of 2024, reflecting a decrease of 29.6 percent, and $46.0 million in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 22.9 percent. Several factors contributed to the decrease in other noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024, including recognition of the $28.4 million fee related to terminating an agreement to resell securities previously purchased and professional fees associated with the firm's capital optimization initiatives completed in the second quarter of 2024 partially offset by increased lending-related expenses associated with the loss protection fee for the credit default swap which was also entered into in the second quarter of 2024. \n\n\n\n\"We anticipated margin expansion in the third quarter, due primarily to the securities portfolio restructuring initiatives we executed during the second quarter,\" said Harold R. Carpenter, Pinnacle's Chief Financial Officer. \"Also during the third quarter, our relationship managers focused on mitigating the impact of the recent reduction in the Federal funds rate. We are pleased to report that our deposit pricing was well contained throughout the quarter, aided by the stability of our noninterest bearing deposit balances. Furthermore, from Aug. 31, 2024, a few weeks prior to the FOMC meeting, through Oct. 11, 2024, our deposit pricing has decreased by 28 basis points, while our loan yields have dropped by 24 basis points, signaling to us that we are doing quite well in managing our net interest spreads here in the initial stages of this new interest rate environment. \n\n\"We are again very excited about our core fee performance during the third quarter. Expanding our fee revenues has been a key initiative for us this year, with many of our business lines experiencing the best performance in the history of our firm, particularly with respect to our wealth management unit. Fee revenues from BHG were less in the third quarter than we anticipated at the end of the second quarter, with BHG’s contribution now representing approximately 8 percent of our third quarter pre-tax, pre-provision revenues. \n\n\"Our expense results for the third quarter came in slightly higher than we originally anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, with most of this attributable to personnel costs. Our hiring has been better than anticipated as it continues to be a strong recruiting year for our firm, which should serve to bolster revenues in future periods. Another contributor to increased expense for the third quarter was that we increased our accrual for annual cash incentive plan payouts to approximately 90 percent of target level payouts as of the end of the third quarter.\" \n\n**CAPITAL, SOUNDNESS AND TAXES:**\n\n**As of**  \n---  \n**Sept. 30, 2024** |  **Dec. 31, 2023** |  **Sept. 30, 2023**  \nShareholders' equity to total assets  |  12.5  |  %  |  12.6  |  %  |  12.3  |  %   \nTangible common equity to tangible assets  |  8.7  |  %  |  8.6  |  %  |  8.2  |  %   \nBook value per common share  |  $  |  79.33  |  $  |  75.80  |  $  |  73.23   \nTangible book value per common share  |  $  |  55.12  |  $  |  51.38  |  $  |  48.78   \nAnnualized net loan charge-offs to avg. loans (1) |  0.21  |  %  |  0.17  |  %  |  0.23  |  %   \nNonperforming assets to total loans, ORE and other nonperforming assets (NPAs)  |  0.35  |  %  |  0.27  |  %  |  0.14  |  %   \nClassified asset ratio (Pinnacle Bank) (2) |  3.92  |  %  |  5.22  |  %  |  4.59  |  %   \nConstruction and land development loans as a percentage of total capital (3) |  68.20  |  %  |  84.20  |  %  |  83.10  |  %   \nConstruction and land development, non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multi-family loans as a percentage of total capital (3) |  243.30  |  %  |  259.00  |  %  |  256.40  |  %   \nAllowance for credit losses (ACL) to total loans  |  1.14  |  %  |  1.08  |  %  |  1.08  |  %   \n  \n(1):  |  Annualized net loan charge-offs to average loans ratios are computed by annualizing quarterly net loan charge-offs and dividing the result by average loans for the quarter.   \n---|---  \n(2):  |  Classified assets as a percentage of Tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses.   \n(3): |  Calculated using the same guidelines as are used in the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's Uniform Bank Performance Report.   \n  \n\"Net charge-offs to average loans for the third quarter of 2024 were 0.21 percent, down from 0.27 percent in the prior quarter,\" Carpenter said. \"Net charge-offs in the third quarter included a partial charge-off of a commercial and industrial loan of approximately $9.0 million. The remaining balance on this loan, which was previously classified, was downgraded to nonaccrual during the third quarter, which was the primary reason for the increase in nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets from the second quarter. In summary, from a credit perspective, thus far this year, we believe our credit performance has remained strong all year long. \n\n\"Lastly, our book value per common share increased during the quarter from $77.15 to $79.33, an annualized linked-quarter increase of 11.3 percent. Concurrently, our tangible book value per common share increased from $52.92 to $55.12 during the third quarter, a linked-quarter annualized increase of 16.6 percent. Additionally, the firm's common equity Tier one risk-based capital ratio increased to 10.8 percent at Sept. 30, 2024 from 10.3 percent at Dec. 31, 2023, which we also consider a great accomplishment.\" \n\n**BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARES DIVIDENDS**\n\nOn Oct. 15, 2024, Pinnacle Financial's Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per common share to be paid on Nov. 29, 2024 to common shareholders of record as of the close of business on Nov. 1, 2024.

Pinnacle Financial disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this press release, which speak only as of the date hereof, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Matters**\n\nThis release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, without limitation, total revenues, net income to common shareholders, earnings per diluted common share, revenue per diluted common share, PPNR, efficiency ratio, noninterest expense, noninterest income and the ratio of noninterest expense to average assets, excluding in certain instances the impact of expenses related to other real estate owned, gains or losses on sale of investment securities, gains associated with the sale-leaseback transaction completed in the second quarter of 2023, losses on the restructuring of certain bank owned life insurance (BOLI) contracts, charges related to the FDIC special assessment, income associated with the recognition of a mortgage servicing asset in the first quarter of 2024, fees related to terminating an agreement to resell securities previously purchased and professional fees associated with capital optimization initiatives in the second quarter of 2024 and other matters for the accounting periods presented. This release may also contain certain other non-GAAP capital ratios and performance measures that exclude the impact of goodwill and core deposit intangibles associated with Pinnacle Financial's acquisitions of BNC, Avenue Bank, Magna Bank, CapitalMark Bank & Trust, Mid-America Bancshares, Inc., Cavalry Bancorp, Inc. and other acquisitions which collectively are less material to the non-GAAP measure as well as the impact of Pinnacle Financial's Series B Preferred Stock. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, these non-GAAP financial measures, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies. \n\nPinnacle Financial believes that these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate making period-to-period comparisons and are meaningful indications of its operating performance. In addition, because intangible assets such as goodwill and the core deposit intangible, and the other items excluded each vary extensively from company to company, Pinnacle Financial believes that the presentation of this information allows investors to more easily compare Pinnacle Financial's results to the results of other companies.

AND SUBSIDIARIES**  \n---  \n**SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA – UNAUDITED**  \n1. Ratios are presented on an annualized basis.   \n2. Net interest margin is the result of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis divided by average interest earning assets.   \n3. Total revenue is equal to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income.   \n4. Efficiency ratios are calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income.   \n5. Annualized net loan charge-offs to average loans ratios are computed by annualizing quarter-to-date net loan charge-offs and dividing the result by average loans for the quarter-to-date period.   \n6. Capital ratios are calculated using regulatory reporting regulations enacted for such period and are defined as follows:   \nEquity to total assets – End of period total shareholders' equity as a percentage of end of period assets.   \nTangible common equity to tangible assets - End of period total shareholders' equity less end of period preferred stock, goodwill, core deposit and other intangibles as a percentage of end of period assets less end of period goodwill, core deposit and other intangibles.   \nLeverage – Tier I capital (pursuant to risk-based capital guidelines) as a percentage of adjusted average assets.   \nTier I risk-based – Tier I capital (pursuant to risk-based capital guidelines) as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets.   \nTotal risk-based – Total capital (pursuant to risk-based capital guidelines) as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets.   \nClassified asset - Classified assets as a percentage of Tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses.   \nTier I common equity to risk weighted assets - Tier 1 capital (pursuant to risk-based capital guidelines) less the amount of any preferred stock or subordinated indebtedness that is considered as a component of Tier 1 capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets.   \n7. Book value per common share computed by dividing total common shareholders' equity by common shares outstanding. Tangible book value per common share computed by dividing total common shareholders' equity, less goodwill, core deposit and other intangibles by common shares outstanding.   \n8. Amounts are included in the statement of income in \"Gains on mortgage loans sold, net\", net of commissions paid on such amounts.   \n9. At fair value, based on information obtained from Pinnacle's third party broker/dealer for non-FDIC insured financial products and services.   \n10. Core deposits include all transaction deposit accounts, money market and savings accounts and all certificates of deposit issued in a denomination of less than $250,000. The ratio noted above represents total core deposits divided by total funding, which includes total deposits, FHLB advances, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, subordinated indebtedness and all other interest-bearing liabilities.   \n11. Associate retention rate is computed by dividing the number of associates employed at quarter end less the number of associates that have resigned in the last 12 months by the number of associates employed at quarter end.   \n12. Adjusted pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue excludes the impact of ORE expenses and income, investment gains and losses on sales of securities, the impact of BOLI restructuring, the impact of the FDIC special assessment, the recognition of the mortgage servicing asset and fees related to terminating agreement to resell securities previously purchased and professional fees associated with capital optimization initiatives.   \n13. Represents investment gains (losses) on sales and impairments, net occurring as a result of gains or losses incurred as the result of a change in management's intention to sell a bond prior to the recovery of its amortized cost basis.   \n14. The dividend payout ratio is calculated as the sum of the annualized dividend rate for dividends paid on common shares divided by the trailing 12-months fully diluted earnings per common share as of the dividend declaration date.   \n15.
