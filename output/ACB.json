Refer to “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Certain Non-\nGAAP Performance Measures” included within this MD&A.\nThis MD&A, the Financial Statements, the Annual Financial Statements, the Company’s annual information form (“AIF”) and press releases\nhave been filed in Canada on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.com and in the U.S. on EDGAR at www.sec.gov/edgar. Additional information can\nalso be found on the Company’s website at www.auroramj.com.\nBusiness Overview\nAurora was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) on December 21, 2006 as “Milk Capital Corp.” Effective\nOctober 2, 2014, the Company changed its name to “Aurora Cannabis Inc.”. The Company’s shares are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market\n(“Nasdaq”) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) under the trading symbol “ACB”, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (“FSE”) under the\ntrading symbol “21P”.\nThe Company’s head office and principal address is 2207 90B St. SW Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6X 1V8. The Company’s registered and\nrecords office address is Suite 1700, 666 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6C 2X8.\nThe Company’s principal strategic business lines are focused on the production, distribution and sale of cannabis and cannabis-derivative\nproducts in Canada and internationally, and the propagation of vegetables and ornamental plants in North America.\nThe Company’s primary cannabis market opportunities are:\n• Global medical cannabis market: Production, distribution and sale of pharmaceutical-grade cannabis products in countries around\nthe world where permitted by government legislation. Currently, there are approximately 50 countries that have implemented\nregimes for some form of access to cannabis for medical purposes. The Company’s current principal medical markets are in\nCanada, Germany, UK, Poland, and Australia. Aurora has established a leading market position in most of these countries; and\n• Global consumer use cannabis market: Currently, only Canada and Uruguay have implemented federally-regulated consumer\nuse of cannabis regimes and the Company has primarily focused on the opportunities in Canada. Longer-term, the Company\nbelieves that the increasing success of medical cannabis regimes globally may lead to increased legalization of consumer markets.\nOn February 7, 2024, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company acquired the remaining interest of 90.43% in Indica Industries Pty Ltd.\n(“MedReleaf Australia”) an Australian domiciled company, for a purchase price of $44.7 million (AUS$51.0 million).\nOur Strategy\nAurora’s strategy is to leverage our diversified and scaled platform, our leadership in global medical markets, and our cultivation, science and\ngenetics expertise and capabilities to drive profitability and cash flow in our core Canadian and international operations in order to build\nsustainable, long-term shareholder value.\nMedical leadership\nOur established leadership in the Canadian and International medical markets positions us well for new regulated medical market openings, as\nwell as the potential U.S. federal legalization of medical cannabis. At the core of Aurora’s near term objective to deliver sustainable profitability\nand positive operating cash flow is our focus on maintaining and growing our industry leading Canadian and international medical cannabis\noperations.\nOur Canadian medical platform is characterized by leading market share, high barriers to entry through regulatory expertise, investment in\ntechnology and distribution, and an unwavering commitment to science, testing and compliance. Our Canadian medical operations allow for a\ndirect-to-patient sales channel that does not rely on provincial wholesalers or private retailers to get product to patients. This direct-to-patient\nmodel allows Aurora to achieve sustainable gross profit margins of better than 60% with substantially better pricing power relative to the\nCanadian adult-use segment.\n3 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. Q1 2025 MD&A\nOur leadership in the International medical cannabis segment provides us with what we expect to be a high growth, profitable business\nsegment that consistently delivers strong adjusted gross profit before fair value adjustments1. Our expertise in managing the complexity of\nmultiple jurisdictions’ regulatory frameworks and relationships, as well as providing export and in-country EU GMP (European Union Good\nManufacturing Practices) and other key certificated cannabis production, are capabilities that we believe will allow us to succeed as new\nmedical and recreational markets open.\nConsumer\nLeveraging our leading strength in science, cultivation and post-harvest processing, Aurora is working to build a sustainable and profitable\nCanadian consumer business. Advances in Aurora production related to cultivar breeding, cultivation, and post-harvest techniques have\nrepositioned the Aurora flower portfolio to one that has the characteristics that consumers are looking for: high THC and terpene levels, and\ndistinctive experiences. These advances have also driven significant improvements in per unit production costs with higher yields and\nconsistent delivery of specification resulting in all-in per unit costs for Aurora’s new portfolio that are a 30% or better improvement from our\nlegacy cultivars. We believe this economic advantage will allow us to compete and make a profit in the most attractive and highest growth\ncategories in the Canadian consumer market. We have also refocused our innovation pipeline for efficient delivery of targeted new products\nand line extensions. The pace of innovation required to compete in the current Canadian consumer market is significant, with most new\nproducts delivering 80% of their lifetime value in the nine months following launch.\nCombined, Aurora’s ability to deliver products that deliver exceptional customer value in our targeted market segments, while at the same time\nachieving strong contribution and gross margins, allows us to build towards a profitable and growing business and provides the know-how to\nleverage these lessons into future global consumer markets that are expected to open over the next few years.\nScience leadership: Genetics, Breeding, Biosynthetics\nWe believe that our scientific leadership and ongoing investment in cannabis breeding and genetics provides Aurora with a strong competitive\nadvantage in premium margin consumer and medical categories driven by what we believe to be our industry leading genetics and breeding\nprogram. Our breeding program, located at Aurora Coast, a state-of-the-art facility in Vancouver Island’s Comox Valley, is driving revenues by\ninjecting rotation and variety into our product pipeline and has delivered nineteen new proprietary cultivars, grown at scale, to our product\npipeline since June 2021. These new cultivars have consistently delivered high potency flower with intensely aromatic profiles – critical\nattributes to delight consumers and deliver the effects patients are seeking. International releases of our latest cultivars Chemango Kush, Pink\nDiesel’71, Cosmic Cream and Black Jelly are now offering patients in Europe and Australia additional high potency options with THC ranges\nfrom 27% to 32%. Moon Berry, our latest balanced cultivar (10% THC/13% CBD) has also been introduced to international markets, further\noffering high aromatics in a balanced high quality whole flower product. Domestically in both medical and consumer markets, the Company\ncontinues to expand its premium offering with compelling aromatics through its new cultivars Critical Diesel (27.2% average THC) and Ginger\nBreath CKS (30.0% average THC).\nIn addition, high quality and high potency cultivars that also deliver meaningful improvements in yield are setting Aurora up for long-term\nsuccess with lower per gram cultivation costs. In selecting Aurora’s “next-generation” cultivars, we are able to set substantially higher minimum\nthresholds for yield which continue to drive up our overall production using the same cultivation footprint, improving our cultivation efficiency\nover time in both indoor and outdoor applications. This improvement allows us to produce top quality flower at industry leading margins. Our\npipeline is now full at every stage of the breeding and selection cycle, and Aurora plans to continue to introduce new cultivars including new\nhigh THC, intensely aromatic flower, and new balanced cultivars.\nOur genetics and breeding program is also expected, over time, to generate incremental, capital efficient revenue through licensing these\ngenetic innovations to other licensed producers.\nGlobal and U.S. expansion\nWe believe that the global expansion of cannabis medical and recreational markets is just beginning. The Company believes its strengths in\nnavigating complex regulatory environments, compliance, testing, cultivar breeding, genetic science, and cultivating high quality cannabis are\nessential strengths that create a repeatable, credible and portable process to new market development. These drive our current leadership in\ninternational medical markets which should allow us to win as new medical markets emerge and potentially transition to recreational markets.\nFor instance, Aurora is active in all key European medical cannabis markets, including Germany, Poland, UK, France, Switzerland, Czech\nRepublic and Malta. The Company holds a top three position in the flower segment in each market and is overall the leading medical cannabis\ncompany in Europe. In Germany, Aurora is one of three active in-country producers of medical cannabis and has just received its production\nand R&D license under the new cannabis law. With this, the Company is in a strong position to serve all medical markets in Europe and for\nany upcoming pilot projects for recreational cannabis.\nWe also believe that the U.S. cannabis market will eventually be federally regulated, with states’ rights respected, in a framework similar to\nevery other comparable market. The timeframe for this is unknown, but Aurora is well positioned to create significant value for our\nshareholders once that federal permissibility allows. Our strategic strengths of medical and regulatory expertise in a federal framework, and\nour scientific expertise, including genetics and breeding, position us as a partner of choice, and to be successful in lucrative components of the\ncannabis value chain.\nWith the acquisition of the remaining 90% equity interest of Indica Industries Pty Ltd. (“MedReleaf Australia”), the Company now sells directly\ninto Australia. MedReleaf Australia is a leading distributor of medical cannabis products in Australia and is currently expanding sales into New\nZealand.\n1Adjusted gross margin before fair value is a Non-GAAP Measure and is defined in the “Cautionary Statement Regarding Certain Non-GAAP Performance\nMeasures” section of this MD&A. Refer to the “Adjusted Gross Margin” section for a reconciliation to IFRS equivalent.\n4 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. Q1 2025 MD&A\nPlant Propagation\nWith the acquisition of Bevo Agtech Inc. (“Bevo”) in August 2022, Aurora moved into the adjacent segment of plant propagation. Building on\nBevo’s established record of profitable and positive cash flow, Aurora is accelerating the growth of the plant propagation business segment\nthrough the repurposing of Aurora Sky and Aurora Sun, which will open additional geographic regions for the existing propagation business, as\nwell as allowing entry into the higher gross margin orchid business, one which is currently served in North America by lower-quality imports.\nFinancial leadership in a rapidly maturing industry\nAurora believes that profitable growth, positive cash flow, smart capital allocation and balance sheet health are critical success factors in such\na dynamic and rapidly developing global industry. Our medical businesses, with country diversification, growth, and strong gross margins\nprovide the foundation for profitability. Aurora has right sized selling, general & administration costs (“SG&A”), centralized and optimized\nproduction facilities, and leveraged the Company’s cultivar breeding success to shift the Company’s portfolio in the Canadian consumer\nbusiness to products with higher gross margins.\nAurora has one of the strongest balance sheets in the Canadian cannabis industry with approximately $182.0 million of cash and cash\nequivalents, inclusive of restricted cash, as at June 30, 2024 and access to a shelf prospectus filed on April 27, 2023 (the “2023 Shelf\nProspectus”) currently covering U.S.$650.0 million of issuable securities. Of the U.S.$650.0 million of securities registered under the 2023\nShelf Prospectus and corresponding registration statement on form F-10 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the U.S.,\napproximately U.S.$225.3 million is allocated to the potential exercise of currently outstanding warrants issued in financing transactions from\n2022. As result, following the closing of the bought deal financing on October 3, 2023, approximately U.S.$396.4 million is available for\npotential new issuances of Common Shares, warrants, options, subscription receipts, debt securities or any combination thereof during the 25-\nmonth period that the 2023 Shelf Prospectus remains effective. Volatility in the cannabis industry, the stock market and the Company’s share\nprice may impact our ability to raise, and the amount of any, financing under the 2023 Shelf Prospectus.\nCash provided by operating activities during the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $8.4 million compared to cash used of $21.1 million\nduring the three months ended March 31, 2024 and cash used of $11.2 million during three months ended June 30, 2023. The Company\ncontinues to improve its operating cash use to deliver sustainable positive free cash flow2. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, free\ncash flow was $6.5 million, which includes a working capital recovery of $10.7 million.\nCondensed Statements of Income (Loss)\nThis MD&A reflects only the results of continuing operations, unless otherwise noted.\nThe consolidated statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) and consolidated statements of cash flows for the previously\nreported Growery, Nordic, Reliva and ICC Labs Inc.

ICC has total net assets of $13.8 million as at March 31, 2024, primarily consisting of property, plant\nand equipment.\nSubsequent to the quarter, on July 31, 2024, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Aurora Cannabis Enterprise Inc., entered into a\ncommercial collaboration agreement with Cogent International Manufacturing Ltd. (“Cogent”) a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vectura Fertin\nPharma Inc., under which Cogent will initially launch its newly-developed CBD lozenge on Aurora’s Canadian medical cannabis patient\nplatform (the “Agreement”). The Agreement, which is expected to have an initial term of 24 months, provides for a fixed fee to Aurora on a\nquarterly basis for the provision of certain marketing, distribution and data collection services to Cogent for a total of $9.8 million over the term\nof the Agreement, and allows for Aurora to earn net revenue on a percentage basis of sales.\n6 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. Q1 2025 MD&A\nFinancial Review\nNet Revenue\nThe Company primarily operates in the cannabis market.

Refer to the “Cost of Sales and Gross Margin” section of this MD&A for a reconciliation to IFRS equivalent.\n(2) Certain previously reported amounts have been adjusted to exclude the results related to discontinued operations.\nMedical Cannabis Net Revenue\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, total medical cannabis net revenue was $47.2 million compared to the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024 of $45.6 million, and $41.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, representing an increase of $1.6 million and\n$5.6 million, respectively.\nCanadian medical cannabis net revenue increased by $0.7 million to $27.1 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to\n$26.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and $25.4 million for three months ended June 30, 2023. The steady increase in\nsales compared to the prior quarter and prior year comparative period was due to higher sales to both insurance and non-insurance covered\npatients as a result of additional product offerings.\nInternational medical cannabis net revenue was $20.1 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $19.2 million for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2024 and $16.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase of $0.9 million and $3.9\nmillion, respectively, is primarily due to increasing sales to Australia.\nConsumer Cannabis Net Revenue\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, consumer cannabis net revenue remained relatively stable at $11.5 million compared to $10.2\nmillion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $12.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease from the prior\nyear quarter was due to the Company’s focus on portfolio optimization and prioritization of sales to the higher margin medical businesses.\nPlant Propagation Revenue\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company’s plant propagation revenue was $23.1 million compared to the three months\nended March 31, 2024 of $10.4 million and $19.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase over the prior quarter is due\nto the seasonality of the Bevo business, which delivers higher revenue in the late winter and spring months as orders are fulfilled. Historically,\napproximately 65-75% of plant propagation revenue has been earned in the first half of the calendar year. The increase over the three months\nended June 30, 2023 is a result of organic growth and increased product offerings.\n7 | AURORA CANNABIS INC.

The improvement quarter over quarter is due to efficiencies in the\nproduction cost, purposeful evolution of the channel mix through increasing participation of the medical market channel which has better\nadjusted gross margin before fair value adjustments than the consumer channel, sourcing change supplying Europe from Canada, and the\nrelated positive impact of closing the Nordic production facility. The increase compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023 is largely\ndriven by lower net inventory impairments, provisions, and destruction charges on cannabis inventory as the Company’s supply is being fully\nallocated to sales channels with minimal excess production.\n8 | AURORA CANNABIS INC.

Q1 2025 MD&A\nAdjusted gross margin before fair value adjustments on medical cannabis net revenue was 69% for the three months ended June 30, 2024,\ncompared to 66% in three months ended March 31, 2024, and 61% in three months ended June 30, 2023. The adjusted gross margin before\nfair value adjustments has improved from the comparative prior periods through sustainable cost reductions, higher selling prices in Australia,\nand improved efficiency in production operations, including shifting sourcing for Europe from Canada due to the closure of the Company’s\nNordic production facility.\nConsumer Cannabis Adjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted gross margin before fair value adjustments on consumer cannabis net revenue was 24% for the three months ended June 30, 2024,\ncompared to 16% in three months ended March 31, 2024 and 26% in three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in adjusted gross\nmargin before fair value adjustments from the prior quarter is due to brand mix with the focus on promoting higher margin brands. The\ndecrease compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, is a result of higher margin product sales in the comparative prior period. The\nCompany strategically decided to allocate less internally-produced cannabis for the consumer channel in favour of increasing its overall\ncannabis allocation for both its domestic and international medical channels.\nPlant Propagation Adjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted gross margin before fair value adjustments on plant propagation revenue was 18% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 as\ncompared to 25% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 22% in three months ended June 30, 2024. The fluctuations in the plant\npropagation adjusted gross margin before fair value adjustments is due to the seasonal timing of lower margin product revenue and a\nprolonged spring season in the current quarter.\nOperating Expenses\nThree months ended\n($ thousands) June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024(1) June 30, 2023(1)\nGeneral and administration 22,524 25,418 21,349\nSales and marketing 14,024 14,530 12,670\nAcquisition costs 1,001 2,970 226\nResearch and development 987 743 1,101\nDepreciation and amortization 2,114 1,895 2,814\nShare-based compensation 3,019 3,029 2,281\nTotal operating expenses 43,669 48,585 40,441\n(1) Certain previously reported amounts have been adjusted to exclude the results related to discontinued operations.\nGeneral and administration (“G&A”)\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, G&A expense decreased by $2.9 million to $22.5 million compared to the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024 and increased by $1.2 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease compared to the prior\nquarter is largely due to severance costs and additional professional fees relating to public company costs incurred in the fourth quarter of the\nfiscal year 2024. The current period reflects incremental ongoing costs associated with the acquisition of MedReleaf Australia as compared to\nthe prior year comparative quarter.\nSales and marketing (“S&M”)\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, S&M expense decreased by $0.5 million to $14.0 million compared to three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024 and increased by $1.4 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase over the prior year\ncomparative quarter is due to freight and logistics costs, notably from sales to Europe with the increase in sourcing from Canada with the\nclosure of Nordic and incremental costs following the acquisition of MedReleaf Australia.\nResearch and development (“R&D”)\nThe Company’s investment in R&D and product innovation is partly opportunistic and its approach to R&D spend is targeted and gated. As\nsuch these costs will vary quarter over quarter and year over year.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, depreciation and amortization expense increased by $0.2 million compared to the three months\nended March 31, 2024 and decreased by $0.7 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease compared to the\nprior year comparative quarter relates to facility disposals and asset impairment charges subsequently recognized.\nShare-based compensation\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, share-based compensation expense remained unchanged compared to the three months\nended March 31, 2024 and increased by $0.7 million compared the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase compared to the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2023 is primarily due to higher than expected forfeitures and expirations in the prior period.\n10 | AURORA CANNABIS INC.

The Company manages liquidity risk through the management of its\ncapital structure and resources to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to settle obligations and liabilities when they are due. Our ability to fund\nour operating requirements depends on future operating performance and cash flows, which are subject to economic, financial, competitive,\nbusiness and regulatory conditions, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our primary short-term liquidity needs are to fund\nour net operating losses and capital expenditures to maintain existing facilities, loans and borrowings repayments and lease payments. Our\nmedium-term liquidity needs primarily relate to lease payments and our long-term liquidity needs primarily relate to potential strategic plans.\n12 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. Q1 2025 MD&A\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company has access to the following capital resources available to fund operations and obligations:\n• $115.5 million cash and cash equivalents; and\n• access to the 2023 Shelf Prospectus (as defined below). The Company currently has access to securities registered for sale under\nthe 2023 Shelf Prospectus currently covering U.S.$650.0 million of issuable securities. Of the U.S.$650.0 million of securities\nregistered under the 2023 Shelf Prospectus and corresponding registration statement on form F-10 filed with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission in the U.S., approximately U.S.$225.3 million is allocated to the potential exercise of currently outstanding\nwarrants issued in financing transactions from 2022. Following the closing of the bought deal financing on October 3, 2023 and the\nexpiration of warrants during the year ended March 31, 2024, approximately U.S.$396.4 million is available for potential new\nissuances of Common Shares, warrants, options, subscription receipts, debt securities or any combination thereof during the 25-\nmonth period that the 2023 Shelf Prospectus remains effective. Volatility in the cannabis industry, stock market and the Company’s\nshare price may impact the amount and our ability to raise financing under the 2023 Shelf Prospectus.\nBased on all of the aforementioned factors, the Company believes that its reduction of operating costs, current liquidity position, and access to\nthe 2023 Shelf Prospectus are adequate to fund operating activities and cash commitments for investing, financing and strategic activities for\nthe foreseeable future.

Excluding changes in non-cash working capital and\ndiscontinued operations, cash used in operating activities during the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $1.8 million compared to $13.0\nmillion for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The improvement of $11.2 million is a combination of increased net revenue and improved\ncontribution margin.\nCash provided by investing activities for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $0.8 million compared to cash used in investing activities\nof $2.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The generation of cash provided by investing activities is largely due to the\ndisposition of marketable securities of $4.7 million, partially offset by net purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nCash used in financing activities decreased to $6.3 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $62.2 million for the\nthree months ended June 30, 2023.

The proposed settlement must now be approved by a court.\nOn June 16, 2020, the Company and its subsidiary, ACE, were named in a purported class action proceeding in the Province of Alberta in\nrelation to the alleged mislabeling of cannabis products with inaccurate THC/CBD content. The class action involves a number of other parties\nincluding Aleafia Health Inc., Hexo Corp, Tilray Canada Ltd., among others, and alleges that upon laboratory testing, certain cannabis products\nwere found to have lower THC potency than the labeled amount, suggesting, among other things, that plastic containers may be leeching\ncannabinoids. While this matter is ongoing, the Company disputes the allegations and intends to vigorously defend against the claims.\nEstimating an amount or range of possible losses resulting from litigation proceedings is inherently difficult, particularly where the matters\ninvolve indeterminate claims for monetary damages and are in the stages of the proceedings where key factual and legal issues have not been\nresolved. For these reasons, the Company is currently unable to predict the ultimate timing or outcome of or reasonably estimate the possible\nlosses or a range of possible losses resulting from the matter described above.\nOn June 15, 2020, a claim was commenced by a party to a former term sheet with the King's Bench of Alberta against Aurora and a former\nofficer alleging a claim of breach of obligations under said term sheet, with the plaintiff seeking $18.0 million in damages.

Estimating an\namount or range of possible losses resulting from litigation proceedings is inherently difficult, particularly where the matters involve\nindeterminate claims for monetary damages and are in the stages of the proceedings where key factual and legal issues have not been\nresolved. For these reasons, the Company is currently unable to predict the ultimate timing or outcome of or reasonably estimate the possible\nlosses or a range of possible losses resulting from the matter described above.\nOn January 4, 2021, a civil claim was filed with the King’s Bench of Alberta against Aurora and Hempco by a former landlord regarding unpaid\nrent in the amount of $8.9 million, representing approximately $0.4 million for rent in arrears and costs, plus $8.5 million for loss of rent and\nremainder of the term. The Company filed a statement of defence on March 24, 2021. Plaintiffs brought an Application seeking summary\njudgment as against the Company and the Company has filed Affidavit evidence in response. Cross-examinations for the Company’s affiants\nand for Plaintiff’s affiant have been completed. While this matter is ongoing, the Company intends to continue to defend against the claims.\nOn November 1, 2022, a claim was commenced by a former employee of Aurora against Aurora Cannabis Enterprises Inc. and another former\nemployee of Aurora (the “Defendant Employee”). The plaintiffs claim that the Defendant Employee entered a lease for a property owned by the\nplaintiffs in January 2017 and states that Aurora was a guarantor for the Defendant Employee. The claim states that the Defendant Employee\nleft the property and caused damage. The plaintiffs further claim outstanding rent and legal fees. There is no record of any documentation of\nAurora being a party to any such relationship. Plaintiffs have received a summary judgment against the Defendant Employee and will now\nattempt to recover their judgment against the Defendant Employee. Plaintiffs will then decide whether to pursue the indemnity claim against\nthe Company. The Company disputes the allegations and intends to defend against the claims.\nOn November 15, 2022, the Company, its subsidiary ACE, and MedReleaf Corp. (which amalgamated with ACE in July 2020) were named in a\npurported class action proceeding in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. The purported class action claims that the Company failed to warn\nof certain risks purported to be associated with the consumption of cannabis. The statement of claim was served upon the Company on\nNovember 22, 2022 and a statement of defence was filed and served. On January 24, 2024, the plaintiff’s delivered their motion record\nregarding class certification. We anticipate that a certification hearing will not be held before March 2025.\nThe Company is subject to litigation and similar claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims related to employment, human\nresources, product liability and commercial disputes. The Company has received notice of, or are aware of, certain possible claims against us\nwhere the magnitude of such claims is negligible, or it is not currently possible for us to predict the outcome of such claims, possible claims or\nlawsuits due to various factors including: the preliminary nature of some claims; an incomplete factual record; and the unpredictable nature of\nopposing parties and their demands. Management is of the opinion, based upon legal assessments and information presently available, that it\nis unlikely that any of these claims would result in liability to the Company, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, would\nhave a material effect on the consolidated financial statements, other than the claims described above.\nIn respect of the aforementioned claims, as at June 30, 2024 the Company has recognized total provisions of $0.3 million (March 31, 2024 –\n$2.3 million) in provisions on the condensed consolidated interim statements of financial position.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nAs at the date of this MD&A, the Company has $0.9 million letters of credit outstanding with the Bank of Montreal. There are no other material\noff-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the financial performance or financial\ncondition of the Company.\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe Company’s key management personnel consists of the Company’s executive management team and management directors who,\ncollectively, have the authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Company.

Director DSUs are included in share-based compensation.\n(3) As at June 30, 2024, there are 10 key management personnel (March 31, 2024 - 10).\n15 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. Q1 2025 MD&A\nThe Company entered into an unsecured Pari Passu Creditor Agreement with Bevo, in which participating shareholders of Bevo provided the\nfunds pursuant to the Creditor Agreement. The Creditor Agreement was for a total loan of $5.0 million and bears interest at a rate of 14.0% per\nannum. The principal and accrued interest are due on May 31, 2025. The Company, advanced funds of $2.5 million, which is eliminated upon\nconsolidation.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of the Financial Statements under IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions about the\ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are\nbased on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period\nin which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the revision affects\nboth current and future periods.\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s critical accounting estimates during the three months ended June 30, 2024. For additional\ninformation on the Company’s accounting policies and key estimates, refer to the note disclosures in the annual consolidated financial\nstatements and MD&A as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nAmendments to IAS 1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\nThe amendment clarifies the requirements relating to determining if a liability should be presented as current or non-current in the statement of\nfinancial position. Under the new requirement, the assessment of whether a liability is presented as current or non-current is based on the\ncontractual arrangements in place as at the reporting date and does not impact the amount or timing of recognition. The amendment applies\nretrospectively for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. The Company has applied the amendments effective April\n1, 2024, retrospectively and it did not impact the classification of current on non-current liabilities.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nThe following IFRS standards have been recently issued by the IASB. Pronouncements that are irrelevant or not expected to have a significant\nimpact have been excluded.\nIFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information\nThis standard sets out overall requirements with the objective to require an entity to disclose information about its sustainability related risks\nand opportunities that is useful to the primary users of general purpose financial reports in making decisions relating to providing resources to\nthe entity. The standard applies for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2025. The Company will continue to assess the\nimpact of this standard.\nIFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures\nThis standard sets out to require an entity to disclose information about its climate-related risks and opportunities that is useful to primary\nusers of general purpose financial reports in making decisions relating to providing resources to the entity. The standard applies for annual\nreporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2025. The Company will continue to assess the impact of this standard.\n16 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. Q1 2025 MD&A\nFinancial Instruments Risk\nThe Company is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks. The Company’s board of directors mitigates\nthese risks by assessing, monitoring and approving the Company’s risk management processes.\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of a potential loss to the Company if a customer or third party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual\nobligations. The Company is moderately exposed to credit risk from its cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and loans receivable.\nThe risk exposure is limited to their carrying amounts reflected on the condensed consolidated interim statements of financial position. The risk\nfor cash and cash equivalents is mitigated by holding these instruments with highly rated Canadian financial institutions. Certain restricted\nfunds in the amount of $39.6 million are retained by an insurer under the Segregated Accounts Companies Act governed by the Bermuda\nMonetary Authority. As the Company does not invest in asset-backed deposits or investments, it does not expect any credit losses. The\nCompany periodically assesses the quality of its investments and is satisfied with the credit rating of the financial institutions and the\ninvestment grade of its Guaranteed Investment Certificates (“GICs”). The Company mitigates the credit risk associated with the loans\nreceivable by managing and monitoring the underlying business relationship.\nThe Company provides credit to certain customers in the normal course of business and has established credit evaluation and monitoring\nprocesses to mitigate credit risk. Credit risk is generally limited for receivables from government bodies, which generally have low default risk.\nCredit risk for non-government customers is assessed on a case-by-case basis and a provision is recorded where required. As of June 30,\n2024, $17.1 million of accounts receivable, net of allowances, are from non-government wholesale customers (March 31, 2024 – $22.8\nmillion).\nAs at June 30, 2024, four customers made up 10% or more of trade accounts receivable (March 31, 2024 – two customers).\nAs at June 30, 2024, the provision for estimated credit losses is $1.1 million (March 31, 2024 – $1.3 million). During the three months ended\nJune 30, 2024, the Company wrote off nil (March 31, 2024 – $2.1 million), and recognized a recovery of $0.2 million (June 30, 2023 – expense\n$0.2 million) recorded in the condensed consolidated interim statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss).\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations associated with its financial liabilities when they are\ndue. The Company’s objective is to manage liquidity risk through the management of its capital structure and resources to ensure that it has\nsufficient liquidity to settle obligations and liabilities when they are due, while executing on its operating and strategic plans. Refer to “Liquidity\nand Capital Resources” section of this MD&A for detailed discussion.\nSummary of Outstanding Share Data\nThe Company had the following securities issued and outstanding as at August 6, 2024:\nSecurities (1) Units Outstanding\nIssued and outstanding Common Shares 54,660,777\nStock options 1,812,287\nWarrants 7,070,433\nRestricted share units 1,017,449\nDeferred share units 319,221\nPerformance share units 1,267,600\n(1) Refer to Note 10 “Share Capital” in the Financial Statements for a detailed description of these securities.\n17 | AURORA CANNABIS INC.

There\nare many factors that affect our business and our results of operations, some of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of\nimportant factors that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or\ndiscussed in the forward-looking statements (“FLS”) set forth in this report relating to our financial results, operations and business prospects.\nExcept as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any such FLS to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this MD&A.\nThese risks include, but are not limited to the following:\n• We have a limited operating history and a history of losses in prior periods and there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve\nor maintain profitability.\n• Our business is reliant on the good standing of our licenses.\n• Our Canadian licenses are reliant on our established sites.\n• We operate in a highly regulated business and any failure or significant delay in obtaining applicable regulatory approvals could\nadversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\n18 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. Q1 2025 MD&A\n• Change in the laws, regulations, and guidelines that impact our business may cause adverse effects on our operations.\n• Failure to comply with anti-money laundering laws and regulation could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\n• We compete for market share with a number of competitors and expect even more competitors to enter our market, and many of our\ncurrent and future competitors may have longer operating histories, more financial resources, and lower costs than us.\n• Selling prices and the cost of cannabis production may vary based on a number of factors outside of our control.\n• We may not be able to realize our growth targets or successfully manage our growth.\n• The continuance of our contractual relations with provincial and territorial governments cannot be guaranteed.\n• Our continued growth may require additional financing, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\n• Any default under our existing debt that is not waived by the applicable lenders could materially adversely impact our results of\noperations and financial results and may have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our Common Shares.\n• We may be subject to credit risk.\n• We may not be able to successfully develop new products or find a market for their sale.\n• As the cannabis market continues to mature, our products may become obsolete, less competitive, or less marketable.\n• Restrictions on branding and advertising may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain customers.\n• The cannabis business may be subject to unfavorable publicity or consumer perception.\n• Third parties with whom we do business may perceive themselves as being exposed to reputational risk by virtue of their\nrelationship with us and may ultimately elect to discontinue their relationships with us.\n• There may be unknown health impacts associated with the use of cannabis and cannabis derivative products.\n• We may enter into strategic alliances or expand the scope of currently existing relationships with third parties that we believe\n• complement our business, financial condition and results of operation and there are risks associated with such activities.\n• Our success will depend on attracting and retaining key personnel.\n• Dependence on Senior Management.\n• Certain of our directors and officers may have conflicts of interests due to other business relationships.\n• Future execution efforts may not be successful.\n• We have expanded and intend to further expand our business and operations into jurisdictions outside of Canada, and there are\nrisks associated with doing so.\n• Our business may be affected by political and economic instability, and a period of sustained inflation across the markets in which\nwe operate could result in higher operating costs.\n• We rely on international advisors and consultants in foreign jurisdictions.\n• Failure to comply with the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (Canada) (“CFPOA”) and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\n(U.S.) (“FCPA”), as well as the anti-bribery laws of the other nations in which we conduct business, could subject us to penalties and\nother adverse consequences.\n• We may be subject to uninsured or uninsurable risks.\n• We may be subject to product liability claims.\n• Our cannabis products may be subject to recalls for a variety of reasons.\n• We are and may become party to litigation, mediation, and/or arbitration from time to time.\n• The transportation of our products is subject to security risks and disruptions.\n• Our business is subject to the risks inherent in agricultural operations.\n• We have in the past, and may in the future, record significant impairments or write-downs of our assets.\n• Our operations are subject to various environmental and employee health and safety regulations.\n• Climate change may have an adverse effect on demand for our products or on our operations.\n• We may not be able to protect our intellectual property.\n• We may experience breaches of security at our facilities or in respect of electronic documents and data storage and may face risks\nrelated to breaches of applicable privacy laws.\n• We may be subject to risks related to our information technology systems, including cyber-attacks.\n• We may not be able to successfully identify and execute future acquisitions or dispositions, or to successfully manage the impacts of\nsuch transactions on our operations.\n• As a holding company, Aurora Cannabis Inc. is dependent on its operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other obligations.\n• The price of our Common Shares has historically been volatile. This volatility may affect the value of your investment in Aurora, the\nprice at which you could sell our Common Shares and the sale of substantial amounts of our Common Shares could adversely affect\nthe price of our Common Shares and the value of your convertible debentures/notes.\n• It is not anticipated that any dividend will be paid to holders of our Common Shares for the foreseeable future.\n• Future sales or issuances of equity securities could decrease the value of our Common Shares, dilute investors’ voting power, and\nreduce our earnings per share.\n• Our management will have substantial discretion concerning the use of proceeds from future share sales and financing transactions.\n• The regulated nature of our business may impede or discourage a takeover, which could reduce the market price of our Common\nShares and the value of any outstanding convertible debentures/notes.\n• There is no assurance we will meet or continue to meet, as applicable, the listing standards of Nasdaq and the TSX.\n• The financial reporting obligations of being a public company and maintaining a dual listing on the TSX and on Nasdaq requires\nsignificant company resources and management attention.\n• Failure to develop and maintain an effective system of internal controls increases the risk that we may not be able to accurately and\nreliably report our financial results or prevent fraud, which may harm our business, the trading price of our Common Shares and\nmarket value of other securities.\n• We are a Canadian company and shareholder protections may differ from shareholder protections in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n• We are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the U.S. Exchange Act, and as such is exempt from certain\nprovisions applicable to United States domestic issuers.\n• Our employees and counterparties may be subject to potential U.S. entry restrictions as a result of their relationship with us.\n• Participants in the cannabis industry may have difficulty accessing the service of banks and financial institutions, which may make it\ndifficult for us to operate.\n• The Company’s employees, independent contractors and consultants may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activities.\n• Our business has and may continue to be subject to disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n19 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. Q1 2025 MD&A\n• The controversy surrounding vaporizers and vaporizer products may materially and adversely affect the market for vaporizer\nproducts and expose us to litigation and additional regulation.\n• We must rely largely on our own market research and internal data to forecast sales and market demand and market prices which\nmay differ from our forecasts.\n• The Canadian excise duty framework affects profitability.\n• We may hedge or enter into forward sales, which involves inherent risks.\n• Our costs, including for input materials, energy and transportation, could be negatively impacted by international conflicts\n• The Company may be a passive foreign investment company, which may result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences\nfor U.S. holders of Common Shares.\nPFIC Risk\nGenerally, if for any taxable year 75% or more of the Company’s gross income is passive income, or at least 50% of the average quarterly\nvalue of the Company’s assets are held for the production of, or produce, passive income, the Company would be characterized as a passive\nforeign investment company (“PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Based on the current profile of the Company’s gross income, gross\nassets, the nature of its business, and its anticipated market capitalization, the Company believes that it may have been a PFIC for the 2023\ntaxable year. While it has not made a determination of expected PFIC status for the current taxable year, there is a risk that it may be a PFIC in\nthe current taxable year and in the foreseeable future. Because PFIC status is determined on an annual basis and generally cannot be\ndetermined until the end of the taxable year, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be a PFIC for the current or future taxable\nyears. If the Company is characterized as a PFIC, the Company’s shareholders who are U.S. holders may suffer adverse tax consequences,\nincluding the treatment of gains realized on the sale of the Common Shares as ordinary income, rather than as capital gain. A U.S. holder may\nbe able to make a \"qualified electing fund\" election (a “QEF Election”) or, alternatively, a \"mark-to-market\" election that could mitigate the\nadverse U.S. federal income tax consequences that would otherwise apply to such U.S. holder. Upon request of a U.S. holder, the Company\nintends to provide the information necessary for a U.S. Holder to make applicable QEF Elections\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (“DC&P”) designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to\nbe disclosed in the Company’s annual filings, interim filings and other reports filed or submitted by it under securities laws is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported accurately and in the time periods specified under such securities laws, and include controls and\nprocedures designed to ensure such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its certifying\nofficers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As at June 30, 2024, the CEO and CFO have concluded that\nthe Company’s DC&P were not effective as at that date as a result of the material weaknesses identified as at March 31, 2024.\nChanges to Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn compliance with reporting obligations, management is in the process of assessing the effectiveness of ICFR pertaining to the Indica\nIndustries Pty Ltd. (MedReleaf Australia) business unit acquired on February 7, 2024, to be concluded upon as part of the ICFR assessment\nfor the fiscal period ending March 31, 2025. Management, with oversight from the Audit Committee, also continues to implement remediation\nmeasures related to the material weaknesses as at March 31, 2024, with a focus on reducing the reliance on manual review procedures over\ndata and information in key business processes, enhancement of IT systems and leveraging automated controls, providing training to control\nowners and hiring additional resources where appropriate, and enhancement to business processes and controls as the Company continues\nto mature its processes.\nAside from these initiatives and the identified material weaknesses resulting from this work and testing of controls as described in\nmanagement’s assessment of ICFR below, no changes to the Company’s ICFR occurred during the quarter that have materially affected, or\nare likely to materially affect, the Company’s ICFR.\nManagement’s Assessment on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn accordance with National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings and as required by Rule\n13a-15(f) and 15d-5(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as amended, management is responsible for establishing\nand maintaining adequate ICFR. The Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, has designed ICFR based on the 2013 Internal\nControl-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO Framework”)\nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for\nexternal purposes in accordance with IFRS.\nICFR is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. ICFR has inherent limitations. ICFR is a\nprocess that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.\nICFR also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material\nmisstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by ICFR. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the\nfinancial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\nManagement has concluded that material weaknesses in the Company’s ICFR continue to exist as identified and described in the Company’s\nannual report and disclosures for the period ending March 31, 2024.\n20 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. Q1 2025 MD&A\nProcess Level Control Activities: The Company did not consistently execute and document sufficiently precise management review controls\nover key assumptions, estimates and period cut-off controls over payable accruals, as well as controls over review of data inputs,\ncompleteness of data entry, and the accuracy of mathematical formulas within spreadsheets. This deficiency impacts property, plant &\nequipment, biological assets and inventory, goodwill and impairment, purchase price accounting, accounts payable, and financial statement\nclose processes.\nInsufficient Segregation of Duties and Personnel at Bevo Agtech Inc.: Specific to the Bevo Agtech Inc. business component and due to\nboth staffing limitations resulting in lack of segregation of duties and limited experience of personnel in key roles in implementing and\nperforming ICFR, the Company had an aggregation of pervasive deficiencies across IT General Controls as well as business processes\nincluding manual journal entries, treasury and cash management, payroll, production and inventory, revenue and receivables, and financial\nreporting processes.\nRemediation Plan\nManagement, with oversight from the Audit Committee will continue to implement remediation measures related to the identified material\nweaknesses, with a continued focus on reducing the reliance on manual review procedures over data and information in key business\nprocesses, providing training to control owners, hiring additional staff to enable the performance of timely internal controls, and enhancement\nto business processes and controls as the Company continues to mature. The Company’s Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”)\ntransformation is a critical step to reducing our dependency on manual review controls, with deployment of the Company’s ERP planned for\nthe European business unit in fiscal year 2025.\nManagement continues to work to improve the robustness of source data used in key assumptions and estimates, including data used in\nbusiness and operational forecasting, and believes that the precision of assumptions and estimates will continue to improve as additional\nmarket and historical company data becomes available as the industry matures.\nWe believe these measures, and others that may be implemented, will remediate the material weaknesses in ICFR described above.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis MD&A contains certain statements which may constitute “forward-looking information” and “forward-looking statements” within the\nmeaning of Canadian securities law requirements (collectively, “forward-looking statements”).

Forward-looking\nstatements contained in this MD&A and in the documents incorporated by reference herein are expressly qualified by this cautionary\nstatement.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Certain Non-GAAP Performance Measures\nThis MD&A contains certain financial performance measures that are not recognized or defined under IFRS (“Non-GAAP Measures”). As a\nresult, this data may not be comparable to data presented by other licensed producers of cannabis and cannabis companies. For an\nexplanation of these measures to related comparable financial information presented in the consolidated Financial Statements prepared in\naccordance with IFRS, refer to the discussion below. The Company believes that these Non-GAAP Measures are useful indicators of operating\nperformance and are specifically used by management to assess the financial and operational performance of the Company. The following are\nNon-GAAP measures contained in this MD&A:\n• Cannabis net revenue represents revenue from the sale of cannabis products, excluding excise taxes. Cannabis net revenue is\nfurther broken down as follows:\n◦ Medical cannabis net revenue represents Canadian and international cannabis net revenue for medical cannabis sales\nonly.\n◦ Consumer cannabis net revenue represents cannabis net revenue for consumer cannabis sales only.\n◦ Wholesale bulk cannabis net revenue represents cannabis net revenue for wholesale bulk cannabis only.\n• Management believes the cannabis net revenue measures provide more specific information about the net revenue purely\ngenerated from our core cannabis business and by market type.\n• Gross profit and margin before FV adjustments on cannabis net revenue is calculated by subtracting (i) cost of sales, before the\neffects of changes in FV of biological assets and inventory, and (ii) cost of sales from plant propagation ancillary support functions,\nfrom total cannabis net revenue. Gross margin before FV adjustments on cannabis net revenue is calculated by dividing gross profit\nbefore FV adjustments on cannabis net revenue divided by cannabis net revenue. Management believes that these measures\nprovide useful information to assess the profitability of our cannabis operations as it excludes the effects of non-cash FV\nadjustments on inventory and biological assets, which are required by IFRS.\n• Adjusted gross profit and margin before FV adjustments on cannabis net revenue represents cash gross profit and gross margin on\ncannabis net revenue and is calculated by subtracting from total cannabis net revenue (i) cost of sales, before the effects of changes\nin FV of biological assets and inventory; (ii) cost of sales from plant propagation ancillary support functions; and removing (iii)\ndepreciation in cost of sales; (iv) cannabis inventory impairment; and (v) business transformation, non-recurring, and out-of-period\nadjustments. Adjusted gross margin before FV adjustments on cannabis net revenue is calculated by dividing adjusted gross profit\nbefore FV adjustments on cannabis net revenue divided by cannabis net revenue. Adjusted gross profit and gross margin before FV\nadjustments on cannabis net revenue is further broken down as follows:\n◦ Adjusted gross profit and gross margin before FV adjustments on medical cannabis net revenue represents gross profit\nand gross margin before FV adjustments on sales generated in the medical market only.\n◦ Adjusted gross profit and gross margin before FV adjustments on consumer cannabis net revenue represents gross profit\nand gross margin before FV adjustments on sales generated in the consumer market only.\n◦ Adjusted gross profit and gross margin before FV adjustments on wholesale bulk cannabis net revenue represents gross\nprofit and gross margin before FV adjustments on sales generated from wholesale bulk cannabis only.\n• Management believes that these measures provide useful information to assess the profitability of our cannabis operations as it\nrepresents the cash gross profit and margin generated from cannabis operations and excludes (i) out-of-period adjustments to\nprovide information that reflects current period results; and (ii) excludes the effects of non-cash FV adjustments on inventory and\nbiological assets, which are required by IFRS.\n• Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net income (loss) from continuing operations excluding income tax expense (recovery), other\nincome (expenses), share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, acquisition costs, changes in fair value of inventory\nsold, inventory impairment adjustments, changes in fair value of biological assets, costs related to our business transformation, out-\nof-period adjustments, non-recurring items and costs related to business operations focused on developing international markets\nprior to commercialization. Adjusted EBITDA is intended to provide a proxy for the Company’s operating cash flow and is widely\nused by industry analysts to compare Aurora to its competitors, and derive expectations of future financial performance for Aurora,\nand excludes out-of-period adjustments that are not reflective of current operating results.\n• Management believes that working capital is an important liquidity measure and is defined as current assets less current liabilities as\nstated on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n22 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. Q1 2025 MD&A\n• Management believes that free cash flow presents meaningful information regarding the amount of cash flow required to maintain\nand organically grow the Company’s business and is an important liquidity measure.\n• Adjusted SG&A is defined as SG&A, less business transformation, non-recurring, market development, and out-of-period costs.\nManagement believes this measure provides useful information to assess the recurring costs of our operations.\nNon-GAAP Measures should be considered together with other data prepared in accordance with IFRS to enable investors to evaluate the\nCompany’s operating results, underlying performance and prospects in a manner similar to Aurora’s management. Accordingly, these Non-\nGAAP Measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of\nperformance prepared in accordance with IFRS.\n23 | AURORA CANNABIS INC.

The proposed settlement must now be approved by a court.\nOn June 16, 2020, the Company and its subsidiary, ACE, were named in a purported class action proceeding in the Province of Alberta in relation\nto the alleged mislabeling of cannabis products with inaccurate THC/CBD content. The class action involves a number of other parties including\nAleafia Health Inc., Hexo Corp, Tilray Canada Ltd., among others, and alleges that upon laboratory testing, certain cannabis products were found\nto have lower THC potency than the labeled amount, suggesting, among other things, that plastic containers may be leeching cannabinoids.\nWhile this matter is ongoing, the Company disputes the allegations and intends to vigorously defend against the claims. Estimating an amount or\nrange of possible losses resulting from litigation proceedings is inherently difficult, particularly where the matters involve indeterminate claims for\nmonetary damages and are in the stages of the proceedings where key factual and legal issues have not been resolved.

Plaintiff and Defendant have each prepared factums for a leave application. Prior to the hearing, Defendants filed a request for\nadjournment and leave to amend their pleadings. The amended Statement of Claim was filed on March 8, 2024. The Company has filed a motion\nto strike the amendment. The Company disputes the allegations and intends to vigorously defend against the claims. Estimating an amount or\nrange of possible losses resulting from litigation proceedings is inherently difficult, particularly where the matters involve indeterminate claims for\nmonetary damages and are in the stages of the proceedings where key factual and legal issues have not been resolved. For these reasons, the\nCompany is currently unable to predict the ultimate timing or outcome of or reasonably estimate the possible losses or a range of possible losses\nresulting from the matter described above.\nOn January 4, 2021, a civil claim was filed with the King’s Bench of Alberta against Aurora and Hempco by a former landlord regarding unpaid\nrent in the amount of $8.9 million, representing approximately $0.4 million for rent in arrears and costs, plus $8.5 million for loss of rent and\nremainder of the term. The Company filed a statement of defence on March 24, 2021. Plaintiffs brought an Application seeking summary\njudgment as against the Company and the Company has filed Affidavit evidence in response. Cross-examinations for the Company’s affiants and\nfor Plaintiff’s affiant have been completed. While this matter is ongoing, the Company intends to continue to defend against the claims.\nOn November 1, 2022, a claim was commenced by a former employee of Aurora against Aurora Cannabis Enterprises Inc. and another former\nemployee of Aurora (the “Defendant Employee”). The plaintiffs claim that the Defendant Employee entered a lease for a property owned by the\nplaintiffs in January 2017 and states that Aurora was a guarantor for the Defendant Employee. The claim states that the Defendant Employee left\nthe property and caused damage. The plaintiffs further claim outstanding rent and legal fees. There is no record of any documentation of Aurora\nbeing a party to any such relationship. Plaintiffs have received a summary judgment against the Defendant Employee and will now attempt to\nrecover their judgment against the Defendant Employee. Plaintiffs will then decide whether to pursue the indemnity claim against the Company.\nThe Company disputes the allegations and intends to defend against the claims.\nOn November 15, 2022, the Company, its subsidiary ACE, and MedReleaf Corp. (which amalgamated with ACE in July 2020) were named in a\npurported class action proceeding in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. The purported class action claims that the Company failed to warn of\ncertain risks purported to be associated with the consumption of cannabis. The statement of claim was served upon the Company on November\n22, 2022 and a statement of defence was filed and served. On January 24, 2024, the plaintiff’s delivered their motion record regarding class\ncertification. We anticipate that a certification hearing will not be held before March 2025.\nThe Company is subject to litigation and similar claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims related to employment, human\nresources, product liability and commercial disputes. The Company has received notice of, or are aware of, certain possible claims against us\nwhere the magnitude of such claims is negligible, or it is not currently possible for us to predict the outcome of such claims, possible claims or\nlawsuits due to various factors including: the preliminary nature of some claims; an incomplete factual record; and the unpredictable nature of\nopposing parties and their demands. Management is of the opinion, based upon legal assessments and information presently available, that it is\nunlikely that any of these claims would result in liability to the Company, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, would\nhave a material effect on the consolidated financial statements, other than the claims described above.\nIn respect of the aforementioned claims, as at June 30, 2024 the Company has recognized total provisions of $0.3 million (March 31, 2024 –\n$2.3 million) in provisions on the condensed consolidated interim statements of financial position.\n(b) Commitments\nThe Company has various lease commitments related to various office space, production equipment, vehicles, facilities and warehouses expiring\nup to June 2033.

The Board mitigates these risks by assessing, monitoring and\napproving the Company’s risk management processes.\n(a) Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of a potential loss to the Company if a customer or third party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual\nobligations. The Company is moderately exposed to credit risk from its cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and loans receivable.\nThe risk exposure is limited to their carrying amounts reflected on the condensed consolidated interim statements of financial position. The risk\nfor cash and cash equivalents is mitigated by holding these instruments with highly rated Canadian financial institutions. Certain restricted funds\nin the amount of $39.6 million are retained by an insurer under the Segregated Accounts Companies Act governed by the Bermuda Monetary\nAuthority. As the Company does not invest in asset-backed deposits or investments, it does not expect any credit losses. The Company\nperiodically assesses the quality of its investments and is satisfied with the credit rating of the financial institutions and the investment grade of its\nGuaranteed Investment Certificates (“GICs”). The Company mitigates the credit risk associated with the loans receivable by managing and\nmonitoring the underlying business relationship.\nThe Company provides credit to certain customers in the normal course of business and has established credit evaluation and monitoring\nprocesses to mitigate credit risk. Credit risk is generally limited for receivables from government bodies, which generally have low default risk.\nCredit risk for non-government customers is assessed on a case-by-case basis and a provision is recorded where required. As of June 30, 2024,\n$17.1 million of accounts receivable, net of allowances, are from non-government wholesale customers (March 31, 2024 – $22.8 million).\nAs at June 30, 2024, four customers made up 10% or more of trade accounts receivable (March 31, 2024 – two customers).\nAs at June 30, 2024, the provision for estimated credit losses is $1.1 million (March 31, 2024 – $1.3 million). During the three months ended June\n30, 2024, the Company wrote off nil (March 31, 2024 – $2.1 million), and recognized a recovery of $0.2 million (June 30, 2023 – expense $0.2\nmillion) recorded in the condensed consolidated interim statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss).\nThe Company’s aging of trade receivables, net was as follows:\nJune 30, 2024 March 31, 2024\n$ $\n0 – 60 days 16,149 33,239\n61+ days 7,548 7,303\n23,697 40,542\n25\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\n(b) Liquidity risk\nThe composition of the Company’s accounts payable and accrued liabilities was as follows:\nJune 30, 2024 March 31, 2024\n$ $\nTrade payables 10,623 20,325\nAccrued liabilities 19,592 20,097\nPayroll liabilities 19,177 15,496\nExcise tax payable 2,272 2,107\nIncome and sales tax payable 2,143 1,940\nOther payables 117 145\n53,924 60,110\nIn addition to the commitments outlined in Note 14, the Company has the following undiscounted contractual obligations as at June 30, 2024,\nwhich are expected to be payable in the following respective periods:\nOver 1 year - 3 Over 3 years - 5\nTotal ≤1 year years years > 5 years\n$ $ $ $ $\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 51,883 51,883 — — —\nLease liabilities (1) 100,403 8,367 23,331 15,898 52,807\nLoans and borrowings 52,381 49,209 3,172 — —\nCapital commitments(2) 1,608 1,608 — — —\n206,275 111,067 26,503 15,898 52,807\n(1) Includes interest payable until maturity date.\n(2) Relates to remaining commitments that the Company has made to vendors for equipment purchases and capital projects pertaining to existing construction.\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations associated with its financial liabilities when they are due.\nThe Company manages liquidity risk through the management of its capital structure and resources to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to\nsettle obligations and liabilities when they are due. Our ability to fund our operating requirements depends on future operating performance and\ncash flows, which are subject to economic, financial, competitive, business and regulatory conditions, and other factors, some of which are\nbeyond our control. Our primary short-term liquidity needs are to fund our net operating losses, capital expenditures to maintain existing facilities,\nconvertible debenture repayment and lease payments. Our medium-term liquidity needs primarily relate lease payments and our long-term\nliquidity needs primarily relate to potential strategic plans.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company has access to the following capital resources available to fund operations and obligations:\n• $115.5 million cash and cash equivalents; and\n• access to the 2023 Shelf Prospectus (as defined below). The Company currently has access to securities registered for sale under the\n2023 Shelf Prospectus currently covering U.S.$650.0 million of issuable securities. Of the U.S.$650.0 million of securities registered\nunder the 2023 Shelf Prospectus and corresponding registration statement on form F-10 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission in the U.S., approximately U.S.$225.3 million is allocated to the potential exercise of currently outstanding warrants issued\nin financing transactions from 2022. Following the closing of the bought deal offering on October 3, 2023 and the expiration of warrants\nduring the year approximately U.S.$396.4 million is available for potential new issuances of Common Shares, warrants, options,\nsubscription receipts, debt securities or any combination thereof during the 25-month period that the 2023 Shelf Prospectus remains\neffective. Volatility in the cannabis industry, stock market and the Company’s share price may impact the amount and our ability to raise\nfinancing under the 2023 Shelf Prospectus.\nBased on all of the aforementioned factors, the Company believes that its reduction of operating costs, current liquidity position, and access to\nthe 2023 Shelf Prospectus are adequate to fund operating activities and cash commitments for investing, financing and strategic activities for the\nforeseeable future. In addition, the Company could access restricted cash of $62.3 million relating to its self-insurance policy, if necessary.\nNote 19 Subsequent Event\nOn July 31, 2024, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Aurora Cannabis Enterprises Inc., entered into a commercial collaboration agreement\nwith Cogent International Manufacturing Ltd. (“Cogent”) a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vectura Fertin Pharma Inc., under which Cogent will initially\nlaunch its newly-developed CBD lozenge on Aurora’s Canadian medical cannabis patient platform (the “Agreement”). The Agreement, which is\nexpected to have an initial term of 24 months, provides for a fixed fee to Aurora on a quarterly basis for the provision of certain marketing,\ndistribution and data collection services to Cogent for a total of $9.8 million over the term of the Agreement, and allows for Aurora to earn net\nrevenue on a percentage basis of sales.\n26"

Having reported our previous fiscal quarter just a few weeks ago, we'll be relatively brief in our\nprepared remarks. Q1 2025 was a milestone period for Aurora, and we could not be more pleased with the results\nthat we'll be sharing with you today. We grew our top line to CAD 83.4 million, which included record revenue in\nCanadian medical cannabis, International Medical Cannabis, and plant propagation during Bevo's seasonally\nstrongest quarter.\nWe take great pride in Aurora being the global medical cannabis leader within nationally legal markets. This\nenables us to capitalize on rapidly evolving opportunities in countries around the world. And through our\ninvestment in Bevo two years ago, we've also become an important player within North America's controlled\nenvironment agricultural industry. This generates a steady, predictable financial performance on a seasonal\ncadence, and we foresee more value creation through an acceleration of Bevo's business plan.\nTurning back to Q1, we also generated substantial growth in adjusted EBITDA to a near record high and reached\npositive free cash flow six months earlier than we had projected, both incredible outcomes. Note that our ability to\nmaintain free cash flow is not linear. And as Simona will explain, we do not foresee reaching positive free cash\nflow in Q2, but expect to be positive again in the third quarter.\nWe also maintained our balance sheet strength through a large cash balance and no debt on our cannabis\nbusiness, which provides us with maximum flexibility. These accomplishments in Q1 position us to have a record\nyear at Aurora led by our flagship global medical business.\nLet me now highlight some specific metrics related to our quarterly performance. First, net revenue rose 12%\ncompared to the same period last year, inclusive of 24% growth in international medical cannabis.\nSecond adjusted gross margin was 43%, while medical cannabis adjusted gross margin reached a record 69%.\nThird, adjusted EBITDA rose 87% and free cash flow was positive for the first time. And finally, we held about\nCAD 182 million in cash on our balance sheet and had no cannabis debt. Our prime positioning within global\nmedical cannabis increasingly enables us to serve the diverse needs of patients globally. Our global medical\nbusiness grew 13% year-over-year and delivered record margins. It generated 57% of our total revenue and 91%\nof our adjusted gross profit. Most of that growth stemmed from international markets. Recall also that medical\ncannabis has the highest gross margin of any segment within the cannabis industry.\nIn Canada, we grew our medical cannabis market share while upholding our number one position. Revenue rose\nnearly 7%, due to higher sales from both insurance covered patients and self-paying patients who not only\nappreciate our broad product assortment but also the steady stream of exciting next-generation cultivars.\nThis consistent supply of innovative products is a direct result of our continued investment in science and\ninnovation and our world class breeding and genetics facility in Comox, British Columbia. We believe that\nconstant innovation is an important element of why we have achieved and maintained our dominant position in\nour home market and frankly, other global markets too.\nOur primary focus with respect to the Canadian medical market is serving insured patients, a generally stable\ngroup. But we were also encouraged by increased interest from unions and other entities that are either already\nor at least considering adding medical cannabis as a member benefit. We think this development, coupled with\nthe traditional medical establishment conducting more clinical trials on a regular basis, provides great upside to\nopening the addressable usage market, which currently encompasses only about 1% of the Canadian adult\npopulation.\n3\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ1 2025 Earnings Call 07-Aug-2024\nTo capitalize on increased interest in medical cannabis as part of healthcare options made available to\nCanadians, last week we announced a commercial collaboration with Vectura Fertin Pharma, an innovator in\nwellness and healthcare, to launch a newly developed CBD lozenge on our leading Canadian medical cannabis\nplatform. Our intention through this launch, which requires minimal additional capital investment on our part, is to\ngather patient feedback, validate the product proposition, and build real-world patient data. Following the launch\nlater this year, we expect to explore additional opportunities to commercialize other Vectura Fertin medical\ncannabis products.\nLet's now turn to the Australian market, which is rapidly becoming the largest medical market in the world outside\nof North America, estimated at AUD 400 million annually, Australia is our largest single market, excluding\nCanada. During Q1, we generated a little over CAD 9 million in revenue in Australia, up 67% from the year ago\nperiod as we benefited from a full quarter contribution from our MedReleaf Australia subsidiary, the number two\nplayer in the market.\nMedReleaf Australia's product portfolio has broadened significantly thanks to Aurora's innovation platform. Since\nthe acquisition, we have become one of the first companies to offer both pastilles and live resin cartridges in\nAustralia. These breakthrough innovations are also being combined with expanded range of high quality cultivars.\nAs I referenced in our last conference call, Australia's clinician led product distribution model and high regulatory\nstandards are significant barriers to entry, providing a distinct advantage for Aurora.\nAurora is actually one of the first Canadian LPs to receive good manufacturing practice certification from the\nAustralian Regulatory Authority, TGA, for River and Ridge, our largest Canadian manufacturing facilities. 90% of\nour annual production comes from these EU GMP and TGA GMP certified facilities, enabling us to pursue growth\nopportunities in Australia and other key global markets. All of Aurora's markets require EU or TGA GMP\ncertification, so Aurora's network of close to 28 tonnes of GMP certified manufacturing capacity is a significant\nadvantage over our competitors.\nTurning to New Zealand, we celebrated our first shipment of Aurora branded premium dried flowers during Q1.\nThis was a significant milestone for medical cannabis accessibility and we believe our leadership in Australia\ngives us an advantage in this emerging market.\nLet's now discuss our European operations. In Germany, a country that we've been operating in since 2018, our\ncredentials are very strong. We hold the number two market share for flowers, the number one market share for\nself payers, and have 2 of the top 10 cultivars by volume sales.\nWhile Germany is in the early stages of cannabis de-scheduling and we do not know with certainty how quickly\nthe market will grow, what we can say is that de-scheduling will continue to fuel the expansion of medical\ncannabis for some time and that we expect these changes to benefit the self payer segment the most as it is the\nfastest growing channel. We are seeing more patients get prescriptions, including telemedicine and this is\nbeginning to positively impact volumes.\nWe'll be able to support increased volumes through our EU GMP Canadian facilities, but also through our EU\nGMP facility in Leuna, Germany, which just recently was granted an expanded cultivation and unique research\nlicense under Germany's new Medical Cannabis Act. We are one of the select few companies to receive\nenhanced licenses, which we view as a result of our commitment to high quality manufacturing practices and a\ntestament to our long established regulatory expertise and an unparalleled commitment to compliance in Europe.\nOur leadership in Germany has an outsized influence on other emerging European markets given the confidence\nand rigor we demonstrate to meet their high regulatory requirements.\n4\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ1 2025 Earnings Call 07-Aug-2024\nMoreover, the changes in Germany should have a broader effect on the expanding acceptance of medical\ncannabis and future modern frameworks across Europe. And we are poised to fulfill that growing patient demand\nthrough our expertise in developing novel, high quality and innovative products.\nLet's now turn to Poland, our second largest European market. Sales softened in Q1 compared to the same\nperiod last year due to the import permit process. But we remain bullish on the long term opportunity.\nIn the UK and Switzerland, we are gaining traction with patients through our proprietary cultivars and widened\ndistribution channels, resulting in significant revenue growth in the UK and a record quarter in Switzerland.\nAnd so, our plan for fiscal 2025 is to thoughtfully execute our medical first cannabis strategy and build on what\nwas accomplished in Q1 and the previous year as the leader in global medical markets. By doing so, we are best\nable to deliver ongoing and sustainable improvements to our financial performance.\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Simona for a detailed financial overview.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nSimona King\nChief Financial Officer, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nThank you, Miguel, and good morning, everyone. Q1 is certainly indicative of how we are fulfilling the mission that\nMiguel laid out as I will now discuss in detail. Revenue of CAD 83.4 million represented 12% growth versus the\nyear ago period, and included a CAD 47.2 million contribution from our high margin medical cannabis segment.\nQuarterly profitability consisted of consolidated adjusted gross margin at 43%, resulting in adjusted gross profit of\nCAD 36 million compared to CAD 32.6 million in the year ago period.\nMedical cannabis comprised 57% of total net revenue and 91% of total adjusted gross profit during the quarter.\nThis marked an increase from 56% of net revenue and 77% for adjusted gross profit from the year ago period,\nreflecting higher medical margins in the current year quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA was CAD 4.9 million for the quarter, resulting in our seventh consecutive quarter of positive\nadjusted EBITDA and grew 87% compared to the year ago period.\nLet's now discuss the results in more detail. Medical cannabis net revenue rose by 13% to CAD 47.2 million,\nwhich consisted of nearly 7% growth in the Canadian medical cannabis and more than 24% growth in\ninternational medical cannabis. The increase in Canadian medical revenue was due to increased sales to both\ninsurance covered and self-paying patients. The increase in international medical cannabis revenue was primarily\ndue to higher sales in Australia and Germany, driven by significant overall growth in both markets as well as\nincreased distribution in the UK.\nAdjusted gross margin for medical cannabis was 69%, up from 61% in the year ago period. This was the highest\nmargin we have ever generated, far exceeding our 60% target and the result of several factors. First, sustainable\ncost reduction. Second, higher selling prices in Australia, which represent a growing component of our\ninternational business. And third, improved efficiency in our production operations with our shift to supplying the\nEuropean markets from Canada. Going forward, we do expect quarterly variability in our adjusted gross margin\ndue to seasonality and changes to geographic sales mix. But we still are confident that we can consistently meet\nour – meet or exceed a 60% or greater margin.\n5\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ1 2025 Earnings Call 07-Aug-2024\nConsumer cannabis net revenue was CAD 11.5 million, down from CAD 12.8 million a year ago. The decline was\nthe expected result of our decision to prioritize the supply of our GMP manufactured product to our high margin\ninternational business. Adjusted gross margin for consumer – adjusted gross margin for consumer cannabis was\n24% compared to 26% in the prior year period due to sales of higher margin products a year ago.\nPlant propagation net revenue was CAD 23.1 million, up from CAD 19.9 million in the year ago period due to a\ncombination of organic growth and the shift in revenue from the most recent quarter due to seasonality. You will\nrecall that Bevo delivers higher revenue in the late winter and spring month.\nPlant propagation adjusted gross margin was 18%, down from 22% in the year ago period due to changes in\nproduct mix and the prolonged growing season this spring. Our consolidated adjusted SG&A rose to CAD 31.4\nmillion, up from CAD 29 million last year due to the incremental SG&A following the acquisition and full ownership\nof MedReleaf Australia. This additional expense is now being offset by increased revenue and EBITDA\ncontribution and we expect to see the full incremental benefit in Q2.\nNow let's turn to our balance sheet, which remains one of the strongest in the global cannabis industry. We held\napproximately CAD 182 million in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30. Recall that our cannabis operations\nare completely debt free while our Bevo business holds CAD 52.4 million in non-recourse debt. Net cash provided\nby operating activities was CAD 8.9 million, a remarkable turnaround from last quarter when net cash used was\nCAD 20.4 million.\nThe improvement was due to both increased revenue, an improved contribution margin and changes in working\ncapital. This resulted in us reaching our free cash flow goal two quarters ahead of our original projection, with free\ncash flow of CAD 6.5 million.\nFinally, let me now provide some thoughts on Q2 and Q3. We expect to see continued strong net revenue and\nadjusted gross margins across its cannabis business supported by net revenue growth in Europe and Australia.\nFor plant propagation, we expect to see seasonally reduced revenues and gross profit in Q2 that will be in line\nwith historical performance as 25% to 35% of revenues are normally earned in the second half of a calendar year.\nPositive adjusted EBITDA is expected to continue while our free cash flow is anticipated to be impacted\nnegatively by several significant annual and one time cash payments that typically occur in Q2. We will continue\nto target improvements to operating cash use and we expect to generate positive free cash flow in Q3 based\nupon the following. First, continued increases in global medical cannabis, driven in part by the full recognition of\nrevenue in Australia and further growth in our key European market.\nSecond, operating expenditure and adjusted gross margins in line with previously stated targets, leading to\ncontinued strong positive adjusted EBITDA. And finally, disciplined working capital management and maintenance\ncapital expenditure of approximately CAD 2 million per quarter.\nTo conclude, we are very pleased with our performance in our first quarter and believe that we have set the\nfoundation for a strong fiscal 2025. We are giving our full attention to executing our expansion strategy across key\nmarkets and combining that with operational excellence to further strengthen our financial condition. Thank you\nfor your time.\nI'll now turn the call back to Miguel.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n6\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ1 2025 Earnings Call 07-Aug-2024\nMiguel Martin\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nThank you, Simona. Aurora is firmly in growth mode, ready and able to capitalize on the opportunity for global\nmedical cannabis, the most attractive segment of our industry as patient access is increasing at a rate like never\nbefore. The openings provided by evolving regulatory environments in key international markets positions just a\nfew companies like Aurora to take advantage of this once in a generation opportunity. As we expand and deepen\nour presence in these markets, we will not only benefit from an increase in our top line, but also from the high\nmargin contribution that flows from the medical cannabis segment. This will result in long term EBITDA and free\ncash flow growth for the benefit of our shareholders.\nAnd with that, thank you for your interest in Aurora and we will now take your questions. Operator, please open\nthe lines.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please limit yourself to\none question and no follow ups. If you wish to ask a follow up, please rejoin the question queue. At this time, we\nwill pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Pablo Zuanic with Zuanic &\nAssociates. Please go ahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPablo Zuanic Q\nAnalyst, Zuanic & Associates LLC\nGood morning. Miguel, can we just discuss Germany. If you can just – it's a two part question. First, if you can\ngive some sense of underlying trends, right? Like some people have talked about growth from April to July, local\ncompanies there have talked about doubling or tripling in doctor visits, scripts. Any color you can give about\nunderlying trends would help.\nAnd the second part of the question is really, remind us of the strength of your franchise in Germany, because\nfrom outside sometimes we wonder about the barriers to entry. There seems to be a lot of companies there,\nwholesalers, importers. So just remind us of the strength of your franchise and when we – why we should assume\nthat you will continue to benefit from strong market share there. Thanks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMiguel Martin A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nGreat. Well, thanks and good morning, Pablo. Appreciate it. So, when we look at Germany and you look at the\npassing of the Cannabis Act, which took effective in April 1, really there were sort of three aspects of it that we're\nencouraged by. First has been the increased access to patient, the ease in which patients can get a prescription\nthrough a variety of means, say, telemedicine and others. And so, it has dramatically grown the sort of the overall\npie of available patients and the ease in which that process is, say, compared to what it used to be.\nSecondly, as you're well aware of, the ease of distribution there, because now you can ship cannabis products\nlike other pharmaceutical products through the mail, which allows an expansion beyond what was the traditional\nface to face interaction that you would see at a pharmacy. And then third is we have not seen margin or pricing\ncompression. And the reason for that is that the wholesale list price of the manufacturer drives the economics for\nboth the wholesaler and the retailer which in this case is the pharmacy.\n7\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ1 2025 Earnings Call 07-Aug-2024\nSo now as to projections of two acts or three acts of the German market, I think that is a bit premature. I think\nroughly 30% on an annualized basis is still very healthy. But we'll have to see given the overall sort of recency of\nthat and the trends that we're going to see not only in the registrations, but in the overall sort of pharmacies and\nwhat's happening with the actual prescriptions themselves.\nI think in terms of what are the strengths for Aurora? What people I think need to understand is that medical\ncannabis operates like traditional pharmaceutical product. You have a clinician or a doctor prescribing a specific\nproduct or a need of a specific patient. And once they find a medication that they like, they stick with it. And so,\nunlike, say, the rec market in Canada, where you see great swings in market shares, once you've established\npresence with innovative and well-made products, they're going to be sticky, so to speak. So that's the first thing.\nThe second thing is that the registration process for new products and the testing protocols in Germany is\nincredibly stringent. So, as an example, you have to be within 10% of their testing of your potency and on some of\nthe other key terp scores. And so that's very hard to do with an agricultural products. So, precision in your\nmanufacturing process beyond the EU GMP standards that you have to have there for a company like Aurora\nthat's been doing it for such a long time is a significant advantage.\nNow in market having infrastructure around wholesalers and distribution and connectivity to those pharmacies is\nsomething that takes a while and takes investment and is something that Aurora has and I think does well. And\nthen lastly, as you also know, we're one of only three companies that have in-country manufacturing. And so, the\nconnectivity of not only selling products made from offshore into Germany, but also growing them and potentially\nselling them in-market all are significant advantages in such a key market.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPablo Zuanic Q\nAnalyst, Zuanic & Associates LLC\nThank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMiguel Martin A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nVery welcome.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the\nconference back over to Miguel Martin for any closing remarks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMiguel Martin\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nThank you very much. And we appreciate everybody's interest in Aurora. As we said, this was a milestone quarter\nand we're incredibly excited about the future and we look forward to sharing those results with you as the year\ngoes along. All the best.

The MD&A has been\nprepared as of June 19, 2024 pursuant to the disclosure requirements under National Instrument 51-102 - Continuous Disclosure Obligations\n(“NI 51-102”) of the Canadian Securities Administrators (“CSA”). Under the United States (“U.S.”) / Canada Multijurisdictional Disclosure\nSystem, we are permitted to prepare the MD&A in accordance with Canadian disclosure requirements which may differ from U.S. disclosure\nrequirements.\nIn 2022, the Company announced a change to its fiscal year end from June 30 to March 31. The Company filed a notice of change of year end\non February 24, 2023 pursuant to Part 4 of NI 52-102. Consequently, the Company is reporting annual financial results for a nine-month\ntransition period from July 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023 compared to the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 (“FY 2024”). References to “fiscal\n2023” or “FY 2023” are in respect of the nine months ended March 31, 2023.\nGiven the Company’s change in year end and recent business transformation initiatives to realign its operational footprint and increase\nfinancial flexibility, in addition to year over year comparison, this MD&A provides comparative disclosures for the fourth quarter ended March\n31, 2024 (“Q4 2024”) to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 ended March 31, 2023 (“Q3 2023”) and to the third quarter of fiscal 2024 ended\nDecember 31, 2023 (“Q3 2024”). Management believes that these comparatives provide relevant and current information.\nOn February 20, 2024, the Company completed a one-to-ten (1:10) reverse share split of all of its issued and outstanding common shares\n(“Share Consolidation”), resulting in a reduction in the issued and outstanding shares from 545,457,970 to 54,545,797. Shares reserved under\nthe Company’s equity, warrants, and incentive plans were adjusted to reflect the Share Consolidation. All share and per share data presented\nin the Company’s consolidated financial statements and this MD&A have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Share Consolidation unless\notherwise noted.\nAll dollar amounts are expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except for share and per share amounts, and where otherwise indicated.\nThis MD&A contains forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and the use of Non-GAAP Measures (as\ndefined below). Refer to “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Certain Non-\nGAAP Performance Measures” included within this MD&A.\nThis MD&A, Financial Statements, annual information form (“AIF”) and press releases have been filed in Canada on SEDAR+ at\nwww.sedarplus.com and in the U.S. on EDGAR at www.sec.gov/edgar. Additional information can also be found on the Company’s website at\nwww.auroramj.com.\nBusiness Overview\nAurora was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) on December 21, 2006 as “Milk Capital Corp.” Effective\nOctober 2, 2014, the Company changed its name to “Aurora Cannabis Inc.” The Company’s shares are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select\nMarket (“Nasdaq”) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) under the trading symbol “ACB”, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (“FSE”)\nunder the trading symbol “21P”.\nThe Company’s head office and principal address is 2207 90B St. SW Edmonton, AB T6X 0J9. The Company’s registered and records office\naddress is Suite 1700, 666 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6C 2X8.\nThe Company’s principal strategic business lines are focused on the production, distribution and sale of cannabis and cannabis-derivative\nproducts in Canada and internationally, and the propagation of vegetables and ornamental plants.\nThe Company’s primary market opportunities are:\n• Global medical cannabis market: Production, distribution and sale of pharmaceutical-grade cannabis products in countries around\nthe world permitted by government legislation. Currently, there are approximately 50 countries that have implemented regimes for\nsome form of access to cannabis for medical purposes. The Company’s current principal medical markets are in Canada, Germany,\nUK, Poland, and Australia. Aurora has established a leading market position in most of these countries; and\n• Global consumer use cannabis market: Currently, only Canada and Uruguay have implemented federally-regulated consumer\nuse of cannabis regimes and the Company has primarily focused on the opportunities in Canada. Longer-term, the Company\nbelieves that the increasing success of medical cannabis regimes globally may lead to increased legalization of consumer markets.\nOn February 7, 2024, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company acquired the remaining interest of 90.43% in Indica Industries Pty Ltd\n(“MedReleaf Australia”) an Australian domiciled company, for a purchase price of $44.7 million (AUS$51.0 million).\nOn August 25, 2022, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company acquired a 50.1% controlling interest in Bevo Agtech Inc. (“Bevo”), the sole\nparent of Bevo Farms Ltd., a key supplier of propagated vegetables and ornamental plants in North America. The acquisition of a controlling\ninterest in Bevo allows the Company to immediately benefit from a profitable, cash flow positive and growing business, and may have the\npotential to add long term value to Aurora's existing cannabis business via the application of Bevo's industry extensive propagation expertise.\nOur Strategy\n3 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nAurora’s strategy is to leverage our diversified and scaled platform, our leadership in global medical markets, and our cultivation, science and\ngenetics expertise and capabilities to drive profitability in our core Canadian and international operations in order to build sustainable, long-\nterm shareholder value.\nMedical leadership\nOur established leadership in the Canadian and International medical markets positions us well for new regulated medical market openings, as\nwell as potential U.S. federal legalization of medical cannabis. At the core of Aurora’s near term objective to deliver sustainable profitability and\npositive operating cash flow is our focus on maintaining and growing our industry leading Canadian and international medical cannabis\noperations.\nOur Canadian medical platform is characterized by leading market share, high barriers to entry through regulatory expertise, investment in\ntechnology and distribution, and unwavering commitment to science, testing and compliance. Our Canadian medical operations allow for a\ndirect-to-patient sales channel that does not rely on provincial wholesalers or private retailers to get product to patients. This direct-to-patient\nmodel allows Aurora to achieve sustainable gross profit margins of better than 60% with substantially better pricing power relative to the\nCanadian adult-use segment.\nOur leadership in the International medical cannabis segment provides us with what we expect to be a high growth, profitable business\nsegment that consistently delivers strong adjusted gross profit before fair value adjustments. Our expertise in managing the complexity of\nmultiple jurisdictions’ regulatory frameworks and relationships, as well as providing export and in-country EU GMP (European Union Good\nManufacturing Practices) and other key certificated cannabis production, are capabilities that we believe will us to succeed as new medical\nand recreational markets open.\nConsumer\nLeveraging our leading strength in science, cultivation and post-harvest processing, Aurora is working to build a sustainable and profitable\nCanadian consumer business. Advances in Aurora production related to cultivar breeding, cultivation, and post-harvest techniques have\nrepositioned the Aurora flower portfolio to one that has the characteristics that consumers are looking for: high THC and terpene levels, and\ndistinctive experiences. These advances have also driven significant improvement in per unit production costs with higher yields and\nconsistent delivery of specification resulting in all-in per unit costs for Aurora’s new portfolio that are 30% or better improvement from our\nlegacy cultivars. We believe this economic advantage will allow us to compete and make a profit in certain categories in which we currently do\nnot operate. We have also refocused our innovation pipeline for efficient delivery of targeted new products and line extensions. The pace of\ninnovation required to compete in the current Canadian consumer market is significant, with most new products delivering 80% of their lifetime\nvalue in the nine to 12 months following launch.\nCombined, Aurora’s ability to deliver products that deliver exceptional customer value in all price tiers, while at the same time achieving strong\ncontribution and gross margins, allows us to build towards a profitable and growing business and provides the know-how to leverage these\nlessons into future global consumer markets that are expected to open over the next few years.\nScience leadership: Genetics, Breeding, Biosynthetics\nWe believe that our scientific leadership and ongoing investment in cannabis breeding and genetics provides Aurora with a strong competitive\nadvantage in premium margin consumer and medical categories driven by what we believe to be our industry leading genetics and breeding\nprogram. Our breeding program, located at Aurora Coast, a state-of-the-art facility in Vancouver Island’s Comox Valley, is driving revenues by\ninjecting rotation and variety into our product pipeline and has delivered nineteen new proprietary cultivars, grown at scale, to our product\npipeline since June 2021. These new cultivars have consistently delivered high potency flower with intensely aromatic profiles – critical\nattributes to delight consumers and deliver the effects patients are seeking. The latest new cultivar to launch in EU and Australia is now\nChemango Kush, joining Farm Gas, Sourdough and Electric Honeydew as “next generation” high potency cultivars released to international\nmarkets. Domestically, the Company continues to expand its offering with Cosmic Cream, and Black Jelly to all Canadian markets, and has\nadded the latest new cultivar with high aromatics, Critical Diesel to Aurora’s Medical channel. Further launches of other new cultivars, including\nPink Diesel’71 and Moon Berry, are underway in international markets.\nIn addition, high quality and high potency cultivars that also deliver meaningful improvements in yield are setting Aurora up for long-term\nsuccess with lower per gram cultivation costs. In selecting Aurora’s “next-generation” cultivars, we are able to set substantially higher minimum\nthresholds for yield which continue to drive up our overall production using the same cultivation footprint, improving our cultivation efficiency\nover time in both indoor and outdoor applications. This improvement allows us to produce top quality flower at industry leading margins. Our\npipeline is now full at every stage of the breeding and selection cycle, and Aurora plans to continue to introduce new cultivars including new\nhigh THC, intensely aromatic flower, and new balanced cultivars.\nOur genetics and breeding program is also expected, over time, to generate incremental, capital efficient revenue through licensing these\ngenetic innovations to other licensed producers.\nGlobal and U.S. expansion\nWe believe that the global expansion of medical and recreational cannabis markets is just beginning. The Company believes its strengths in\nnavigating complex regulatory environments, compliance, testing, cultivar breeding, genetic science, and cultivating high quality cannabis are\nessential strengths that create a repeatable, credible and portable process to new market development. These drive our current leadership in\ninternational medical markets which should allow us to win as new medical markets emerge and potentially transition to recreational markets.\nFor instance, Aurora was awarded a tender to supply extracts in the French medical cannabis trial program, a large medical market. In\naddition, Aurora is at the forefront of large developing federally legal consumer markets, with a leading position in the German medical market\nand as one of three domestic German producers, is well positioned to benefit from the recent regulatory changes introduced by the German\nGovernment on April 1, 2024. These changes are expected to support greater access to medical cannabis for German patients following the\nde-scheduling of cannabis, with further regulatory changes expected in the coming years.\n4 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nWe also believe that the U.S. cannabis market will eventually be federally regulated, with states’ rights respected, in a framework similar to\nevery other comparable market. The timeframe for this is unknown, but Aurora is well positioned to create significant value for our\nshareholders once that federal permissibility allows. Our strategic strengths of medical and regulatory expertise in a federal framework, and\nour scientific expertise, including genetics, breeding, and biosynthetics, position us as a partner of choice, and to be successful in lucrative\ncomponents of the cannabis value chain.\nPlant Propagation\nWith the acquisition of Bevo in August 2022, Aurora moved into the adjacent segment of plant propagation. Building on Bevo’s established\nrecord of profitable and positive cash flow, Aurora is accelerating the growth of plant propagation through the repurposing of Aurora Sky and\nAurora Sun, which will open additional geographic regions for the existing propagation business, as well as allowing entry into the higher gross\nmargin orchid business, one which is currently served in North America by lower-quality imports.\nFinancial leadership in a rapidly maturing industry\nAurora believes that profitable growth, positive cash flow, smart capital allocation and balance sheet health are critical success factors in such\na dynamic and rapidly developing global industry. Our medical businesses, with country diversification, growth, and strong gross margins\nprovide the foundation for profitability. Aurora has right sized selling, general & administration costs (“SG&A”), centralized and optimized\nproduction facilities, and leveraged the Company’s cultivar breeding success to shift the Company’s portfolio in the Canadian consumer\nbusiness to products with higher gross margins.\nAurora has one of the strongest balance sheets in the Canadian cannabis industry with approximately $180.0 million of cash and cash\nequivalents, inclusive of restricted cash, as at March 31, 2024 and access to a shelf prospectus filed on April 27, 2023 (the “2023 Shelf\nProspectus”) currently covering U.S.$650.0 million of issuable securities. Of the U.S.$650.0 million of securities registered under the 2023\nShelf Prospectus and corresponding registration statement on form F-10 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the U.S.,\napproximately U.S.$225.3 million is allocated to the potential exercise of currently outstanding warrants issued in financing transactions from\n2022. Following the closing of the bought deal offering on October 3, 2023 and the expiration of warrants during the year approximately U.S.\n$396.4 million is available for potential new issuances of Common Shares, warrants, options, subscription receipts, debt securities or any\ncombination thereof during the 25-month period that the 2023 Shelf Prospectus remains effective. Volatility in the cannabis industry, stock\nmarket and the Company’s share price may impact the amount and our ability to raise financing under the 2023 Shelf Prospectus.\nCash used in operating activities during Q4 2024 was $21.1 million compared to $5.3 million and $20.4 million during Q3 2024 and Q3 2023,\nrespectively. Excluding changes in non-cash working capital1 and net cash used in discontinued operations2, net cash used in operating\nactivities during Q4 2024 was $10.5 million compared to $11.7 million and $13.6 million during Q3 2024 and Q3 2023, respectively. The\nCompany’s plan to reduce costs by $40 million annualized during fiscal 2024 is expected to continue to improve operating cash use over the\nnext several quarters and support the Company’s initiative to achieve positive free cash flow during calendar year 2024.\nCondensed Statements of Loss\nThis MD&A reflects only the results of continuing operations, unless otherwise noted.\nThe consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss and consolidated statements of cash flows for the previously reported Growery\nand Nordic, formerly part of the EU Cannabis operating segment and Reliva, formerly part of the Canadian Cannabis operating segment, are\npresented as discontinued operations, separate from the Company’s continuing operations. Certain prior period financial information on the\nconsolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss and the consolidated statements of cash flows have been updated to present\nGrowery, Nordic and Reliva as discontinued operations, and has therefore been excluded from both continuing operations and results for all\nperiods presented in this MD&A.\nThe loss from discontinued operations included in the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss for the three and twelve\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 was nil and $10.3 million, respectively compared to the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023 – $10.7\nmillion and $21.9 million, respectively.\n1 “Working Capital” is a Non-GAAP Measure and is not recognized, defined or standardized measure under IFRS.

(“ICC”). ICC has total net assets of $13.8 million as at March 31, 2024, primarily consisting of property, plant\nand equipment. During the year ended March 31, 2024, ICC incurred operating losses of approximately $2.0 million. The Company is still\nevaluating its options for disposal.\n8 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nFinancial Review\nNet Revenue\nThe Company primarily operates in the cannabis market.

Refer to discussion under “ Historical Quarterly Results” section of this MD&A for further detail.\nMedical Cannabis Net Revenue\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, total medical cannabis net revenue was $45.6 million compared to the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2023 of $45.1 million, and $37.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing an increase of $0.6 million\nand $7.7 million, respectively.\nCanadian medical cannabis net revenue increased by $0.7 million to $26.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to\n$25.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and $24.1 million for three months ended March 31, 2023. The steady increase\ncompared to the prior quarter and prior year comparative period was due to higher sales to insurance covered patients and increased basket\nsizes.\nInternational medical cannabis net revenue was $19.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $19.3 million for\nthe three months ended December 31, 2023 and $13.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease of $0.1 million was\ndriven by an initial change in revenue recognition upon acquiring MedReleaf Australia. Prior to the acquisition on February 7, 2024, revenue\nwas recognized when the product was delivered to MedReleaf Australia. Subsequent to the acquisition, revenue is recognized when the\nproduct is sold through to MedReleaf Australia’s retail customers. Compared to the prior year comparative period, the increase of $5.4 million\nwas due to increased sales to Australia due to significant growth in the Australian market, in addition to higher sales to Poland and the United\nKingdom during the quarter.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, total medical cannabis net revenue was $176.2 million, an increase of $68.4 million compared to\n$107.8 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2023. The increase is partly due to the current year consisting of four quarters\ncompared to prior year which was three quarters, in addition to organic growth.\n9 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nCanadian medical cannabis net revenue increased by $31.0 million to $103.1 million during the year ended March 31, 2024 compared to the\nnine months ended March 31, 2023. The increase is partly due to the current year consisting of four quarters compared to three quarters in the\nprior year, in addition to higher sales to insurance covered patients and increased basket sizes.\nInternational medical cannabis net revenue was $73.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $37.4 million compared to\n$35.7 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2023. The increase is partly due to the current year consisting of four quarters compared to\nthree quarters in the prior year, significantly higher sales to Australia and improved sales to Poland and the United Kingdom.\nConsumer Cannabis Net Revenue\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, consumer cannabis net revenue was $10.2 million compared to the prior quarter of $11.6\nmillion and $14.5 million for the prior year comparative period. The decrease was due to a focus on portfolio optimization.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, consumer cannabis net revenue increased to $47.0 million compared to $42.9 million during the nine\nmonths ended March 31, 2023. Adjusting for the number of quarters between the current year and comparative period, consumer cannabis net\nrevenue declined as the Company shifted its focus to portfolio optimization and allocation of cannabis flower to Aurora’s highest margin\nbusiness segments.\nPlant Propagation Revenue\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company’s plant propagation revenue was $10.4 million compared to the prior quarter of\n$7.3 million and $10.8 million in the prior year comparative period. The increase from the prior quarter is due to the seasonality of the Bevo\nbusiness, which delivers higher revenue in the late winter and spring months as orders are fulfilled. Historically, approximately 65-75% of plant\npropagation revenue has been earned in the first half of the calendar year.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023, plant propagation revenue was $44.8 million and $20.7\nmillion, respectively. The increase is mainly due to the comparative period reflecting six months of sales compared to twelve months in the\ncurrent period.

The improvement quarter over quarter is due to efficiencies\nin the production cost, purposeful evolution of the channel mix through increasing participation of the medical market channel which has better\nadjusted gross margin before fair value adjustments than the consumer channel, sourcing change supplying Europe from Canada, and the\nrelated positive impact of closing the Nordic production facility. The increase compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 is largely\ndriven by lower net inventory impairments, provisions, and destruction charges on cannabis inventory as the Company’s supply is being fully\nallocated to sales channels with minimal excess production.\nGross margin before fair value adjustments was 29% for the year ended March 31, 2024 compared to 15% for the nine months ended March\n31, 2023. The improvement is driven by positive production spend variances, lower net inventory impairments, provisions and destruction\ncharges on cannabis inventory during the current period.\n10 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nAdjusted Gross Margin – Q4 2024\nThe table below outlines adjusted gross profit and margin before fair value adjustments for the indicated three month period:\nCore Non-Core\nWholesale Wholesale\nMedical Consumer Bulk Total Core Bulk Plant\n($ thousands) Cannabis Cannabis Cannabis Cannabis Cannabis Propagation Total\nThree months ended March 31, 2024\nGross revenue 48,466 15,240 221 63,927 893 10,416 75,236\nExcise taxes (2,818) (5,007) — (7,825) — — (7,825)\nNet revenue (1) 45,648 10,233 221 56,102 893 10,416 67,411\nNon-recurring net revenue adjustments (4) — — — — (192) (192)\nAdjusted net revenue 45,648 10,233 221 56,102 893 10,224 67,219\nCost of sales (20,976) (11,682) (131) (32,789) (2,555) (8,327) (43,671)\nDepreciation 2,262 1,195 14 3,471 270 660 4,401\nInventory impairment and non-recurring\ncosts included in cost of sales (2)(5) 2,985 1,842 22 4,849 416 42 5,307\nAdjusted gross profit (loss) before FV\nadjustments (1) 29,919 1,588 126 31,633 (976) 2,599 33,256\nAdjusted gross margin before FV\nadjustments (1) 66% 16% 57% 56% (109%) 25% 49%\nThree months ended December 31,\n2023(8)\nGross revenue 47,942 16,951 106 64,999 323 7,285 72,607\nExcise taxes (2,860) (5,328) — (8,188) — — (8,188)\nNet revenue(1) 45,082 11,623 106 56,811 323 7,285 64,419\nNon-recurring revenue adjustments (4,5) — — — — $ — $ (872) (872)\nAdjusted net revenue 45,082 11,623 106 56,811 323 6,413 63,547\nCost of sales (23,786) (12,292) (133) (36,211) (449) (7,321) (43,981)\nDepreciation 2,665 1,340 14 4,019 48 1,052 5,119\nInventory impairment, non-recurring, out-of-\nperiod, and market development costs\nincluded in cost of sales (2)(3)(4)(6) 4,201 2,719 28 6,948 95 1,681 8,724\nAdjusted gross profit (loss) before FV\nadjustments (1) 28,162 3,390 15 31,567 17 1,825 33,409\nAdjusted gross margin before FV\nadjustments (1) 62% 29% 14% 56% 5% 28% 53%\nThree months ended March 31, 2023(7)\nGross revenue 40,592 18,956 307 59,855 488 10,754 71,097\nExcise taxes (2,681) (4,465) — (7,146) — — (7,146)\nNet revenue(1) 37,911 14,491 307 52,709 488 10,754 63,951\nCost of sales (19,549) (14,556) (173) (34,278) (646) (8,032) (42,956)\nDepreciation 2,453 1,773 21 4,247 77 877 5,201\nInventory impairment, out-of-period, and\nnon-recurring adjustments included in cost\nof sales (2)(4)(6) 2,555 1,912 25 4,492 96 233 4,821\nAdjusted gross profit (loss) before FV\nadjustments (1) 23,370 3,620 180 27,170 15 3,832 31,017\nAdjusted gross margin before FV\nadjustments (1) 60% 25% 59% 52% 3% 36% 49%\n(1) These terms are Non-GAAP Measures and are note recognized, defined or standardized measures under IFRS.

Refer to discussion under “Historical Quarterly Results” section of this MD&A for further detail.\nMedical Cannabis Adjusted Gross Margin\nAurora’s leading medical cannabis businesses in Canada, Europe and Australia continued to perform well during the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024 and delivered 90% (three months ended December 31, 2023 – 84%, three months ended March 31, 2023 – 75%) of adjusted\ngross profit before fair value adjustments. Excluding the plant propagation business, the medical cannabis business delivered 98% of the\nadjusted gross profit before fair value adjustments for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (three months ended December 31, 2023 –\n89%, three months ended March 31, 2023 – 86%) of adjusted gross profit before fair value adjustments.\nAdjusted gross margin before fair value adjustments on medical cannabis net revenue was 66% for the three months ended March 31, 2024,\ncompared to 62% in three months ended December 31, 2023, and 60% in three months ended March 31, 2023. The adjusted gross margin\nbefore fair value adjustments has improved from the comparative prior period through sustainable cost reductions, higher selling prices in\nAustralia, and improved efficiency in production operations, including shifting sourcing of Europe from Canada due to the closure of the\nCompany’s Nordic production facility.\nConsumer Cannabis Adjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted gross margin before fair value adjustments on consumer cannabis net revenue was 16% for the three months ended March 31, 2024,\ncompared to 29% in three months ended December 31, 2023 and 25% in three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in adjusted\ngross margin before fair value adjustments from the prior comparative quarter is largely due to product sales with lower margins relative to the\ncomparative prior periods.\nPlant Propagation Adjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted gross margin before fair value adjustments on plant propagation revenue was 25% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as\ncompared to 28% for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 36% in three months ended March 31, 2023.

Adjusted gross margin before fair value adjustments will fluctuate depending on sales mix\nduring the year. In fiscal 2024, sales to Australia doubled over the comparative period. However, prior to the acquisition of MedReleaf Australia\nin February 2024, the contribution margin in Australia was the lowest of Aurora’s three medical regions as Aurora did not yet own the\ndistribution part of the value chain. Subsequent to the MedReleaf Australia acquisition, margins are commensurate with the rest of Aurora’s\ninternational medical businesses.\nConsumer Cannabis Adjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted gross margin before fair value adjustments on consumer cannabis net revenue increased to 25% for the year ended March 31, 2024\nas compared to 23% for the nine months ended March 31, 2023, mainly driven by sales mix. The increase in adjusted gross margin before fair\nvalue adjustments is driven by the focus on improving margins and the increased sales of high margin brands.\n13 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nPlant Propagation Adjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted gross margin before fair value adjustments on plant propagation was 24% for the year ended March 31, 2024 compared to 26% for\nthe nine months ended March 31, 2023. The fluctuations are due to product mix of vegetables and ornamental plants. The prior year\ncomparative period represented the truncated period from the date of closing the acquisition of Bevo on August 25, 2022 and therefore not\nrepresentative of the variation of product sales that may occur throughout the quarter or year.\nOperating Expenses\nNine months\nThree months ended Year ended ended\nDecember 31,\n($ thousands) March 31, 2024 2023 March 31, 2023 March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023\nGeneral and administration 25,658 22,259 26,046 92,222 81,416\nSales and marketing 14,537 12,106 13,246 51,937 38,684\nAcquisition costs 2,970 1,567 696 5,326 5,608\nResearch and development 743 782 1,656 3,572 3,780\nDepreciation and amortization(1) 1,927 3,293 4,674 12,139 14,511\nShare-based compensation 3,029 2,839 3,620 12,717 10,764\nTotal operating expenses 48,864 42,846 49,938 177,913 154,763\n(1) During the three months ended March 31, 2024, and subsequent to the filing of the Company’s Q3 2024 condensed consolidated interim financial\nstatements, the Company noted that inventory and property, plant and equipment was understated as at December 31, 2023.

Refer to discussion under “Historical Quarterly Results” section of this MD&A for further detail.\nGeneral and administration (“G&A”)\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, G&A expense increased by $3.4 million compared to the prior quarter and decreased $0.4\nmillion compared to the prior year comparative quarter. The increase compared to the prior quarter is largely due to severance costs and\nadditional professional fees relating to public company costs incurred in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, G&A expense increased by $10.8 million compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2023 which is\nprimarily due to the current period consisting of four quarters compared to prior year which was three quarters. Adjusting for this period\ndifference, G&A costs decreased from a reduction in headcount, resulting in lower compensation costs, lower professional fees and a\nreduction in utility costs.\nSales and marketing (“S&M”)\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, S&M expense increased by $2.4 million compared to the prior quarter and increased by $1.3\nmillion compared to the prior year comparative quarter. The increases are due to freight and logistics costs, notably from sales to Europe with\nthe increase in sourcing from Canada with the closure of Nordic and incremental costs following the acquisition of MedReleaf Australia.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, S&M expense increased by $13.3 million compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2023,\nprimarily due to the current period consisting of four quarters compared to prior year which was three quarters. Otherwise, there is a slight\nincrease related to freight and logistics costs.\nResearch and development (“R&D”)\nThe Company’s investment in R&D and product innovation is partly opportunistic and its approach to R&D spend is targeted and gated. As\nsuch these costs will vary quarter over quarter and year over year.\nR&D expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was relatively consistent as compared to the prior quarter and decreased $0.9\nmillion compared to the prior year comparative quarter. The decrease compared to the prior year comparative quarter is due to a reduction in\nheadcount.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, R&D expenses was relatively consistent compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2023.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $1.4 million compared to the prior\nquarter and decreased by $2.7 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decreases relate to timing of additions of\nproperty, plant and equipment and facility disposals and asset impairment charges recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n14 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $2.4 million as compared to the prior year. This\ndecrease is primarily due to facility disposals, closures and asset impairment charges recognized in the prior year.\nShare-based compensation\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, share-based compensation expense increased by $0.2 million compared to prior quarter and\ndecreased by $0.6 million compared the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase over the prior quarter relates to reversals from\nforfeitures during the prior quarter. The decrease compared to the prior year comparative quarter is due to fewer share-based grants resulting\nfrom a reduction in headcount.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, share-based compensation expense increased by $2.0 million compared to the nine months ended\nMarch 31, 2023, which is primarily because the current period consists of four quarters whereas the prior period was three quarters. Adjusting\nfor this difference, share-based compensation expense decreased over the year because the actual forfeiture rate was higher than estimated\nin conjunction with a decrease in the fair value of share-based awards.\nThe table below outlines Adjusted SG&A for the periods ended:\nNine months\nThree months ended Year ended ended\nDecember 31,\n($ thousands) March 31, 2024 2023(2) March 31, 2023 March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023\nSales and marketing 14,537 12,106 13,246 51,937 38,684\nGeneral and administration 25,658 22,259 26,046 92,222 81,416\nBusiness transformation costs(3) (6,862) (5,150) (7,209) (22,590) (27,239)\nOut-of-period adjustments(3) (642) 214 (818) (1,236) (1,801)\nNon-recurring costs (1,093) (1,670) (2,837) (3,768) (6,243)\nMarket development costs — — (958) — (2,935)\nAdjusted SG&A (1) 31,598 27,759 27,470 116,565 81,882\n(1) Adjusted SG&A is a Non-GAAP Measure and is not a recognized, defined, or standardized measure under IFRS.

The improvement of $29.4 million is partly due to other gains and losses which was a loss of $11.6 million in the prior year\ncomparative quarter compared to a gain of $12.1 million in the current quarter. The gain in the current quarter is primarily from a fair value\nadjustment for the acquisition of Thrive, in which the contingent consideration was zero based on not achieving the requisite performance\nmilestones. Finance costs decreased by $6.5 million in the current quarter compared to the prior year comparative quarter, as the convertible\ndebentures have been settled over the last two years. In addition, the impairment of intangible assets and goodwill and property, plant and\n15 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nequipment was $32.9 million and $3.0 million, respectively for the current quarter compared to $20.6 million and $12.1 million, respectively in\nthe prior year comparative quarter.\nOther expenses for the year ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023 was $13.1 million and $51.3 million, respectively.\nThe improvement of $38.2 million is largely due to a reduction in finance costs of $15.3 million related to the extinguishment of the convertible\ndebentures throughout the year and a reversal of a $12.4 million provision. The provision was established to account for uncertainty regarding\neligibility of the government grant that was rolled out expeditiously in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and was reversed upon the\nconclusion of a Canada Revenue Agency audit with no findings.\nNet Loss\nNet loss from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $20.8 million compared to net loss of $76.2 million for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in net loss of $55.4 million compared to prior quarter is primarily due to: (i) increase in\ngross profit of $27.3 million (ii) decrease in operating expenses by $1.1 million and (iii) decrease in other expenses by $29.4 million\n.\nNet loss from continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2024 was $59.0 million compared to $183.2 million for the nine months\nended March 31, 2023. The decrease in net loss of $124.2 million was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $123.8 million, decrease\nin operating expense of $23.2 million and decrease in other expenses of $38.2 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe following is the Company’s adjusted EBITDA:\nNine months\nThree months ended Year ended ended\n($ thousands) March 31, 2024 Decemb 2e 0r 2 3 31 (7, ) March 31, 2023(6) March 20 3 21 4, Mar 2c 0h 2 3 31 (6, )\nNet income (loss) from continuing operations (20,793) (17,755) (76,150) (59,045) (183,228)\nIncome tax expense (recovery) (711) (67) (3,109) (554) (15,184)\nOther income (expense) 18,785 (199) 48,149 13,146 51,303\nShare-based compensation 3,029 2,839 3,620 12,717 10,764\nDepreciation and amortization 6,328 8,411 9,875 32,225 28,995\nAcquisition costs 2,970 1,567 696 5,326 5,608\nInventory and biological assets fair value and\nimpairment adjustments (16,940) (479) 6,719 (25,345) 64,862\nBusiness transformation related charges (1) 7,539 5,132 7,253 25,189 28,202\nOut-of-period adjustments (2) (185) 613 1,333 1,236 2,316\nNon-recurring items (3) 1,869 5,107 2,425 7,859 2,608\nMarkets under development (4) — — 1,172 — 3,308\nAdjusted EBITDA (5) 1,891 5,169 1,983 12,754 (446)\n(1) Business transformation related charges includes costs related to closed facilities, certain IT project costs, costs associated with the repurposing of Sky,\nseverance and retention costs in connection with the business transformation plan, costs associated with the retention of certain medical aggregators.\nSome prior period amounts have been adjusted for changes in presentation.\n(2) Out-of-period adjustments reflect adjustments to net loss for the financial impact of transactions recorded in the current period that relate to prior periods.\nSome prior period amounts have been adjusted for changes in presentation.\n(3) Non-recurring items includes one-time excise tax refunds, non-core adjusted wholesale bulk margins, inventory count adjustments resulting from facility\nshutdowns and inter-site transfers, litigation and non-recurring project costs.\n(4) Markets under development represents the adjustment for business operations focused on developing international markets prior to commercialization.\n(5) Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP Measure and is not a recognized, defined, or standardized measure under IFRS.

Refer to the “Cautionary Statement\nRegarding Certain Non-GAAP Performance Measures” section of this MD&A.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company primarily financed its operations, capital expenditures and growth initiatives through the\ngeneration of net revenue, working capital, equity offerings, and cash on hand. For more information on key cash flows related to operations,\ninvesting and financing activities during the quarter, refer to the “Cash Flow Highlights” discussion below.\nThe Company’s objective when managing its liquidity and capital resources is to maintain sufficient liquidity to support financial obligations\nwhen they come due, while executing operating and strategic plans. The Company manages liquidity risk through the management of its\ncapital structure and resources to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to settle obligations and liabilities when they are due. Our ability to fund\nour operating requirements depends on future operating performance and cash flows, which are subject to economic, financial, competitive,\nbusiness and regulatory conditions, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our primary short-term liquidity needs are to fund\nour net operating losses and capital expenditures to maintain existing facilities, loans and borrowings repayments and lease payments. Our\nmedium-term liquidity needs primarily relate to lease payments and our long-term liquidity needs primarily relate to potential strategic plans.\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company has access to the following capital resources available to fund operations and obligations:\n• $113.4 million cash and cash equivalents; and\n• access to the 2023 Shelf Prospectus (as defined below). The Company currently has access to securities registered for sale under\nthe 2023 Shelf Prospectus currently covering U.S.$650.0 million of issuable securities. Of the U.S.$650.0 million of securities\nregistered under the 2023 Shelf Prospectus and corresponding registration statement on form F-10 filed with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission in the U.S., approximately U.S.$225.3 million is allocated to the potential exercise of currently outstanding\nwarrants issued in financing transactions from 2022. Following the closing of the bought deal offering on October 3, 2023 and the\nexpiration of warrants during the year approximately U.S.$396.4 million is available for potential new issuances of Common Shares,\nwarrants, options, subscription receipts, debt securities or any combination thereof during the 25-month period that the 2023 Shelf\nProspectus remains effective. Volatility in the cannabis industry, stock market and the Company’s share price may impact the\namount and our ability to raise financing under the 2023 Shelf Prospectus.\nBased on all of the aforementioned factors, the Company believes that its reduction of operating costs, current liquidity position, and access to\nthe 2023 Shelf Prospectus are adequate to fund operating activities and cash commitments for investing, financing and strategic activities for\nthe foreseeable future. In addition, the Company could access restricted cash of $61.4 million relating to its self-insurance policy, if necessary.\nCash Flow Highlights\nThe table below summarizes the Company’s cash flows, including discontinued operations:\nNine months\nThree months ended Year ended ended\n($ thousands) March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023 March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023\nCash used in operating activities (21,125) (20,437) (68,508) (115,805)\nCash used in investing activities (6,237) (3,461) (5,487) (27,307)\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities 399 1,518 (47,923) (56,478)\nEffect of foreign exchange 1,187 (477) 297 11,654\nDecrease in cash and cash equivalents (25,776) (22,857) (121,621) (187,936)\nCash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased by $0.7 million to $21.1 million compared to the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023.

The improvement of $47.3 million is a combination of increased net revenue and profit margin due to the\ncomparative period consisting of three quarters whereas the current period is for four quarters. Adjusting for this, there was also a reduction in\noperating expenses as a result of the fiscal 2022 restructuring initiative.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2024 was $5.5 million compared to cash used of $27.3 million during the nine\nmonths ended March 31, 2023. The decrease of $21.8 million in cash used primarily relates to the costs of business acquisitions which were\n$2.5 million in the current period compared to $38.8 million in the prior period. In addition, discontinued operations used $0.3 million in the\ncurrent period compared to $2.8 million in the prior period.\nCash used in financing activities was $47.9 million during the year ended March 31, 2024 compared to $56.5 million for the nine months ended\nMarch 31, 2023. In the current period, the repayment of convertible debentures was $91.6 million compared to a repayment of $128.7 million\nin the prior period. This was partially offset by proceeds from share issuances of $37.9 million compared to proceeds of $73.2 million in the\ncomparative prior period.

The judge rendered a decision on August 24,\n2023 on Aurora’s motion to dismiss. On September 8, 2023, the Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration as to the stock drop that occurred\nfollowing Aurora’s September 2019 financials. Aurora opposed this motion. Mediation was held and a tentative settlement was reached on\nMarch 4, 2024. The proposed settlement must now be approved by a court.\nOn June 16, 2020, the Company and its subsidiary, ACE, were named in a purported class action proceeding in the Province of Alberta in\nrelation to the alleged mislabeling of cannabis products with inaccurate THC/CBD content. The class action involves a number of other parties\nincluding Aleafia Health Inc., Hexo Corp, Tilray Canada Ltd., among others, and alleges that upon laboratory testing, certain cannabis products\nwere found to have lower THC potency than the labeled amount, suggesting, among other things, that plastic containers may be leeching\ncannabinoids. While this matter is ongoing, the Company disputes the allegations and intends to vigorously defend against the claims.\nEstimating an amount or range of possible losses resulting from litigation proceedings is inherently difficult, particularly where the matters\ninvolve indeterminate claims for monetary damages and are in the stages of the proceedings where key factual and legal issues have not been\nresolved. For these reasons, the Company is currently unable to predict the ultimate timing or outcome of or reasonably estimate the possible\nlosses or a range of possible losses resulting from the matter described above.\nOn June 15, 2020, a claim was commenced by a party to a former term sheet with the King's Bench of Alberta against Aurora and a former\nofficer alleging a claim of breach of obligations under said term sheet, with the plaintiff seeking $18.0 million in damages. While this matter is\nongoing, the Company believes the action to be without merit and intends to defend the claim.\nOn August 10, 2020, a purported class action lawsuit was filed with the King's Bench of Alberta against Aurora and certain executive officers in\nthe Province of Alberta on behalf of persons or entities who purchased, or otherwise acquired, publicly traded Aurora securities and suffered\nlosses as a result of Aurora releasing statements containing misrepresentations during the period of September 11, 2019 and December 21,\n2019.

For these reasons, the Company is currently unable to predict the ultimate timing or outcome of or reasonably estimate the possible\nlosses or a range of possible losses resulting from the matter described above.\nOn January 4, 2021, a civil claim was filed with the King’s Bench of Alberta against Aurora and Hempco by a former landlord regarding unpaid\nrent in the amount of $8.9 million, representing approximately $0.4 million for rent in arrears and costs, plus $8.5 million for loss of rent and\nremainder of the term. The Company filed a statement of defence on March 24, 2021. Plaintiffs brought an Application seeking summary\njudgment as against the Company and the Company has filed Affidavit evidence in response. Cross-examinations for the Company’s affiants\nand for Plaintiff’s affiant have been completed. While this matter is ongoing, the Company intends to continue to defend against the claims.\nOn November 1, 2022, a claim was commenced by a former employee of Aurora against Aurora Cannabis Enterprises Inc. and another former\nemployee of Aurora (the “Defendant Employee”). The plaintiffs claim that the Defendant Employee entered a lease for a property owned by the\nplaintiffs in January 2017 and states that Aurora was a guarantor for the Defendant Employee. The claim states that the Defendant Employee\nleft the property and caused damage. The plaintiffs further claim outstanding rent and legal fees. There is no record of any documentation of\nAurora being a party to any such relationship. Plaintiffs have received a summary judgment against the Defendant Employee and will now\nattempt to recover their judgment against the Defendant Employee. Plaintiffs will then decide whether to pursue the indemnity claim against\nthe Company. The Company disputes the allegations and intends to defend against the claims.\nOn November 15. 2022. the Company, its subsidiary ACE, and MedReleaf Corp. (which amalgamated with ACE in July 2020) were named in a\npurported class action proceeding in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. The purported class action claims that the Company failed to warn\nof certain risks purported to be associated with the consumption of cannabis. The statement of claim was served upon the Company on\nNovember 22, 2022 and a statement of defence was filed and served. The next major step in the process is scheduling a timetable for the\nremaining deliverables of the process, including delivery of the plaintiff’s certification motion record. The plaintiff must either deliver their\ncertification materials or come to an agreement with the Aurora Defendants on a timetable for doing so within one year of commencing the\nproposed class action. On January 24, 2024, the plaintiff’s delivered their motion record regarding class certification. We are reviewing and will\nestablish our timeline for responding which will not be before June 2024. The Company disputes the allegations and intends to defend against\nthe claims.\nThe Company is subject to litigation and similar claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims related to employment, human\nresources, product liability and commercial disputes. The Company has received notice of, or are aware of, certain possible claims against us\nwhere the magnitude of such claims is negligible, or it is not currently possible for us to predict the outcome of such claims, possible claims or\nlawsuits due to various factors including: the preliminary nature of some claims; an incomplete factual record; and the unpredictable nature of\nopposing parties and their demands. Management is of the opinion, based upon legal assessments and information presently available, that it\nis unlikely that any of these claims would result in liability to the Company, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, would\nhave a material effect on the consolidated financial statements, other than the claims described above.\nIn respect of the aforementioned claims, as at March 31, 2024 the Company has recognized total provisions of $2.3 million (March 31, 2023 –\n$1.0 million) in provisions on the consolidated statements of financial position and a settlement accrual for nil (March 31, 2023 – $1.0 million)\nin accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial position.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nAs at the date of this MD&A, the Company has $0.9 million letters of credit outstanding with the Bank of Montreal. There are no other material\noff-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the financial performance or financial\ncondition of the Company.\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe Company’s key management personnel consists of the Company’s executive management team and management directors who,\ncollectively, have the authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Company. Compensation expense\nfor key management personnel was as follows:\nThree months ended Year ended Nine months ended\n($ thousands) March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023 March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023\nShort-term employment benefits (1) 1,773 1,494 10,440 5,454\nLong-term employment benefits 10 13 41 31\nTermination benefits 1,089 — 1,089 489\nDirectors’ fees (2) 68 103 322 273\nShare-based compensation (3) 2,360 3,207 10,218 8,886\nTotal management compensation (4) 5,300 4,817 22,110 15,133\n(1) As of March 31, 2024, $1.8 million is payable or accrued for key management compensation (March 31, 2023 - $1.2 million).\n(2) Share-based compensation represent the fair value of options granted and vested to key management personnel and directors of the Company under the\nCompany’s share-based compensation plans (Note 19). Director DSUs are included in share-based compensation.\n(3) As of March 31, 2024, there are 10 key management personnel (March 31, 2023 - 14).\n19 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nIn connection with the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of CannaHealth, the Company paid $21.9 million to the minority\ninterest of a consolidated subsidiary. The allocation of the consideration paid was determined to be solely deferred compensation, which is\nbeing amortized over a five year period. During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company recognized amortization expense of $3.8 million\n(nine months ended March 31, 2023 - $1.9 million) in the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company entered into an unsecured Pari Passu Creditor Agreement with Bevo, in which\nparticipating shareholders of Bevo provided the funds pursuant to the Creditor Agreement. The Creditor Agreement was for a total loan of\n$5.0 million and bears interest at a rate of 14.0% per annum. As at March 31, 2024, $4.8 million of the funds pursuant to the Creditt Agreement\nwere received. The principal and accrued interest are due on May 31, 2025. The Company, advanced funds of $2.5 million, which is eliminated\nupon consolidation.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements under IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions\nabout the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated\nassumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these\nestimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period\nin which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the revision affects\nboth current and future periods.\nSignificant judgments, estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements are as follows:\nBiological Assets\nThe Company defines biological assets as cannabis plants up to the point of harvest. Biological assets are measured at fair value less costs to\nsell at the end of each reporting period in accordance with IAS 41, Agriculture using the income approach. The Company utilizes an income\napproach to determine the fair value less cost to sell at a specific measurement date, based on the existing plants’ stage of completion up to\nthe point of harvest.\nInputs and assumptions Description Correlation between inputs and fair value\nAverage selling price per Represents the average selling price per gram net of excise taxes, where If the average selling price per gram were higher\ngram applicable, for the period for all strains of cannabis sold, which is expected (lower), estimated fair value would increase\nto approximate future selling prices. (decrease).\nAverage selling price per Represents the average selling price per plant, which is expected to If the average selling price per plant were higher\nplant approximate future selling prices or committed purchase plans. (lower), estimated fair value would increase\n(decrease).\nAverage attrition rate Represents the weighted average number of plants culled at each stage of If the average attrition rate was lower (higher),\nproduction. estimated fair value would increase (decrease).\nWeighted average yield per Represents the weighted average number of grams of dried cannabis If the average yield per plant was higher (lower),\nplant inventory expected to be harvested from each cannabis plant. estimated fair value would increase (decrease).\nStandard cost per gram to Based on actual production costs incurred divided by the grams produced If the standard cost per gram to complete\ncomplete production in the period. production was lower (higher), estimated fair value\nwould increase (decrease).\nWeighted average effective Represents the estimated loss in fair value due to harvested product not If the weighted average effective yield were higher\nyield meeting specifications. (lower), the estimated fair value would increase\n(decrease).\nStage of completion in the Calculated by taking the weighted average number of days in production If the number of days in production was higher\nproduction process over a total average grow cycle of the specific plant. (lower), estimated fair value would increase\n(decrease).\nSignificant assumptions used in the fair value of biological assets include (i) the average selling price per gram; (ii) the weighted average yield\nper plant; (iii) weighted average effective yield; and (iv) the standard cost per gram to complete production. Refer to Note 8 for sensitivities and\nthe impact of changes to these significant assumptions on the fair value of biological assets.\nProduction costs are capitalized to biological assets and include all direct and indirect costs relating to biological transformation. Costs include\ndirect costs of production, such as labour, growing materials, as well as indirect costs such as indirect labour and benefits, quality control\ncosts, depreciation on production equipment, and overhead expenses including rent and utilities.\nInventory\nCannabis inventory is transferred from biological assets at fair value less costs to sell at the point of harvest, which becomes the deemed cost.\nBy-products, such as trim, are measured at their net realizable value (“NRV”) at point of harvest which is deducted from the total deemed cost\nto give a net cost for the primary product. Any subsequent post-harvest costs are capitalized to cannabis inventory to the extent that the cost is\nless than NRV. NRV for work-in-process (“WIP”) and finished cannabis inventory is determined by deducting estimated remaining conversion/\n20 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\ncompletion costs and selling costs from the estimated sale price achievable in the ordinary course of business. Products for resale,\nconsumable supplies and accessories are initially recognized at cost and subsequently valued at the lower of cost and NRV. The Company\nuses judgment in determining the NRV of inventory. When assessing NRV, the Company considers the impact of price fluctuation, inventory\nspoilage, inventory excess, age, and damage.\nImpairment of property, plant and equipment\nRefer to Note 14 in the 2024 Consolidated Financial Statements for significant assumptions applied in the determination of the recoverable\namount of cash generating units (“CGU”).\nThe Company assesses impairment of property, plant and equipment when an impairment indicator arises (e.g. change in use or\ndiscontinued use, obsolescence or physical damage). When the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those\nfrom other assets or group of assets, the asset is tested at the CGU level. In assessing impairment, the Company compares the carrying\namount of the asset or CGU to the recoverable amount, which is determined as the higher of the asset or CGU’s fair value less costs of\ndisposal and its value-in-use. Value-in-use is assessed based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a\npre-tax discount rate that reflects applicable market and economic conditions, the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. An\nimpairment loss is recognized whenever the carrying amount of the asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount and is recorded in the\nconsolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss.\nImpairment of intangible assets and goodwill\nRefer to Note 14 in the 2024 Consolidated Financial Statements for significant assumptions applied in the determination of the recoverable\namount of the CGU.\nGoodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life or not yet available for use are tested for impairment at the end of each fiscal period, and\nwhenever events or circumstances that make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse\nchange in the business climate or a decision to sell or dispose all or a portion of a reporting unit. Finite life intangible assets are tested\nwhenever there is an indication of impairment.\nGoodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are tested at each fiscal period end for impairment by comparing the carrying value of each CGU\ncontaining the assets to its recoverable amount. Indefinite life intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value of\neach CGU containing the assets to its recoverable amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment based on the level at which it is monitored by\nmanagement, and not at a level higher than an operating segment. The Company’s goodwill is allocated to the Canadian Cannabis operating\nsegment and the international cannabis operating segment, which represents the lowest level at which management monitors goodwill. The\nallocation of goodwill to the CGUs or group of CGUs requires the use of judgment.\nAn impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the operating segment or CGU’s carrying amount exceeds it recoverable amount.\nThe recoverable amounts of the CGUs’ assets have been determined based on the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use.\nThere is a material degree of uncertainty with respect to the estimates of the recoverable amounts of the CGU, given the necessity of making\nkey economic assumptions about the future. Impairment losses recognized in respect of a CGU are first allocated to the carrying value of\ngoodwill and any excess is allocated to the carrying value of assets in the CGU. Any impairment is recorded in profit and loss in the period in\nwhich the impairment is identified. A reversal of an asset impairment loss is allocated to the assets of the CGU on a pro rata basis. In allocating\na reversal of an impairment loss, the carrying amount of an asset shall not be increased above the lower of its recoverable amount and the\ncarrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior period. Impairment losses on\ngoodwill are not subsequently reversed.\nBusiness combinations\nRefer to Note 12 in the 2024 Consolidated Financial Statements for significant assumptions applied in the determination of the fair value of\nall identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the acquisition of Indica Industries Pty Ltd (“MedReleaf Australia”).\nIn determining the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the most significant estimates generally relate to\ncontingent consideration, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Management exercises judgment in estimating the probability\nand timing of when earn-out milestones are expected to be achieved, which is used as the basis for estimating fair value. The fair value of the\nidentified intangible assets are calculated using appropriate valuation techniques which are generally based on a forecast of the total expected\nfuture net cash flows of the acquiree. Valuations are highly dependent on the inputs used and assumptions made by management regarding\nthe future performance of these assets and any changes in the discount rate applied.\nShare-based compensation\nDepending on the complexity of the specific stock option and warrant terms, the fair value of options and warrants is calculated using either the\nBlack-Scholes option pricing model or the Binomial model. When determining the fair value of stock options and warrants, management is\nrequired to make certain assumptions and estimates related to expected lives, volatility, risk-free rate, future dividend yields and estimated\nforfeitures at the initial grant date. Changes in assumptions used to estimate fair value could result in materially different results.\n21 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nDeferred tax assets\nSignificant estimates are required in determining the Company’s provision for income taxes and uncertain tax positions. Some of these\nestimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. Various internal and external factors may have favorable or\nunfavorable effects on the Company’s future effective tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in tax laws, regulations\nand/or rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, changes in estimates of prior years’ items, results of tax audits by tax\nauthorities, future levels of research and development spending, changes in estimates related to repatriation of undistributed earnings of\nforeign subsidiaries, and changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required on\ndeferred tax assets often requires significant judgment with regard to management’s assessment of the long-range forecast of future taxable\nincome and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period\nwhen such assessments are made.\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe individual fair values attributed to the different components of a financing transaction, notably marketable securities, derivative financial\ninstruments, put options, convertible debentures and loans, are determined using valuation techniques. The Company uses judgment to select\nthe methods used to make certain assumptions and derive estimates. Significant judgment is also used when attributing to fair values to each\ncomponent of a transaction upon initial recognition, measuring fair values for certain instruments on a recurring basis and disclosing the fair\nvalues of financial instruments subsequently carried at amortized cost. These valuation estimates could be significantly different because of\nthe use of judgment and the inherent uncertainty in estimating the fair value of instruments that are not quoted or observable in an active\nmarket. Information about valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of financial instruments is disclosed in Note 28 of\nthe Financial Statements.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nIAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements\nThe amendment clarifies that entities should disclosure material accounting policies instead of significant accounting policies. The\namendments explains how to identify material accounting policies. An accounting policy is material if it can reasonably be expected to\ninfluence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements. The\nCompany has reviewed its accounting policies and has included those which were considered to be material.\nIFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts\nIFRS 17 establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts within the scope of\nthe standard. The objective of IFRS 17 is to ensure that an entity provides relevant information that faithfully represents those contracts. The\nstandard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The Company does not currently have any contracts to be\naccounted for under this standard. However, the Company has a wholly owned captive insurance entity that is required to adopt this standard\nwhen reporting on a standalone basis. The impact of the captive insurance company adopting IFRS 17 was immaterial to the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nThe following IFRS standards have been recently issued by the IASB. Pronouncements that are irrelevant or not expected to have a significant\nimpact have been excluded.\nAmendments to IAS 1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\nThe amendment clarifies the requirements relating to determining if a liability should be presented as current or non-current in the statement of\nfinancial position. Under the new requirement, the assessment of whether a liability is presented as current or non-current is based on the\ncontractual arrangements in place as at the reporting date and does not impact the amount or timing of recognition. The amendment applies\nretrospectively for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. The Company will make this assessment as required at the\nend of each reporting date.\n22 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nFinancial Instruments\nFinancial instruments are measured either at fair value or at amortized cost. The table below lists the valuation methods used to determine the\nfair value of each financial instrument.\nFair Value Method\nFinancial Instruments Measured at Fair Value\nMarketable securities Closing market price of Common Shares as of the measurement date (Level 1)\nDerivatives Closing market price (Level 1) or Black-Scholes, Binomial, Monte-Carlo & FINCAD\nvaluation model (Level 2 or 3)\nContingent consideration payable Discounted cash flow model (Level 3)\nOther long term liability Discounted cash flow model (Level 3)\nDerivative liability Closing market price of warrants (Level 1) or Kynex valuation model (Level 2)\nFinancial Instruments Measured at Amortized Cost\nCash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts Carrying amount (approximates fair value due to short-term nature)\nreceivable, loans receivable\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities, other current and Carrying amount (approximates fair value due to short-term nature)\nlong-term liabilities, loans and borrowings\nLease receivable, convertible debentures, loans and Carrying value discounted at the effective interest rate which approximates fair value\nborrowings, and lease liabilities.\nSummary of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying values of the financial instruments at March 31, 2024 are summarized in the following table:\n($ thousands) Amortized cost FVTPL Total\n$ $ $\nFinancial Assets\nCash and cash equivalents 113,439 — 113,439\nRestricted cash 65,782 — 65,782\nAccounts receivable, excluding sales taxes and lease receivable 41,440 — 41,440\nMarketable securities — 4,036 4,036\nDerivatives — 760 760\nLease receivable 8,803 — 8,803\nFinancial Liabilities\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 58,563 — 58,563\nLease liabilities 47,532 — 47,532\nDerivative liability — 2,309 2,309\nLoans and borrowings 57,259 — 57,259\nFair Value Hierarchy\nFinancial instruments recorded at fair value are classified using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs to fair value\nmeasurements. The three levels of hierarchy are:\nLevel 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.\n23 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nThe following is a summary of financial instruments measured at fair value segregated based on the various levels of inputs as at March 31,\n2024:\n($ thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAs at March 31, 2024\nMarketable securities 4,036 — — 4,036\nDerivative assets (1) — 760 — 760\nOther long term liability 591 — 45,519 46,110\nDerivative liability (2) 1,698 611 — 2,309\nAs at March 31, 2023\nDerivative assets (1) — 7,114 135 7,249\nContingent consideration payable — — 12,487 12,487\nOther long term liability 409 — 47,638 48,047\nDerivative liability (2) 9,634 — — 9,634\n(1) For a reconciliation of realized and unrealized gains and losses applicable to financial assets measured at fair value for the year ended and nine months\nended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 respectively, refer to Note 7 the Financial Statements.\n(2) For a reconciliation of unrealized gains and losses applicable to financial liabilities measured at fair value for the year and nine months ended March 31,\n2024 and March 31, 2023 respectively, refer to Note 15 and Note 18(c) in the Financial Statements.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, certain marketable securities were reclassified from Level 2 to Level 1 hierarchy as trading restrictions\nwere removed and the fair value is now determined based on observable inputs.\n24 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nFinancial Instruments Risk\nThe Company is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks. The Company’s board of directors mitigates\nthese risks by assessing, monitoring and approving the Company’s risk management processes.\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of a potential loss to the Company if a customer or third party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual\nobligations. The Company is moderately exposed to credit risk from its cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and loans receivable.\nThe risk exposure is limited to their carrying amounts reflected on the consolidated statements of financial position. The risk for cash and cash\nequivalents is mitigated by holding these instruments with highly rated Canadian financial institutions. Certain restricted funds in the amount of\n$38.8 million are retained by an insurer under the Segregated Accounts Companies Act governed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority. As the\nCompany does not invest in asset-backed deposits or investments, it does not expect any credit losses. The Company periodically assesses\nthe quality of its investments and is satisfied with the credit rating of the financial institutions and the investment grade of its Guaranteed\nInvestment Certificates (“GICs”). The Company mitigates the credit risk associated with the loans receivable by managing and monitoring the\nunderlying business relationship.\nThe Company provides credit to certain customers in the normal course of business and has established credit evaluation and monitoring\nprocesses to mitigate credit risk. Credit risk is generally limited for receivables from government bodies, which generally have low default risk.\nCredit risk for non-government customers is assessed on a case-by-case basis and a provision is recorded where required. As of March 31,\n2024, $22.8 million of accounts receivable, net of allowances, are from non-government wholesale customers (March 31, 2023 – $20.9\nmillion).\nAs at March 31, 2024, two customers made up 10% or more of trade accounts receivable (March 31, 2023 – three customers).\nAs at March 31, 2024, the provision for estimated credit losses is $1.3 million (March 31, 2023 – $3.4 million). During the year ended March\n31, 2024, the Company wrote off $2.1 million (March 31, 2023 – $5.0 million), and recognized an additional provision for estimated credit\nlosses of nil (nine months ended March 31, 2023 – nil) recorded in the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss.\nFor the periods indicated, the Company’s aging of trade receivables were as follows:\n($ thousands) March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023\n0 – 60 days 33,239 28,355\n61+ days 7,303 6,661\n40,542 35,016\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations associated with its financial liabilities when they are\ndue. The Company’s objective is to manage liquidity risk through the management of its capital structure and resources to ensure that it has\nsufficient liquidity to settle obligations and liabilities when they are due, while executing on its operating and strategic plans. Refer to “Liquidity\nand Capital Resources” section of this MD&A for detailed discussion.\nThe Company’s contractual cash flows from lease receivables was as follows:\n($ thousands) March 31, 2024\n$\nNext 12 months 2,897\nOver 1 year to 2 years 2,023\nOver 2 years to 3 years 1,919\nOver 3 years to 4 years 1,628\nOver 4 years to 5 years 1,046\nThereafter 504\nTotal undiscounted lease payments receivable 10,017\nUnearned finance income (1,214)\nTotal lease receivable 8,803\nCurrent (2,460)\nLong-term 6,343\nMarket risk\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in the market related factors, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Company’s\n(loss) income or the fair value of its financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk\nexposures within acceptable parameters.\n25 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\n(i) Currency risk\nThe operating results and financial position of the Company are reported in Canadian dollars. As the Company operates internationally, certain\nof the Company’s financial instruments and transactions are denominated in currencies other than the Canadian dollar. The results of the\nCompany’s operations are, therefore, subject to currency transaction and translation risks.\nThe Company’s main risk is associated with fluctuations in Euros, Australian dollars and U.S. dollars. The Company holds cash in Canadian\ndollars, U.S. dollars, Australian dollars and Euros; U.S.$0.4 million (March 31, 2023 – U.S.$7.1 million) of warrant derivative liabilities\nexercisable in U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated based on the Company’s foreign currency translation policy.\nThe Company has determined that as at March 31, 2024, the effect of a 10% increase or decrease in Euros, Australian dollars, and U.S.\ndollars against the Canadian dollar on financial assets and liabilities would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $1.9 million\n(March 31, 2023 – $15.2 million) to net loss and $6.7 million (March 31, 2023 – $11.4 million) to consolidated statements of loss and\ncomprehensive loss for the nine months ended March 31, 2023.\n(ii) Interest rate risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.\nCash and cash equivalents bear interest at market rates. During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company’s financial liabilities consisted\nof long-term fixed rate debt.\n(iii) Price risk\nPrice risk is the risk of variability in fair value due to movements in equity or market prices. The Company’s warrant derivative liabilities,\nmarketable securities and investments are susceptible to price risk arising from uncertainties about their future outlook, future values and the\nimpact of market conditions. The fair value of warrant derivative liabilities, marketable securities and derivative investments held in publicly\ntraded entities are based on quoted market prices which the warrants or investment shares can be exchanged for. The fair value of marketable\nsecurities and derivatives held in privately-held entities are based on various valuation techniques, as detailed in Note 28, and is dependent on\nthe type and terms of the security.\nIf the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities were to increase or decrease by 10% as of March 31, 2024, the Company would incur\nan associated increase or decrease in loss and comprehensive loss of approximately nil (March 31, 2023 – $2.5 million).

This company was incorporated in 2013 and our\nbusiness began operations in 2015. We started generating revenue from the sale of cannabis in January 2016. Due to the disruption and\nslower than anticipated growth of the cannabis market globally and in Canada, we are subject to all of the associated business risks and\nuncertainties which include, but are not limited to, under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financial and\nother resources, and lack of revenues.\nWe have incurred operating losses in recent periods. We may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability and may continue to incur\nsignificant losses in the future. In addition, as we explore and implement initiatives to grow our business, we expect to continue to increase\noperating expenses. If our revenues do not increase to offset these expected increases in costs and operating expenses, we may not be\nprofitable. It may make it difficult for investors to evaluate our prospects for success, based on our operating history. There is no assurance\nthat we will be successful in achieving a return on shareholders’ investments and the likelihood of success is uncertain.\nOur business is reliant on the good standing of our licenses.\nOur ability to continue our business of cannabis cultivation, storage, and distribution is dependent on the good standing of all of our licenses,\nauthorizations, and permits and adherence to all regulatory requirements related to such activities. We will incur ongoing costs and obligations\nrelated to regulatory compliance. Any failure to comply with the terms of the licenses, or to renew the licenses after their expiry dates, would\nhave a material adverse impact on the financial conditions and operations of the business. Although we believe that we will meet the\nrequirements of the Cannabis Act (S.C. 2018, c. 16) (the \"Cannabis Act\") for future extensions or renewals of the licenses, there can be no\nassurance that the Canadian Ministry of Health for Canada (“Health Canada”) will extend or renew the licenses, or if extended or renewed, that\nthey will be extended or renewed on the same or similar terms. Should Health Canada or the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) not extend or\nrenew the licenses, or should they renew the licenses on different terms, our business, financial condition and operations would be materially\nadversely affected. The same risks may arise when expanding our operations to foreign jurisdictions.\nWe are committed to regulatory compliance, including but not limited to the maintenance of good production practices and physical security\nmeasures required by Health Canada. Failure to comply with regulations may result in additional costs for corrective measures, penalties, or\nrestrictions on our operations. In addition, changes in regulations, more vigorous enforcement thereof, or other unanticipated events could\nrequire changes to our operations, increased compliance costs or give rise to material liabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and operations.\nOur Canadian licenses are reliant on our established sites.\nThe Canadian licenses we hold are specific to individual facilities. Any adverse changes or disruptions to the functionality, security and\nsanitation of our sites or any other form of non-compliance may put our licenses at risk, and ultimately adversely impact our business, financial\ncondition and operations. As our operations and financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to keep up with such\nrequirements, we are committed to the maintenance of our sites and intend to comply with Health Canada and their inspectors as required.\nAs our business continues to grow, any expansion to or update of our current operating sites, will require the approval of Health Canada.\nThere is no guarantee that Health Canada will approve any such expansions and/or renovations, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated business and any failure or significant delay in obtaining applicable regulatory approvals could\nadversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nOur business and activities are heavily regulated in all jurisdictions where we carry on business. Achievement of our business objectives is\ncontingent, in part, upon compliance with the regulatory requirements enacted by applicable government authorities, including those imposed\nby Health Canada, and obtaining all applicable regulatory approvals, where necessary. We cannot predict the time required to secure all\nappropriate regulatory approvals for our products, or with respect to any activities or our facilities, or the extent of testing and documentation\nthat may be required by government authorities on an ongoing basis. The impact of regulatory compliance regimes and any delays in\nobtaining, maintaining or renewing, or failure to obtain, maintain or renew, regulatory approvals may significantly delay or impact the\ndevelopment of our business and operations. Non-compliance could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition\nand operations.\nOn December 5, 2023, Health Canada published new guidance on cannabis products with what it deems to be intoxicating cannabinoids other\nthan THC. The guidance identifies the cannabinoids CBN and THCV as “intoxicating” and recommends that they be regulated in the same\nmanner as THC, whose potency is capped in the edible and extract categories. While the guidance encourages licensed processors to follow\nrecommended controls, it does not mandate any action and does not have the force of law without legislative change. The guidance does,\nhowever, create some uncertainty regarding the manner in which certain cannabinoids may be regulated in the future.\nChange in the laws, regulations, and guidelines that impact our business may cause adverse effects on our operations.\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws, regulations, and guidelines relating to the marketing, manufacturing, management, transportation,\nstorage, sale, packaging and labeling, disposal and, if necessary, acquisition of cannabis. We are also subject to laws, regulations, and\nguidelines relating to health and safety, the conduct of operations, taxation of products and the protection of the environment. As the laws,\nregulations and guidelines pertaining to the cannabis industry are relatively new, it is possible that significant legislative amendments may still\nbe enacted – either provincially or federally – that address current or future regulatory issues or perceived inadequacies in the regulatory\nframework. It is also possible that laws that impact our business may not develop as we expect or on the timeline we expect, including the\nfederal legalization of cannabis use in the U.S. if and when it occurs. Changes to such laws, regulations, and guidelines, may cause material\nadverse effects on our business, financial condition and operations.\n30 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nThe legislative framework pertaining to the Canadian non-medical cannabis market is subject to significant provincial and territorial regulation.\nThe legal framework varies across provinces and territories and results in asymmetric regulatory and market environments. Different\ncompetitive pressures, additional compliance requirements, and other costs may limit our ability to participate in such markets.\nFailure to comply with anti-money laundering laws and regulation could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to a variety of domestic and international laws and regulations pertaining to money laundering, financial recordkeeping and\nproceeds of crime, including the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (Canada), as amended and the rules and\nregulations thereunder, the Criminal Code (Canada) and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or\nenforced by governmental authorities internationally.\nIn the event that any of our operations or investments, any proceeds thereof, any dividends or distributions therefrom, or any profits or\nrevenues accruing from such operations or investments were found to be in violation of money laundering legislation or otherwise, such\ntransactions may be viewed as proceeds of crime under one or more of the statutes noted above or any other applicable legislation, and any\npersons, including such U.S. based investors, found to be aiding and abetting us in such violations could be subject to liability. Any violations of\nthese laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and involve significant\ncosts and expenses, including legal fees. We could also suffer severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other\nremedial measures. This could restrict or otherwise jeopardize our ability to declare or pay dividends, effect other distributions or subsequently\nrepatriate such funds back to Canada.\nWe compete for market share with a number of competitors and many of our competitors may have longer operating histories, more\nfinancial resources, and lower costs than us.\nAs the cannabis market continues to mature, both domestically and internationally, the overall demand for products and the number of\ncompetitors is expected to increase.\nConsumers that once solely relied on the medical cannabis market may shift some, or all, of their consumption or preferences away from\nmedical cannabis and towards consumer cannabis. The Cannabis Act also permits patients to produce a limited amount of cannabis for their\nown purposes or to designate a person to produce a limited amount of cannabis on their behalf. Such shifts in market demand, and other\nfactors that we cannot currently anticipate, could potentially reduce the market for our products, which could ultimately have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition and operations.\nThe cannabis industry is undergoing substantial change, which has resulted in an increase in new and existing competitors, consolidation and\nthe formation of strategic relationships. Acquisitions or other consolidating transactions could harm our business in a number of ways,\nincluding losing patients and/or customers, revenue and market share, or forcing us to expend greater resources to meet new or additional\ncompetitive threats. There is potential that we will face intense competition from not only existing companies but from new entrants including\nthose resulting from the federal legalization of cannabis use in the U.S. if and when it occurs, all of which could harm our operating results.\nChanges in the number of licenses granted and the number of entities holding all valid licenses in the jurisdictions they operate to cultivate\ncannabis (\"Licensed Producers\") ultimately authorized by Health Canada, as well as other regulatory changes in both Canada and the U.S.\nthat have the effect of increasing competition, could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete for market share in Canada’s cannabis\nmarket.\nSome competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources compared to us. Such companies may be\nable to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products and services, and may have more\nextensive customer bases and broader customer relationships. Such competition may make it difficult to enter into supply agreements,\nnegotiate favourable prices, recruit or retain qualified employees, and acquire the capital necessary to fund our capital investments.\nWe also face competition from illegal cannabis dispensaries and ‘black market’ operations and participants, who do not have a valid license,\nthat are selling cannabis to individuals, including products with higher concentrations of active ingredients, using flavours or other additives or\nengaging in advertising and promotion activities that are not permitted by law. Because they do not comply with the regulations governing the\ncannabis industry, illegal market participants’ operations may also have significantly lower costs.\nIn order for us to be competitive, we will need to invest significantly in research and development, market development, marketing, new client\nidentification, distribution channels, and client support. If we are not successful in obtaining sufficient resources to invest in these areas, our\nability to compete in the market may be adversely affected, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions and\noperations.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to maintain competitive production costs through economies of scale and our ability to recognize\nhigher margins through the sale of higher margin products. To the extent that we are not able to continue to produce our products at\ncompetitive prices or consumers prioritize established low margin products over innovative, higher margin products, our business, financial\nconditions and operations could be materially adversely affected.\nSelling prices and the cost of cannabis production may vary based on a number of factors outside of our control.\nOur revenues are in a large part derived from the production, sale, and distribution of cannabis. The cost of production, sale, and distribution of\ncannabis is dependent on a number of key inputs and their related costs, including equipment and supplies, labour and raw materials related\nto our growing operations, as well other overhead costs such as electricity, water, and utilities. In particular, our cannabis cultivation operations\nconsume considerable energy, making us vulnerable to rising energy costs. Rising or volatile energy costs may have a material adverse effect\non our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough our business has not been materially impacted by ongoing international military conflicts, the measures that have been taken, and\ncould be taken in the future, may have a negative impact on our costs, including for input materials, energy and transportation. Any significant\ninterruption or negative change in the availability or economics of the supply chain for key inputs, including an inability to secure required\nsupplies and services or to do so on appropriate terms could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. This includes any change in the selling price of products set by the applicable province or territory. The price of cannabis is\naffected by numerous factors beyond our control and any price decline may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition\nand operations.\n31 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nWe may not be able to realize our growth targets.\nOur ability to continue the production of cannabis products at the same pace as we are currently producing, or at all, and our ability to continue\nto increase both our production capacity and our production volumes, may be affected by a number of factors, including plant design errors,\nnon-performance by third party contractors, increases in materials or labour costs, construction performance falling below expected levels of\noutput or efficiency, contractor or operator errors, breakdowns, aging or failure of equipment or processes, and labour disputes. Factors\nspecifically related to indoor agricultural and processing practices, such as reliance on provision of energy and utilities to our facilities, those\nspecifically related to outdoor cultivation practices, such as droughts, environmental pollution and inadvertent contamination, and any major\nincidents or catastrophic events affecting the premises, such as fires, explosions, earthquakes or storms, may all materially and adversely\nimpact the growth of our business.\nIn addition, the Company may be subject to other growth-related risks, including pressure on its internal systems and controls. The ability of\nthe Company to manage growth effectively will require it to continue to implement and improve its operational and financial systems and to\nexpand, train and manage its employee base. If the Company is unable to deal with this growth, it may have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe continuance of our contractual relations with provincial and territorial governments cannot be guaranteed.\nPart of our current revenues depend upon our supply contracts with the various Canadian provinces and territories. There are many factors\nwhich could impact our contractual agreements and alterations to, or the termination or renewal of, such contracts may adversely impact our\nbusiness, financial condition and operations.\nIn addition, not all of the Company’s supply arrangements with the various Canadian provinces and territories contain purchase commitments\nor otherwise obligate the provincial or territorial wholesaler to buy a minimum or fixed volume of cannabis products from the Company. The\namount of cannabis that the provincial and territorial wholesalers may purchase under the supply arrangements may therefore vary from what\nthe Company expects or has planned for. As a result, the Company’s revenues could fluctuate materially in the future and could be materially\nand disproportionately impacted by the purchasing decisions of the provincial and territorial wholesalers. If any of the provincial or territorial\nwholesalers decide to purchase lower volumes of products from the Company than the Company expects, alters its purchasing patterns at any\ntime with limited notice, decides to return product or decides not to continue to purchase the Company’s cannabis products at all, the\nCompany’s revenues could be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur continued growth may require additional financing, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur continued development may require additional financing. The failure to raise such capital could result in the delay or indefinite\npostponement of our current business strategy or our ceasing to carry on business. There can be no assurance that additional capital or other\ntypes of financing will be available if needed or that, if available, the terms of such financing will be available on favorable terms. If additional\nfunds are raised through issuances of equity, equity-linked securities, or convertible debt securities, existing shareholders could suffer\nsignificant dilution, and any new equity securities issued could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of Common\nShares. In addition, from time to time, we may enter into transactions to acquire assets or equity securities of other companies. These\ntransactions may be financed wholly or partially with debt, which may increase our debt levels above industry standards and our ability to\nservice such debt. Any debt financing obtained in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to capital raising activities and other\nfinancial and operational matters, which could make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and pursue business opportunities,\nincluding potential acquisitions. Debt financings may contain provisions, which, if breached, entitle lenders to accelerate repayment of debt and\nthere is no assurance that we would be able to repay such debt in such an event or prevent the enforcement of security, if any, granted\npursuant to such debt financing.\nAn economic downturn of global capital markets may make raising additional capital more difficult. If uncertain market conditions persist, the\nCompany’s ability to raise capital could be jeopardized, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s operations and the trading\nprice of the Company’s shares on the TSX and Nasdaq.\nAny default under our existing debt that is not waived by the applicable lenders could materially adversely impact our results of\noperations and financial results and may have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our Common Shares.\nCovenants in respect of our existing debt may create a risk of default on our debt if we cannot satisfy or continue to satisfy these covenants. If\nwe cannot comply with a debt covenant or anticipates that it will be unable to comply with a debt covenant under any debt instrument it is party\nto, management may seek a waiver and/or amendment to the applicable debt instrument in respect of any such covenant in order to avoid any\nbreach or default that might otherwise result therefrom. If we default under a debt instrument and the default is not waived by the lender(s), the\ndebt extended pursuant to all of its debt instruments could become due and payable prior to its stated due date. If such event were to occur,\nwe cannot give any assurance that (i) its lenders will agree to any covenant amendments or waive any covenant breaches or defaults that may\noccur, and (ii) it could pay this debt if it became due prior to its stated due date. Accordingly, any default by us on existing debt that is not\nwaived by the applicable lenders could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial results and may have a material\nadverse effect on the trading price of our Common Shares.\nWe may be subject to credit risk.\nCredit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, resulting in a financial loss to us.\nWe have credit risk exposure based on the balance of our cash, accounts receivable, investments, and taxes recoverable. There are no\nassurances that our counterparties, including parties to whom we extended credit, or customers will meet their contractual obligations to us.\nWe may not be able to successfully develop new products or find a market for their sale.\nThe medical and non-medical cannabis industries are in their early stages of development and it is likely that we, and our competitors, will\nseek to introduce new products in the future. In attempting to keep pace with any new market developments, we may need to expend\nsignificant amounts of capital in order to successfully develop and generate revenues from new products introduced by us. As well, we may be\n32 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nrequired to obtain additional regulatory approvals from Health Canada and any other applicable regulatory authorities, which may take\nsignificant amounts of time and entail significant costs. We may not be successful in developing effective and safe new products, bringing such\nproducts to market in time to be effectively commercialized, or obtaining any required regulatory approvals, which, together with any capital\nexpenditures made in the course of such product development and regulatory approval processes, may have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and operations.\nAs the cannabis market continues to mature, our products may become obsolete, less competitive, or less marketable.\nBecause the cannabis market and associated products and technology are rapidly evolving, both domestically and internationally, we may be\nunable to anticipate and/or respond to developments in a timely and cost-efficient manner. The process of developing our products is complex\nand requires significant costs, development efforts, and third-party commitments. Our failure to develop new products and technologies and\nthe potential disuse of our existing products and technologies could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operations. Our\nsuccess will depend, in part, on our ability to continually invest in research and development and enhance our existing technologies and\nproducts in a competitive manner.\nRestrictions on branding and advertising may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain customers.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers. The Cannabis Act strictly regulates the way cannabis is packaged,\nlabelled, and displayed. The associated provisions are quite broad and are subject to change. It is currently prohibited to use testimonials and\nendorsements, depict people, characters and animals and produce any packaging that may be appealing to young people. The restrictions on\npackaging, labelling, and the display of our cannabis products may adversely impact our ability to establish brand presence, acquire new\ncustomers, retain existing customers and maintain a loyal customer base. This may ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial conditions and operations.\nThe cannabis business may be subject to unfavorable publicity or consumer perception.\nWe believe that the cannabis industry is highly dependent upon positive consumer and investor perception regarding the benefits, safety,\nefficacy and quality of the cannabis distributed to consumers. Cannabis is a controversial topic, and there is no guarantee that future scientific\nresearch, publicity, regulations, medical opinion, and public opinion relating to cannabis will be favorable. Consumer perception of our products\ncan be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, regulatory investigations, litigation, media attention and other publicity\nregarding the consumption of cannabis products. There can be no assurance that future scientific research, findings, regulatory proceedings,\nlitigation, media attention or other research findings or publicity will be favorable to the cannabis market or any particular product, or consistent\nwith earlier publicity. Future scientific research, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other research findings or\npublicity that are perceived as less favorable than, or that question, earlier research reports, findings or publicity could have a material adverse\neffect on the demand for our products and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our dependence upon\nconsumer perception means that adverse scientific research, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other research\nfindings or publicity, whether or not accurate or with merit, could have a material adverse effect on us, the demand for products, and our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAdverse publicity reports or other media attention regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of cannabis in general, or our products specifically,\nor associating the consumption of cannabis with illness or other negative effects or events, could have such a material adverse effect on us.\nSuch adverse publicity reports or other media attention could arise even if the adverse effects associated with such products resulted from\nconsumers’ failure to consume such products legally, appropriately, or as directed. Although we believe that we operate in a manner that is\nrespectful to all stakeholders and that we take care in protecting our image and reputation, we do not ultimately have direct control over how\nwe are perceived by others. There is also a risk that the actions of other companies and service providers in the cannabis industry may\nnegatively affect the reputation of the industry as a whole and, thereby, negatively impact our reputation. The increased usage of social media\nand other web-based tools used to generate, publish and discuss user-generated content and to connect with other users has made it\nincreasingly easier for individuals and groups to communicate and share negative opinions and views in Canada and elsewhere in regard to\nour activities and the cannabis industry in general, whether true or not. The legal restrictions with respect to labelling and marketing cannabis\nmay exacerbate these risks by increasing the influence of social media users and prohibiting us from effectively responding to negative\npublicity.\nThird parties with whom we do business may perceive themselves as being exposed to reputational risk by virtue of their\nrelationship with us and may ultimately elect to discontinue their relationships with us.\nThe parties with which we do business may perceive that they are exposed to reputational risk as a result of our cannabis business activities.\nIn particular, while we attempt to conduct our cannabis-related business activities in compliance with all laws, negative perception of cannabis-\nrelated activities could cause the parties with whom we do business to discontinue their relationships with us and may cause potential\ncounterparties to decline to do business with us. These risks may increase during periods in jurisdictions where cannabis-related activities are\nillegal and where jurisdictions focus their enforcement efforts on eliminating such activities. Failure to establish or maintain business\nrelationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations.\nThere may be unknown health impacts associated with the use of cannabis and cannabis derivative products.\nThere is little in the way of longitudinal studies on the short-term and long-term effects of cannabis use on human health, whether used for\nrecreational or medicinal purposes. As such, there are inherent risks associated with using our cannabis and cannabis derivative products,\nincluding unexpected side effects or safety concerns, the discovery of which could lead to civil litigation, regulatory actions and even possibly\ncriminal enforcement actions.\nPreviously unknown or unforeseeable adverse reactions arising from human consumption of cannabis products may occur and consumers\nshould consume cannabis at their own risk or in accordance with the direction of a health care practitioner.\n33 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nWe may enter into strategic alliances or expand the scope of currently existing relationships with third parties that we believe\ncomplement our business, financial condition and results of operation and there are risks associated with such activities.\nWe have entered into, and may in the future enter into, strategic alliances with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our\nexisting business, including third party supply. Our ability to complete and develop strategic alliances is dependent upon, and may be limited\nby, the availability of suitable candidates and capital. In addition, strategic alliances could present unforeseen regulatory issues, integration\nobstacles or costs, may not enhance our business, and may involve risks that could adversely affect us, including significant amounts of\nmanagement time that may be diverted from current operations in order to pursue and complete such transactions or maintain such strategic\nalliances. Future strategic alliances could result in the incurrence of additional debt, costs and contingent liabilities, and there can be no\nassurance that future strategic alliances will achieve, or that our existing strategic alliances will continue to achieve, the expected benefits to\nour business or that we will be able to consummate future strategic alliances on satisfactory terms, or at all. Any of the foregoing could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations.\nOur success will depend on attracting and retaining key personnel.\nThe success of the Company is dependent upon the ability, expertise, judgment, discretion and good faith of its key personnel.\nOur future success will depend on our directors’ and officers’ ability to develop and execute our business strategies and manage our ongoing\noperations, as well as our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Competition for qualified professionals, technical, sales and marketing\nstaff, as well as officers and directors can be intense, and no assurance can be provided that we will be able to attract or retain key personnel\nin the future, which may adversely impact our operations. While employment and consulting agreements are customary, these agreements\ncannot assure the continued services of such individuals.\nFurther, as a Licensed Producer under the Cannabis Act, certain key personnel are required to obtain a security clearance by Health Canada.\nLicenses will not be granted until all key personnel have been granted security clearance. Under the Cannabis Act, a security clearance cannot\nbe valid for more than five years and must be renewed before the expiry of a current security clearance. There is no assurance that any of our\nexisting or future key personnel will be able to obtain or renew such clearances. A failure by key personnel to maintain or renew their security\nclearance could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations. There is also a risk that if key personnel\nleave the Company, we may not be able to find a suitable replacement that can obtain a security clearance in a timely manner, or at all.\nDependence on senior management\nThe success of the Company and its strategic focus is dependent to a significant degree upon the contributions of senior management. The\nloss of any of these individuals, or an inability to attract, retain and motivate sufficient numbers of qualified senior management personnel\ncould adversely affect the Company’s business. As well, the implementation of employee compensation packages, composed of monetary\nshort-term compensation and long-term equity-based compensation, has been designed for the retention of key employees.\nCertain of our directors and officers may have conflicts of interests due to other business relationships.\nWe may be subject to potential conflicts of interest as some of our directors and officers may be engaged in a range of other business\nactivities. Our directors and officers are permitted to devote time to their outside business interests, so long as such activities do not materially\nor adversely interfere with their duties to the Company. However, in some cases these outside business interests can require significant time\nand attention which may interfere with their ability to devote the necessary time to our business, and there is no assurance that such\noccurrences would not adversely affect our operations.\nWe may also become involved in other transactions which conflict with the interests of its directors and officers who may, from time to time,\ndeal with persons, institutions or corporations with which we may be dealing, or which may be seeking investments similar to those the\nCompany desires. The interests of these persons could conflict with our interests. In addition, from time to time, these persons may be\ncompeting with us for available investment opportunities. Conflicts of interest, if any, will be subject to the procedures and remedies provided\nunder applicable laws. In particular, in the event that such a conflict of interest arises at a meeting of the Company’s board of directors, a\ndirector who has such a conflict will abstain from voting for or against the approval thereof in accordance with applicable laws. In accordance\nwith applicable laws, our directors are required to act honestly, in good faith and in the Company’s best interests.\nFuture execution efforts may not be successful.\nThere is no guarantee that our current execution strategy will be completed in the currently proposed form, if at all, nor is there any guarantee\nthat we will be able to expand into additional jurisdictions. There is also no guarantee that expansions to our marketing and sales initiatives will\nbe successful. Any such activities will require, among other things, various regulatory approvals, licenses and permits (such as additional\nlicenses from Health Canada under the Cannabis Act) and there is no guarantee that all required approvals, licenses and permits will be\nobtained in a timely fashion or at all. There is also no guarantee that we will be able to complete any of the foregoing activities as anticipated\nor at all. Our failure to successfully execute our strategy could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operations and may result\nin our failing to meet anticipated or future demand for products, when and if it arises.\nIn addition, the construction (or remaining construction) of any current or future facilities is subject to various potential problems and\nuncertainties, and may be delayed or adversely affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including the failure to obtain regulatory\napprovals, permits, delays in the delivery or installation of equipment by our suppliers, difficulties in integrating new equipment with its existing\nfacilities, shortages in materials or labour, defects in design or construction, diversion of management resources, or insufficient funding or\nother resource constraints. Moreover, actual costs for construction may exceed our budgets. As a result of construction delays, cost overruns,\nchanges in market circumstances or other factors, we may not be able to achieve the intended economic benefits, which in turn may materially\nand adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operations.\nWe have expanded and intend to further expand our business and operations into jurisdictions outside of Canada, and there are\nrisks associated with doing so.\nAs international demand grows, we intend to consider the expansion of our operations and business into jurisdictions outside of Canada, some\nof which are emerging markets, but there can be no assurance that any market for our products will develop in any such foreign jurisdiction.\n34 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nThe continuation or expansion of our operations internationally will depend on our ability to renew or secure the necessary permits, licenses, or\nother approvals in those jurisdictions. An agency's denial of or delay in issuing or renewing a permit, license, or other approval, or revocation\nor substantial modification of an existing permit or approval, could prevent us from continuing our operations in or exports to other countries.\nOperations in non-Canadian markets may expose us to new or unexpected risks or significantly increase our exposure to one or more existing\nrisk factors. Some governmental regulations may require us to award contracts in, employ citizens of, and/or purchase supplies from the\njurisdiction. These factors may limit our capability to successfully expand our operations and may have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and operations.\nIn addition, we are further subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations domestically and internationally with respect to the flow of funds\nand product across international borders and the amount of medical cannabis we export may be limited by the various drug control\nconventions to which Canada is a signatory.\nWhile we continue to monitor developments and policies in the emerging markets in which we operate and assess the impact thereof to our\noperations, such developments cannot be accurately predicted and could have an adverse effect on our business, operations or profitability.\nOn April 1, 2024, cannabis was reclassified as a non-narcotic by the German government, allowing adults to possess small amounts of\ncannabis, and making Germany the largest European Union country to legalize possession for recreational use. While the Company is one of\nthree existing domestic medical cannabis producers in Germany, there is no assurance that we will be successful in the German recreational\nmarket, if and when commercial cultivation, manufacturing, and retail sales are permitted.\nOur business may be affected by political and economic instability, and a period of sustained inflation across the markets in which\nwe operate could result in higher operating costs.\nWe may be affected by political or economic instability. The risks include, but are not limited to, terrorism, military repression, extreme\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, high rates of inflation and other negative impacts on the global economy, capital markets or other\ngeopolitical conditions. Changes in medical and agricultural development or investment policies or shifts in political viewpoints of certain\ncountries may adversely affect our business. Operations may be affected in varying degrees by government regulations with respect to\nrestrictions on production, distribution, price controls, export controls, income taxes, expropriation of property, maintenance of assets,\nenvironmental legislation, land use, land claims of local people, and water use. The effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted.\nIn the past year, the worldwide economy has experienced significant inflation and inflationary pressures. Inflation may negatively impact our\nbusiness, raise cost and reduce profitability. While we have and will continue to take actions, wherever possible, to reduce the impact of the\neffects of inflation, in the case of sustained inflation across several of the markets in which we operate, it could become increasingly difficult to\neffectively mitigate the increases to our costs. In addition, the effects of inflation on consumers’ budgets could result in the reduction of our\ncustomers’ spending habits. If we are unable to take actions to effectively mitigate the effect of the resulting higher costs, our profitability and\nfinancial position could be negatively impacted.\nWe rely on international advisors and consultants in foreign jurisdictions.\nThe legal and regulatory requirements in the foreign countries in which we currently or intend to operate are different from those in Canada.\nOur officers and directors must rely, to a great extent, on local legal counsel and consultants in order to ensure our compliance with material\nlegal, regulatory and governmental developments as they pertain to and affect our business operations, to assist with governmental relations\nand enhance our understanding of and appreciation for the local business culture and practices. Any developments or changes in such legal,\nregulatory or governmental requirements or in local business practices are beyond our control. The impact of any such changes may adversely\naffect our business, financial condition and operations.\nFailure to comply with the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (Canada) (“CFPOA”) and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\n(U.S.) (“FCPA”), as well as the anti-bribery laws of the other nations in which we conduct business, could subject us to penalties\nand other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the CFPOA and the FCPA, which generally prohibit companies and their employees from engaging in bribery, kickbacks or\nmaking other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The CFPOA and the FCPA also require\ncompanies to maintain accurate books and records and internal controls, including at foreign controlled subsidiaries. In addition, we are\nsubject to other anti-bribery laws of other countries in which we conduct, or will conduct, business that apply similar prohibitions as the CFPOA\nand FCPA (e.g. the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Anti-Bribery Convention). Our employees or other agents may,\nwithout our knowledge and despite our efforts, engage in prohibited conduct under our policies and procedures and the CFPOA, the FCPA, or\nother anti-bribery laws to which we may be subject for which we may be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have\nengaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and operations.\nWe may be subject to uninsured or uninsurable risks.\nWhile we may have insurance to protect our assets, operations, and employees, such insurance is subject to coverage limits and exclusions\nand may not be available for the risks and hazards to which we are exposed. No assurance can be given that such insurance will be adequate\nto cover our liabilities or that it will be available in the future or at all, and that it will be commercially justifiable. We may be subject to liability for\nrisks against which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure due to the high cost of insurance premiums or other factors.\nThe payment of any such liabilities would reduce the funds available for our normal business activities. Payment of liabilities for which we do\nnot carry insurance may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims.\nAs a manufacturer and distributor of products designed to be topically applied, inhaled and ingested or otherwise consumed by humans, we\nface an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action and litigation if our products are alleged to have caused significant\nloss or injury. In addition, the manufacture and sale of cannabis products involves the risk of injury to consumers due to tampering by\nunauthorized third parties or product contamination. We may in the future have to recall certain of our cannabis products as a result of\npotential contamination and quality assurance concerns. Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of\n35 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\ncannabis products alone or in combination with other medications or substances could occur. We may be subject to various product liability\nclaims, including, among others, that the products produced by us caused or contributed to injury or illness, include inadequate instructions for\nuse or include inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects or interactions with other substances. A product liability claim or\nregulatory action against us could result in increased costs, adversely affect our reputation and goodwill with our customers, and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations. There can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain or\nmaintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities. The inability to obtain sufficient\ninsurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the\ncommercialization of such products.\nOur cannabis products may be subject to recalls for a variety of reasons.\nManufacturers and distributors of consumer goods and products are sometimes subject to the recall or return of their products for a variety of\nreasons, including product defects, such as contamination, unintended harmful side effects or interactions with other substances, packaging\nsafety and inadequate or inaccurate labeling disclosure. If any of the products produced by us are recalled due to an alleged product defect or\nfor any other reason, we could be required to incur the unexpected expense of the recall and any legal proceedings that might arise in\nconnection with the recall. We may lose a significant amount of sales and may not be able to replace those sales at an acceptable margin or at\nall. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention. Although we have detailed procedures in place for testing\nfinished products, there can be no assurance that any quality, potency or contamination problems will be detected in time to avoid unforeseen\nproduct recalls, regulatory action or lawsuits, whether frivolous or otherwise. Additionally, if any of the products produced by us were subject to\nrecall, the reputation and goodwill of that product and/or us could be harmed. A recall for any of the foregoing reasons could lead to decreased\ndemand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally,\nproduct recalls may lead to increased scrutiny of our operations by Health Canada or other regulatory agencies, requiring further management\nattention, increased compliance costs and potential legal fees, fines, penalties and other expenses. Furthermore, any product recall affecting\nthe cannabis industry more broadly could lead consumers to lose confidence in the safety and security of the products sold by participants in\nthe industry generally, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations.\nWe are and may become party to litigation, mediation, and/or arbitration from time to time.\nWe are and may in the future become party to regulatory proceedings, litigation, mediation, and/or arbitration from time to time in the ordinary\ncourse of business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operations. Monitoring and defending against legal\nactions, with or without merit, can be time-consuming, divert management’s attention and resources and can cause us to incur significant\nexpenses. In addition, legal fees and costs incurred in connection with such activities may be significant and we could, in the future, be subject\nto judgments or enter into settlements of claims for significant monetary damages. While we have insurance that may cover the costs and\nawards of certain types of litigation, the amount of insurance may not be sufficient to cover any costs or awards. Substantial litigation costs or\nan adverse result in any litigation may adversely impact our business, financial condition, or operations. Litigation, and any decision resulting\ntherefrom, may also create a negative perception of our company. We are currently subject to class action proceedings in both the U.S. and\nCanada (as further detailed herein). Though we believe these to be without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the claims, there is\nno assurance that we will be successful.\nThe transportation of our products is subject to security risks and disruptions.\nWe depend on fast, cost-effective, and efficient third-party courier services to distribute our product to both wholesale and retail customers.\nAny prolonged disruption of these courier services could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations. Rising\ncosts associated with the courier service we use to ship our products may also adversely impact our business and our ability to operate\nprofitably.\nDue to the nature of our products, security during transportation is of the utmost concern. Any breach of the security measures during the\ntransport or delivery of our products, including any failure to comply with recommendations or requirements of government regulators, whether\nintentional or not, could have a materially adverse impact on our ability to continue operating under our current licenses and may potentially\nimpact our ability to renew such licenses.\nOur business is subject to the risks inherent in agricultural operations.\nSince our business revolves mainly around the growth and processing of cannabis, an agricultural product, the risks inherent with agricultural\nbusinesses apply to our business. Such risks may include disease and insect pests, among others. Cannabis growing operations consume\nconsiderable energy and any rise in energy costs may have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce cannabis, and therefore, our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we currently grow, and expect to grow, most of our cannabis in climate-controlled, monitored, indoor locations, some of our\nproduction takes place outdoors and there is no guarantee that changes in outside weather and climate will not adversely affect such\nproduction. Like other agricultural products, the quality of cannabis grown outdoors is affected by weather and the environment, which can\nchange the quality or size of the harvest. If a weather event is particularly severe, such as a major drought or hurricane, the affected harvest\ncould be destroyed or damaged to an extent that results in lost revenues. In addition, other items may affect the marketability of cannabis\ngrown outdoors, including, among other things, the presence of non-cannabis related material, genetically modified organisms and excess\nresidues of pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides. High degrees of quality variance can affect processing velocity and capacity utilization, as\nthe process required to potentially upgrade lower quality product requires significant time and resources. There can be no assurance that\nnatural elements will not have a material adverse effect on the production of our products and ultimately our business, financial condition and\noperations.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, record significant impairments or write-downs of our assets.\nOur cannabis inventory in our cannabis operations and cannabis retail segments has a finite shelf life and is subject to obsolescence,\nexpiration, spoilage, shrinkage, unacceptable quality, contamination or other declines in value prior to wholesale or retail sale. We have in the\npast, and may in the future, be required to record substantial write-downs or impairments related to loss of value in our cannabis inventory. In\naddition, our facilities may be subject to obsolescence, damage, loss of fair market value or other declines in value.\n36 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nOur operations are subject to various environmental and employee health and safety regulations.\nOur operations are subject to environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions and discharges to\nwater, air, and land, the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials and wastes, and employee health and safety. We\nincur ongoing costs and obligations related to compliance with environmental and employee health and safety matters. Failure to obtain an\nenvironmental compliance approval under applicable regulations or otherwise comply with environmental and safety laws and regulations may\nresult in additional costs for corrective measures, penalties or restrictions on our manufacturing operations. In addition, changes in\nenvironmental, employee health and safety or other laws, more vigorous enforcement thereof, or other unanticipated events could require\nextensive changes to our operations or give rise to material liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and operations.\nClimate change may have an adverse effect on demand for our products or on our operations.\nOver the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions due to natural and man-made causes have added to the\nunpredictability and frequency of extreme weather events such as severe weather, heat waves, wildfires, flooding, hailstorms, snowstorms,\nand the spread of disease and insect infestations. These events could damage, destroy or hinder the operations at our physical facilities, or\nthe facilities of our suppliers or customers, and adversely affect our financial results as a result of decreased production output, increased\noperating costs or reduced availability of transportation.\nGovernment action to address climate change, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water and land use may result in the enactment of\nadditional or more stringent laws and regulations that may require us to incur additional capital expenditures, pay higher taxes, increased\ntransportation costs, or could otherwise adversely affect our financial conditions.\nIn addition, increasingly our employees, customers and investors expect that we minimize the negative environmental impacts of our\noperations Although we make efforts to create positive impacts where possible and anticipate potential costs associated with climate change,\nfailure to mitigate the risks of climate change and adequately respond to their changing expectations as well as those of governments on\nenvironmental matters, could result in missed opportunities, additional regulatory scrutiny, loss of team members, customers and investors,\nand adverse impact on our brand and reputation.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to own and protect our trademarks, patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights. We\nrely on certain trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information that are not protected by patents to maintain our competitive\nposition. Our trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information, which are not protected by patents, may become known to or be\nindependently developed by competitors. Even if we move to protect our intellectual property with trademarks, patents, copyrights or by other\nmeans, we are not assured that competitors will not develop similar technology and business methods or that we will be able to exercise our\nlegal rights.\nOther countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same standards as does Canada, particularly in the U.S. where cannabis\nremains federally illegal. Policing the unauthorized use of current or future trademarks, patents, trade secrets or intellectual property rights\ncould be difficult, expensive, time-consuming and unpredictable, as may be enforcing these rights against unauthorized use by others.\nActions taken to protect or preserve intellectual property rights may require significant financial and other resources such that said actions may\nhave a materially adverse impact our ability to successfully grow our business. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could\nput one or more of the trademarks, patents or other intellectual property rights at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put\nexisting intellectual property applications at risk of not being issued. Any or all of these events could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and operations.\nWe may experience breaches of security at our facilities or in respect of electronic documents and data storage and may face risks\nrelated to breaches of applicable privacy laws.\nGiven the nature of our product and its lack of legal availability outside of channels approved by the Government of Canada, as well as the\nconcentration of inventory in our facilities, despite meeting or exceeding Health Canada’s security requirements, there remains a risk of\nshrinkage as well as theft. A security breach at one of our facilities could expose us to additional liability, potentially costly litigation, increased\nexpenses relating to the resolution and future prevention of these breaches and may deter potential customers from choosing our products.\nIn addition, we collect and store personal information about our customers and are responsible for protecting that information from privacy\nbreaches. A privacy breach may occur through procedural or process failure, information technology malfunction, or deliberate unauthorized\nintrusions. Data theft for competitive purposes, particularly patient lists and preferences, is an ongoing risk whether perpetrated via employee\ncollusion or negligence, or through a deliberate cyber-attack. Any such theft or privacy breach would have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, there are several federal and provincial laws protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient\nrecords, and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information. In particular, the privacy rules under the Personal Information\nProtection and Electronics Documents Act (Canada) (“PIPEDA”), protect medical records and other personal health information by limiting their\nuse and disclosure of health information to the minimum level reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. If we were found to\nbe in violation of the privacy or security rules under PIPEDA or other laws protecting the confidentiality of patient health information, we could\nbe subject to sanctions and civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities, harm our reputation, and have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition and operations.\nWe may be subject to risks related to our information technology systems, including cyber-attacks.\nWe have entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology services in\nconnection with our operations. Our operations depend, in part, on how well we and our suppliers protect networks, equipment, IT systems\n37 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nand software against damage from a number of threats, including, but not limited to, cable cuts, damage to physical plants, natural disasters,\nintentional damage and destruction, fire, power loss, hacking, computer viruses, vandalism and theft. Our operations also depend on the timely\nmaintenance, upgrade and replacement of networks, equipment, IT systems and software, as well as pre-emptive expenses to mitigate the\nrisks of failures. Any of these and other events could result in information system failures, delays and/or increase in capital expenses. The\nfailure of information systems or a component of information systems, depending on the nature of any such failure, could adversely impact our\nbusiness, financial condition and operations.\nCyber-attacks could result in important remediation costs, increased cybersecurity costs, lost revenues due to a disruption of activities,\nlitigation, and reputational harm affecting customer and investor confidence, which ultimately could materially adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and operations.\nIn December 2020, the Company was the target of a cybersecurity incident that involved the theft of company information. The subsequent\ninvestigation identified that certain personally identifiable information of our employees and consumers was compromised. It also confirmed\nthat our patient database was not compromised, and our performance and financial information was not impacted. All impacted individuals\nwere notified, as were all required government privacy offices.\nWe have not experienced any material losses to date relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no\nassurance that we will not incur such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters cannot be fully mitigated because of, among\nother things, the evolving nature of these threats. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of controls,\nprocesses and practices designed to protect systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access is\na priority. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance protective\nmeasures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\nGlobally, cybersecurity incidents have increased in number and severity and it is expected that these external trends will continue. In response\nto this incident, or any potential future incident, we may incur substantial costs which may include:\n• remediation costs, such as liability for stolen information, repairs to system or data damage, or implementation of new security;\n• measures in response to the evolving security landscape; and\n• legal expenses, including costs related to litigation, regulatory actions or penalties.\nWe may not be able to successfully identify and execute future acquisitions or dispositions, or to successfully manage the impacts\nof such transactions on our operations.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, seek strategic acquisitions. Our ability to identify and consummate any future potential acquisitions\non terms that are favorable to us may be limited by the number of attractive acquisition targets, internal demands on our resources and, to the\nextent necessary, our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, if at all. Over the past few years, we have completed a number of such\nacquisitions.\nMaterial acquisitions, dispositions, and other strategic transactions involve a number of risks, including: (i) potential disruption of our ongoing\nbusiness; (ii) distraction of management; (iii) increased financial leverage; (iv) the anticipated benefits and cost savings of those transactions\nmay not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected; (v) increased scope and complexity of our operations; and (vi)\nloss or reduction of control over certain of our assets.\nThe presence of one or more material liabilities and/or commitments of an acquired company that are unknown to us at the time of acquisition\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations. A strategic transaction may result in a significant\nchange in the nature of our business, operations and strategy. In addition, we may encounter unforeseen obstacles or costs in implementing a\nstrategic transaction or integrating any acquired business into our existing operations.\nAs a holding company, Aurora Cannabis Inc. is dependent on its operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other obligations.\nAurora Cannabis Inc. is a holding company. Essentially all of our operating assets are the capital stock of our subsidiaries and substantially all\nof our business is conducted through subsidiaries which are separate legal entities. Consequently, our cash flows and ability to pursue future\nbusiness and expansion opportunities are dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to us. The\nability of these entities to pay dividends and other distributions will depend on their operating results and will be subject to applicable laws and\nregulations which require that solvency and capital standards be maintained by such companies and contractual restrictions contained in the\ninstruments governing their debt. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of our subsidiaries, holders of indebtedness\nand trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made\navailable for distribution to us.\nThe price of our Common Shares has historically been volatile. This volatility may affect the value of your investment in Aurora, the\nprice at which you could sell our Common Shares and the sale of substantial amounts of our Common Shares could adversely\naffect the price of our Common Shares and the value of your convertible debentures/notes.\nThe market price for Common Shares may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are\nbeyond our control, including the following:\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\n• recommendations by securities research analysts;\n• changes in the economic performance or market valuations of companies in the same industry in which we operate;\n• addition or departure of our executive officers and other key personnel;\n• release or expiration of transfer restrictions on outstanding Common Shares;\n• sales or perceived sales of additional Common Shares;\n• operating and financial performance that varies significantly from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n• regulatory changes affecting the Company’s industry, business and operations;\n• announcements of developments and other material events by us or our competitors;\n• fluctuations in the costs of vital production inputs, materials and services;\n38 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\n• changes in global financial markets, global economies and general market conditions, such as interest rates and product price\nvolatility;\n• significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or\nour competitors;\n• operating and share price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us; and\n• news reports relating to trends, concerns, technological or competitive developments, regulatory changes and other related issues in\nthe Company’s industry or target markets.\nFinancial markets have recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity\nsecurities of companies and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance, underlying asset values, or prospects of such\ncompanies. Such volatility has been particularly evident with regards to the share prices of medical cannabis companies that are public issuers\nin Canada. Accordingly, the market price of Common Shares may decline even if our operating results, underlying asset values, or prospects\nhave not changed. Additionally, these factors, as well as other related factors, may cause decreases in asset values that are lasting and not\ntemporary, which may result in impairment losses. There can be no assurance that continuing fluctuations in share price and volume will not\noccur. If such increased levels of volatility and market turmoil continue, our operations could be adversely impacted, and the trading price of\nCommon Shares may be materially adversely affected.\nIt is not anticipated that any dividend will be paid to holders of our Common Shares for the foreseeable future.\nNo dividends on our Common Shares have been paid to date. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, for future operation and\nexpansion. Our board of directors has the discretion to declare dividends and to prescribe the timing, amount and payment of such dividends.\nSuch decision will depend upon our future earnings, cash flows, acquisition capital requirements and financial condition, and other relevant\nfactors that our Board may deem relevant.\nFuture sales or issuances of equity securities could decrease the value of our Common Shares, dilute investors’ voting power, and\nreduce our earnings per share.\nWe may sell or issue additional equity securities in subsequent offerings (including through the sale of securities convertible into equity\nsecurities and the issuance of equity securities in connection with acquisitions). We cannot predict the size of future issuances of equity\nsecurities or the size and terms of future issuances of debt instruments or other securities convertible into equity securities or the effect, if any,\nthat future issuances and sales of our securities will have on the market price of our Common Shares.\nAdditional issuances of our securities may involve the issuance of a significant number of Common Shares at prices less than the current\nmarket prices. Issuances of a substantial number of Common Shares, or the perception that such issuances could occur, may adversely affect\nprevailing market prices of our Common Shares. Any transaction involving the issuance of previously authorized but unissued Common\nShares, or securities convertible into Common Shares, may result in significant dilution to security holders.\nSales of substantial amounts of our securities by us or our existing shareholders, or the availability of such securities for sale, could adversely\naffect the prevailing market prices for our securities and dilute investors’ earnings per share. Exercises of presently outstanding share options\nor warrants may also result in dilution to security holders. A decline in the market prices of our securities could impair our ability to raise\nadditional or sufficient capital through the sale of securities should we desire to do so.\nOur management will have substantial discretion concerning the use of proceeds from future share sales and financing\ntransactions.\nOur management will have substantial discretion concerning the use of proceeds from any future share sales and financing transactions, as\nwell as the timing of the expenditure of the proceeds thereof. As a result, investors will be relying on the judgment of management as to the\nspecific application of the proceeds of any future sales. Management may use the net proceeds in ways that an investor may not consider\ndesirable. The results and effectiveness of the application of the net proceeds are uncertain.\nThe regulated nature of our business may impede or discourage a takeover, which could reduce the market price of our Common\nShares and the value of any outstanding convertible debentures/notes.\nWe require and hold various government licenses to operate our business, which would not necessarily continue to apply to an acquirer of our\nbusiness following a change of control. These licensing requirements could impede a merger, amalgamation, takeover, or other business\ncombination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our Common Shares, which, under certain\ncircumstances, could reduce the market price of our Common Shares.\nThere is no assurance we will continue to meet the listing standards of Nasdaq and the TSX.\nWe must meet continuing listing standards to maintain the listing of our Common Shares on Nasdaq and the TSX. If we fail to comply with\nlisting standards and Nasdaq and/or the TSX delists our Common Shares, we and our shareholders could face significant material adverse\nconsequences, including:\n• a limited availability of market quotations for our Common Shares;\n• reduced liquidity for our Common Shares;\n• a determination that our Common Shares are “penny stock”, which would require brokers trading in our Common Shares to adhere\nto more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our Common\nShares;\n• a limited amount of news and analyst coverage of us; and\n• a decreased ability for us to issue additional equity securities or obtain additional equity or debt financing in the future.\nAs a public company, Aurora is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that may from time to time increase\nboth our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance, which could adversely impact the price of our Common Shares.\n39 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nThe financial reporting obligations of being a public company and maintaining a dual listing on the TSX and on Nasdaq requires\nsignificant company resources and management attention.\nWe are subject to the public company reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"U.S. Exchange Act\") and the\nrules and regulations regarding corporate governance practices, including those under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\"SOX\"), the Dodd-Frank Act,\nand the listing requirements of Nasdaq. We incur significant legal, accounting, reporting and other expenses in order to maintain a dual listing\non both the TSX and Nasdaq. Moreover, our listing on both the TSX and Nasdaq may increase price volatility due to various factors, including\nthe ability to buy or sell Common Shares, different market conditions in different capital markets and different trading volumes. In addition, low\ntrading volume may increase the price volatility of our Common Shares.\nFailure to develop and maintain an effective system of internal controls increases the risk that we may not be able to accurately and\nreliably report our financial results or prevent fraud, which may harm our business, the trading price of our Common Shares and\nmarket value of other securities.\nUnder Section 404, we are required to design, document and test the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting (“ICFR”)\nduring the financial year ended March 31, 2024. ICFR are designed to provide reasonable assurance that our financial reporting is reliable and\nthat its financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. Regardless of how well controls are designed, internal controls\nhave inherent limitations and can only provide reasonable assurance that the controls are meeting our objectives in providing reliable financial\nreporting information in accordance with IFRS. Effective internal controls are required for us to provide reasonable assurance that our financial\nresults and other financial information are accurate and reliable. Any failure to design, develop or maintain effective controls, or difficulties\nencountered in implementing, improving or remediation lapses in internal controls may affect our ability to prevent fraud, detect material\nmisstatements, and fulfill our reporting obligations. As a result, investors may lose confidence in our ability to report timely, accurate and\nreliable financial and other information, which may expose us to certain legal or regulatory actions, thus negatively impacting our business, the\ntrading process of our Common Shares and market value of other securities.\nWe are a Canadian company and shareholder protections may differ from shareholder protections in the U.S. and elsewhere.\nWe are organized and exist under the laws of British Columbia, Canada and, accordingly, are governed by the Business Corporations Act\n(British Columbia) (the \"BCBCA\"). The BCBCA differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and\nshareholders, including the provisions and proceedings relating to interested directors, mergers, amalgamations, restructuring, takeovers,\nshareholders’ suits, indemnification of directors, and inspection of corporation records.\nWe are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the U.S. Exchange Act, and as such is exempt from certain\nprovisions applicable to U.S. domestic issuers.\nBecause we are a “foreign private issuer” under the U.S. Exchange Act, we are exempt from certain provisions of the securities rules and\nregulations in the U.S. that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, including:\n• the rules under the U.S. Exchange Act requiring the filing of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K with the\nSEC;\n• the sections of the U.S. Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in respect of securities\nregistered under the U.S. Exchange Act;\n• the sections of the U.S. Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and\nliability for insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time; and\n• the selective disclosure rules by issuers of material non-public information under Regulation Fair Disclosure.\nWe are required to file an annual report on Form 40-F with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") within three months of\nthe end of each fiscal year. We do not intend to voluntarily file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q in lieu of Form\n40-F requirements. For so long as we choose to only comply with foreign private issuer requirements, the information we are required to file\nwith or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the SEC by U.S. domestic issuers.\nAs a result, you may not be afforded the same protections or information which would be made available to you if you were investing in a U.S.\ndomestic issuer.\nOur employees and counterparties may be subject to potential U.S. entry restrictions as a result of their relationship with us.\nA foreign visitor who is involved either directly or indirectly in the cannabis industry may be subject to increased border scrutiny when\nattempting to enter the U.S. Multiple states have legalized aspects of cannabis production, sale and consumption; however, cannabis remains\nillegal federally in the U.S. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection previously advised that border agents may deem a foreign visitor who is\ninvolved, either directly or indirectly, in a state-legal cannabis industry as inadmissible. While unassociated trips to the U.S. may not result in\nproblems entering the U.S., a foreign visitor attempting to enter the U.S. to proliferate cannabis-associated business may be deemed\ninadmissible, at the discretion of the border agents. As a company with operations in both the U.S. and Canada, inability of our employees or\ncounterparties to enter the U.S. could harm our ability to conduct our business.\nParticipants in the cannabis industry may have difficulty accessing the service of banks and financial institutions, which may make\nit difficult for us to operate.\nBecause cannabis remains illegal federally in the U.S., U.S. banks and financial institutions remain wary of accepting funds from businesses in\nthe cannabis industry, as such funds may technically be considered proceeds of crime. Consequently, businesses involved in the cannabis\nindustry continue to have trouble establishing banking infrastructure and relationships. The inability or limitation on our ability to open or\nmaintain a bank account in the U.S. or other foreign jurisdictions, obtain other banking services and/or accept credit card and debit card\npayments may make it difficult to operate and conduct business in the U.S. or other foreign jurisdictions.\n40 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nThe Company’s employees, independent contractors and consultants may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activities.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk that its employees, independent contractors and consultants may engage in fraudulent or other illegal\nactivity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct that violates: (i) government regulations; (ii)\nmanufacturing standards; (iii) federal and provincial healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; or (iv) laws that require the true,\ncomplete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. It is not always possible for the Company to identify and deter misconduct by\nits employees and other third parties, and the precautions taken by the Company to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in\ncontrolling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting the Company from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits\nstemming from a failure to comply with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against the Company, and it is not\nsuccessful in defending itself or asserting its rights, those actions could have a significant impact on the Company’s business, including the\nimposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits\nand future earnings, and curtailment of the Company’s operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be subject to disruptions as a result of health epidemics and other infectious diseases.\nA local, regional, national or international outbreak of a contagious disease, such as COVID-19, or the fear of a potential outbreak, could\ndecrease the willingness of the general population to travel, cause staff shortages, reduced customer traffic, supply shortages and increased\ngovernment regulation all of which may negatively impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The risk\nof a pandemic, or public perception of the risk, could cause customers to avoid public places, including retail properties, and could cause\ntemporary or long-term disruptions in our supply chains and/or delays in the delivery of our inventory. Further, such risks could also adversely\naffect the financial condition of the Company's customers, resulting in reduced spending for the products we sell. Moreover, an epidemic,\npandemic, outbreak or other public health crisis, such as COVID-19, could cause employees to avoid Company properties, which could\nadversely affect the Company’s ability to adequately staff and manage its businesses. “Shelter-in-place” or other such orders by governmental\nentities could also disrupt our operations, if employees who cannot perform their responsibilities from home, are not able to report to work.\nRisks related to an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis could also lead to the complete or partial closure of one or more of our stores,\nfacilities or operations of the Company’s sourcing partners. The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis\non our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be\npredicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of such epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis and actions\ntaken to contain or prevent their further spread, among others. These and other potential impacts of an epidemic, pandemic or other health\ncrisis, such as COVID-19, could therefore materially and adversely our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn May 5, 2023, the World Health Organization declared that the COVID-19 pandemic would no longer qualify as a global health emergency.\nHowever, the duration and full financial effects of the COVID-19 global health pandemic are unpredictable at this time, as are the measures\ntaken by governments, companies and others to attempt to address any future spread of COVID-19 and its impact. Any estimate of the length\nand severity of these developments is therefore subject to significant uncertainty, and accordingly estimates of the extent to which COVID-19\nmay materially and adversely affect the Company’s operations, financial results and condition in future periods are also subject to significant\nuncertainty.\nThe controversy surrounding vaporizers and vaporizer products may materially and adversely affect the market for vaporizer\nproducts and expose us to litigation and additional regulation.\nThere have been a number of highly publicized cases involving lung and other illnesses and deaths that appear to be related to vaporizer\ndevices and/or products used in such devices (such as vaporizer liquids). The focus is currently on the vaporizer devices, the manner in which\nthe devices were used and the related vaporizer device products - THC, nicotine, other substances in vaporizer liquids, possibly adulterated\nproducts and other illegal unlicensed cannabis vaporizer products. Some states, provinces, territories and cities in Canada and the U.S. have\nalready taken steps to prohibit the sale or distribution of vaporizers, restrict the sale and distribution of such products or impose restrictions on\nflavors or use of such vaporizers. This trend may continue, accelerate and expand.\nCannabis vaporizers in Canada are regulated under the Cannabis Act and the regulations enacted under the Cannabis Act. Negative public\nsentiment may prompt regulators to decide to further limit or defer the industry’s ability to sell cannabis vaporizer products, and may also\ndiminish consumer demand for such products. For instance, Health Canada has proposed new regulations that would place stricter limits on\nthe advertising and promotion of vaping products and make health warnings on vaping products mandatory, although such regulations\nexplicitly exclude cannabis and cannabis accessories. The provincial governments in Quebec, Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador have\nimposed provincial regulatory restrictions on the sale of cannabis vape products. These actions, together with potential deterioration in the\npublic’s perception of cannabis containing vaping liquids, may result in a reduced market for our vaping products. There can be no assurance\nthat we will be able to meet any additional compliance requirements or regulatory restrictions, or remain competitive in face of unexpected\nchanges in market conditions.\nThis controversy could well extend to non-nicotine vaporizer devices and other product formats. Any such extension could materially and\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow and operational performance. Litigation pertaining to\nvaporizer products is accelerating and that litigation could potentially expand to include our products, which would materially and adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow and operational performance.\nVaporizers, electronic cigarettes and related products were recently developed and therefore the scientific or medical communities have had a\nlimited period of time to study the long-term health effects of their use. Currently, there is limited scientific or medical data on the safety of such\nproducts for their intended use and the medical community is still studying the health effects of the use of such products, including the long-\nterm health effects. If the scientific or medical community were to determine conclusively that use of any or all of these products pose long-\nterm health risks, market demand for these products and their use could materially decline. Such a determination could also lead to litigation,\nreputational harm and significant regulation. Loss of demand for our product, product liability claims and increased regulation stemming from\nunfavorable scientific studies on cannabis vaporizer products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\n41 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nWe must rely largely on our own market research and internal data to forecast sales and market demand and market prices which\nmay differ from our forecasts.\nGiven the early stage of the cannabis industry, we rely largely on our own market research and internal data to forecast industry trends and\nstatistics as detailed forecasts are, with certain exceptions, not generally available from other sources. A failure in the demand for our products\nto materialize as a result of competition, technological change, change in the regulatory or legal landscape or other factors could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Canadian excise duty framework affects profitability.\nCanada’s excise duty framework imposes an excise duty and various regulatory-like restrictions on certain cannabis products sold in Canada.\nWe currently hold licenses issued by the CRA required to comply with this excise framework. Any change in the rates or application of excise\nduty to cannabis products sold by us in Canada, and any restrictive interpretations by the CRA or the courts of the provisions of the Excise Act,\n2001 (which may be different than those contained in the Cannabis Act) may affect our profitability and ability to compete in the market.\nWe may hedge or enter into forward sales, which involves inherent risks.\nWe may hedge or enter into forward sales of our forecasted right to purchase cannabis. Hedging involves certain inherent risks including: (i)\ncredit risk (the risk that the creditworthiness of a counterparty may adversely affect its ability to perform its payment and other obligations\nunder its agreement with us or adversely affect the financial and other terms the counterparty is able to offer us); (ii) market liquidity risk (the\nrisk that we have entered into a hedging position that cannot be closed out quickly, by either liquidating such hedging instrument or by\nestablishing an offsetting position); and (iii) unrealized fair value adjustment risk (the risk that, in respect of certain hedging products, an\nadverse change in market prices for cannabis will result in us incurring losses in respect of such hedging products as a result of the hedging\nproducts being out-of-the-money on their settlement dates).\nThere can be no assurance that a hedging program designed to reduce the risks associated with price fluctuations will be successful. Although\nhedging may protect us from adverse changes in price fluctuations, it may also prevent us from fully benefiting from positive changes in price\nfluctuations.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs required by National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings and Rule 13a-15(b) of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as amended, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures(“DC&P”) (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered\nby this Annual Report. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be\ndisclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the CSA and SEC.\nBased upon the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) have concluded that our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024 at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses described\nbelow under “Management’s Assessment on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.” As a result of the material weaknesses identified, we\nperformed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures. Notwithstanding these material weaknesses, management has concluded\nthat the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\nCompany at March 31, 2024 in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting\nStandards Board and KPMG LLP, an independent registered accounting firm, has issued an unqualified opinion on our consolidated financial\nstatements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024.\nChanges to Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn fiscal 2024, the Company experienced changes that materially affected or are reasonably likely to continue to materially affect the\nCompany’s internal controls over financial reporting (“ICFR”). Management has continued efforts to develop and enhance the performance of\nICFR, as described below.\nContinued Enhancement of Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nIn fiscal 2024, management implemented a number of business process and control improvements to address known control deficiencies and\ncontinue to enhance the Company’s control environment, including:\n• Continuing to improve controls over management’s review of company data, information, assumption and estimates\n• Modifying existing controls and implementing new controls that operated effectively to address known system limitations regarding\nassurance and segregation of duties\n• The ongoing implementation of ICFR within the Bevo Agtech Inc. business component\nAside from these initiatives and the identified material weaknesses resulting from this work and testing of controls as described in\nmanagement’s assessment of ICFR below, no changes to the Company’s ICFR occurred during the quarter that have materially affected, or\nare likely to materially affect, the Company’s ICFR.\n42 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nAcquisition of Indica Industries Pty Ltd.\nOn February 7, 2024, the Company acquired Indica Industries Pty Ltd. (Australia), triggering the Company’s business combination controls as\nwell as select internal integration activities. While management has extended its oversight and monitoring processes that support our ICFR, we\ncontinue to review and assess Indica Industries Pty Ltd.’s ICFR framework, which may result in additions or changes to the Company’s overall\nICFR or processes.\nManagement’s Assessment on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn accordance with National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings and as required by Rule\n13a-15(f) and 15d-5(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as amended, management is responsible for establishing\nand maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting (“ICFR”). The Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, has\ndesigned ICFR based on the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (the “COSO Framework”) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS.\nICFR is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. ICFR has inherent limitations. ICFR is a\nprocess that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.\nICFR also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material\nmisstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by ICFR. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the\nfinancial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\nManagement, under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO and oversight of the Board of Directors, evaluated the\neffectiveness of our ICFR as of March 31, 2024 against the COSO Framework. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that material\nweaknesses existed as of March 31, 2024, as described below, and due to these material weaknesses, ICFR is not effective as of March 31,\n2024.\nProcess Level Control Activities: The Company did not consistently execute and document sufficiently precise management review controls\nover key assumptions, estimates and period cut-off controls over payable accruals, as well as controls over review of data inputs,\ncompleteness of data entry, and the accuracy of mathematical formulas within spreadsheets. This deficiency impacts property, plant &\nequipment, biological assets and inventory, goodwill and impairment, purchase price accounting, accounts payable, and financial statement\nclose processes.\nInsufficient Segregation of Duties and Personnel at Bevo Agtech Inc.: Specific to the Bevo Agtech Inc. business component and due to\nboth staffing limitations resulting in lack of segregation of duties and limited experience of personnel in key roles in implementing and\nperforming ICFR, the Company had an aggregation of pervasive deficiencies across IT General Controls as well as business processes\nincluding manual journal entries, treasury and cash management, payroll, production and inventory, revenue and receivables, and financial\nreporting processes.\nMaterial and immaterial errors were identified as a result of these material weaknesses which were corrected prior to release of the annual\nfinancial statements. These material weaknesses create a reasonable possibility that material misstatements in interim or annual financial\nstatements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nKPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements and has issued an\nadverse report on the effectiveness of Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nManagement has excluded the acquisition of a controlling interest in Indica Industries Pty Ltd. from its assessment of effectiveness of DC&P\nand ICFR as of March 31, 2024.\nSelected financial information from the statement of earnings for the excluded controls related to the acquired business\n($ thousands)\nRevenue 2,754\nNet loss (879)\nSelected financial information from the statement of financial position for the excluded controls related to acquired business\n($ thousands)\nCurrent Assets 28,153\nNon-current Assets 14,796\nCurrent Liabilities 2,572\nNon-Current Liabilities 247\n43 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nAs the goodwill and intangible assets acquired in the Indica Industries Pty Ltd. acquisition were tested as part of the Company’s testing of\nDC&P and ICFR, as applicable, it has been excluded from the table above.\nRemediation Plan\nManagement, with oversight from the Audit Committee will continue to implement remediation measures related to the identified material\nweaknesses, with a continued focus on reducing the reliance on manual review procedures over data and information in key business\nprocesses, providing training to control owners, hiring additional staff to enable the performance of timely internal controls, and enhancement\nto business processes and controls as the Company continues to mature. The Company’s ERP transformation is a critical step to reducing our\ndependency on manual review controls.\nAdditionally, management is actively working to improve the robustness of source data used in key assumptions and estimates, including data\nused in business and operational forecasting, and believes that the precision of assumptions and estimates will continue to improve as\nadditional market and historical company data becomes available as the industry matures.\nWe believe these measures, and others that may be implemented, will remediate the material weakness in ICFR described above.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis MD&A contains certain statements which may constitute “forward-looking information” and “forward-looking statements” within the\nmeaning of Canadian securities law requirements (collectively, “forward-looking statements”). These forward-looking statements are made as\nof the date of this MD&A and the Company does not intend, and does not assume any obligation, to update these forward-looking statements,\nexcept as required under applicable securities legislation. Forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance and reflect\nCompany management’s expectations or beliefs regarding future events. In certain cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the\nuse of words such as “plans”, “expects” or “does not expect”, “is expected”, “budget”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, “intends”,\n“anticipates” or “does not anticipate”, or “believes”, or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or\nresults “may”, “could”, “would”, “might” or “will be taken”, “occur” or “be achieved” or the negative of these terms or comparable terminology. By\ntheir very nature forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual\nresults, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements\nexpressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. The Company provides no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be\naccurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.

As a\nresult, this data may not be comparable to data presented by other licensed producers of cannabis and cannabis companies. For an\nexplanation of these measures to related comparable financial information presented in the consolidated Financial Statements prepared in\naccordance with IFRS, refer to the discussion below. The Company believes that these Non-GAAP Measures are useful indicators of operating\nperformance and are specifically used by management to assess the financial and operational performance of the Company. The following are\nNon-GAAP measures contained in this MD&A:\n• Cannabis net revenue represents revenue from the sale of cannabis products, excluding excise taxes. Cannabis net revenue is\nfurther broken down as follows:\n◦ Medical cannabis net revenue represents Canadian and international cannabis net revenue for medical cannabis sales\nonly.\n◦ Consumer cannabis net revenue represents cannabis net revenue for consumer cannabis sales only.\n◦ Wholesale bulk cannabis net revenue represents cannabis net revenue for wholesale bulk cannabis only.\n• Management believes the cannabis net revenue measures provide more specific information about the net revenue purely\ngenerated from our core cannabis business and by market type.\n• Average net selling price of dried cannabis excluding bulk sales, is calculated by taking net revenue from dried cannabis, less net\nrevenue from wholesale bulk cannabis sold in the period, which is then divided by total grams and gram equivalent of cannabis sold\nin the period. Management believes the average net selling price per gram or gram equivalent measure provides more specific\ninformation about the pricing trends over time\n• Gross profit and margin before FV adjustments on cannabis net revenue is calculated by subtracting (i) cost of sales, before the\neffects of changes in FV of biological assets and inventory, and (ii) cost of sales from plant propagation ancillary support functions,\nfrom total cannabis net revenue. Gross margin before FV adjustments on cannabis net revenue is calculated by dividing gross profit\nbefore FV adjustments on cannabis net revenue divided by cannabis net revenue. Management believes that these measures\nprovide useful information to assess the profitability of our cannabis operations as it excludes the effects of non-cash FV\nadjustments on inventory and biological assets, which are required by IFRS.\n• Adjusted gross profit and margin before FV adjustments on cannabis net revenue represents cash gross profit and gross margin on\ncannabis net revenue and is calculated by subtracting from total cannabis net revenue (i) cost of sales, before the effects of changes\nin FV of biological assets and inventory; (ii) cost of sales from plant propagation ancillary support functions; and removing (iii)\ndepreciation in cost of sales; (iv) cannabis inventory impairment; and (v) business transformation, non-recurring, and out-of-period\nadjustments. Adjusted gross margin before FV adjustments on cannabis net revenue is calculated by dividing adjusted gross profit\nbefore FV adjustments on cannabis net revenue divided by cannabis net revenue. Adjusted gross profit and gross margin before FV\nadjustments on cannabis net revenue is further broken down as follows:\n◦ Adjusted gross profit and gross margin before FV adjustments on medical cannabis net revenue represents gross profit\nand gross margin before FV adjustments on sales generated in the medical market only.\n◦ Adjusted gross profit and gross margin before FV adjustments on consumer cannabis net revenue represents gross profit\nand gross margin before FV adjustments on sales generated in the consumer market only.\n◦ Adjusted gross profit and gross margin before FV adjustments on wholesale bulk cannabis net revenue represents gross\nprofit and gross margin before FV adjustments on sales generated from wholesale bulk cannabis only.\n• Management believes that these measures provide useful information to assess the profitability of our cannabis operations as it\nrepresents the cash gross profit and margin generated from cannabis operations and excludes (i) out-of-period adjustments to\nprovide information that reflects current period results; and (ii) excludes the effects of non-cash FV adjustments on inventory and\nbiological assets, which are required by IFRS.\n• Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net income (loss) from continuing operations excluding income tax expense (recovery), other\nincome (expenses), share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, acquisition costs, changes in fair value of inventory\nsold, inventory impairment adjustments, changes in fair value of biological assets, costs related to our business transformation, out-\nof-period adjustments, non-recurring items and costs related to business operations focused on developing international markets\nprior to commercialization. Adjusted EBITDA is intended to provide a proxy for the Company’s operating cash flow and is widely\nused by industry analysts to compare Aurora to its competitors, and derive expectations of future financial performance for Aurora,\nand excludes out-of-period adjustments that are not reflective of current operating results.\n• Management believes that working capital is an important liquidity measure and is defined as current assets less current liabilities as\nstated on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n• Management believes that cash used in operating activities, before changes in non-cash working capital and net cash used from\ndiscontinued operations, is an important liquidity measure as it excludes investments in working capital.\n• Adjusted SG&A is defined as SG&A, less business transformation, non-recurring, market development, and out-of-period costs.\nManagement believes this measure provides useful information to assess the recurring costs of our operations.\n45 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\n• Adjusted R&D is defined as R&D, less business transformation, non-recurring and out-of-period costs. Management believes this\nmeasure provides useful information to assess the recurring costs of our operations.\nNon-GAAP Measures should be considered together with other data prepared in accordance with IFRS to enable investors to evaluate the\nCompany’s operating results, underlying performance and prospects in a manner similar to Aurora’s management. Accordingly, these Non-\nGAAP Measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of\nperformance prepared in accordance with IFRS.\n46 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. 2024 ANNUAL REPORT"

The Board is responsible for the oversight of management in the performance of its financial reporting responsibilities and approval\nof the financial information included in the annual report. The Board fulfills these responsibilities by reviewing the financial information prepared\nby management and discussing relevant matters with management and the external auditors. The Audit Committee is also responsible for\nrecommending the appointment of the Company’s external auditors.\nKPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has been appointed by the Company’s shareholders to audit the consolidated\nfinancial statements and report directly to them. The external auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee and management to\ndiscuss their audit findings.\nJune 19, 2024\n/s/ Miguel Martin /s/ Simona King\nMiguel Martin Simona King\nChief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer\n1\nReport of Independent Registered\nPublic Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors\nAurora Cannabis Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Aurora Cannabis Inc. (the\nCompany) as of March 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss,\nchanges in equity, and cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2024 and the nine months ended March 31, 2023,\nand the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial\nstatements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2024 and\n2023, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2024 and the nine months\nended March 31, 2023, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the\nInternational Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated June 19, 2024 expressed an adverse opinion on\nthe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is\nto express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting\nfirm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan\nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free\nof material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the\nrisks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating\nthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\nrelate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter\nin any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n2\nValuation of intangible assets in the European cannabis cash generating unit\nAs discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the intangible assets balance was $40,850\nthousand as of March 31, 2024. The Company conducts an impairment test annually, and whenever events or\ncircumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred. The recoverable amount of the\nEuropean Cannabis cash generating unit (CGU) to which intangible assets are allocated was determined based on\nthe fair value less costs of disposal method. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the CGU’s\ncarrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. For the year ended March 31, 2024, no impairment was\nrecognized for the European Cannabis CGU.\nWe identified the evaluation of the fair value less costs of disposal of the intangible assets in the European\nCannabis CGU as a critical audit matter. There was a high degree of auditor judgment required to evaluate the\nsignificant assumptions used in determining the fair value less costs of disposal. The significant assumptions used\nin the valuation model were the forecasted revenues and the discount rate. The sensitivity of reasonably possible\nchanges to those assumptions could have had a significant impact on the determination of the fair value less costs\nof disposal of the intangible assets. Additionally, the judgment associated with the discount rate assumption required\nthe involvement of professionals with specialized skills and knowledge.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We compared the\nCompany’s historical revenue forecast to actual results to assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast. We\nevaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s forecasted revenues for the intangible assets attributable to the\nEuropean Cannabis CGU by comparing the growth assumptions to historical actual results of the Company and\npublicly available external industry growth rates. We performed sensitivity analyses over forecasted revenues to\nassess their impact on the determination of the fair value less costs of disposal. In addition, we involved valuation\nprofessionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the discount rate used in the\nimpairment analysis by comparing it to a discount rate that was independently developed using publicly available\nmarket data for comparable entities.\nValuation of goodwill in the Plant Propagation cash generating unit\nAs discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the total goodwill balance was $43,180 thousand\nas of March 31, 2024. The Company conducts an impairment test annually, and whenever events or circumstances\nmake it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred. The recoverable amount of the Plant\nPropagation cash generating unit (CGU) to which goodwill is allocated was determined based on the fair value less\ncosts of disposal method. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the CGU’s carrying amount\nexceeds its recoverable amount. For the year ended March 31, 2024, no impairment was recognized for the Plant\nPropagation CGU.\nWe identified the evaluation of the fair value less costs of disposal of the goodwill in the Plant Propagation CGU as\na critical audit matter. There was a high degree of auditor judgment required to evaluate the significant assumptions\nused in determining the fair value less costs of disposal. The significant assumptions used in the valuation model\nwere forecasted revenues, gross margin, and the discount rate. The sensitivity of reasonably possible changes to\nthose assumptions could have had a significant impact on the determination of the fair value less costs of disposal\nof the Plant Propagation CGU. Additionally, the judgment associated with the discount rate assumption required the\ninvolvement of professionals with specialized skills and knowledge.\n3\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We compared the\nCompany’s historical revenue and gross margin forecasts to actual results to assess the Company’s ability to\naccurately forecast. We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s forecasted revenues and gross margin for\nthe Plant Propagation CGU by comparing the growth assumptions to historical actual results. We compared the\nforecasted revenues to customer sales orders received subsequent to the year-end and to external market data. We\nperformed sensitivity analyses over forecasted revenues and gross margins to assess their impact on the\ndetermination of the fair value less costs of disposal. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with\nspecialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the discount rate used in the impairment analysis by\ncomparing it to a discount rate that was independently developed using publicly available market data for\ncomparable entities.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nChartered Professional Accountants\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.\nVancouver, Canada\nJune 19, 2024\n4\nReport of Independent Registered\nPublic Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors\nAurora Cannabis Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Aurora Cannabis Inc.’s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of March 31,\n2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, because of the effect of the material\nweakness, described below, on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not\nmaintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated statements of financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2024 and 2023,\nthe related consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss, changes in equity, and cash flows for the year\nended March 31, 2024 and the nine months ended March 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the\nconsolidated financial statements), and our report dated June 19, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those\nconsolidated financial statements.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,\nsuch that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial\nstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Material weaknesses related to the following have\nbeen identified and included in management’s assessment:\nProcess Level Control Activities: The Company did not consistently execute and document sufficiently precise\nmanagement review controls over key assumptions, estimates and period cut-off controls over payable accruals, as\nwell as controls over review of data inputs, completeness of data entry, and the accuracy of mathematical formulas\nwithin spreadsheets. This deficiency impacts property, plant & equipment, biological assets and inventory, goodwill\nand impairment, purchase price accounting, accounts payable, and financial statement close processes.\nInsufficient Segregation of Duties and Personnel at Bevo Agtech Inc.: Specific to the Bevo Agtech Inc. business\ncomponent and due to both staffing limitations resulting in lack of segregation of duties and limited experience of\npersonnel in key roles in implementing and performing ICFR, the Company had an aggregation of pervasive\ndeficiencies across IT General Controls as well as business processes including manual journal entries, treasury\nand cash management, payroll, production and inventory, revenue and receivables, and financial reporting\nprocesses.\nThe material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our\naudit of the 2024 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report on those consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nThe Company acquired Indica Industries Pty Ltd. during 2024, and management excluded from its assessment of\nthe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024, Indica Industries\nPty Ltd.’s internal control over financial reporting associated with total current assets of $28,153 thousand, total non-\ncurrent assets of $14,796 thousand, total current liabilities of $2,572 thousand, total non-current liabilities of $247\nthousand, total revenue of $2,574 thousand and net loss of $879 thousand included in the consolidated financial\nstatements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024. Our audit of internal control over financial\nreporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Indica\nIndustries Pty Ltd.\n5\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Management’s Assessment on Internal Control over Financial\nReporting”. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting\nbased on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent\nwith respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may\nbecome inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nChartered Professional Accountants\nVancouver, Canada\nJune 19, 2024\n6\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Position\nAs at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars)\nAdjusted -

(the “Company” or “Aurora”) was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) on December 21,\n2006 as Milk Capital Corp. Effective October 2, 2014, the Company changed its name to Aurora Cannabis Inc. The Company’s shares are listed\non the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) under the trading symbol “ACB”, and on the Frankfurt Stock\nExchange (“FSE”) under the trading symbol “21P1”.\nThe Company’s head office and principal address is 2207 90B St. SW Edmonton, Alberta T6X 1V8. The Company’s registered and records office\naddress is Suite 1700, 666 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6C 2X8.\nThe Company’s principal strategic business lines are focused on the production, distribution and sale of cannabis related products in Canada and\ninternationally. Aurora currently conducts the following key business activities in the jurisdictions listed below:\n• Production, distribution and sale of medical and consumer cannabis products in Canada pursuant to the Cannabis Act;\n• Distribution of wholesale medical cannabis in the European Union (“EU”) pursuant to the German Medicinal Products Act and German\nNarcotic Drugs Act; and\n• Distribution of wholesale medical cannabis in various international markets, including Australia, the Caribbean, South America and\nIsrael.\nThe Company has a 50.1% controlling interest in Bevo Agtech Inc. (“Bevo”), the sole parent of Bevo Farms Ltd., a key supplier of propagated\nvegetables and ornamental plants in North America.\nNote 2 Material Accounting Policies and Judgments\nIFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities and\nthe reported amounts of income and expenses during the period. Actual results may differ from these judgments, estimates, and assumptions.\nMaterial accounting policies, which affect the consolidated financial statements as a whole, as well as key accounting estimates and areas of\nsignificant judgment are highlighted in this section. This note also describes change in accounting policies, new accounting standards adopted\nduring the current year and upcoming accounting pronouncements, which are not yet effective but are expected to impact the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements in the future. Accounting policies, estimates, or judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts\nrecognized in the financial statements include, biological assets (Note 8), inventory (Note 9), impairment of nonfinancial assets (Note 9, 10, and\n14), business combinations (Note 12), share-based compensation (Note 19), deferred taxes (Note 23), segmented information (Note 27) and the\nfair value of financial instruments, including put options (Note 28).\n(a) Basis of Presentation and Measurement\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards\n(“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). Unless otherwise noted, all amounts are presented in thousands of\nCanadian dollars, except share and per share data.\nThe Company has reclassified certain comparative balances to conform with the current period’s presentation.\nOn February 20, 2024, the Company completed a one-to-ten (1:10) reverse share split of all of its issued and outstanding common shares\n(“Share Consolidation”), resulting in a reduction in the issued and outstanding shares from 545,457,970 to 54,545,797. Shares reserved under\nthe Company’s equity, warrants, and incentive plans were adjusted to reflect the Share Consolidation. All share and per share data presented in\nthe Company’s consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Share Consolidation unless otherwise noted.\nThese consolidated financial statements were approved and authorized for issue by the Board of Directors of the Company on June 19, 2024.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, with the exception of financial instruments and biological\nassets, which are measured at fair value, as explained in the accounting policies set out below. In addition, these consolidated financial\nstatements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting, except for cash flow information. In February 2023, the Company changed\nits reporting year end from June 30 to March 31. Accordingly, the current period is for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, whereas the\ncomparative period is for the nine months ended March 31, 2023. The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all\nperiods presented in these consolidated financial statements, except where noted.\n(b) Basis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial results of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries include entities which are\nwholly-owned as well as entities over which Aurora has the authority or ability to exert control over the investee’s financial and/or operating\ndecisions (i.e. control), which in turn may affect the Company’s exposure or rights to the variable returns from the investee. The consolidated\nfinancial statements include the operating results of acquired or disposed entities from the date control is obtained or the date control is lost,\nrespectively. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.\n13\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nYear ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nThe Company’s principal subsidiaries during the year ended March 31, 2024 are as follows:\nMajor subsidiaries Percentage Ownership Functional Currency\nAurora Cannabis Enterprises Inc. (“ACE”) 100% Canadian Dollar\nAurora Deutschland GmbH (“Aurora Deutschland”) 100% European Euro\nTerraFarma Inc. 100% Canadian Dollar\nWhistler Medical Marijuana Corporation (“Whistler”) 100% Canadian Dollar\nBevo Agtech Inc. (“Bevo”) 50.1% Canadian Dollar\nCannaHealth Therapeutics Inc. 100% Canadian Dollar\nACB Captive Insurance Company Inc. 100% Canadian Dollar\nIndica Industries Pty Ltd. (“MedReleaf Australia”) 100% Australian Dollar\nAll shareholdings are of ordinary shares or other equity. Other subsidiaries, while included in the consolidated financial statements, are not\nmaterial and have not been reflected in the table above.\n(c) Discontinued Operations\nThe Company reports financial results for discontinued operations separately from continuing operations to distinguish the financial impact of\ndisposal transactions from ongoing operations. Discontinued operations reporting occurs when the disposal of a component or a group of\ncomponents of the Company represents a strategic shift that will have an impact on the Company’s operations and financial results, and where\nthe operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the Company.\nThe results of discontinued operations are excluded from both continuing operations and business segment information in the consolidated\nfinancial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise noted, and are presented net of tax in the\nconsolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss for the current and comparative periods. Refer to Note 11(b) Discontinued Operations.\n(d) Foreign Currency Translation\nThe Company’s functional currency is the Canadian dollar. Transactions undertaken in foreign currencies are translated into Canadian dollars at\ndaily exchange rates prevailing when the transactions occur. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at\nperiod-end exchange rates and non-monetary items are translated at historical exchange rates. Realized and unrealized exchange gains and\nlosses are recognized in the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss.\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Canadian dollars using the period-end exchange rates. Income, expenses, and\ncash flows of foreign operations are translated into Canadian dollars using average exchange rates. Exchange differences resulting from the\ntranslation of foreign operations into Canadian dollars are recognized in other comprehensive loss and accumulated in equity.\n(e) Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are financial assets that are measured at amortized cost, which approximate fair value. Cash and cash equivalents\nincludes cash deposits in financial institutions and other deposits that are highly liquid and readily convertible into cash.\n(f) Provisions\nThe Company recognizes a provision if there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that the\nCompany will be required to settle that obligation and the obligation can be reliably estimated. The amount recognized as a provision reflects\nmanagement’s best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and\nuncertainties surrounding the obligation.\nAn onerous contract provision is recorded when the Company has a contract under which it is more likely than not that the unavoidable costs of\nmeeting the contractual obligations will be greater than the economic benefits that the Company expects to receive under the contract. An\nonerous contract provision represents the lesser of the cost of exiting from the contract and the cost of fulfilling it.\n(g) Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nIAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements\nThe amendments clarify that entities should disclosure material accounting policies instead of significant accounting policies. The amendments\nexplain how to identify material accounting policies. An accounting policy is material if it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions that\nthe primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements. The Company has reviewed its\naccounting policies and has included those which were considered to be material.\n14\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nYear ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nIFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts\nIFRS 17 establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts within the scope of the\nstandard. The objective of IFRS 17 is to ensure that an entity provides relevant information that faithfully represents those contracts. The\nstandard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The Company does not currently have any contracts to be\naccounted for under this standard. However, the Company has a wholly owned captive insurance entity that is required to adopt this standard\nwhen reporting on a standalone basis. The impact of the captive insurance company adopting IFRS 17 was immaterial to the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements.\n(h) New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nThe following IFRS standards have been recently issued by the IASB. Pronouncements that are irrelevant or not expected to have a significant\nimpact have been excluded.\nAmendments to IAS 1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\nThe amendment clarifies the requirements relating to determining if a liability should be presented as current or non-current in the statement of\nfinancial position. Under the new requirement, the assessment of whether a liability is presented as current or non-current is based on the\ncontractual arrangements in place as at the reporting date and does not impact the amount or timing of recognition. The amendment applies\nretrospectively for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. The Company will make this assessment as required at the\nend of each reporting date.\n(i) Revisions of Previously Issued Financial Statements\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company identified a non-material error in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, specifically\nrelating to the goods received not invoiced accrual, whereby the account was not relieved in prior periods on a consistent basis when invoices\nwere received and recorded in accounts payable. The Company believes that these errors are not material to any of the Company’s previously-\nissued financial statements based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative factors. However, correcting the errors in 2024 would be material\nto the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that an\namendment of previously-filed periodic reports is not required. Rather, the Company made revisions to the historical periods in the Company’s\nAnnual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, and to the historical periods that will be presented in the Company's prospective filings.\nThe Company has revised the opening deficit and corrected the error by revising the prior period information in these consolidated financial\nstatements.\nThe following is the revision to the ending deficit for the year ended June 30, 2022:\nJune 30, 2022 June 30, 2022\nAs previously reported Adjustments Adjusted\nConsolidated Statements of Financial\nPosition\nJune 30, 2022\nDeficit (6,038,275) 3,411 (6,034,864)\nThe following is a summary of the impacts to the statement of financial position, the statement of comprehensive loss, and the statement of cash\nflows for the year ended March 31, 2023:\nMarch 31, 2023 March 31, 2023\nAs previously reported Adjustments Adjusted\nConsolidated Statements of Financial\nPosition\nMarch 31, 2023\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 75,825 (4,568) 71,257\nDeficit (6,296,833) 4,568 (6,292,265)\n15\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nYear ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nNine months ended Nine months ended\nMarch 31, 2023 March 31, 2023\nAs previously reported(1) Adjustments Adjusted\nCondensed Consolidated Interim Statements\nof Loss and Comprehensive Loss\nMarch 31, 2023\nCost of sales 150,835 (1,157) 149,678\nGross profit (loss) before fair value adjustments 24,133 1,157 25,290\nGross profit 775 1,157 1,932\nIncome before income taxes and discontinued\noperations (221,532) 1,157 (220,375)\nNet loss from continuing operations (206,295) 1,157 (205,138)\nNet loss from continuing operations attributable\nto Aurora shareholders (198,997) 1,157 (197,840)\nComprehensive loss (206,939) 1,157 (205,782)\nLoss per share - basic and diluted(2) $ (6.17) $ 0.04 $ (6.13)\nContinuing operations $ (5.49) $ 0.04 $ (5.45)\nDiscontinued operations $ (0.68) $ — $ (0.68)\n(1) Amounts before impacts of discontinued operations (Note 11).\n(2) As described under Note 2(a) in the Consolidated Financial Statements, comparative information has been adjusted due to 1:10 reverse stock split.\nNine months ended Nine months ended\nMarch 31, 2023 March 31, 2023\nAs previously reported(1) Adjustments Adjusted\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nMarch 31, 2023\nNet income (loss) from continuing operations $ (206,295) $ 1,157 $ (205,138)\nChanges in non-cash working capital $ (25,116) $ (1,157) $ (26,273)\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (115,821) $ — $ (115,821)\n(1) Amounts before impacts of discontinued operations (Note 11).\n16\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nYear ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nNote 3 Provisions\nAccounting Policy\nRestructuring Provision\nA restructuring provision is recognized when the Company has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a\nvalid expectation that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those individuals\nwho are affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring,\nwhich reflect amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.\nLoan Loss Provision\nThe loan loss provision originates from the operations of the insurance company incorporated by the Company, for self insurance related\nto properties. A loan loss provision is an estimate for known reported losses and loss expenses plus a provision for losses incurred but not\nreported. These amounts are based upon estimates or losses reported by loss adjusters plus an estimate for losses incurred but not\nreported in accordance with the recommendations of an independent actuary using the past experience of the Company and industry data,\noffset by actual claims paid. Changes in the loan loss provision are reflected in the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive\nloss.\nLoan Loss\nRestructuring Provision Other Total\n$ $ $\nBalance, June 30, 2022 997 3,613 800 5,410\nRemeasurement 513 832 8 1,353\nSettlements (1,510) — (800) (2,310)\nBalance, March 31, 2023 — 4,445 8 4,453\nRemeasurement — 1,153 — 1,153\nBalance, March 31, 2024 — 5,598 8 5,606\nNote 4 Accounts Receivable\nAccounting Policy\nAccounts receivable are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost, less any provisions for\nimpairment. Financial assets measured at amortized cost are assessed for impairment at the end of each reporting period. Impairment\nprovisions are estimated using the expected credit loss impairment model where any expected future credit losses are provided for,\nirrespective of whether a loss event has occurred at the reporting date.\nEstimates of expected credit losses take into account the Company’s collection history, deterioration of collection rates during the average\ncredit period, as well as observable changes in and forecasts of future economic conditions that affect default risk. Where applicable, the\ncarrying amount of a trade receivable is reduced for any expected credit losses. Changes in the allowance for expected credit losses are\nrecognized in the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss. Accounts receivables are written off when they are deemed\nuncollectible.\nNotes March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023\n$ $\nTrade receivables, net (1) 29(a) 40,542 35,016\nSales taxes receivable 1,511 1,214\nLease receivable 29(a) 2,460 2,094\nGovernment grant receivable 5 — 1,913\nOther receivables, net (1) (2) 898 1,108\n45,411 41,345\n(1) Refer to (Note 29(a)) for credit risk loss provisions.\n(2) Includes interest receivable from the convertible debenture investments (Note 7).\n17\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nYear ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nNote 5 Government Grant\nAccounting Policy\nThe Company recognizes government grants when there is reasonable assurance that it will comply with the conditions required to\nqualify for the grant, and that the grant will be received. Government grants related to income are recognized as other gains (losses) in\nthe statements of net loss while government grants related to assets, including non-monetary grants at fair value, are recognized as a\nreduction of the related asset’s carrying amount.\nIn April 2020, the Government of Canada announced the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (“CEWS”) program. CEWS provided a wage\nsubsidy on eligible remuneration, subject to limits per employee, to eligible employers based on certain criteria, including the demonstration of\ndeclining revenue. The Company determined that it qualified for CEWS and received benefits from the government. A corresponding provision\nwas established during the period in which the Company received the benefits to account for uncertainty with respect to eligibility of CEWS\ngiven that it was expeditiously rolled out in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs at March 31, 2024, nil (March 31, 2023 – $12.4 million) is recognized as other current liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial\nposition. The provision of $12.4 million was reversed during the year ended March 31, 2024, as a result of a Canadian Revenue Agency audit\nof the CEWS benefits received with no proposed audit adjustments. The reversal of the provision is recorded to other gains (losses) in the\nconsolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss (Note 21).\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company received nil (nine months ended March 31, 2023 – $3.3 million) government grant\nrelated to the co-generation project at the Aurora River facility to offset the costs relating to capital expenditures that would have otherwise\nbeen capitalized as property, plant and equipment.\nNote 6 Marketable Securities\nAccounting Policy\nMarketable securities are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) or are\ndesignated at fair value through other comprehensive income (loss) (“FVTOCI”), at the election of the Company. The designation of FVTOCI\nis made on an instrument by instrument basis and if elected, subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive (loss)\nincome and not through profit or loss on disposition.\nAs at March 31, 2024, the Company held the following marketable securities:\nFinancial asset hierarchy level Level 1 Level 1 Level 1\nRadient CTT High Tide Total\nPharmaceutical\nHoldings\nSubsequent remeasurement policy FVTOCI FVTOCI FVTPL\nNote 6(a) Note 6(b)\n$ $ $ $\nBalance, June 30, 2022 1,128 203 — 1,331\nDisposals — (126) — (126)\nRealized loss on changes in fair value — (77) — (77)\nUnrealized loss on changes in fair value (1,128) — — (1,128)\nBalance, March 31, 2023 — — — —\nAdditions — — 5,025 5,025\nDisposals — — (2,179) (2,179)\nUnrealized gain on changes in fair value — — 1,190 1,190\nBalance, March 31, 2024 — — 4,036 4,036\n(a) Radient Technologies Inc.

The Company sold 996,538 common shares for $2.2 million in net proceeds during the year.\nThe High Tide common shares are classified as marketable securities, initially measured at fair value with subsequent remeasurements of fair\nvalue recorded through profit and loss. Initially, due to trading restrictions and future release dates of the common shares received, the shares\nwere designated as level 2 on the fair value hierarchy and measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model. As at March 31, 2024, with the\ntrading restrictions satisfied, the fair value is determined based on observable inputs, namely the share price and is classified as level 1 on the\nfair value hierarchy.\nNote 7 Derivatives and Convertible Debentures\nAccounting Policy\nDerivatives and debentures are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at FVTPL. If the transaction price does not\nequal to fair value at the point of initial recognition, management measures the fair value of each component of the investment and any\nunrealized gains or losses at inception are either recognized in profit or loss or deferred and recognized over the term of the investment,\ndepending on whether the valuation inputs are based on observable market data. The resulting unrealized gain or loss at inception and\nsubsequent changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss for the period. Transaction costs, which are directly attributable to the\nacquisition of the investment, are expensed as incurred. Refer to Note 28 for significant judgments in determining the fair value of\nderivative financial instruments.\nAt March 31, 2024, the Company held the following derivative and convertible debentures:\nFinancial asset hierarchy level Level 2 Level 3 Level 2 Level 3\nDerivatives and convertible debentures at fair value ACI Investee-B High Tide Investee-C Total\nthrough profit or loss (“FVTPL”) Note 7(a) Note 7(b) Note 7(c) Note 7(d)\nBalance, June 30, 2022 1,418 13,961 8,442 2,462 26,283\nRepayment — — (748) (2,490) (3,238)\nUnrealized loss on changes in fair value (1,418) — (580) — (1,998)\nRealized gain (loss) on changes in fair value — (14,506) — 28 (14,478)\nForeign exchange — 680 — — 680\nBalance, March 31, 2023 — 135 7,114 — 7,249\nRepayment — (135) (7,916) — (8,051)\nAdjustments — — 100 — 100\nUnrealized gain on changes in fair value — — 1,462 — 1,462\nBalance, March 31, 2024 — — 760 — 760\n(a) Australis Capital Inc.

Biological assets are measured at fair value less costs to\nsell at the end of each reporting period in accordance with IAS 41 - Agriculture using the income approach. The Company utilizes an income\napproach to determine the fair value less cost to sell at a specific measurement date, based on the existing plants’ stage of completion up to\nthe point of harvest. The Company cultivates cannabis and propagation plants biological assets. For cannabis plants, the stage of\ncompletion is determined based on the specific date of clipping the mother plant, the period-end reporting date, the average growth rate for\nthe strain and facility environment and is calculated on a weighted average basis for the number of plants in the specific lot. Propagation\nplants are comprised solely of plants from the Bevo business, and are sold as living plants to customers and therefore not harvested into\ninventory. For propagation plants, the stage of completion is determined based on the propagation date, the promised date, and the period-\nend reporting date.\nThe following inputs and assumptions are all categorized within Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy and were used in determining the fair\nvalue of cannabis biological assets:\nInputs and assumptions Description Correlation between inputs and fair value\nAverage selling price per gram Represents the average selling price per gram of dried If the average selling price per gram were higher\ncannabis net of excise taxes, where applicable, for the (lower), estimated fair value would increase\nperiod for all strains of cannabis sold, which is expected to (decrease).\napproximate future selling prices.\nAverage attrition rate Represents the weighted average number of plants culled If the average attrition rate was lower (higher),\nat each stage of production. estimated fair value would increase (decrease).\nWeighted average yield per plant Represents the weighted average number of grams of If the weighted average yield per plant was higher\ndried cannabis inventory expected to be harvested from (lower), estimated fair value would increase\neach cannabis plant.

Cannabis Inventory includes harvested cannabis, trim, cannabis oils,\ncapsules, edibles and vaporizers.\nInventories of harvested cannabis are transferred from biological assets at fair value less costs to sell at the point of harvest, which\nbecomes the deemed cost. By-products, such as trim, are measured at their net realizable value (“NRV”) at point of harvest which is\ndeducted from the total deemed cost to give a net cost for the primary product. Any subsequent post-harvest costs are capitalized to\nCannabis Inventory to the extent that the cost is less than NRV. NRV for work-in-process (“WIP”) and finished Cannabis Inventory is\ndetermined by deducting estimated remaining conversion/completion costs and selling costs from the estimated sale price achievable in\nthe ordinary course of business. Conversion and selling costs are determined using average cost. In the period that Cannabis Inventory is\nsold, the fair value portion of the deemed cost is recorded within changes in fair value of inventory sold line, and the cost of such\nCannabis Inventory, including direct and indirect costs, are recorded within the cost of sales line on the consolidated statements of loss\nand comprehensive loss.\nProducts for resale, consumable supplies and accessories are initially recognized at cost and subsequently valued at the lower of cost\nand NRV. The Company reviews these types of inventory for obsolescence, redundancy and slow turnover to ensure that they are written-\ndown and reflected at NRV.\nThe Company uses judgment in determining the NRV of inventory. When assessing NRV, the Company considers the impact of the\naverage selling price per gram, inventory spoilage, inventory excess, age and damage.\nThe following is a breakdown of inventory:\nMarch 31, 2024 March 31, 2023\nCapitalized Fair value Carrying Capitalized Fair value Carrying\ncost adjustment value cost adjustment value\n$ $ $ $ $ $\nHarvested cannabis\nWork-in-process 25,977 32,519 58,496 30,936 14,756 45,692\nFinished goods 34,871 10,782 45,653 13,518 1,777 15,295\n60,848 43,301 104,149 44,454 16,533 60,987\nExtracted cannabis\nWork-in-process 8,674 4,428 13,102 11,566 2,753 14,319\nFinished goods 8,749 590 9,339 8,786 561 9,347\n17,423 5,018 22,441 20,352 3,314 23,666\nSupplies and consumables 14,987 — 14,987 19,923 — 19,923\nMerchandise and accessories 2,025 — 2,025 1,556 — 1,556\nEnding balance 95,283 48,319 143,602 86,285 19,847 106,132\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, inventory expensed to cost of goods sold was $234.2 million (nine months ended March 31, 2023 –\n$186.4 million), which included $72.7 million (nine months ended March 31, 2023 – $54.2 million) related to the changes in fair value of inventory\nsold.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company recognized $73.4 million in inventory provisions (nine months ended March 31, 2023 –\n$93.4 million) consisting of cost of sales of $28.5 million (nine months ended March 31, 2023 – $45.6 million) and changes in fair value of\ninventory sold of $44.9 million (nine months ended March 31, 2023 – $47.8 million).\n24\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nYear ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nNote 10 Property, Plant and Equipment\nAccounting Policy\nOwned Assets\nProperty, plant and equipment is measured at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.\nCost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the asset acquisition. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of\nmaterials, direct labor, other costs directly attributable to make the asset available for its intended use, as well as relevant borrowing costs on\nqualifying assets as further described below. During their construction, property, plant and equipment are classified as construction in progress\n(“CIP”) and are not subject to depreciation. When the asset is available for use, it is transferred from CIP to the relevant category of property,\nplant and equipment and depreciation commences.\nWhere particular parts of an asset are significant, discrete and have distinct useful lives, the Company may allocate the associated costs\nbetween the various components, which are then separately depreciated over the estimated useful lives of each respective component.\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:\nComputer software and equipment 3 - 5 years\nProduction equipment 5 - 10 years\nFurniture and fixtures 5 years\nBuilding and improvements 10 - 30 years\nResidual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed annually and changes are accounted for prospectively.\nGains and losses on asset disposals are determined by deducting the carrying value from the sale proceeds and are recognized in profit or\nloss.\nThe Company capitalizes borrowing costs on qualifying capital construction projects. Upon the asset becoming available for use, capitalization\nof borrowing costs ceases and depreciation commences on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset.\nRight-of-use leased assets\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost, which is calculated as the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability plus any lease\npayments made at or before the commencement date, any initial direct costs and related restoration costs. The right-of-use assets are\ndepreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the underlying asset. The depreciation is recognized\nfrom the commencement date of the lease.\nIf the right-of-use asset is subsequently leased to a third party (a “sublease”), the Company will assess the classification of the sublease as to\nwhether it is a finance or operating lease. Subleases that are classified as an operating lease will recognize lease income while a finance lease\nwill recognize a lease receivable and derecognize the carrying value of the right-of-use asset, with the difference recorded in profit of loss.\nImpairment of property, plant and equipment\nThe Company assesses impairment of property, plant and equipment when an impairment indicator arises (e.g. change in use or discontinued\nuse, obsolescence or physical damage). When the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other\nassets or group of assets, the asset is tested at the cash generating unit (“CGU”) level. In assessing impairment, the Company compares the\ncarrying amount of the asset or CGU to the recoverable amount, which is determined as the higher of the asset or CGU’s fair value less costs\nof disposal and its value-in-use. Value-in-use is assessed based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a\npre-tax discount rate that reflects applicable market and economic conditions, the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. An\nimpairment loss is recognized whenever the carrying amount of the asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount and is recorded in the\nconsolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss.\n25\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nYear ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nThe following summarizes the carrying values of property, plant and equipment for the periods reflected:\nMarch 31, 2024 March 31, 2023\nAccumulated Net book Accumulated Net book\nCost depreciation Impairment value Cost depreciation Impairment value\nOwned assets\nLand 43,914 — — 43,914 52,077 — (1,820) 50,257\nBuildings 242,052 (97,885) (300) 143,867 239,353 (83,888) (3,842) 151,623\nConstruction in progress 26,330 — (645) 25,685 37,563 — (11,945) 25,618\nComputer software & equipment 31,333 (30,135) — 1,198 31,313 (29,570) (20) 1,723\nFurniture & fixtures 7,900 (6,444) — 1,456 7,434 (5,596) (42) 1,796\nProduction & other equipment 154,042 (106,370) (202) 47,470 146,960 (87,425) (1,686) 57,849\nTotal owned assets 505,571 (240,834) (1,147) 263,590 514,700 (206,479) (19,355) 288,866\nRight-of-use leased assets\nLand 13,890 (1,601) — 12,289 14,859 (1,345) (969) 12,545\nBuildings 37,252 (16,640) (2,512) 18,100 36,789 (15,836) — 20,953\nProduction & other equipment 5,290 (4,945) — 345 5,343 (4,738) — 605\nTotal right-of-use lease assets 56,432 (23,186) (2,512) 30,734 56,991 (21,919) (969) 34,103\nTotal property, plant and\nequipment 562,003 (264,020) (3,659) 294,324 571,691 (228,398) (20,324) 322,969\nThe following summarizes the changes in the net book values of property, plant and equipment for the periods presented:\nBalance, Additions from Foreign Balance,\nMarch 31, business currency March 31,\n2023 Additions combinations Disposals Other (1) Depreciation Impairment translation 2024\nOwned assets\nLand 50,257 — 1,497 — (7,779) — — (61) 43,914\nBuildings 151,623 1,168 — (212) 3,435 (12,397) (300) 550 143,867\nConstruction in progress 25,618 10,239 — (2,137) (7,760) (145) (645) 515 25,685\nComputer software &\nequipment 1,723 313 — (26) (12) (797) — (3) 1,198\nFurniture & fixtures 1,796 407 — (11) 159 (883) — (12) 1,456\nProduction & other\nequipment 57,849 3,026 — (1,232) 4,340 (16,325) (202) 14 47,470\nTotal owned assets 288,866 15,153 1,497 (3,618) (7,617) (30,547) (1,147) 1,003 263,590\nRight-of-use leased assets\nLand 12,545 — — — — (255) — (1) 12,289\nBuildings 20,953 5,232 298 (2,355) (388) (3,098) (2,512) (30) 18,100\nProduction & other\nequipment 605 87 — (68) — (277) — (2) 345\nTotal right-of-use lease\n34,103 5,319 298 (2,423) (388) (3,630) (2,512) (33) 30,734\nassets\nTotal property, plant and\nequipment 322,969 20,472 1,795 (6,041) (8,005) (34,177) (3,659) 970 294,324\n(1) Includes reclassification of construction in progress cost when associated projects are complete and transfers to assets held for sale (Note 11).\n26\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nYear ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nBalance, Additions from Foreign Balance,\nJune 30, business currency March 31,\n2022 Additions combinations Disposals Other (1) Depreciation Impairment translation 2023\nOwned assets\nLand 13,127 — 21,770 — 16,609 — (1,820) 571 50,257\nReal estate 96,804 840 52,350 — 15,467 (9,774) (3,842) (222) 151,623\nConstruction in progress 25,092 5,322 1,134 (36) 5,135 — (11,945) 916 25,618\nComputer software &\nequipment 3,161 710 — — (867) (1,284) (20) 23 1,723\nFurniture & fixtures 2,681 37 — — (874) (46) (42) 40 1,796\nProduction & other\nequipment 60,462 1,662 17,633 (1,989) (1,808) (16,942) (1,686) 517 57,849\nTotal owned assets 201,327 8,571 92,887 (2,025) 33,662 (28,046) (19,355) 1,845 288,866\nRight-of-use leased assets\nLand 6,251 — — (29) 7,580 (291) (969) 3 12,545\nReal estate 25,044 57 — (6,553) 5,363 (3,155) — 197 20,953\nProduction & other\nequipment 843 498 — (182) (72) (495) — 13 605\nTotal right-of-use lease assets 32,138 555 — (6,764) 12,871 (3,941) (969) 213 34,103\nTotal property, plant and\nequipment 233,465 9,126 92,887 (8,789) 46,533 (31,987) (20,324) 2,058 322,969\n(1) Includes reclassification of construction in progress cost when associated projects are complete and transfers to assets held for sale (Note 11).\nDepreciation relating to manufacturing equipment and production facilities for owned and right-of-use leased assets is capitalized to inventory\nand is expensed to cost of sales upon the sale of goods.

The\nCompany does not expect to incur any additional expenses in connection with the wind down.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company closed its Aurora Nordic facility (“Nordic”), located in Denmark due to a number of\noperational and regulatory challenges.\nIn connection with the closures of Nordic, Reliva and the exit of our partnership in Growery B.V., the Company has reported these as\ndiscontinued operations as the operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the\nrest of the Company.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's consolidated discontinued operations for the respective periods:\nNine months ended\nYear ended March 31, March 31\n2024 2023\nRevenue 425 1,280\nCost of sales 6,205 2,838\nChanges in fair value of inventory and biological assets sold 5,449 (184)\nUnrealized loss (gain) on changes in fair value of biological assets (4,411) 4,348\nGeneral and administration expenses 1,887 1,748\nSales and marketing 502 791\nAcquisition costs — 30\nResearch and development 301 1,141\nDepreciation (350) 405\nInterest 193 —\nFinance costs (523) 61\nForeign exchange 55 1,798\nImpairment of property, plant, and equipment 85 8,180\nImpairment of goodwill — 1,920\nOther losses (gains) (1,191) 167\nCurrent tax 93 —\nDeferred tax — (53)\nLoss on disposal of discontinued operations 2,411 —\n10,706 23,190\nNet loss from discontinued operations (10,281) (21,910)\n30\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nYear ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nNote 12 Business Combinations\nAccounting Policy\nA business combination is a transaction or event in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses and is accounted for\nusing the acquisition method. The total consideration paid for the acquisition is the aggregate of the fair values of assets acquired,\nliabilities assumed, and equity instruments issued in exchange for control of the acquiree at the acquisition date. The acquisition date is\nthe date when the Company obtains control of the acquiree. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at\ntheir acquisition date fair values, except for deferred taxes and share-based payment awards where IFRS provides exceptions to recording\nthe amounts at fair value. Goodwill represents the difference between the fair value of total consideration paid and the fair value of the net\nidentifiable assets acquired. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed through the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss.\nContingent consideration is measured at its acquisition date fair value and is included as part of the consideration transferred in a business\ncombination, subject to the applicable terms and conditions. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at\nsubsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration that is classified as an\nasset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with the corresponding\ngain or loss recognized in profit or loss.\nBased on the facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date, management will perform a valuation analysis to allocate the\npurchase price based on the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date. Management\nhas one year from the acquisition date to confirm and finalize the facts and circumstances that support the finalized fair value analysis and\nrelated purchase price allocation. Until such time, these values are provisionally reported and are subject to change. Changes to fair\nvalues and allocations are retrospectively adjusted in subsequent periods.\nIn determining the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the most significant estimates generally relate to\ncontingent consideration, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Management exercises judgment in estimating the\nprobability and timing of when earn-out milestones are expected to be achieved, which is used as the basis for estimating fair value.\nIdentified intangible assets are fair valued using appropriate valuation techniques which are generally based on a forecast of the total\nexpected future net cash flows of the acquiree. Valuations are highly dependent on the inputs used and assumptions made by\nmanagement regarding the future performance of these assets and any changes in the discount rate applied. Property, plant and\nequipment are fair valued using a combination of the cost approach and sales comparison approach. The significant assumptions used\nwere the replacement costs and rate per acre in the fair value measurement of the acquired land and replacement cost per square foot in\nthe fair value measurement of the acquired buildings.\nAcquisitions that do not meet the definition of a business combination are accounted for as asset acquisitions. Consideration paid for an\nasset acquisition is allocated to the individual identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. Asset\nacquisitions do not give rise to goodwill.\nMedReleaf Australia\nOn February 7, 2024, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company acquired the remaining 90.43% interest in Indica Industries Pty Ltd (“MedReleaf\nAustralia” or “MRA”) an Australian domiciled company, for total purchase price consideration of approximately $44.7 million (AUS$51.0 million),\ncomprised of cash consideration of approximately $8.2 million (AUS$9.5 million) and issuance of Common Shares of 6,948,994(1) with a fair value\nof $36.5 million (AUS$41.6 million). Given the Company’s ownership interest of 9.57% prior to the acquisition, the Company applied step\nacquisition accounting requiring a disposal of its current position based on the fair value of its ownership interest immediate before acquisition. As\na result the Company recognized a gain on disposal of $4.7 million (AUS$5.4 million), recorded as other comprehensive income in the\nconsolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss with a corresponding increase to the total purchase price consideration. The Company\nacquired the remaining interest in MRA to secure its distribution and market share in a key export market.\nThe total purchase price consideration includes cash held in escrow of approximately $0.8 million (AUS$0.9 million) for working capital and\nspecified indemnifications obligations and 676,579 Common Shares with a fair value of $3.6 million (AUS$4.0 million) on closing, held in escrow.\nThe indemnification period is up to one year following the close of the transaction, with an exception for certain tax superannuation claims, which\nexpire five years from closing, and certain other specified claims that survive until the applicable statute of limitations. Total transactions costs of\n$2.2 million were expensed to acquisition costs in the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss. The working capital and\nindemnity cash consideration held in escrow has been recorded as restricted cash with a corresponding increase to accounts payable and\naccrued liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial position. The common shares held in escrow have been recorded as an obligation\nto issues shares in the consolidated statements of changes in equity.\nGoodwill arising from the acquisition represents future income, projected growth in the Australian marketplace, and other intangibles that do not\nqualify for separate recognition. The goodwill will be allocated to the Cannabis Operating segment.\nThe initial purchase price was provisionally allocated based on the Company’s estimated fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the\nliabilities assumed on the acquisition date. The values assigned, including the related goodwill and deferred tax assets and liabilities, are\ntherefore preliminary and subject to change.\n31\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nYear ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nProvisional Allocation at\nAcquisition\nCash paid 8,249\nCommon shares issued 36,482\nTotal purchase price for remaining 90.43% interest 44,731\nFair value of existing ownership 4,734\nTotal fair value of consideration 49,465\nPreliminary fair value of net identifiable assets\nCash 5,710\nAccounts receivable 4,785\nInventory 10,464\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 80\nProperty, plant and equipment 1,795\nIntangible assets:\nLicenses 5,500\nBrand 7,500\n35,834\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 10,206\nIncome taxes payable 317\nLease liability 311\n10,834\nProvisional purchase price allocation\nNet identifiable assets acquired 25,000\nGoodwill 24,465\n49,465\nNet cash outflows\nCash consideration paid (8,249)\nCash acquired 5,710\n(2,539)\nFor year ended March 31, 2024, MedReleaf Australia accounted for $2.8 million in revenue and $0.9 million in net loss since the February 7,\n2024 acquisition date.

The transaction\nincluded initial consideration of $44.8 million consisting of $38.8 million paid in cash, $3.0 million paid into escrow for indemnity holdback, and\n$3.0 million paid into escrow relating to performance holdback, which are released upon Bevo meeting certain financial targets. The performance\nholdback payable was measured at fair value of $2.2 million. The total cash consideration of $6.0 million paid into escrow has been recognized\nas an increase in restricted cash, with a corresponding increase of $3.0 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to the\nindemnity holdback; $2.2 million in contingent consideration payable related to the performance holdback and $0.8 million in goodwill on the\nconsolidated statements of financial position.\nAdditional consideration of up to $12.0 million as a potential earnout amount is payable in cash or Common Shares at the election of the\nCompany, subject to Bevo successfully achieving certain financial milestones at its Site One facility in Langley, British Columbia for the period up\nto December 31, 2025. The additional consideration was measured at fair value and recognized as an increase of $0.7 million in contingent\nconsideration payable, with a corresponding increase in goodwill, on the consolidated financial statements of financial position.\nIn connection with the potential earnout, the Company has pledged 6,596,761 of Bevo common shares owned by the Company as security to the\nnon-controlling shareholders of Bevo.\n32\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nYear ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nThe transaction includes call options such that the Company and certain non-controlling shareholders of Bevo may acquire additional Common\nShares of Bevo based on Bevo’s EBITDA performance and in the event of an Adverse Change of Control, as defined in the Bevo shareholders\nagreement. The call options are derivative instruments measured at fair value on the date of acquisition with subsequent changes recognized in\nnet loss. The fair value of the call options at the date of acquisition were determined to be nominal in the provisional purchase price allocation.\nIn addition, the transaction includes a put option with certain non-controlling shareholders of Bevo such that the Company is required to purchase\nup to an additional 40.4% of the common shares of Bevo based on Bevo’s achievement of certain future EBITDA performance targets. As a\nresult, the Company recognized a financial liability of $48.0 million on the date of acquisition at the present value of the amount payable on\nexercise of the put option. The put option was valued at the date of acquisition using a discounted cash flow model and is valued subsequently\nusing a Monte Carlo simulation. The determination relies on forecasted information, of which the significant assumptions used within the model\nare revenue, cost of sales and operating expenses. Since the Company has elected to use the present-access method and measure the NCI of\nthe proportionate share of the net assets in Bevo, the fair value of the put option is not included in the purchase price allocation.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, the indemnity holdback of $3.0 million was paid out of escrow with a corresponding decrease in restricted\ncash. Additionally, the performance holdback became payable in the amount of $3.0 million, the fair value at the date of determination.\nProvisional allocation at\nacquisition Adjustments Final\nCash paid 38,844 — 38,844\nPerformance holdback 2,153 — 2,153\nIndemnity holdback 3,000 — 3,000\nContingent consideration 749 — 749\n44,746 — 44,746\nPreliminary fair value of net identifiable assets\nCash 54 — 54\nAccounts receivable 3,317 — 3,317\nBiological assets 4,873 (403) 4,470\nInventory 4,366 — 4,366\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 749 — 749\nProperty, plant and equipment 92,887 — 92,887\nIntangible assets —\nCustomer relationships 5,600 — 5,600\nSoftware 247 — 247\n112,093 (403) 111,690\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 3,699 — 3,699\nIncome taxes payable 1,660 (1,744) (84)\nDeferred revenue 151 — 151\nLoans and borrowings 39,934 (237) 39,697\nDeferred tax liability 14,762 1,509 16,271\n60,206 (472) 59,734\nProvisional purchase price allocation\nNet identifiable assets acquired 51,887 69 51,956\nNon-controlling interest (25,891) (34) (25,925)\nGoodwill 18,750 (35) 18,715\n44,746 — 44,746\nNet cash outflows\nCash consideration paid (38,844) — (38,844)\nCash acquired 54 — 54\n(38,790) — (38,790)\nGoodwill arising from the acquisition represents future income and growth, and other intangibles that do not qualify for separate recognition.

As at March 31, 2023, Management finalized its purchase price allocation for the fair value of identifiable assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed and the resulting allocation of goodwill.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Bevo, the Company recognized non-controlling interests in Bevo of $25.9 million, which represents the non-\ncontrolling interest portion of 49.9% of the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.\nAs a result of the transaction, the Company recognized a deferred tax asset of $16.3 million with a corresponding recovery of deferred taxes on\nthe consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss.\nTransaction costs directly related to the acquisition of Bevo for $1.0 million was expensed to acquisition costs in the consolidated statements of\nloss and comprehensive loss.\nGoodwill arising from the acquisition represents expected synergies, future income and growth, and other intangibles that do not qualify for\nseparate recognition. The goodwill arising on this acquisition is expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes.\nNote 13 Non-controlling Interest (“NCI”)\nAccounting Policy\nNon-controlling interests (“NCI”) are recognized either at fair value or at the NCI’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets,\ndetermined on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. For each acquisition, the excess of the total consideration, the fair value of previously held\nequity interests held prior to obtaining control and the NCI in the acquiree, over the fair value of the identifiable net asset acquired, is\nrecorded as goodwill.\nThe change in non-controlling interest is as follows:\nBevo Other Total\n$ $ $\nBalance, June 30, 2022 — 511 511\nAcquired through business acquisitions (Note 12) 25,925 — 25,925\nChange in ownership interests in net assets 11,923 — 11,923\nShare of loss for the period (4,944) (2,354) (7,298)\nBalance, March 31, 2023 32,904 (1,843) 31,061\nAdditions — — —\nChange in ownership interests in net assets 12,208 — 12,208\nDiscontinued operations (Note 11) — 2,572 2,572\nShare of loss for the period (3,519) (225) (3,744)\nBalance, March 31, 2024 41,593 504 42,097\nDuring the nine months ended March 31, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its Aurora Sky facility in Edmonton, Alberta and\nrelated assets and liabilities to Bevo (a 50.1% controlled subsidiary) (the “Aurora Sky Transaction”).

The Aurora Sky Transaction closed on September 30, 2022. The Company recognized the inter-company transfer of\nnet assets to Bevo at cost and recorded an increase in non-controlling interest equal to the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the\ncarrying value of the net assets transferred of $12.2 million with a corresponding decrease to deficit on the consolidated statements of financial\nposition.\n34\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nYear ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nNote 14 Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nAccounting Policy\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization and any impairment losses. Intangible assets acquired in a business\ncombination are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Amortization of definite life intangibles is calculated on a straight-line basis\nover their estimated useful lives, which do not exceed the contractual period, if any, over the following terms:\nCustomer relationships 20 years\nHealth Canada licenses Useful life of the facility\nOther operating licenses 10 years\nPatents 10 years\nIP and Know-how 10 years\nERP Software 5 years\nThe estimated useful lives, residual values and amortization methods are reviewed annually and any changes in estimates are accounted\nfor prospectively. Intangible assets with an indefinite life or not yet available for use are not subject to amortization. Indefinite life permits\nand licenses are predominantly held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. Given that these permits and licenses are connected to the\nsubsidiary rather than a specific asset, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which these assets are expected to generate future\ncash inflows for the Company.\nResearch costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditures are capitalized only if development costs can be measured reliably,\nthe product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and the Company intends to and\nhas sufficient resources to complete development to use or sell the asset. Other development expenditures are recognized as research\nand development expenses on the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss as incurred. Capitalized deferred development\ncosts are internally generated intangible assets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid for the acquisition of an entity over the fair value of the net tangible and\nintangible assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to the cash generating unit (“CGU”) or group of CGUs which are expected to benefit from\nthe synergies of the combination. Goodwill is not subject to amortization.\nImpairment of intangible assets and goodwill\nGoodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life or not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or\ncircumstances that make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the\nbusiness climate or a decision to sell or dispose all or a portion of a reporting unit. Finite life intangible assets are tested whenever there is\nan indication of impairment.\nGoodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are tested annually as required for impairment by comparing the carrying value of each CGU\ncontaining the assets to its recoverable amount. Indefinite life intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value\nof each CGU containing the assets to its recoverable amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment based on the level at which it is monitored\nby management, and not at a level higher than an operating segment. The allocation of goodwill to the CGUs or group of CGUs requires\nthe use of judgment.\nAn impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the operating segment or CGU’s carrying amount exceeds it recoverable\namount. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs’ assets have been determined based on the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and\nvalue-in-use. There is a material degree of uncertainty with respect to the estimates of the recoverable amounts of the CGU, given the\nnecessity of making key economic assumptions about the future. Impairment losses recognized in respect of a CGU are first allocated to\nthe carrying value of goodwill and any excess is allocated to the carrying value of assets in the CGU. Any impairment is recorded in profit\nand loss in the period in which the impairment is identified. A reversal of an asset impairment loss is allocated to the assets of the CGU on\na pro rata basis. In allocating a reversal of an impairment loss, the carrying amount of an asset shall not be increased above the lower of\nits recoverable amount and the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset\nin prior period.

The Company considers external and internal factors, including\noverall financial performance, market expectations and relevant entity-specific factors, as part of this assessment.\nGoodwill arising from business combinations were allocated to the Cannabis segment and Plant Propagation segment for $24.5 million and $18.7\nmillion, respectively (March 31, 2023 – nil and $18.7 million). The goodwill in the Cannabis segment arose in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024\nfrom the acquisition of MedReleaf Australia (Note 12).\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company had two reportable operating segments: (i) Cannabis and (ii) Plant Propagation, compared\nto the nine months ended March 31, 2023, of three reportable segments: (i) Canadian Cannabis, (ii) European Union (“EU”) Cannabis and (iii)\nPlant Propagation (Note 27).

Where applicable, the Company uses its\nmarket capitalization and comparative market multiples to corroborate DCF results. The significant assumptions applied in the determination of\nthe recoverable amount are described below:\ni. Cash flows: Estimated cash flows were projected based on actual operating results from internal sources as well as industry and\nmarket trends. Estimated cash flows are primarily driven by forecasted revenues, gross margins and earnings before interest, taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins. The Canadian Cannabis CGU, European Cannabis CGU and the Cannabis\nOperating Segment forecasts are extended to a total of 4 years (and a terminal year thereafter). The Plant Propagation CGU and\noperating segment forecasts are extended to a total of 7 years (and a terminal year thereafter). The Company extended the forecast\nperiod an additional two years to account for the maturation of the new orchid business\nii. Terminal value growth rate: The terminal growth rate was based on historical and projected consumer price inflation, historical and\nprojected economic indicators, and projected industry growth;\niii. Post-tax discount rate: The post-tax discount rate is reflective of the CGUs and Operating Segments Weighted Average Cost of Capital\n(“WACC”). The WACC was estimated based on the risk-free rate, equity risk premium, beta adjustment to the equity risk premium\nbased on a direct comparison approach, an unsystematic risk premium, and after-tax cost of debt based on corporate bond yields; and\niv. Tax rate: The tax rates used in determining the future cash flows were those substantively enacted at the respective valuation date.\nThe following table outlines the key assumptions used in calculating the recoverable amount for each CGU and operating segment for\nimpairment as at March 31, 2024 (Impairment testing date of January 1, 2024) and March 31, 2023:\nIndefinite Life Intangible\nImpairment Testing Goodwill Impairment Testing\nCannabis\nCanadian European Operating\nCannabis CGU Plant Propagation Cannabis CGU Segment Plant Propagation\nMarch 31, 2024\nTerminal value growth rate 3.0 % 3.0 % 3.0 % 3.0 % 3.0%\nDiscount rate 12.0 % 10.0 % 12.0 % 12.0 % 10.0%\nBudgeted revenue growth 4.6 % 10.6 % 17.4 % 4.6 % 10.6%\nrate over forecast period\nFair value less cost to dispose $74,175 $192,729 $48,143 $138,395 $192,729\nCanadian European\nCannabis Cannabis\nCanadian European Operating Operating\nCannabis CGU Plant Propagation Cannabis CGU Segment Plant Propagation Segment\nMarch 31, 2023\nTerminal value growth rate 3.0 % 3.0 % 3.0 % 3.0 % 3.0 % 3.0 %\nDiscount rate 16.5 % 11.0 % 17.0 % 16.5 % 11.0 % 17.0 %\nBudgeted revenue growth 16.7 % 10.0 % 48.8 % 16.5 % 10.0 % 48.8 %\nrate over forecast period\nFair value less cost to dispose $258,228 $184,832 $78,612 $236,345 $184,832 $87,420\nCGU impairment\nCanadian Cannabis CGU\nThe Company’s Canadian Cannabis CGU represents its operations dedicated to the cultivation and sale of cannabis products within Canada and\ncertain international markets and forms part of the Company’s Cannabis operating segment. During the year ended March 31, 2024, it was\nconcluded that the recoverable amount was lower than the carrying value resulting in assessment of the recoverable amounts of its long lived\nassets, indicating an impairment. The impairment loss was allocated based on the relative carrying amounts of the CGU’s assets at the\nimpairment date, with no individual asset being reduced below its recoverable amount. The Company allocated $32.9 million of impairment\nlosses to the CGU’s intangible assets and $2.8 million of impairment losses to property, plant and equipment (Note 10). The allocation of\nimpairment recognized to intangible assets was to the extent that that the intangible assets were not impaired beyond their recoverable amount.\nThe fair value of the intangible assets were measured using valuation techniques including the relief from royalty method for brands and the with\n37\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nYear ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nand without method for permits and licenses.

The identification of such components embedded within a convertible debenture requires\nsignificant judgment given that it is based on the interpretation of the substance of the contractual arrangement. Where the conversion\noption has a fixed conversion rate, the financial liability, which represents the obligation to pay coupon interest on the convertible\ndebentures in the future, is initially measured at its fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost. The residual amount is\naccounted for as an equity instrument at issuance. Where the conversion option has a variable conversion rate, the conversion option is\nrecognized as a derivative liability measured at fair value through profit and loss. The residual amount is recognized as a financial liability\nand subsequently measured at amortized cost. The determination of the fair value is also an area of significant judgment given that it is\nsubject to various inputs, assumptions and estimates including: contractual future cash flows, discount rates, credit spreads and volatility.\nTransaction costs are apportioned to the debt liability and equity components in proportion to the allocation of proceeds.\n$\nBalance, June 30, 2022 226,504\nInterest paid (13,305)\nAccretion 16,123\nAccrued interest 8,956\nDebt repurchased (128,706)\nRealized loss on debt repurchased 10,874\nRealized loss on foreign exchange 12,125\nBalance, March 31, 2023 132,571\nInterest paid (3,043)\nAccretion 5,363\nAccrued interest 2,199\nAmortized cost of debt repurchased (145,770)\nRealized loss on debt repurchased 9,244\nUnrealized gain on foreign exchange (564)\nBalance, March 31, 2024 —\nOn January 24, 2019, the Company issued $460.6 million (U.S.$345.0 million) in aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due\n2024 (“Senior Notes”) issued at par value.

A lease is recognized as a right-of-use asset\nand corresponding liability at the commencement date. Each lease payment included in the lease liability is apportioned between the\nrepayment of the liability and a finance cost. The finance cost is recognized in “finance and other costs” in the consolidated statements of\nloss and comprehensive loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the\nliability. Lease liabilities represent the net present value of fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments); variable lease\npayments based on an index, rate, or subject to a fair market value renewal condition; amounts expected to be payable by the lessee\nunder residual value guarantees; the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\npayments of penalties for terminating the lease, if it is probable that the lessee will exercise that option.\nThe Company’s lease liability is recognized net of lease incentives receivable. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate\nimplicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. The period over which the lease\npayments are discounted is the expected lease term, including renewal and termination options that the Company is reasonably certain to\nexercise.\nSubsequently, if there is a change to the expected lease term within the control of the lessee, the lease liability will be remeasured using\nthe updated term and revised discount rate on a prospective basis.\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis in\ngeneral and administration and sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss. Short-term\nleases are defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index, rate, or\nsubject to a fair market value renewal condition are expensed as incurred and recognized in costs of goods sold, general and\nadministration, or sales and marketing expense, as appropriate given how the underlying leased asset is used, in the consolidated\nstatements of loss and comprehensive loss.\nIf the right-of-use asset is subsequently leased to a third party (a “sublease”), the Company will assess the classification of the sublease as\nto whether it is a finance or operating lease. Subleases that are classified as an operating lease will recognize lease income, while a\nfinancing lease will recognize a lease receivable and derecognize the carrying value of the right-of-use asset, with the difference recorded\nin profit or loss.\n41\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nYear ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nThe changes in the carrying value of current and non-current lease liabilities are as follows:\n$\nBalance, June 30, 2022 42,987\nLease additions 555\nDisposal of leases (272)\nLease payments (6,709)\nNet lease term reduction and other items 10,166\nChanges due to foreign exchange rates 244\nInterest expense on lease liabilities 2,246\nBalance, March 31, 2023 49,217\nCurrent portion (5,413)\nLong-term portion 43,804\nBalance, March 31, 2023 49,217\nLease additions 5,618\nDisposal of leases (635)\nLease payments (8,446)\nNet lease term increase and other items (1,402)\nChanges due to foreign exchange rates 28\nInterest expense on lease liabilities 3,152\nBalance, March 31, 2024 47,532\nCurrent portion (4,856)\nLong-term portion 42,676\nFor the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded $3.1 million in leasing expenses (nine months ended March 31, 2023 – $1.6 million)\nrelated to short-term leases, variable leases, and low-value leases.\n42\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nYear ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nNote 18 Share Capital\nAccounting Policy\nShare Purchase Warrants\nWarrants issued in foreign currencies are classified as derivative liabilities.

The fair value of non-employee stock\noptions is recorded as an expense at the date the goods or services are received with a corresponding credit to share reserves.\nDepending on the complexity of the stock option terms, the fair value of options is calculated using either the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel or the Binomial model. When determining the fair value of stock options, management is required to make certain assumptions and\nestimates related to expected lives, volatility, risk-free rate, future dividend yields and estimated forfeitures at the initial grant date.\nThe number of options expected to vest is reviewed and adjusted at the end of each reporting period such that the amount recognized for\nservices received as consideration for the equity instruments granted shall be based on the number of equity instruments that eventually\nvest. Upon the exercise of stock options, proceeds received from stock option holders are recorded as an increase to share capital and the\nrelated share reserve is transferred to share capital.\nRestricted Share Units (“RSUs”) and Deferred Share Units (“DSUs”)\nRSUs are equity-settled share-based payments. RSUs are measured at their intrinsic fair value on the date of grant based on the closing\nprice of the Company’s shares on the date prior to the grant, and is recognized as share-based compensation expense over the vesting\nperiod with a corresponding credit to share reserves. Under IFRS, the Company’s DSUs are classified as equity-settled share-based\npayment transactions as they are settled in either cash or common shares at the sole discretion of Aurora. As such, the DSUs are\nmeasured in the same manner as RSUs.\nThe amount recognized for services received as consideration for the RSUs and DSUs granted is based on the number of equity\ninstruments that eventually vest. Upon the release of RSUs and DSUs, the related share reserve is transferred to share capital.\nPerformance Share Units (“PSUs”)\nPSUs are equity-settled share-based payments and have both a service and market condition. PSUs are measured at their fair value on\nthe grant date and are recognized as share-based compensation expense over the vesting period with a corresponding credit to share\nreserves. The fair value of PSUs is calculated using the Monte Carlo model which factors in the probability of achieving the market-based\nperformance target. When determining the fair value, management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates related to\nvolatility, risk-free rate, equity correlations between Aurora and a peer group of companies, future stock prices, and estimated forfeitures.\nThe amount recognized for services received as consideration for the PSUs granted is based on the number of equity instruments that\neventually vest. Upon the release of PSUs, the related share reserve is transferred to share capital.\nCash Settled Share-based Compensation\nShare-based compensation subject to cash settlement are classified as a derivative liability. They are initially measured at fair value and\nrecorded as a derivative liability in the consolidated statements of financial position.\nShare-based compensation that is in recognition of past service is recorded at the full amount to share-based compensation expense and\nare remeasured each reporting period with the difference going through share-based compensation expense. Upon settlement they are\nremeasured and the derivative liability is extinguished at the remeasured amount.\nShare-based compensation that is in recognition of future service is amortized ratably over the future service period. Each reporting period,\nthey are remeasured with the change in value reflected in the share-based compensation expense.\nThe Company currently has in place a “rolling maximum” or “evergreen” stock option plan (“Option Plan”), Fixed Restricted Share Unit Plan\n(“RSU Plan”), Fixed Performance Share Unit Plan (“PSU Plan”), and a Fixed Deferred Share Unit Plan (“DSU Plan”), which is applicable to non-\nemployee directors only. The Board may from time to time, in its discretion and in accordance with Toronto Stock Exchange requirements, grant\nto directors, officers, employees and consultants, as applicable, non-transferable stock options, RSUs, PSUs and DSUs in accordance with these\nplans. The maximum number of Common Shares issuable pursuant to all equity-based compensation arrangements shall not, at any time,\nexceed 10.0% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares.\nAt the Company’s Annual General and Special Meeting held on November 13, 2017 (“2017 AGM”), shareholders approved the adoption of the\nOption Plan.

Current tax is payable on taxable profit, which differs from profit or loss in the financial\nstatements. Calculation of current tax is based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of\nthe reporting period. Current tax assets arise when the amount paid for taxes exceeds the amount due for the current and prior periods.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities\nDeferred taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities\nand their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated, without discounting, at tax rates that are expected to\napply to their respective periods of realization, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.\nDeferred tax liabilities are always provided for in full.\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that they will be able to be utilized against future taxable income.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when the Company has a right and intention to offset current tax assets and liabilities\nfrom the same taxation authority.\nChanges in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized as a component of tax income or expense in profit or loss, except where they\nrelate to items that are recognized in other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the related deferred tax is also recognized in\nother comprehensive income or equity, respectively.\nSignificant estimates are required in determining the Company’s provision for income taxes and uncertain tax positions. Some of these\nestimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. Various internal and external factors may have favorable or\nunfavorable effects on the Company’s future effective tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in tax laws,\nregulations and/or rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, changes in estimates of prior years’ items, results of\ntax audits by tax authorities, future levels of research and development spending, changes in estimates related to repatriation of\nundistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings. The realization of the Company’s\ndeferred tax assets is primarily dependent on whether the Company is able to generate sufficient capital gains and taxable income prior\nto expiration of any loss carry forward balance. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset\nwill not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment with regard to\nmanagement’s assessment of the long-range forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments\nto the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made.\nThe Company records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances\nand information available at the reporting date. There is inherent uncertainty in quantifying income tax positions. The Company has\nrecorded tax benefits for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will result upon ultimate settlement with a\ntax authority that has all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will\nresult, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.\n53\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nYear ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nThe net tax provision differs from that expected by applying the combined federal and provincial tax rates of 27.0% (March 31, 2023 – 27.0%) to\nloss before income tax for the following items:\nMarch 31, 2024 March 31, 2023\n$ $\nLoss before tax (59,599) (220,376)\nCombined federal and provincial rate 27.0 % 27.0 %\nExpected tax recovery (16,092) (59,502)\nChange in estimates from prior year 34 (23)\nForeign exchange 368 (2,637)\nNon-deductible expenses 3,170 5,715\nNon-deductible (non-taxable) portion of capital items (2,441) (7,469)\nGoodwill and other impairment items 1,674 612\nTax impact on divestitures 953 3,076\nDifference in statutory tax rate 1,070 6,655\nEffect of change in tax rates (5,277) (99)\nChanges in deferred tax benefits not recognized 15,987 38,488\nIncome tax expense (recovery) (554) (15,184)\nDeferred taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of asset and liabilities for financial reporting\npurposes and their tax values.

The judge rendered a decision on August 24, 2023\non Aurora’s motion to dismiss. On September 8, 2023, the Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration as to the stock drop that occurred following\nAurora’s September 2019 financials. Aurora opposed this motion.

The claim states that the Defendant Employee left\nthe property and caused damage. The plaintiffs further claim outstanding rent and legal fees. There is no record of any documentation of Aurora\nbeing a party to any such relationship. Plaintiffs have received a summary judgment against the Defendant Employee and will now attempt to\nrecover their judgment against the Defendant Employee. Plaintiffs will then decide whether to pursue the indemnity claim against the Company.\nThe Company disputes the allegations and intends to defend against the claims.\nOn November 15, 2022, the Company, its subsidiary ACE, and MedReleaf Corp. (which amalgamated with ACE in July 2020) were named in a\npurported class action proceeding in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. The purported class action claims that the Company failed to warn of\ncertain risks purported to be associated with the consumption of cannabis. The statement of claim was served upon the Company on November\n22, 2022 and a statement of defence was filed and served. The next major step in the process is scheduling a timetable for the remaining\ndeliverables of the process, including delivery of the plaintiff’s certification motion record. The plaintiff must either deliver their certification\nmaterials or come to an agreement with the Aurora Defendants on a timetable for doing so within one year of commencing the proposed class\naction.

The Company disputes the allegations and intends to defend against the claims.\nThe Company is subject to litigation and similar claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims related to employment, human\nresources, product liability and commercial disputes. The Company has received notice of, or are aware of, certain possible claims against us\nwhere the magnitude of such claims is negligible, or it is not currently possible for us to predict the outcome of such claims, possible claims or\nlawsuits due to various factors including: the preliminary nature of some claims; an incomplete factual record; and the unpredictable nature of\nopposing parties and their demands. Management is of the opinion, based upon legal assessments and information presently available, that it is\nunlikely that any of these claims would result in liability to the Company, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, would\nhave a material effect on the consolidated financial statements, other than the claims described above.\nIn respect of the aforementioned claims, as at March 31, 2024 the Company has recognized total provisions of $2.3 million (March 31, 2023 –\n$1.0 million) in provisions on the consolidated statements of financial position and a settlement accrual for nil (March 31, 2023 – $1.0 million) in\naccounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial position.\n(b) Commitments\nThe Company has various lease commitments related to various office space, production equipment, vehicles, facilities and warehouses expiring\nup to June 2033. The Company has certain leases with optional renewal terms that the Company may exercise at its option.\nIn addition to lease liability commitments disclosed in Note 29(b) and loans and borrowing repayments in Note 16, the Company has $3.2 million\nin future capital commitments and purchase commitments payments, which are due over the next 12 months.\n57\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nYear ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nNote 26 Revenue\nAccounting Policy\nThe Company generates revenue primarily from the sale of cannabis, cannabis related products, plant propagation and provision of\nservices. The Company uses the following five-step contract-based analysis of transactions to determine if, when and how much revenue\ncan be recognized:\n1. Identify the contract with a customer;\n2. Identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract;\n3. Determine the transaction price;\n4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and\n5. Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies the performance obligation(s).\nRevenue from the sale of cannabis is generally recognized when control over the goods has been transferred to the customer. Payment\nfor medical sales is typically due prior to shipment. Payment for wholesale transactions is due within a specified time period as permitted\nby the underlying agreement and the Company’s credit policy upon the transfer of goods to the customer. The Company generally satisfies\nits performance obligation and transfers control to the customer upon delivery and acceptance by the customer. Revenue is recorded at\nthe estimated amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled.\nRevenue from plant propagation is recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, at an amount\nwhich reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. The Company goods consist\nof propagation seedlings and bedding plants. The sale is completed upon delivery as the Company bears the responsibility of\ntransportation and related costs.\nFor bill-and-hold arrangements, revenue is recognized before delivery but only upon transfer of control of the good to the customer.\nControl is transferred to the customer when the substance of the bill-and-hold arrangement is substantive, the Company cannot sell the\ngoods to another customer, the goods can be identified separately and are ready for physical transfer to the customer.\nService revenues, including patient referral services, are recognized over a period of time as performance obligations are completed.\nPayment of the transaction price for patient counselling is typically due prior to the services being rendered and therefore, the transaction\nprice is recognized as a contract liability, or deferred revenue, when payment is received. Contract liabilities are subsequently recognized\ninto revenue as or when the Company fulfills its performance obligation.\nEffective October 17, 2018, Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) began levying an excise tax on the sale of medical and consumer cannabis\nproducts. The Company becomes liable for these excise duties when cannabis products are delivered to the customer. The excise taxes\npayable is the higher of (i) a flat-rate duty which is imposed when a cannabis product is packaged, and (ii) an advalorem duty that is\nimposed when a cannabis product is delivered to the customer. Effective May 1, 2019, excise tax calculated on edible cannabis products,\ncannabis extracts and cannabis topicals will prospectively be calculated as a flat rate based on the quantity of total tetrahydrocannabinol\n(THC) contained in the final product. There were no changes in the legislation in calculating excise taxes for fresh cannabis, dried\ncannabis, seeds and plants. Where the excise tax has been billed to customers, the Company has reflected the excise tax as part of\nrevenue in accordance with IFRS 15. Net revenue from sale of goods, as presented on the consolidated statements of comprehensive\n(loss) income, represents revenue from the sale of goods less applicable excise taxes. Given that the excise tax payable/paid to CRA\ncannot be reclaimed and is not always billed to customers, the Company recognizes that the excise tax is an operating cost that affects\ngross margin to the extent that it is not recovered from its customers.\nFor certain sale of goods in which the Company earns a manufacturing fee, the Company records net revenue as an agent on the basis\nthat the Company does not control pricing or bear inventory or credit risk.\n58\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nYear ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nThe Company generates revenue from the transfer of goods and services over time and at a point-in-time from the revenue streams below. Net\nrevenue from sale of goods is reflected net of actual returns and estimated variable consideration for future returns and price adjustments of\n$1.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2024 (nine months ended March 31, 2023 – $3.0 million). The estimated variable consideration is\nbased on historical experience and management’s expectation of future returns and price adjustments. As of March 31, 2024, the net return\nliability for the estimated variable consideration was $1.2 million (March 31, 2023 – $1.6 million) and is included in deferred revenue on the\nconsolidated statements of financial position.\nOther Plant\nYear ended March 31, 2024 Consumer Medical Cannabis(1) Propagation Total\n$ $ $ $ $\nCanada 46,958 103,068 2,403 12,792 165,221\nAustralia — 31,679 — — 31,679\nEurope — 40,767 — — 40,767\nU.S. — — — 31,967 31,967\nOther — 647 — — 647\nTotal net revenue 46,958 176,161 2,403 44,759 270,281\nOther Plant\nNine months ended March 31, 2023 Consumer Medical Cannabis(1) Propagation Total\n$ $ $ $ $\nCanada 42,850 72,117 2,371 10,849 128,187\nAustralia — 9,831 — — 9,831\nEurope — 24,171 — — 24,171\nU.S. — — — 9,833 9,833\nOther — 1,666 — — 1,666\nTotal net revenue 42,850 107,785 2,371 20,682 173,688\n(1) Includes core and non-core wholesale bulk cannabis.\n59\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nYear ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nNote 27 Segmented Information\nAccounting Policy\nOperating segments are components of the Company that engage in business activities which generate revenues and incur expenses\n(including intercompany revenues and expenses related to transactions conducted with other components of the Company). The\noperations of an operating segment are distinct and the operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker\n(“CODM”) for the purposes of resource allocation decisions and assessing its performance. Reportable segments are Operating segments\nwhose revenues or profit/loss or total assets exceed ten percent or more of those of the combined entity.\nKey measures used by the CODM to assess performance and make resource allocation decisions include revenues, gross profit and net\n(loss) income. The Company’s operating results are divided into three reportable segments plus corporate. The three reportable segments\nare (i) Canadian Cannabis; (ii) EU Cannabis and (iii) Plant Propagation\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2023, the Company had three reportable operating segments: (i) Canadian Cannabis, (ii) EU Cannabis and (iii)\nPlant Propagation. During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company changed its internal management reporting which resulted in a change\nin the composition of the operating segments. With the closure of Nordic, most of the European market is fulfilled from Canadian sourced\ncannabis, which impacts how resources are allocated. Additionally, Canada, Europe and other export markets are being managed centrally.\nAccordingly, Management has identified two reportable operating segments, Cannabis and Plant Propagation. The comparative periods have\nbeen restated to conform with the change in segment composition, consolidating the former Canadian and EU Cannabis operating segments.\nPlant\nOperating Segments Cannabis Propagation Corporate (1) Total\n$ $ $\nYear ended March 31, 2024\nNet revenue 225,522 44,759 — 270,281\nGross profit (loss) before fair value adjustments 74,340 3,261 12 77,613\nGross profit 126,353 5,095 12 131,460\nSelling, general, and administrative expense 127,155 3,304 13,700 144,159\nLoss before taxes (30,401) (1,210) (27,988) (59,599)\nNine months ended March 31, 2023\nNet revenue 153,008 20,680 — 173,688\nGross profit (loss) before fair value adjustments 25,505 1,343 — 26,848\nGross profit 5,004 2,650 — 7,654\nSelling, general and administrative expense 103,973 1,783 14,344 120,100\nLoss before taxes (156,249) (2,918) (39,245) (198,412)\n(1) Net (loss) income under the Corporate allocation includes fair value gains and losses from investments in marketable securities, derivatives and investment in\nassociates.

The three levels of hierarchy are:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3 - Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.\nThe individual fair values attributed to the different components of a financing transaction, notably marketable securities, derivative financial\ninstruments, convertible debentures and loans, are determined using valuation techniques. The Company uses judgment to select the\nmethods used to make certain assumptions and derive estimates. Significant judgment is also used when attributing fair values to each\ncomponent of a transaction upon initial recognition, measuring fair values for certain instruments on a recurring basis and disclosing the fair\nvalues of financial instruments subsequently carried at amortized cost. These valuation estimates could be significantly different because of\nthe use of judgment and the inherent uncertainty in estimating the fair value of instruments that are not quoted or observable in an active\nmarket.\nFinancial instruments are measured either at fair value or at amortized cost. The table below lists the valuation methods used to determine\nfair value of each financial instrument.\nFair Value Method\nFinancial Instruments Measured at Fair Value\nMarketable securities Closing market price of common shares as of the measurement date (Level 1)\nDerivatives Closing market price (Level 1) or Black-Scholes, Binomial, Monte-Carlo &\nFINCAD valuation model (Level 2 or 3)\nContingent consideration payable Discounted cash flow model (Level 3)\nOther long term liability Discounted cash flow model (level 3)\nDerivative liability Closing market price of warrants (Level 1) or Kynex valuation model (Level 2)\nFinancial Instruments Measured at Amortized Cost\nCash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts Carrying amount (approximates fair value due to short-term nature)\nreceivable, loans receivable\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities, other current and Carrying amount (approximates fair value due to short-term nature)\nlong-term liabilities\nLease receivable, convertible debentures, loans and Carrying value discounted at the effective interest rate approximates fair value\nborrowings, and lease liabilities.\nThe following is a continuity schedule of contingent consideration payable:\nThrive Bevo Total\n$ $ $\nBalance, June 30, 2022 14,371 — 14,371\nAdditions 451 2,902 3,353\nUnrealized loss from changes in fair value (4,882) (355) (5,237)\nPayments — —\nBalance, March 31, 2023 9,940 2,547 12,487\nAdditions 275 — 275\nUnrealized gain from changes in fair value (10,215) — (10,215)\nRealized gain from changes in fair value — 459 459\nPayments — (3,006) (3,006)\nBalance, March 31, 2024 — — —\nThe Company’s contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value based on unobservable inputs and is considered a Level 3 financial\ninstrument.

The expected milestones were assigned probabilities and the expected related cash flows were discounted to\nderive the fair value of the contingent consideration. If the probabilities of achieving the milestones decreased by 10%, the estimated fair value of\nthe contingent consideration would decrease by nil (March 31, 2023 – $1.0 million). If the discount rates increased or decreased by 5%, the\nestimated fair value of contingent consideration would increase or decrease by nil (March 31, 2023 – $0.7 million).\nThe carrying values of the financial instruments at March 31, 2024 are summarized in the following table:\nAmortized cost FVTPL Total\n$ $ $\nFinancial Assets\nCash and cash equivalents 113,439 — 113,439\nRestricted cash 65,782 — 65,782\nAccounts receivable, excluding sales taxes and lease receivable 41,440 — 41,440\nMarketable securities — 4,036 4,036\nDerivative assets — 760 760\nLoans receivable — — —\nLease receivable 8,803 — 8,803\nFinancial Liabilities\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 58,563 — 58,563\nLease liabilities 47,532 — 47,532\nDerivative liabilities — 2,309 2,309\nLoans and borrowings 57,259 — 57,259\nThe following is a summary of financial instruments measured at fair value segregated based on the various levels of inputs:\nNotes Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n$ $ $ $\nAs at March 31, 2024\nMarketable securities 7 4,036 — — 4,036\nDerivative assets — 760 — 760\nOther long term liability 591 — 45,519 46,110\nDerivative liabilities 18(c), 19(e) 1,698 611 — 2,309\nAs at March 31, 2023\nDerivative assets — 7,114 135 7,249\nContingent consideration payable(1) — — 12,487 12,487\nOther long term liability 409 — 47,638 48,047\nDerivative liabilities 18(c), 19(e) 9,634 — — 9,634\n(1) The Company’s contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value based on unobservable inputs and is considered a Level 3 financial instrument. The\ndetermination of the fair value of these liabilities is primarily driven by the Company’s expectations of the respective subsidiaries achieving certain milestones. The\nexpected milestones were assigned probabilities and the expected related cash flows were discounted to derive the fair value of the contingent consideration.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, certain marketable securities were reclassified from Level 2 to Level 1 hierarchy (Note 6(b)).\nOther long term liability includes the put option arising from the acquisition of Bevo (Note 12). The put option is valued at using a Monte Carlo\nsimulation. The determination relies on forecasted information, of which the significant assumptions used within the model are revenue, cost of\nsales and operating expenses. As at March 31, 2024, the present value of the amount payable on exercise of the put option was $45.5 million\nwhich is recorded in other long term liability in the consolidated statements of financial position. The change of $0.2 million is recorded in deficit in\nthe consolidated statements of financial position.\n62\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nYear ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nNote 29 Financial Instruments Risk\nThe Company is exposed to a variety of financial instrument related risks. The Board mitigates these risks by assessing, monitoring and\napproving the Company’s risk management processes.\n(a) Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of a potential loss to the Company if a customer or third party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual\nobligations. The Company is moderately exposed to credit risk from its cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and loans receivable.\nThe risk exposure is limited to their carrying amounts reflected on the consolidated statements of financial position. The risk for cash and cash\nequivalents is mitigated by holding these instruments with highly rated Canadian financial institutions. Certain restricted funds in the amount of\n$38.8 million are retained by an insurer under the Segregated Accounts Companies Act governed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority. As the\nCompany does not invest in asset-backed deposits or investments, it does not expect any credit losses. The Company periodically assesses the\nquality of its investments and is satisfied with the credit rating of the financial institutions and the investment grade of its Guaranteed Investment\nCertificates (“GICs”). The Company mitigates the credit risk associated with the loans receivable by managing and monitoring the underlying\nbusiness relationship.\nThe Company provides credit to certain customers in the normal course of business and has established credit evaluation and monitoring\nprocesses to mitigate credit risk. Credit risk is generally limited for receivables from government bodies, which generally have low default risk.\nCredit risk for non-government customers is assessed on a case-by-case basis and a provision is recorded where required. As of March 31,\n2024, $22.8 million of accounts receivable, net of allowances, are from non-government wholesale customers (March 31, 2023 – $20.9 million).\nAs at March 31, 2024, two customers made up 10% or more of trade accounts receivable (March 31, 2023 – three customers).\nAs at March 31, 2024, the provision for estimated credit losses is $1.3 million (March 31, 2023 – $3.4 million). During the year ended March 31,\n2024, the Company wrote off $2.1 million (March 31, 2023 – $5.0 million), and recognized an additional provision for estimated credit losses of\nnil (nine months ended March 31, 2023 – nil) recorded in the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss.\nThe Company’s aging of trade receivables, net was as follows:\nMarch 31, 2024 March 31, 2023\n$ $\n0 – 60 days 33,239 28,355\n61+ days 7,303 6,661\n40,542 35,016\nThe Company’s undiscounted contractual cash flows from lease receivables is as follows:\nMarch 31, 2024\n$\nNext 12 months 2,897\nOver 1 year to 2 years 2,023\nOver 2 years to 3 years 1,919\nOver 3 years to 4 years 1,628\nOver 4 years to 5 years 1,046\nThereafter 504\nTotal undiscounted lease payments receivable 10,017\nUnearned finance income (1,214)\nTotal lease receivable 8,803\nCurrent Note 4 (2,460)\nLong-term 6,343\n63\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nYear ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\n(b) Liquidity risk\nThe composition of the Company’s accounts payable and accrued liabilities was as follows:\nMarch 31, 2024 March 31, 2023\n$ $\nTrade payables 20,325 21,942\nAccrued liabilities 20,097 33,608\nPayroll liabilities 15,496 12,610\nExcise tax payable 2,107 2,611\nIncome and sales tax payable 1,940 161\nOther payables 145 486\n60,110 71,418\nIn addition to the commitments outlined in Note 25, the Company has the following undiscounted contractual obligations as at March 31, 2024,\nwhich are expected to be payable in the following respective periods:\nOver 1 year - 3 Over 3 years - 5\nTotal ≤1 year years years > 5 years\n$ $ $ $ $\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 58,563 58,563 — — —\nLease liabilities (2) 93,656 7,678 21,180 13,698 51,100\nLoans and borrowings 57,259 52,361 4,898 — —\nCapital commitments(3) 3,217 3,217 — — —\n212,695 121,819 26,078 13,698 51,100\n(1) Assumes the principal balance of the debentures outstanding at March 31, 2024 remains unconverted and includes the estimated interest payable until the\nmaturity date.\n(2) Includes interest payable until maturity date.\n(3) Relates to remaining commitments that the Company has made to vendors for equipment purchases and capital projects pertaining to existing construction.\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations associated with its financial liabilities when they are due.\nThe Company manages liquidity risk through the management of its capital structure and resources to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to\nsettle obligations and liabilities when they are due. Our ability to fund our operating requirements depends on future operating performance and\ncash flows, which are subject to economic, financial, competitive, business and regulatory conditions, and other factors, some of which are\nbeyond our control. Our primary short-term liquidity needs are to fund our net operating losses, capital expenditures to maintain existing facilities,\nconvertible debenture repayment and lease payments. Our medium-term liquidity needs primarily relate lease payments and our long-term\nliquidity needs primarily relate to potential strategic plans.\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company has access to the following capital resources available to fund operations and obligations:\n• $113.4 million cash and cash equivalents; and\n• access to the 2023 Shelf Prospectus (as defined below). The Company currently has access to securities registered for sale under the\n2023 Shelf Prospectus currently covering U.S.$650.0 million of issuable securities. Of the U.S.$650.0 million of securities registered\nunder the 2023 Shelf Prospectus and corresponding registration statement on form F-10 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission in the U.S., approximately U.S.$225.3 million is allocated to the potential exercise of currently outstanding warrants issued\nin financing transactions from 2022. Following the closing of the bought deal offering on October 3, 2023 and the expiration of warrants\nduring the year approximately U.S.$396.4 million is available for potential new issuances of Common Shares, warrants, options,\nsubscription receipts, debt securities or any combination thereof during the 25-month period that the 2023 Shelf Prospectus remains\neffective. Volatility in the cannabis industry, stock market and the Company’s share price may impact the amount and our ability to raise\nfinancing under the 2023 Shelf Prospectus.\nBased on all of the aforementioned factors, the Company believes that its reduction of operating costs, current liquidity position, and access to\nthe 2023 Shelf Prospectus are adequate to fund operating activities and cash commitments for investing, financing and strategic activities for the\nforeseeable future. In addition, the Company could access restricted cash of $61.4 million relating to its self-insurance policy, if necessary.\n(c) Market risk\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in the market related factors, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Company’s\n(loss) income or the fair value of its financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk\nexposures within acceptable parameters.\n64\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nYear ended March 31, 2024 and nine months ended March 31, 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\n(i) Currency risk\nThe operating results and financial position of the Company are reported in Canadian dollars. As the Company operates internationally, certain of\nthe Company’s financial instruments and transactions are denominated in currencies other than the Canadian dollar. The results of the\nCompany’s operations are, therefore, subject to currency transaction and translation risks.\nThe Company’s main risk is associated with fluctuations in Euros, Australian dollars and U.S. dollars. The Company holds cash in Canadian\ndollars, U.S. dollars, Australian dollars and Euros; U.S.$0.4 million (March 31, 2023 – U.S.$7.1 million) of warrant derivative liabilities are\nexercisable in U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated based on the Company’s foreign currency translation policy.\nThe Company has determined that as at March 31, 2024, the effect of a 10% increase or decrease in Euros, Australian dollars, and U.S. dollars\nagainst the Canadian dollar on financial assets and liabilities would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $1.9 million (March 31,\n2023 – $15.2 million) to net loss and $6.7 million (March 31, 2023 – $11.4 million) to consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss for\nthe nine months ended March 31, 2023.\n(ii) Interest rate risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.\nCash and cash equivalents bear interest at market rates. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on the variable rate of interest on its term\ncredit facilities which is based on the prime rate plus a margin. Otherwise, the Company’s other financial liabilities as at March 31, 2024,\nconsisted of short term, non-interest bearing accounts and as a result are not impacted by changes in market interest rates.\n(iii) Price risk\nPrice risk is the risk of variability in fair value due to movements in equity or market prices. The Company’s warrant derivative liabilities,\nmarketable securities and investments are susceptible to price risk arising from uncertainties about their future outlook, future values and the\nimpact of market conditions. The fair value of warrant derivative liabilities, marketable securities and derivative investments held in publicly traded\nentities are based on quoted market prices which the warrants or investment shares can be exchanged for. The fair value of marketable\nsecurities and derivatives held in privately-held entities are based on various valuation techniques, as detailed in Note 28, and is dependent on\nthe type and terms of the security.\nIf the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities were to increase or decrease by 10% as of March 31, 2024, the Company would incur an\nassociated increase or decrease in loss and comprehensive loss of approximately nil (March 31, 2023 – $2.5 million). Refer to Note 7 of the\nfinancial statements for details on the fair value of marketable securities and derivatives investments and Note 18(c) for details on the warrant\nderivative liabilities.\nNote 30 Capital Management\nAs at March 31, 2024, the capital structure of the Company consists of $706.7 million (March 31, 2023 – $749.2 million) in shareholders’ equity\nand debt.\nThe Company’s objectives when managing capital are to ensure that there are adequate capital resources to safeguard the Company’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern and maintain adequate levels of funding to support ongoing operations and future growth such that the Company\ncan continue to deliver returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.\nFrom time to time, the Company may adjust its capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the\nCompany’s underlying assets. In addition, the Company plans to use existing funds, as well as funds from the future sale of products to fund\noperations and expansion activities.\nNote 31 Subsequent Event\nSubsequent to March 31, 2024, the Company made a formal decision to exit from its operations in Uruguay that is operated through its wholly-\nowned subsidiary ICC Labs Inc. (“ICC”). ICC has total net assets of $13.8 million as at March 31, 2024, primarily consisting of property, plant and\nequipment. During the year ended March 31, 2024, ICC incurred operating losses of approximately $2.0 million. The Company is still evaluating\nits options for disposal.\n65"

We are very pleased to report that 2024 was our strongest ever fiscal year. I will highlight some\nspecific metrics related to our performance momentarily, but more generally, we believe our accomplishments can\nbest be attributed to the following. First, our business model is centered on our Medical cannabis leadership\nwithin nationally legal markets. Aurora's front line positioning in the industry's highest margin segment is the direct\nresult of the competitive advantage we've built through our manufacturing network of indoor EU GMP-certified\nfacilities that serve the diverse needs of our patients across the world.\nSecond, our financial discipline, which has been demonstrated primarily by increasing our adjusted gross margin,\nalready among the highest in the industry, through sustainable cost reductions, consistently generating positive\nadjusted EBITDA and bolstering our balance sheet by maintaining a healthy cash balance and substantially\nreducing debt. All of these factors support our goal of achieving positive free cash flow by the end of this calendar\nyear.\nTurning now to some highlights for fiscal 2024. First, net revenue rose 21% on a trailing 12-month basis. Second,\nadjusted gross margin was 49%. Third, we had positive adjusted EBITDA in each of our four fiscal quarters,\nmarking the first time in Aurora's history that we've reported positive adjusted EBITDA on an annual basis. Fourth,\nwe ended the year with a very sound balance sheet characterized by about CAD 180 million in cash on hand with\nplenty of firepower as needed. With this momentum, we're in a strong position as we head into fiscal year 2025.\nNow let's look more deeply into Q4, beginning with our Global Medical Cannabis business, which increased 20%\ncompared to the year-ago quarter and delivered 68% of our total revenue and 90% of our adjusted gross profit. In\nCanada, we grew revenue by nearly 10% due to higher sales to insurance-covered patients and upheld our\nnumber one position in medical cannabis while growing our market share. We attribute our growth to a broad and\nattractive product assortment, positive sales mix, and most importantly, product innovation.\nThe Canadian medical market has experienced a lot of disruption over the past several years, which is all the\nmore reason why our focus on serving insured patient groups supported by continuous pipeline of exciting next-\ngeneration cultivars is critical to both holding and growing our market share. However, we are also encouraged to\nbe seeing increased interest from unions and other entities that are considering adding medical cannabis as a\nbenefit to their members along with more clinical trials being conducted by the traditional medical establishment.\nBoth of these developments could expand the addressable usage market rather meaningfully.\nRecall that only about 1% of the Canadian adult population are medical cannabis patients, so there's plenty of\nupside opportunity. Excellence in Canada has also enabled us to learn and become adept at navigating other\nnationally legal cannabis markets with great flexibility while making thoughtful investments based on opportunity\nsize and overall economics. Whereas in some international markets we are the manufacturer, wholesaler and\nsales organization, in others, we are the manufacturer and partner with world-class wholesalers and sales\norganizations.\nOur leadership positioning across several countries in Europe and in Australia stems directly from what we've\nlearned in over 10 years of medical cannabis experience in Canada and we are able to leverage our world-class\nmanufacturing in Canada to ship EU GMP products around the world. International medical cannabis grew nearly\n40% during Q4 as I will now explain.\nLet's first discuss Australia, where we experienced significant sales growth. Recall that in February, we acquired\nthe remaining 90% equity interest in MedReleaf Australia, which holds the number two position in the rapidly\n3\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 20-Jun-2024\ngrowing AUD 400 million market, the largest medical market in the world outside of North America. This\ntransaction positions us to deliver increases to our profitability in Australia through higher revenue contributions\nand higher gross margins. The Australian market is a clinician-led product distribution model that closely aligns\nwith our operational success. The high regulatory standards of the Therapeutic Goods Administration, which is\nresponsible for regulating the supply, manufacturing and advertising of therapeutic goods, makes it challenging\nfor new entrants while providing an advantage to companies like Aurora that are dedicated to quality and\ncompliance and are able to meet those requirements.\nIn March, we became one of the first Canadian-licensed producers to receive good manufacturing practice\ncertification from the TGA for our largest Canadian manufacturing facilities, River and Ridge, strengthening our\ndedication to supporting the continued growth and development of the Australian medical cannabis market. Being\none of the select few Canadian LPs with EU GMP and TGA GMP-certified facilities with close to 90% of our\nannual production coming from these facilities, Aurora is uniquely positioned to be able to pursue new growth\nopportunities in Australia as well as other key global markets. In addition to adding to our range of dried flower,\nthe license also granted us approval to broaden our product offerings to include pastilles or gummies, oils and our\nnewly launched resin cartridges.\nFollowing this landmark certification, we announced the expansion of MedReleaf Australia's portfolio with the\nintroduction of a new range of premium dried flower products and resin cartridges manufactured at our EU GMP\nand TGA GMP-certified facilities. The new dried flowers are proprietary cultivars grown exclusively by Aurora\nwhile another previously existing proprietary cultivar has been relaunched under the Aurora brand. The new resin\ncartridge products are offered by our Aurora and IndiMed brands and are full spectrum, ensuring a\ncomprehensive cannabinoid profile for a more effective and balanced experience. We're excited to be offering an\nexpanded range of innovative and differentiated products that cater to the market demand for a range of options\nwithout compromising on quality.\nMedReleaf Australia now focuses on three core brands; CraftPlant, offering a handcrafted premium range of\nproducts; Aurora, for innovative and affordable options; and IndiMed, providing a company funded concession\nrange, supporting access to individuals who may not be able to avail of this treatment through self-paid channels.\nMoving on now to New Zealand, we celebrated our first shipment of Aurora-branded premium dried flowers during\nthe first quarter of fiscal year 2025, representing a significant milestone in medical cannabis accessibility for the\ncountry. The initial product portfolio includes cultivars grown exclusively by us with each strain meticulously bred\nand cultivated to address a variety of patient needs. We view New Zealand as an emerging market poised for\ngrowth, where we can leverage symmetry with our leadership in Australia.\nLet's now delve into our European operations. In Germany, we believe that the official passing of the Cannabis\nAct and descheduling of cannabis has fueled the expansion of medical cannabis. The country is already our\nlargest European market, and we are currently one of only three companies with a domestic cultivation facility.\nWe hold the number two market share for flowers, the number one market share for self-payers and have 3 of the\ntop 10 cultivars by volume sales.\nWith cannabis descheduling, more patients gain access to treatment, reinforcing our dedication to patient\noutreach and comprehensive access to quality medical cannabis. The reclassification of cannabis as a\nnonnarcotic should also inspire more patients to actively consult with their physicians, facilitating greater access,\neducation and awareness to medical cannabis. All in all, this change presents long overdue reform in favor of a\nmore accessible medical cannabis market and commitment to patients.\n4\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 20-Jun-2024\nIn Poland, our second largest European market, we are the number two cultivar and number two market position\nby volume. We grew sales during Q4 compared to the year-ago period and remain excited by the opportunities\nthis growing market presents. In the UK, patients are responding favorably to the launches of our next-generation\ncultivars, which has led to a significant increase in sales in the final two quarters of this fiscal year. We also\npartnered with Script Assist, a cutting-edge prescription platform, that now includes our extensive range of\nmedical cannabis products from our portfolio. In doing so, we can further improve the landscape in the UK by\nproviding patients with access to premium, high-quality products along with valuable information to guide them\nthrough their medical cannabis journey.\nIn Switzerland, where we first launched in Q2, we are becoming the trusted favorite for patients and are currently\nwidening distribution channels in the country. In total, Medical cannabis adjusted gross margin reached 66%, the\nhighest level we've ever achieved as we benefited from sustainable cost reductions and improved efficiency in\nmanufacturing operations. This is an increase from comparable prior year quarter and substantially above our\n60% target.\nTurning back to Canada, our focus on portfolio optimization and strategic allocation of product to higher margin\nmedical markets resulted in an expected revenue decline in the Consumer cannabis business. This was coupled\nwith a decrease in adjusted gross margin because of a less favorable product mix.\nFinally, our investment in the controlled environment agricultural industry through Bevo resulted in strong revenue\nfor Q4, down only slightly from the year-ago quarter due to the seasonality of this business. Recall that\napproximately 65% to 75% of Plant Propagation revenue is earned in the first half of the calendar year as orders\nare fulfilled. The Bevo team is utilizing our former cannabis facilities to enter the profitable cultivated orchid market\nwhile our current vegetable and plant propagation business already generates a steady, predictable financial\nperformance, albeit on a seasonal cadence.\nOver the next several years, we think our shareholders will benefit from the value creation coming from this\nsegment as we expect the acceleration of Bevo's business plan to drive revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth.\nThese achievements were made possible through the efforts and dedication of our team who enable everything\nwe do.\nOn that note, let me now take this opportunity to introduce Simona King, our new CFO, who brings over 20 years\nof global finance experience at Fortune 500 pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Her wealth of knowledge in\nhighly regulated healthcare spaces is already proving to be an asset to Aurora as we pursue our purpose of\nopening the world to cannabis.\nAnd with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Simona for a detailed financial overview.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nSimona King\nChief Financial Officer, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nThank you, Miguel, and good morning, everyone. I'm very excited to be here as the newest member of Aurora's\nleadership team. Since joining in February, I have been focused on determining how I can best leverage my deep\nknowledge and experience in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries to contribute to the company's next\nphase of growth. I also look forward to sharing the company's progress with our analysts and investors over the\ncoming quarters.\n5\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 20-Jun-2024\nThanks to our outstanding people, 2024 was Aurora's strongest fiscal year ever. As we look towards the new\nfiscal year, we intend to build on our prior accomplishments by further strengthening our business through sound\nexecution of our medical cannabis strategy and delivering sustainable improvements to our financial performance.\nLet's now review our results for the fourth quarter, which ended on March 31, before providing some commentary\non our expectations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, which ends on June 30. In the fourth quarter of fiscal\nyear 2024, we delivered revenue growth of 5% over the prior-year period to CAD 67.4 million. This growth notably\nincluded a 20% increase in sales from our high-margin Global Medical Cannabis segment, resulting in net\nrevenue of CAD 45.6 million.\nOn profitability, consolidated adjusted gross margin was 49%, resulting in adjusted gross profit of CAD 33.3\nmillion compared to CAD 31 million in the year-ago period. Driven by our focus on leadership in global medical\nmarkets, Medical cannabis represented 68% of total net revenue for the fourth quarter and 90% of total adjusted\ngross profit. This marked an increase from 59% in the year-ago period for net revenue and 75% for adjusted\ngross profit. Adjusted EBITDA was CAD 1.9 million for the quarter, which marked our sixth consecutive quarter of\npositive adjusted EBITDA and a record of CAD 12.8 million for the fiscal year.\nLet's now go into our results by segment. Medical cannabis net revenue rose by 20% to CAD 45.6 million, which\nconsisted of nearly 10% growth in Canadian Medical cannabis and nearly 40% growth in international Medical\ncannabis. The increase in Canadian Medical was due to increased sales to insurance-covered patients and\nincreased basket sizes. The increase in international Medical cannabis was due to higher sales in Australia,\ndriven by significant overall growth in that market in addition to stronger sales from increased market share in\nPoland and the UK, as customers in those and other European markets have positively reacted to our Canadian-\ngrown high-quality cultivars.\nWe continue to see strong performance in Germany, given our leadership position in dried flower and look\nforward to continuing market growth as more patients gain access to medical cannabis following recent regulatory\nchanges that took effect on April 1. Note that following the acquisition of MedReleaf Australia in February, we\nhave yet to record a full quarter of revenue from MedReleaf Australia to their customers as we continue to sell\nthrough the existing inventory in the market. We expect to see the full benefit of this incremental revenue following\nthe first quarter of fiscal year 2025.\nAdjusted gross margin from Medical cannabis was 66%, up from 60% in the year-ago period and the highest\nmargin we have ever generated. This was the result of several factors, including sustainable cost reductions,\nhigher selling prices in Australia, which is positively impacting our international business and improved efficiency\nin our production operations with our shift to supplying the European markets from Canada as the impact of\nclosing our Aurora Nordic production facility is now flowing through our financials. While we expect to experience\nquarterly variability in our adjusted gross margins based on the seasonality and changes to geographic sales mix,\nwe project that a consistent margin of 60% or greater is likely to be achievable.\nConsumer cannabis net revenue was CAD 10.2 million, down from CAD 14.5 million a year ago. The decline was\nexpected result of our decision to prioritize the supply of our GMP-manufactured products to our high-margin\ninternational business rather than the consumer business, which offers lower margins. Adjusted gross margin for\nConsumer cannabis was 16% compared to 25% in the prior-year period due to sales of lower margin products\ncompared to last year.\nAnd Plant Propagation net revenue was CAD 10.4 million, down slightly from CAD 10.8 million in the year-ago\nperiod due to the timing of revenue and seasonality. You will recall that Bevo delivered higher revenue in the late\n6\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 20-Jun-2024\nwinter and spring month, which should result in about 65% to 75% of revenue and up to 80% of EBITDA in the\nfirst half of a calendar year, which equates to our fiscal fourth quarter and first quarter periods. Plant Propagation\nadjusted gross margin was 25%, down from 36% in the year-ago period due to timing of higher margin product\nrevenue.\nOur consolidated adjusted SG&A rose to CAD 31.6 million, up from CAD 27.4 million last year due to the\nincremental SG&A following the acquisition and full ownership of MedReleaf Australia.\nNow, moving to our balance sheet, which remains one of the strongest in the global cannabis industry, we held\napproximately CAD 100 million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31 after having fully repaid our\nremaining CAD 7.3 million of convertible senior notes with cash. This last repayment marked the conclusion of\nnearly CAD 540 million in debt repayments over the last 3 years, which has saved Aurora significant ongoing\ncash interest payments. Our cannabis operations are now completely debt free while our Bevo business holds\nCAD 57.3 million in debt.\nIn terms of our cash flow, we made significant progress during the fourth quarter towards our goal of positive free\ncash flow by end of calendar year 2024. Cash used in operating activities fell by CAD 0.7 million to CAD 21.1\nmillion, but excluding changes in noncash working capital and discontinued operations, cash used actually\nimproved by CAD 3.1 million to CAD 10.5 million from CAD 13.6 million during the year-ago period. This was due\nto both increased revenue and an improved contribution margin.\nFinally, as we are already nearing the end of our next fiscal quarter on June 30, we wanted to provide our outlook\nfor this three-month period. Consolidated net revenue for the first quarter fiscal year 2025 is positioned to deliver\nan increase in the mid- to high-teens from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. The cannabis segment should\nsee increases to net revenue driven by growth in high-margin international medical cannabis revenue. The recent\nregulatory reforms in Germany are expected to increase the size of the market combined with continued strength\nin our key European markets as well as incremental revenue from the acquisition of MedReleaf Australia.\nOur Plant Propagation segment typically experiences a seasonally higher quarter as it completes its peak spring\nfloral sales period. Consolidated adjusted gross margin for each individual segment are typically similar on\nquarter-over-quarter basis with the higher mix contribution from Plant Propagation expected in Q1 fiscal year\n2025. Positive adjusted EBITDA should be higher compared to the fourth quarter as a result of revenue growth\ncombined with comparable consolidated margins and operating cash flow is expected to improve compared to the\nfourth quarter.\nAnd finally, we see our target of positive free cash flow by end of calendar year 2024 as being achievable\nbecause of the following. First, we expect to see continued increases in global medical cannabis, building on the\ngrowth we are expecting in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, driven by the full recognition of revenue in\nAustralia as well as further growth in our key European markets. Second, operating expenditure and gross\nmargins are positioned to be in line with previously stated targets, leading to continued strong positive adjusted\nEBITDA. And finally, disciplined working capital management and maintenance capital expenditure of\napproximately CAD 2 million per quarter.\nTo conclude, our team's strategic focus, combined with our operational excellence have strengthened our\nfinancial condition over this past year. As we look ahead, we are pleased with our leadership positioning in the\nhigh-margin global medical cannabis segment, which we believe will enable us to generate dependable revenues\nand EBITDA growth over the long term while in the near term actualize our goal of positive free cash flow.\n7\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 20-Jun-2024\nThank you for your time. I'll now turn the call back to Miguel.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMiguel Martin\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nThanks, Simona. We've certainly proven ourselves to be strong and resilient despite the challenges we have\nfaced. At the same time, we've been successful in attracting fresh talent to our organization, including new\nleadership and board members with pharmaceutical and CPG experience. We've also made substantial progress\nin rightsizing this business over the past four years. This reset has made us leaner and more agile and has\nenabled us to focus squarely on the most attractive segment of our industry, medical cannabis.\nThe medical cannabis sector continues to grow rapidly and Aurora is well positioned to benefit from these positive\nchanges. We are excited to see patient access increase globally and are encouraged by the evolving regulatory\nenvironments in key international markets. For these reasons, we are confident in our future and our ability to\nachieve positive free cash flow by the end of this calendar year.\nAnd with that, operator, please open the lines for questions.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\nOur first question comes from the line of Matt Bottomley with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your\nquestion.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMatt Bottomley Q\nAnalyst, Canaccord Genuity Corp.\nYeah. Good morning, everyone. I guess for my question then, we can keep it maybe more general to any markets\nwhere this is specific, but I'm just curious on the international front what you can see that's actually trackable right\nnow and the visibility you have of potentially an increased cadence on revenues. I know there's typically some\nvariability there, but I'm most interested in Germany and some of the narrative around doctors maybe more willing\nor able to prescribe cannabis now and if there's anything that's been tangible that can be seen? So, it doesn't\nreally necessarily just have to be Germany, but any commentary on international markets and what you can see\nwith respect to traction being gained that might be tangible in your results in several quarters from now?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMiguel Martin A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nSure, Matt. Well, good morning, and thanks for the question. So, as you know and others know, syndicated data\ntypically that we see in other industries is not available. What we do see is that the regulatory agencies have\ncertain reporting mechanisms, and I'll go into the ones that we know. You start with the tonnage or the licenses\nthat – through the permitting process that come through and you can typically see that 90 days in arrears. Then in\nGermany, particularly, you can also see manufacturer shipments by the governments that go in. Now, none of the\nlicensed producers can be the pharmacist, so it's LP to wholesale, but there's not – there's no way to return it. So,\nthere's no – not just sort of net out returns like maybe you do in Canadian Consumer and we get that quarterly in\nGermany. It's a little more opaque in Poland, usually get something about every six months. And then, for\nAustralia, the TGA, the regulatory agency there, provides market shares of manufacturer shipments to wholesale,\n8\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 20-Jun-2024\nnot wholesale to pharmacy, on a quarterly basis. And it's a panel in Australia that only represents probably 20% to\n22% of the pharmacies and those shipments, so it's representative of that panel.\nNow, specifically for Germany, we've seen that the most sort of tangible or asset of the regulatory changes has\nbeen the ease in which patients can get prescriptions and through electronic means and even through vehicles\nthat don't even have to be in Germany, call it telemedicine. We've seen this rapid increase in the number of\npatients getting prescriptions.\nNow, the net effect on volume, I think we have to wait a little bit. I know that there's been a lot of conjecture about\nare you going to see that market double, triple or whatnot? I think it's early to get there. We're definitely going to\nsee an increase because of the access – increased access in prescriptions of patients. But it's going to probably\ntake a quarter for that data set to sort of catch up and see what the shipments are.\nBeyond that if you look at the other countries, there are not as sort of predictable or transparent shipments with\nthe possible exception of the UK, you see something in the UK quarterly similar to what you see in Germany. I\ndon't know, Matt, did that answer your question?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMatt Bottomley Q\nAnalyst, Canaccord Genuity Corp.\nNo, no. That's great. Appreciate that. I know it's something that from a lot of US operators, there's a lot of data\nthat you can subscribe to out there, so I'm just curious as international becomes more relevant now just to sort of\nkeep an eye on those things, I appreciate it. And I just wanted to ask one more quick one, more of a\nhousekeeping. I apologize if this was kind of in the prepared remarks already, but if you look at the difference\nfrom the profitability and I understand the comments on the cash flow, but from your adjusted EBITDA\ncontribution, everything on a sequential basis was largely flat except Bevo was slightly up. So can you just maybe\ngive me a little more color on what the drivers was for the slight sequential downtick in the adjusted EBITDA in\nabsolute dollars?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMiguel Martin A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nYeah. Simona, you want to grab that? I mean, I'm happy if you want to go ahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nSimona King A\nChief Financial Officer, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nYeah. Let me do that. So, yeah, Matt, to give a little bit more perspective and context on the adjusted EBITDA for\nQ4, a couple of factors have come into play and contributed to that and we view this as a temporary situation. So,\nas you may recall, the acquisition of MedReleaf Australia occurred in February, so we had a partial quarter this\nfourth quarter of Australia. So, as a result of that, we've seen a incremental SG&A following this acquisition as we\nnow fully own the company, and we also saw revenue – incremental revenue from customers. However, we have\nnot been able to fully recognize that incremental revenue to customers as we're working through our inventory\nthat's currently in the channel, and we actually expect to see that full benefit come through after Q1 fiscal year\n2025. And then, on top of that, due to the timing of gross profit from our Plant Propagation business, as you know\nthat.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMatt Bottomley Q\nAnalyst, Canaccord Genuity Corp.\nOkay. Got it. Appreciate all that, everyone.\n9\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 20-Jun-2024\nMiguel Martin A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nThank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Frederico Gomes with ATB Capital Markets. Please\nproceed with your question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nEric Livshits Q\nAnalyst, ATB Capital Markets, Inc.\nHi. Good morning. This is Eric Livshits in for Frederico Gomes, and thank you for taking my question. So, just on\nthe SG&A front, obviously, it ticked higher this quarter due to those integration costs related to MedReleaf. I'm just\nwondering if you could provide just some more insight into the nature of these costs and when you would expect\nSG&A to normalize? Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMiguel Martin A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nYeah. I mean I'll start and then Simona, you can pick it up. I think the guidance that we gave in the past did not\ninclude running MedReleaf Australia, which is quite a significant piece of business. So, you do have some\nintegration costs, but you are going to have ongoing SG&A costs running that substantial business. And so, we do\nexpect our SG&A to go up. I think from an integration standpoint, you'd see us work through integration costs, call\nit, probably by the end of the summer. But beyond that, we will have a bit of a higher SG&A line than we've had in\nthe past because we're now running that business over there and there's SG&A costs connected to it.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nSimona King A\nChief Financial Officer, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nSo, yeah, let maybe me add a little bit more, Miguel. So, I know in the past we talked about a adjusted SG&A\nbaseline around the CAD 30 million per quarter impact and that did not include incremental SG&A coming from\nany future acquisitions. So, as we've seen with MedReleaf Australia, we have taken on partial costs for Q4 and\nthat's reflected in our financials. And as we continue with the follow-on quarters, we do expect that to go up\nslightly and we continue to manage our SG&A and general expenses very, very carefully. So, this is really a\nreflection of taking on additional business, which we see, of course, as we will take on the full benefit of that\nrevenue to customers in the follow-on quarters post – after we work through our inventory, that will definitely have\nan impact to our EBITDA throughout the quarters.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nEric Livshits Q\nAnalyst, ATB Capital Markets, Inc.\nGreat. Thank you. I'll hop back in the queue.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMiguel Martin A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nThank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Zamparo with CIBC. Please proceed with\nyour question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n10\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 20-Jun-2024\nJohn Zamparo Q\nAnalyst, CIBC World Markets, Inc.\nThank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on Australia and just want to better understand your – the start to\nthat market with MedReleaf Australia. The contribution in the quarter from that deal, I think, was just under CAD 3\nmillion. That seems to imply around CAD 20 million annually. I understand that's a pretty small sample size, but\nit's also meaningfully below the 2023 results, so is there anything you can call out on that and do you still expect\nthat business to contribute what it did previously?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMiguel Martin A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nYeah, John. I mean, we do expect it to contribute meaningfully. I guess a couple of things. So, previously, when\nwe were the manufacturer, we sold to our customer, which was MedReleaf Australia. And they – there was\nrevenue recognition at that point. In the transition of the quarter, we recognize revenue when it's sold to the\npharmacy. So, it's a consignment model there with the wholesale partners, so there's a timing point in that quarter\nwhere you're not seeing full revenue recognition of that business. So, we expect the quarter that we're in that\nwe're seeing now where we have almost complete revenue recognition and the future quarters being significantly\nstronger, not only from a timing standpoint but also because that market is growing.\nSo, right now, MedReleaf Australia is the number two based on that sample size that I spoke about earlier, the\nnumber two manufacturer. We're launching products right now. We're one of the few in that market with a gummy,\nthey call it a pastille, and with a vape cartridge. So, we're very bullish on that market, but you've got a bit of a\ntiming point in the quarter we just reported because of the consignment and the revenue recognition, but also\nyou've got a growing market. Simona, anything you want to add about that?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nSimona King A\nChief Financial Officer, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nI think you covered it well, Miguel.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMiguel Martin A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nAll right.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic with Zuanic\nand Associates. Please proceed with your question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPablo Zuanic Q\nAnalyst, Zuanic & Associates LLC\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Miguel, let me just stay with Germany.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMiguel Martin A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nYeah.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPablo Zuanic Q\nAnalyst, Zuanic & Associates LLC\nI understand the color you gave in terms of the lack of data, but back in April at the Benzinga Conference, some\noperators there were talking about sales doubling for them, right, in terms of their shipments to pharmacies.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMiguel Martin A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nYeah.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPablo Zuanic Q\nAnalyst, Zuanic & Associates LLC\nSo, you are vertically integrated in Germany, you have local manufacturer, also import from Canada. You have\nyour own wholesale distribution, and then, of course, you also have your sales organization, right? So, you\nprobably have good visibility in terms of what you're sending to a pharmacy market. So, at least if you can\nquantify or give some color now that we're in the middle of June in terms of whether have you seen volumes\ndouble or triple or pretty flat? That's the first question.\nAnd the second part, which is really related to that, is talk about any issues from a demand or supply perspective.\nAnd what I mean by that, on the supply side, are there bottlenecks, right? We are hearing that pharmacies cannot\ncope with a large number of scripts. So, talk about any supply side bottlenecks. And on the demand side, help me\nreconcile the ratios that we look in the US versus Germany, right? In the US, Pennsylvania, Florida 3.5% to 4% of\nthe population is in the medical program. In Germany, the numbers are not exact, but we calculate 0.3%, right?\nSo, sometimes, we say, well, the market could grow 10 times. But the reality is that it's very different for a doctor,\neven in Germany, with a change in the narcotic law, to write an Rx prescription versus what we call in the US a\nrecommendation, right? So, from a demand perspective, just help us understand what's a real comparison? If we\ndo 0.3% Germany versus 3.5% in the US, is that the right comparison when we try to assess demand? Thank\nyou. I know there's a lot there. Thanks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMiguel Martin A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\n12\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 20-Jun-2024\nIt's okay. We don't see doubling. And we probably have one of the largest sales organizations. We have GR\nresources on the ground, we talk to the government, we see all the same syndicated data. So, a doubling of a\nbusiness the size of Germany right out of the gate within six months of descheduling, I think, is unrealistic. That\nbeing said, a market that size growing 20% to 30%, call it annually at a minimum, is significant. Because one of\nthe things that – you talked about the US, you talk about Canada, one of the things about medical cannabis is that\nbusiness is really broken up amongst probably at best 6 to 7 LPs, do 80%, 90% of the business. So, like, in\nCanada, in the [indiscernible] (00:39:22) business, you got to do – you've got to get to about 30, 40 companies to\nget to 60% of business, so it's a concentrated benefit. So, Pablo, the first point I would say is it's early to\nunderstand what's the impact of descheduling, but it's not double, but it could be 20% to 30% every 3 to 6\nmonths, we'll know more in a little bit.\nOn supply and demand, one of the most important things that is happening in Germany that is allowed is you're\nallowed to ship cannabis as you are other pharmaceutical products through the mail. And so, the historical\ndelivery of that product through a brick-and-mortar pharmacy as opposed to some of these very large pharmacies\nthat ship through the mail is allowing supply to get there and the government, through their work with the IMCD,\nhas plenty of access to cannabis.\nNow, one of the things that is a significant limiter not only in Germany but all around the world is the incredible\nprecision that that product has to have. So, what do I mean by that? First is it has to be EU GMP. That's a very\ndifficult standard from a manufacturing process and it limits the number of people that can produce product for\nGermany. Secondly, they test it, not your own testing, not the lab of your choice, has to be within 10% on the\nTHCs and on the CBDs. That's easier with a higher potency product, but with a balanced product, it's very\ndifficult. So, that makes it challenging; packaging, permitting, and in order to bring a new product into Germany,\ntakes anywhere between 8 months to 12 months. So, those are all limiters and that's why a company like Aurora\nthat has a history with this does well.\nNow, comparison to the US, I don't think you can make that comparison and you brought up one of the primary\npoints of distinction. In the US, as an example, you can go get your medical card and you can walk into a\ndispensary and buy as much as you want of whatever you want because there's no limit. In Germany, it is a\nrelationship, as it is with other medical products, between a prescribing physician who's prescribing a specific\nproduct at a specific dosage and then the patient is getting it fulfilled at a pharmacy. So, if Canada's 1% of the\nadult population is in the medical system and we expect that to grow, Germany at a 0.2% or 0.3% of the numbers\nthat you quoted, will continue to grow but it's not apples-to-apples in the US.\nThat being said, being in a traditional pharmaceutical model does allow for a steadier cadence and very\nimportantly allows for good margins because the flow of the economics start with the wholesale price, so you don't\nsee this massive compression in either the self-pay or the insured market that you see in other markets. And so,\nis it a little bit slower? Yes. Is it a bit more traditional? Yes, both, which we like, but also, like other pharmaceutical\nproducts, steadier from a margin standpoint.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPablo Zuanic Q\nAnalyst, Zuanic & Associates LLC\nThank you. That's great color. Can I just do a quick follow up? I mean, when you look at the rescheduling process\nin the US, how could Aurora benefit or participate in a market we see rescheduling or you don't really see it if it's\nnot legalized at the federal level? Thanks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMiguel Martin A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\n13\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 20-Jun-2024\nNo. I mean, we – so, Aurora is the largest [ph] Canadian (00:43:05) medical company by far. We have a 31%\nshare of that overall business. We've been at it 10 years. We interact with regulatory agencies all around the\nworld, and as we've mentioned, we have some of the largest EU GMP pharma-grade production facilities. We\nalso have one of the largest genetic facilities on Vancouver Island in cannabis in the world. So, we've long held\nthe position, and I think we've been proven right that the US will be medical first. We also believe that the FDA will\nregulate cannabis like they regulate almost everything between toothpaste and tobacco, and in that it will be a\nscience-based process.\nAurora being one of the largest in North America and one of the largest in the world, will clearly have significant\nadvantages in order to navigate that system. And just because we don't hold an entity today in the US has no\nbearing upon that. And everything that we do in Germany, Poland, Czech Republic and Australia with those very\nstrict and organized regulatory regimes will benefit us in the US with the FDA. So, we're very confident that when\nthe US legalizes, we'll be in a great position.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPablo Zuanic Q\nAnalyst, Zuanic & Associates LLC\nThank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMiguel Martin A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nYou're welcome.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Thank you.

Additional information can\nalso be found on the Company’s website at www.auroramj.com.\nBusiness Overview\nAurora was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) on December 21, 2006 as “Milk Capital Corp.” Effective\nOctober 2, 2014, the Company changed its name to “Aurora Cannabis Inc.”. The Company’s shares are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market\n(“Nasdaq”) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) under the trading symbol “ACB”, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (“FSE”) under the\ntrading symbol “21P”.\nThe Company’s head office and principal address is 2207 90B St. SW Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6X 1V8. The Company’s registered and\nrecords office address is Suite 1700, 666 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6C 2X8.\nThe Company’s principal strategic business lines are focused on the production, distribution and sale of cannabis and cannabis-derivative\nproducts in Canada and internationally, and the propagation of vegetables and ornamental plants in North America.\nThe Company’s primary cannabis market opportunities are:\n• Global medical cannabis market: Development, production, distribution and sale of pharmaceutical-grade cannabis products in\ncountries around the world where permitted by government legislation. Currently, there are approximately 50 countries that have\nimplemented regimes for some form of access to cannabis for medical purposes. The Company’s current principal medical markets\nare in Canada, Germany, United Kingdom, Poland, and Australia. Aurora has established a leading market position in most of these\ncountries; and\n• Global consumer use cannabis market: Currently, only two countries have implemented federally-regulated consumer use of\ncannabis regimes and the Company’s current consumer market is in Canada. Longer term, the Company believes that the\nincreasing success of medical cannabis regimes globally may lead to increased legalization of consumer markets.\nOn February 7, 2024, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company acquired the remaining interest of 90.43% in Indica Industries Pty Ltd.\n(“MedReleaf Australia”) an Australian domiciled company, for a purchase price of $44.7 million (AUS$51.0 million).\nOur Strategy\nAurora’s strategy is to leverage our diversified and scaled platform, our leadership in global cannabis medical markets, and our cultivation,\nscience and genetics expertise and capabilities to drive profitability and cash flow in our core Canadian and international operations in order to\nbuild sustainable, long-term shareholder value. We believe our key strength to delivering on our strategy is through our highly experienced\nleadership team and dedicated workforce.\nMedical leadership\nOur established leadership in the Canadian and international medical markets positions us well for new regulated medical market openings, as\nwell as the potential U.S. federal legalization of medical cannabis. At the core of Aurora’s near-term objective to deliver sustainable profitability\nand positive operating cash flow is our focus on maintaining and growing our industry leading Canadian and international medical cannabis\noperations.\nOur Canadian medical platform is characterized by leading market share, high barriers to entry through regulatory expertise, investment in\ntechnology and distribution, and an unwavering commitment to science, testing and compliance. Our Canadian medical operations allow for a\ndirect-to-patient sales channel that does not rely on provincial wholesalers or private retailers to get product to patients. This direct-to-patient\nmodel allows Aurora to achieve sustainable gross profit margins of better than 60% with substantially better pricing power relative to the\nCanadian adult-use segment.\n3 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. Q2 2025 MD&A\nOur leadership in the International medical cannabis segment provides us with what we expect to be a high growth, profitable business\nsegment that consistently delivers strong adjusted gross profit before fair value adjustments1. Our expertise in managing the complexity of\nmultiple jurisdictions’ regulatory frameworks and relationships, as well as providing export and in-country EU GMP (European Union Good\nManufacturing Practices) and other key certificated cannabis production, are capabilities that we believe will allow us to succeed as new\nmedical and recreational markets open.\nConsumer\nLeveraging our leading strength in science, cultivation and post-harvest processing, Aurora is working to build a sustainable and profitable\nCanadian consumer business. Advances in Aurora cultivar breeding yielding unique proprietary genetics coupled with operational\nadvancements in cultivation, and post-harvest techniques have repositioned the Aurora flower portfolio to one that has the characteristics that\nconsumers are looking for: high THC and terpene levels, and distinctive experiences. These advances have also driven significant\nimprovements in per unit production costs with higher yields and consistent delivery of specification resulting in all-in per unit costs for Aurora’s\nnew portfolio that are a 30% or better improvement from our legacy cultivars. We believe this economic advantage will allow us to compete\nand make a profit in the most attractive and highest growth categories in the Canadian consumer market. We have also refocused our\ninnovation pipeline for efficient delivery of targeted new products and line extensions. The pace of innovation required to compete in the\ncurrent Canadian consumer market is significant, with most new products delivering 80% of their lifetime value in the nine months following\nlaunch.\nCombined, Aurora’s ability to deliver products that deliver exceptional customer value in our targeted market segments, while at the same time\nachieving favorable contribution and gross margins, allows us to build towards a profitable and growing business and provides the know-how\nto leverage these lessons into future global consumer markets that are expected to open over the next few years.\nScience leadership: Genetics and Breeding\nWe believe that our scientific leadership and ongoing investment in cannabis breeding and genetics provides Aurora with a strong competitive\nadvantage in premium margin consumer and medical categories driven by what we believe to be our industry leading genetics and breeding\nprogram. Our breeding program, located at Aurora Coast, a state-of-the-art facility in Vancouver Island’s Comox Valley, is driving revenues by\ninjecting rotation and variety into our product pipeline and has delivered 22 new proprietary cultivars, grown at scale in our own internal\nnetwork, to our product pipeline since June 2021. These new cultivars have consistently delivered high potency flower with intensely aromatic\nprofiles – critical attributes to delight consumers and deliver the effects patients are seeking.\nMost recently, we have expanded the global reach of a number of our cultivars – launching Cosmic Cream, Black Jelly, Pink Diesel for patient\naccess in the United Kingdom. We have also launched three new products for our Canadian Medical channel: Esprit de Corps, Frosted Alpine\nand Noculus, each offering a unique set of aroma and potency traits sought by our patients.\nIn addition, these high quality and high potency cultivars continue to drive meaningful improvements in yield, improving output of our sites and\ncontinuing to drive down costs. In selecting Aurora’s “next-generation” cultivars, we are able to set substantially higher minimum thresholds for\nyield which continue to drive up our overall production using the same cultivation footprint, improving our cultivation efficiency over time in both\nindoor and outdoor applications. This pipeline is a key competitive advantage for Aurora, creating a sustainable means for driving productivity\nof high-quality products.\nLooking to the future, we continue to build what we believe is an industry-leading knowledge base with an intellectual property portfolio to\ncapture the value of this investment. Our team of scientists at Coast have now characterized a number of traits around cannabinoid profile,\naroma, disease resistance, and autoflowering, and created marker-assisted selection tools to rapidly screen our populations to drive further\nimprovements in our breeding program. We believe that this expertise continues to set Aurora apart from our competitors and raises the bar on\ncannabis breeding globally.\nGlobal and U.S. expansion\nWe believe that the global expansion of cannabis medical and recreational markets is just beginning. The Company believes its strengths in\nnavigating complex regulatory environments, compliance, testing, cultivar breeding, genetic science, and cultivating high quality cannabis are\nessential strengths that create a repeatable, credible and portable process to new market development. These drive our current leadership in\ninternational medical markets which should allow us to win as new medical markets emerge and potentially transition to recreational markets.\nFor instance, Aurora is active in all key European medical cannabis markets, including Germany, Poland, UK, France, Switzerland, Czech\nRepublic and Malta. The Company holds a top three position in the flower segment in each market and is overall the leading medical cannabis\ncompany in Europe. In Germany, Aurora is one of three active in-country producers of medical cannabis and has just received its production\nand R&D license under the new cannabis law. With this, the Company is in a strong position to serve all medical markets in Europe and for\nany upcoming pilot projects for recreational cannabis.\nWe also believe that the U.S. cannabis market will eventually be federally regulated, with states’ rights respected, in a framework similar to\nevery other comparable market. The timeframe for this is unknown, but Aurora is well positioned to create significant value for our\nshareholders once that federal permissibility allows. Our strategic strengths of medical and regulatory expertise in a federal framework, and\nour scientific expertise, including genetics and breeding, position us as a partner of choice, and to be successful in lucrative components of the\ncannabis value chain.\n1Adjusted gross profit before fair value is a Non-GAAP Measure and is defined in the “Cautionary Statement Regarding Certain Non-GAAP Performance\nMeasures” section of this MD&A.

Q2 2025 MD&A\nWith the acquisition of the remaining 90% equity interest of Indica Industries Pty Ltd. (“MedReleaf Australia”), the Company now sells directly\ninto Australia. MedReleaf Australia is a leading distributor of medical cannabis products in Australia and is expanding sales into New Zealand.\nPlant Propagation\nWith the acquisition of Bevo Agtech Inc. (“Bevo”) in August 2022, Aurora moved into the adjacent segment of plant propagation. Building on\nBevo’s established record of profitable and positive cash flow, Aurora is accelerating the growth of the plant propagation business segment\nthrough the repurposing of Aurora Sky and Aurora Sun, which will open additional geographic regions for the existing propagation business, as\nwell as allowing entry into the higher gross margin orchid business, one which is currently served in North America by lower-quality imports.\nFinancial leadership in a rapidly maturing industry\nAurora believes that profitable growth, positive cash flow, smart capital allocation and balance sheet health are critical success factors in such\na dynamic and rapidly developing global industry. Our medical businesses, with country diversification, growth, and strong gross margins\nprovide the foundation for profitability. Aurora has right sized selling, general & administration costs (“SG&A”), centralized and optimized\nproduction facilities, and leveraged the Company’s cultivar breeding success to shift the Company’s portfolio in the Canadian consumer\nbusiness to products with higher gross margins.\nAurora has one of the strongest balance sheets in the Canadian cannabis industry with approximately $151.6 million of cash and cash\nequivalents, inclusive of restricted cash, as at September 30, 2024 and access to a shelf prospectus filed on April 27, 2023 (the “2023 Shelf\nProspectus”) currently covering U.S.$650.0 million of issuable securities. Of the U.S.$650.0 million of securities registered under the 2023\nShelf Prospectus and corresponding registration statement on form F-10 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the U.S.,\napproximately U.S.$225.3 million is allocated to the potential exercise of currently outstanding warrants issued in financing transactions from\n2022. As result, following the closing of the bought deal financing on October 3, 2023, approximately U.S.$396.4 million is available for\npotential new issuances of Common Shares, warrants, options, subscription receipts, debt securities or any combination thereof during the 25-\nmonth period that the 2023 Shelf Prospectus remains effective. Volatility in the cannabis industry, the stock market and the Company’s share\nprice may impact our ability to raise, and the amount of any, financing under the 2023 Shelf Prospectus.\nCash used in operating activities from continuing operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $24.3 million compared\nto cash provided by of $8.9 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and cash used of $27.7 million during three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The Company continues to focus its operating cash use to deliver sustainable positive free cash flow2. During the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, free cash outflow was $26.4 million, which includes a working capital investment of $29.6 million.\nCondensed Statements of Loss\nThis MD&A reflects only the results of continuing operations, unless otherwise noted.\nThe condensed consolidated interim statements of loss and comprehensive loss and condensed consolidated interim statements of cash flows\nfor the previously reported Growery, Nordic, Reliva and ICC Labs Inc.

Refer to the “Cost of Sales and Gross Margin” section of this MD&A for a reconciliation to IFRS equivalent.\n(2) Certain previously reported amounts have been adjusted to exclude the results of discontinued operations.\nMedical Cannabis Net Revenue\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, total medical cannabis net revenue was $61.3 million compared to the three months\nended June 30, 2024 of $47.2 million, and $43.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of $14.1\nmillion and $17.8 million, respectively. The increase over the comparative periods is primarily attributable to international medical cannabis\nsales in Europe and Australia.\nCanadian medical cannabis net revenue remained relatively consistent during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the\nthree months ended June 30, 2024, and the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nInternational medical cannabis net revenue was $35.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $20.1 million\nfor the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $18.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of $15.0 million\nand $16.9 million, respectively, is largely due to (i) increased sales in Germany as a result of de-schedulization, (ii) increased permits in\nPoland, and (iii) increased sales in United Kingdom and Australia. Similarly, this is reflected in the increase of $21.1 million during the six\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023.\nDuring the six months ended September 30, 2024, total medical cannabis net revenue was $108.5 million, an increase of $23.7 million\ncompared to $84.8 million during the six months ended September 30, 2023, with most of the increase occurring during the three months\nended September 30, 2024 due to the increase in European and Australian sales noted above.\nCanadian medical cannabis net revenue increased by $2.6 million to $53.4 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared\nto the six months ended September 30, 2023. The slight increase is primarily due to higher sales to both insurance and non-insurance covered\npatients as a result of additional product offerings.\nConsumer Cannabis Net Revenue\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, consumer cannabis net revenue decreased to $10.4 million compared to $11.5 million for\nthe three months ended June 30, 2024 and $12.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease over both periods\nwas due to the Company’s focus on portfolio optimization and prioritization of sales to the higher margin medical businesses.\nDuring the six months ended September 30, 2024, consumer cannabis net revenue decreased to $22.0 million compared to $25.1 million\nduring the six months ended September 30, 2023. Consumer cannabis net revenue declined as the Company shifted its focus to portfolio\noptimization and allocation of cannabis flower to Aurora’s highest margin business segments.\n7 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. Q2 2025 MD&A\nPlant Propagation Revenue\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company’s plant propagation revenue was $8.6 million compared to the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 of $23.1 million and $7.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease over the prior\nquarter is due to the seasonality of the Bevo business, which delivers higher revenue in the late winter and spring months as orders are\nfulfilled. Historically, approximately 65-75% of plant propagation revenue has been earned in the first half of the calendar year. The increase\nover the three months ended September 30, 2023 is a result of organic growth and increased product offerings, both arising from increased\ncapacity.\nDuring the six months ended September 30, 2024 and six months ended September 30, 2023, plant propagation revenue was $31.7 million\nand $27.1 million, respectively. The increase is a result of organic growth and increased product offerings, namely orchids.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nThree months ended Six months ended\n($ thousands) Septembe 2r 0 3 20 4, June 30, 2024(2) Septemb 2e 0r 2 3 30 (2, ) Septembe 2r 0 3 20 4, Septemb 2e 0r 2 3 30 (2, )\nRevenue from sale of goods 88,544 91,936 70,048 180,480 151,103\nRevenue from provision of services 389 101 135 490 278\nExcise taxes (7,811) (8,602) (7,064) (16,413) (13,530)\nNet revenue (1) 81,122 83,435 63,119 164,557 137,851\nCost of sales (41,929) (53,310) (44,535) (95,239) (104,668)\nGross profit before FV adjustments (1) 39,193 30,125 18,584 69,318 33,183\nGross margin before FV adjustments (1) 48% 36% 29% 42% 24%\nChanges in fair value of inventory sold (36,027) (33,048) (18,636) (69,075) (36,088)\nUnrealized gain on changes in fair value of\nbiological assets 38,999 47,469 34,453 86,468 63,326\nGross profit 42,165 44,546 34,401 86,711 60,421\nGross margin 52% 53% 55% 53% 44%\n(1) These terms are Non-GAAP Measures and neither is a recognized, defined or standardized measure under IFRS.

The improvement quarter over quarter is due to purposeful\nevolution of the channel mix through increasing participation of the medical market channel which has higher adjusted gross margin before fair\nvalue adjustments than the consumer channel and to efficiencies in production cost. The increase compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 is largely driven by inventory management improvement with lower net inventory impairments, provisions, and destruction\ncharges on cannabis inventory as the Company’s supply is fully allocated to sales channels with minimal excess production.\nGross margin before fair value adjustments was 42% for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 24% for the six months\nended September 30, 2023.

The Company currently has access to securities registered for sale under\nthe 2023 Shelf Prospectus currently covering U.S.$650.0 million of issuable securities. Of the U.S.$650.0 million of securities\nregistered under the 2023 Shelf Prospectus and corresponding registration statement on form F-10 filed with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission in the U.S., approximately U.S.$225.3 million is allocated to the potential exercise of currently outstanding\nwarrants issued in financing transactions from 2022. Following the closing of the bought deal financing on October 3, 2023 and the\nexpiration of warrants during the year ended March 31, 2024, approximately U.S.$396.4 million is available for potential new\nissuances of Common Shares, warrants, options, subscription receipts, debt securities or any combination thereof during the 25-\nmonth period that the 2023 Shelf Prospectus remains effective. Volatility in the cannabis industry, stock market and the Company’s\nshare price may impact the amount and our ability to raise financing under the 2023 Shelf Prospectus.\nBased on all of the aforementioned factors, the Company believes that its reduction of operating costs, current liquidity position, and access to\nthe 2023 Shelf Prospectus are adequate to fund operating activities and cash commitments for investing, financing and strategic activities for\nthe foreseeable future. In addition, the Company could access restricted cash of $62.3 million relating to its self-insurance policy, if necessary.\nCash Flow Highlights\nThe table below summarizes the Company’s cash flows, including discontinued operations:\nThree months ended Six months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n($ thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities (24,891) (30,882) (16,516) (42,119)\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities (3,638) (3,979) (2,824) (6,137)\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities 3,962 3,735 (3,242) (58,208)\nEffect of foreign exchange (5,999) 2,188 (5,936) 439\nIncrease (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (30,566) (28,938) (28,518) (106,025)\nCash used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $24.9 million compared to $30.9 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.

The convertible debentures were fully extinguished in Q4 2024.\n15 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. Q2 2025 MD&A\nFree Cash Flow\nThe table below outlines free cash flow for the periods ended:\nThree months ended Six months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\nJune 30, 2024\n($ thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCash provided by (used in) operating\nactivities from continuing operations before\nchanges in non-cash working capital 5,295 (1,822) (12,883) 3,473 (25,888)\nChanges in non-cash working capital (29,588) 10,682 (14,781) (18,906) (10,967)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating\nactivities from continuing operations (24,293) 8,860 (27,664) (15,433) (36,855)\nLess: maintenance capital expenditures(1) (2,140) (2,370) (1,815) (4,510) (4,310)\nFree cash flow(2) (26,433) 6,490 (29,479) (19,943) (41,165)\n(1) Maintenance capital expenditures are comprised of costs to sustain facilities, machinery and equipment in working order to support operations and\nexcludes discretionary investments for revenue growth.\n(2) Free cash flow is a Non-GAAP Measure and is not a recognized, defined, or a standardized measure under IFRS. Refer to the “Cautionary Statement\nRegarding Certain Non-GAAP Performance Measures” section of this MD&A.\nFree cash outflow was $26.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an inflow of $6.5 million for the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 and an outflow of $29.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Compared to the three months\nended June 30, 2024, the decrease of $32.9 million is primarily due to a $29.6 million investment in working capital in the current quarter\ncompared to a $10.7 million recovery of working capital in the prior quarter. The investment in working capital during the current quarter\nincludes annual payments for insurance premiums and employee bonuses. Compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, the\ndecrease in the free cash outflow of $3.0 million primarily relates to higher net revenue and contribution margin, partially offset by an increase\nin the investment of working capital of $14.8 million.\nFree cash outflow was $19.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an outflow of $41.2 million for the six months\nended September 30, 2023. The improvement of $21.2 million relates primarily to higher net revenue and improved contribution margin over\nthe current period, slightly offset with a higher investment in working capital of $7.9 million.\nContractual Obligations\nAs at September 30, 2024, the Company had the following undiscounted contractual obligations:\nOver 1 year to Over 3 years to\n($ thousands) Total ≤ 1 year 3 years 5 years > 5 years\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 39,032 39,032 — — —\nLease liabilities (1) 89,394 8,282 22,014 10,804 48,294\nLoans and borrowings, principal repayment 57,563 53,737 3,826 — —\nCapital commitments (2) 2,858 2,858 — — —\nTotal contractual obligations 188,847 103,909 25,840 10,804 48,294\n(1) Includes interest payable until maturity date.\n(2) Relates to remaining commitments that the Company has made to vendors for equipment purchases and capital projects pertaining to existing construction.\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company and/or its subsidiaries may become defendants in legal actions and the Company intends to take appropriate\naction with respect to any such legal actions, including by defending itself against such legal claims as necessary. Other than the claims\ndescribed below, as of the date of this report, Aurora is not aware of any other material or significant claims against the Company.\nOn November 21, 2019, a purported class action proceeding was commenced in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey\nagainst the Company and certain of its current and former directors and officers on behalf of persons or entities who purchased, or otherwise\nacquired, publicly traded Aurora securities between October 23, 2018 and February 6, 2020. The parties have filed for preliminary approval of\na settlement, which will be covered by insurance.\nOn June 16, 2020, the Company and its subsidiary, ACE, were named in a purported class action proceeding in the Province of Alberta in\nrelation to the alleged mislabeling of cannabis products with inaccurate THC/CBD content. The class action involved a number of other parties\nincluding Aleafia Health Inc., Hexo Corp, Tilray Canada Ltd., among others. The plaintiffs have filed a Discontinuance of Claim for this matter,\nas such, this claim is no longer active.\nOn June 15, 2020, a claim was filed with the King's Bench of Alberta by a party to a former term sheet with the King's Bench of Alberta against\nAurora and a former officer alleging a claim of breach of obligations under said term sheet, with the plaintiff seeking $18.0 million in damages.\nWhile this matter is ongoing, the Company believes the action to be without merit and intends to defend the claim.\nOn August 10, 2020, a purported class action lawsuit was filed with the King's Bench of Alberta against Aurora and certain executive officers in\nthe Province of Alberta on behalf of persons or entities who purchased, or otherwise acquired, publicly traded Aurora securities and suffered\nlosses as a result of Aurora releasing statements containing misrepresentations during the period of September 11, 2019 and December 21,\n16 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. Q2 2025 MD&A\n2019. Plaintiff and Defendant have each prepared factums for a leave application. Prior to the hearing, Defendants filed a request for\nadjournment and leave to amend their pleadings. The amended Statement of Claim was filed on March 8, 2024. The Company has filed a\nmotion to strike the amendment. The Company’s motion to strike will be heard the week of November 18, 2024. The Company disputes the\nallegations and intends to vigorously defend against the claims. Estimating an amount or range of possible losses resulting from litigation\nproceedings is inherently difficult, particularly where the matters involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages and are in the stages of\nthe proceedings where key factual and legal issues have not been resolved. For these reasons, the Company is currently unable to predict the\nultimate timing or outcome of or reasonably estimate the possible losses or a range of possible losses resulting from the matter described\nabove.\nOn January 4, 2021, a civil claim was filed with the King’s Bench of Alberta against Aurora and Hempco by a former landlord regarding unpaid\nrent in the amount of $8.9 million, representing approximately $0.4 million for rent in arrears and costs, plus $8.5 million for loss of rent and\nremainder of the term. The Company filed a statement of defence on March 24, 2021. Plaintiffs brought an Application seeking summary\njudgment as against the Company and the Company has filed Affidavit evidence in response. Cross-examinations for the Company’s affiants\nand for Plaintiff’s affiant have been completed. While this matter is ongoing, the Company intends to continue to defend against the claims.\nOn November 15, 2022, the Company, its subsidiary ACE, and MedReleaf Corp. (which amalgamated with ACE in July 2020) were named in a\npurported class action proceeding in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. The purported class action claims that the Company failed to warn\nof certain risks purported to be associated with the consumption of cannabis. While this matter is ongoing, the Company intends to continue to\ndefend against the claims.\nThe Company is subject to litigation and similar claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims related to employment, human\nresources, product liability and commercial disputes. The Company has received notice of, or are aware of, certain possible claims against us\nwhere the magnitude of such claims is negligible, or it is not currently possible for us to predict the outcome of such claims, possible claims or\nlawsuits due to various factors including: the preliminary nature of some claims; an incomplete factual record; and the unpredictable nature of\nopposing parties and their demands. Management is of the opinion, based upon legal assessments and information presently available, that it\nis unlikely that any of these claims would result in liability to the Company, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, would\nhave a material effect on the consolidated financial statements, other than the claims described above.\nIn respect of the aforementioned claims, as at September 30, 2024 the Company has recognized total provisions of nil (March 31, 2024 – $2.3\nmillion) in provisions on the condensed consolidated interim statements of financial position.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nAs at the date of this MD&A, the Company has $0.9 million letters of credit outstanding with the Bank of Montreal. There are no other material\noff-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the financial performance or financial\ncondition of the Company.\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe Company’s key management personnel consists of the Company’s executive management team and management directors who,\ncollectively, have the authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Company. Compensation expense\nfor key management personnel was as follows:\nThree months ended Six months ended\n($ thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nShort-term employment benefits (1) 1,839 3,855 3,631 5,627\nLong-term employment benefits 12 11 22 21\nDirectors’ fees (2) 97 84 185 187\nShare-based compensation 3,334 3,452 5,393 5,752\nTotal management compensation(3) 5,282 7,402 9,231 11,587\n(1) As at September 30, 2024, $1.4 million is payable or accrued for key management compensation (March 31, 2024 - $1.8 million).\n(2) Share-based compensation represent the fair value of options granted and vested to key management personnel and directors of the Company under the\nCompany’s share-based compensation plans. Director DSUs are included in share-based compensation.\n(3) As at September 30, 2024, there are 10 key management personnel (September 30, 2023 - 10).\nThe Company entered into an unsecured Pari Passu Creditor Agreement with Bevo, in which participating shareholders of Bevo provided the\nfunds pursuant to the Creditor Agreement. The Creditor Agreement was for a total loan of $5.0 million and bears interest at a rate of 14.0% per\nannum. The principal and accrued interest are due on May 31, 2025. The Company advanced funds of $2.5 million, which is eliminated upon\nconsolidation.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of the Financial Statements under IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions about the\ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are\nbased on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n17 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. Q2 2025 MD&A\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period\nin which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the revision affects\nboth current and future periods.\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s critical accounting estimates during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024. For\nadditional information on the Company’s accounting policies and key estimates, refer to the note disclosures in the annual consolidated\nfinancial statements and MD&A as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nAmendments to IAS 1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\nThe amendment clarifies the requirements relating to determining if a liability should be presented as current or non-current in the statement of\nfinancial position. Under the new requirement, the assessment of whether a liability is presented as current or non-current is based on the\ncontractual arrangements in place as at the reporting date and does not impact the amount or timing of recognition. The amendment applies\nretrospectively for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. The Company has applied the amendments effective April\n1, 2024, retrospectively and it did not impact the classification of current on non-current liabilities.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nThe following IFRS standards have been recently issued by the IASB. Pronouncements that are irrelevant or not expected to have a significant\nimpact have been excluded.\nIFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosures in Financial Statements\nIFRS 18, Presentation and Disclosures in Financial Statements, replaces IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements for reporting periods\nbeginning on or after January 1, 2027, including for interim financial statements with retrospective application. IFRS 18, introduces a specified\nstructure for the income statement by requiring income and expenses to be presented into the three defined categories of operating, investing\nand financing, and by specifying certain defined totals and subtotals.\nWhere company-specific measures related to the income statement are provided, IFRS 18 requires companies to disclose explanations\naround these measures, which are referred to as management defined performance measures. IFRS 18 also provides additional guidance on\nprinciples of aggregation and disaggregation which apply to the primary financial statements and the notes. IFRS 18 will not affect the\nrecognition and measurement of items in the financial statements, nor will it affect which items are classified in other comprehensive income\nand how these items are classified. The Company is currently assessing the effect of this new standard on its financial statements.\nFinancial Instruments Risk\nThe Company is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks. The Company’s board of directors mitigates\nthese risks by assessing, monitoring and approving the Company’s risk management processes.\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of a potential loss to the Company if a customer or third party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual\nobligations. The Company is moderately exposed to credit risk from its cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and loans receivable.\nThe risk exposure is limited to their carrying amounts reflected on the condensed consolidated interim statements of financial position. The risk\nfor cash and cash equivalents is mitigated by holding these instruments with highly rated Canadian financial institutions. Certain restricted\nfunds in the amount of $39.7 million are retained by an insurer under the Segregated Accounts Companies Act governed by the Bermuda\nMonetary Authority. As the Company does not invest in asset-backed deposits or investments, it does not expect any credit losses. The\nCompany periodically assesses the quality of its investments and is satisfied with the credit rating of the financial institutions and the\ninvestment grade of its Guaranteed Investment Certificates (“GICs”). The Company mitigates the credit risk associated with the loans\nreceivable by managing and monitoring the underlying business relationship.\nThe Company provides credit to certain customers in the normal course of business and has established credit evaluation and monitoring\nprocesses to mitigate credit risk. Credit risk is generally limited for receivables from government bodies, which generally have low default risk.\nCredit risk for non-government customers is assessed on a case-by-case basis and a provision is recorded where required. As of September\n30, 2024, $25.0 million of accounts receivable, net of allowances, are from non-government wholesale customers (March 31, 2024 – $22.8\nmillion).\nAs at September 30, 2024, three customers made up 10% or more of trade accounts receivable (March 31, 2024 – two customers).\nAs at September 30, 2024, the provision for estimated credit losses is $1.3 million (March 31, 2024 – $1.3 million). During the three and six\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, the Company wrote off nil and nil, respectively (three and six months ended September 30, 2023 – $0.5\nmillion and $3.2 million, respectively) and recognized an expense for the three and six months ended of $0.2 million and nil, respectively (three\nand six months ended September 30, 2023 – expense of $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively) recorded in the condensed consolidated\ninterim statements of loss and comprehensive loss. The write off of nil during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, relate to\nother receivables, which are assessed on a case-by-case basis and provided for as required.\n18 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. Q2 2025 MD&A\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations associated with its financial liabilities when they are\ndue. The Company’s objective is to manage liquidity risk through the management of its capital structure and resources to ensure that it has\nsufficient liquidity to settle obligations and liabilities when they are due, while executing on its operating and strategic plans. Refer to “Liquidity\nand Capital Resources” section of this MD&A for detailed discussion.\nSummary of Outstanding Share Data\nThe Company had the following securities issued and outstanding as at November 5, 2024:\nSecurities (1) Units Outstanding\nIssued and outstanding Common Shares 54,877,160\nStock options 1,853,897\nWarrants 7,066,027\nRestricted share units 833,098\nDeferred share units 358,201\nPerformance share units 1,253,778\n(1) Refer to Note 10 “Share Capital” in the Financial Statements for a detailed description of these securities.\nHistorical Quarterly Results\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n($ thousands, except earnings per share and operational results) 2024 June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 2023(7)\nFinancial Results\nNet revenue (2) 81,122 83,435 67,411 64,375\nAdjusted gross margin before FV adjustments on total net revenue (3) 54% 43% 50% 53%\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common\nshareholders (4) 2,599 6,216 (20,624) (15,994)\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to common\nshareholders (14,640) 304 (501) (1,042)\nIncome (loss) attributable to common shareholders (12,041) 6,520 (21,125) (17,036)\nBasic and diluted income (loss) per share from continuing operations (8) 0.05 0.12 (0.40) (0.34)\nBasic income (loss) per share (0.22) 0.13 (0.41) (0.36)\nBalance Sheet\nWorking capital 308,580 322,563 301,985 308,743\nCannabis inventory and biological assets (5) 177,999 173,197 148,112 112,645\nTotal assets 808,774 838,689 838,673 824,272\nSeptember 30, March 31, December 31,\n2023 June 30, 2023 2023(1) 2022(1)\nFinancial Results\nNet revenue (2) 63,119 74,732 63,951 61,023\nAdjusted gross margin before FV adjustments on total net revenue (3) 51% 44% 49% 46%\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common\nshareholders (4) 2,043 (18,764) (68,965) (59,419)\nLoss from discontinued operations attributable to common shareholders (2,566) (8,134) (12,649) (5,568)\nLoss attributable to common shareholders (523) (26,898) (81,614) (64,987)\nBasic and diluted income (loss) per share from continuing operations (8) 0.05 (0.53) (2.02) (1.82)\nBasic loss per share (0.01) (0.76) (2.39) (1.99)\nBalance Sheet\nWorking capital(6) 200,837 192,201 242,190 413,909\nCannabis inventory and biological assets (5) 114,781 100,846 93,081 93,675\nTotal assets 818,371 832,188 926,322 1,023,835\n(1) Certain previously reported amounts have been adjusted to exclude the results related to discontinued operations and adjusted for the accounts payable\nand accrued liabilities non-material prior period adjustment.\n(2) Net revenue represents our total gross revenue net of excise taxes levied by the CRA on the sale of medical and consumer use cannabis products.

There\nare many factors that affect our business and our results of operations, some of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of\nimportant factors that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or\ndiscussed in the forward-looking statements (“FLS”) set forth in this report relating to our financial results, operations and business prospects.\nExcept as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any such FLS to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this MD&A.\nThese risks include, but are not limited to the following:\n• We have a limited operating history and a history of losses in

our\ncurrent and future competitors may have longer operating histories, more financial resources, and lower costs than us.\n• Selling prices and the cost of cannabis production may vary based on a number of factors outside of our control.\n• We may not be able to realize our growth targets or successfully manage our growth.\n• The continuance of our contractual relations with provincial and territorial governments cannot be guaranteed.\n• Our continued growth may require additional financing, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\n• Any default under our existing debt that is not waived by the applicable lenders could materially adversely impact our results of\noperations and financial results and may have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our Common Shares.\n• We may be subject to credit risk.\n• We may not be able to successfully develop new products or find a market for their sale.\n• As the cannabis market continues to mature, our products may become obsolete, less competitive, or less marketable.\n• Restrictions on branding and advertising may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain customers.\n• The cannabis business may be subject to unfavorable publicity or consumer perception.\n• Third parties with whom we do business may perceive themselves as being exposed to reputational risk by virtue of their\nrelationship with us and may ultimately elect to discontinue their relationships with us.\n• There may be unknown health impacts associated with the use of cannabis and cannabis derivative products.\n• We may enter into strategic alliances or expand the scope of currently existing relationships with third parties that we believe\n• complement our business, financial condition and

subject to security risks and disruptions.\n• Our business is subject to the risks inherent in agricultural operations.\n• We have in the past, and may in the future, record significant impairments or write-downs of our assets.\n• Our operations are subject to various environmental and employee health and safety regulations.\n• Climate change may have an adverse effect on demand for our products or on our operations.\n• We may not be able to protect our intellectual property.\n• We may experience breaches of security at our facilities or in respect of electronic documents and data storage and may face risks\nrelated to breaches of applicable privacy laws.\n• We may be subject to risks related to our information technology systems, including cyber-attacks.\n20 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. Q2 2025 MD&A\n• We may not be able to successfully identify and execute future acquisitions or dispositions, or to successfully manage the impacts of\nsuch transactions on our operations.\n• As a holding company, Aurora Cannabis Inc. is dependent on its operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other obligations.\n• The price of our Common Shares has historically been volatile. This volatility may affect the value of your investment in Aurora, the\nprice at which you could sell our Common Shares and the sale of substantial amounts of our Common Shares could adversely affect\nthe price of our Common Shares and the value of your convertible debentures/notes.\n• It is not anticipated that any dividend will be paid to holders of our Common Shares for the foreseeable future.\n• Future sales or issuances of equity securities could decrease the value of our Common Shares, dilute investors’ voting power, and\nreduce our earnings per share.\n• Our management will have substantial discretion concerning the use of proceeds from future share sales and financing transactions.\n• The regulated nature of our business may impede or discourage a takeover, which could reduce the market price of our Common\nShares and the value of any outstanding convertible debentures/notes.\n• There is no assurance we will meet or continue to meet, as applicable, the listing standards of Nasdaq and the TSX.\n• The financial reporting obligations of being a public company and maintaining a dual listing on the TSX and on Nasdaq requires\nsignificant company resources and management attention.\n• Failure to develop and maintain an effective system of internal controls increases the risk that we may not be able to accurately and\nreliably report our financial results or prevent fraud, which may harm our business, the trading price of our Common Shares and\nmarket value of other securities.\n• We are a Canadian company and shareholder protections may differ from shareholder protections in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n• We are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the U.S. Exchange Act, and as such is exempt from certain\nprovisions applicable to United States domestic issuers.\n• Our employees and counterparties may be subject to potential U.S. entry restrictions as a result of their relationship with us.\n• Participants in the cannabis industry may have difficulty accessing the service of banks and financial institutions, which may make it\ndifficult for us to operate.\n• The Company’s employees, independent contractors and consultants may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activities.\n• The controversy surrounding vaporizers and vaporizer products may materially and adversely affect the market for vaporizer\nproducts and expose us to litigation and additional regulation.\n• We must rely largely on our own market research and internal data to forecast sales and market demand and market prices which\nmay differ from our forecasts.\n• The Canadian excise duty framework affects profitability.\n• We may hedge or enter into forward sales, which involves inherent risks.\n• Our costs, including for input materials, energy and transportation, could be negatively impacted by international conflicts\n• The Company may be a passive foreign investment company, which may result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences\nfor U.S. holders of Common Shares.\nPFIC Risk\nGenerally, if for any taxable year 75% or more of the Company’s gross income is passive income, or at least 50% of the average quarterly\nvalue of the Company’s assets are held for the production of, or produce, passive income, the Company would be characterized as a passive\nforeign investment company (“PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Based on the current profile of the Company’s gross income, gross\nassets, the nature of its business, and its anticipated market capitalization, the Company believes that it may have been a PFIC for the 2023\ntaxable year. While it has not made a determination of expected PFIC status for the current taxable year, there is a risk that it may be a PFIC in\nthe current taxable year and in the foreseeable future. Because PFIC status is determined on an annual basis and generally cannot be\ndetermined until the end of the taxable year, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be a PFIC for the current or future taxable\nyears. If the Company is characterized as a PFIC, the Company’s shareholders who are U.S. holders may suffer adverse tax consequences,\nincluding the treatment of gains realized on the sale of the Common Shares as ordinary income, rather than as capital gain. A U.S. holder may\nbe able to make a \"qualified electing fund\" election (a “QEF Election”) or, alternatively, a \"mark-to-market\" election that could mitigate the\nadverse U.S. federal income tax consequences that would otherwise apply to such U.S. holder. Upon request of a U.S. holder, the Company\nintends to provide the information necessary for a U.S. Holder to make applicable QEF Elections\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (“DC&P”) designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to\nbe disclosed in the Company’s annual filings, interim filings and other reports filed or submitted by it under securities laws is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported accurately and in the time periods specified under such securities laws, and include controls and\nprocedures designed to ensure such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its certifying\nofficers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As at September 30, 2024, the CEO and CFO have concluded\nthat the Company’s DC&P were not effective as at that date as a result of the material weaknesses identified as at March 31, 2024.\nChanges to Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn compliance with reporting obligations, management is in the process of assessing the effectiveness of ICFR pertaining to the Indica\nIndustries Pty Ltd. (MedReleaf Australia) business unit acquired on February 7, 2024, to be concluded upon as part of the ICFR assessment\nfor the fiscal period ending March 31, 2025. Management, with oversight from the Audit Committee, also continues to implement remediation\nmeasures related to the material weaknesses as at March 31, 2024, with a focus on reducing the reliance on manual review procedures over\ndata and information in key business processes, enhancement of IT systems and leveraging automated controls, providing training to control\nowners and hiring additional resources where appropriate, and enhancement to business processes and controls as the Company continues\nto mature its processes.\n21 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. Q2 2025 MD&A\nAside from these initiatives and the identified material weaknesses resulting from this work and testing of controls as described in\nmanagement’s assessment of ICFR below, no changes to the Company’s ICFR occurred during the quarter that have materially affected, or\nare likely to materially affect, the Company’s ICFR.\nManagement’s Assessment on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn accordance with National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings and as required by Rule\n13a-15(f) and 15d-5(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as amended, management is responsible for establishing\nand maintaining adequate ICFR. The Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, has designed ICFR based on the 2013 Internal\nControl-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO Framework”)\nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for\nexternal purposes in accordance with IFRS.\nICFR is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. ICFR has inherent limitations. ICFR is a\nprocess that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.\nICFR also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material\nmisstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by ICFR. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the\nfinancial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\nManagement has concluded that material weaknesses in the Company’s ICFR continue to exist as identified and described in the Company’s\nannual report and disclosures for the period ending March 31, 2024.\nProcess Level Control Activities: The Company did not consistently execute and document sufficiently precise management review controls\nover key assumptions, estimates and period cut-off controls over payable accruals, as well as controls over review of data inputs,\ncompleteness of data entry, and the accuracy of mathematical formulas within spreadsheets. This deficiency impacts property, plant &\nequipment, biological assets and inventory, goodwill and impairment, purchase price accounting, accounts payable, and financial statement\nclose processes.\nInsufficient Segregation of Duties and Personnel at Bevo Agtech Inc.: Specific to the Bevo Agtech Inc. business component and due to\nboth staffing limitations resulting in lack of segregation of duties and limited experience of personnel in key roles in implementing and\nperforming ICFR, the Company had an aggregation of pervasive deficiencies across IT General Controls as well as business processes\nincluding manual journal entries, treasury and cash management, payroll, production and inventory, revenue and receivables, and financial\nreporting processes.\nRemediation Plan\nManagement, with oversight from the Audit Committee will continue to implement remediation measures related to the identified material\nweaknesses, with a continued focus on reducing the reliance on manual review procedures over data and information in key business\nprocesses, providing training to control owners, hiring additional staff to enable the performance of timely internal controls, and enhancement\nto business processes and controls as the Company continues to mature. The Company’s Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”)\ntransformation is a critical step to reducing our dependency on manual review controls, with deployment of the Company’s ERP planned for\nthe European business unit in fiscal year 2025.\nManagement continues to work to improve the robustness of source data used in key assumptions and estimates, including data used in\nbusiness and operational forecasting, and believes that the precision of assumptions and estimates will continue to improve as additional\nmarket and historical company data becomes available as the industry matures.\nWe believe these measures, and others that may be implemented, will remediate the material weaknesses in ICFR described above.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis MD&A contains certain statements which may constitute “forward-looking information” and “forward-looking statements” within the\nmeaning of Canadian securities law requirements (collectively, “forward-looking statements”).

Readers are urged to consider the risks,\nuncertainties and assumptions carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements.\nAlthough the Company believes that the expectations conveyed by the forward-looking statements are reasonable based on the information\navailable to the Company on the date hereof, no assurance can be given as to future results, approvals or achievements. Forward-looking\nstatements contained in this MD&A and in the documents incorporated by reference herein are expressly qualified by this cautionary\nstatement.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Certain Non-GAAP Performance Measures\nThis MD&A contains certain financial performance measures that are not recognized or defined under IFRS (“Non-GAAP Measures”). As a\nresult, this data may not be comparable to data presented by other licensed producers of cannabis and cannabis companies. For an\nexplanation of these measures to related comparable financial information presented in the consolidated Financial Statements prepared in\naccordance with IFRS, refer to the discussion below. The Company believes that these Non-GAAP Measures are useful indicators of operating\nperformance and are specifically used by management to assess the financial and operational performance of the Company. The following are\nNon-GAAP measures contained in this MD&A:\n• Cannabis net revenue represents revenue from the sale of cannabis products, excluding excise taxes. Cannabis net revenue is\nfurther broken down as follows:\n◦ Medical cannabis net revenue represents Canadian and international cannabis net revenue for medical cannabis sales\nonly.\n◦ Consumer cannabis net revenue represents cannabis net revenue for consumer cannabis sales only.\n◦ Wholesale bulk cannabis net revenue represents cannabis net revenue for wholesale bulk cannabis only.\nManagement believes the cannabis net revenue measures provide more specific information about the net revenue purely\ngenerated from our core cannabis business and by market type.\n• Gross profit before fair value adjustments (“FV adjustments”) is calculated by subtracting cost of sales, before the effects of changes\nin FV of biological assets and inventory from net revenue. Gross margin before FV adjustments is calculated by dividing gross profit\nbefore FV adjustments by net revenue. Management believes that these measures provide useful information to assess the\nprofitability of our operations as it excludes the effects of non-cash FV adjustments on inventory and biological assets, which are\nrequired by IFRS.\n• Adjusted gross profit before FV adjustments represents cash gross profit on net revenue and is calculated by subtracting from total\nnet revenue (i) cost of sales, before the effects of changes in FV of biological assets and inventory; and removing (ii) depreciation in\ncost of sales; (iii) cannabis inventory impairment; and (iv) business transformation, non-recurring, and out-of-period adjustments.\nAdjusted gross margin before FV adjustments is calculated by dividing adjusted gross profit before FV adjustments by net revenue.\nAdjusted gross profit and gross margin before FV adjustments on cannabis net revenue is further broken down as follows:\n◦ Adjusted gross profit and gross margin before FV adjustments on medical cannabis net revenue represents gross profit\nand gross margin before FV adjustments on sales generated in the medical market only.\n23 | AURORA CANNABIS INC. Q2 2025 MD&A\n◦ Adjusted gross profit and gross margin before FV adjustments on consumer cannabis net revenue represents gross profit\nand gross margin before FV adjustments on sales generated in the consumer market only.\n◦ Adjusted gross profit and gross margin before FV adjustments on wholesale bulk cannabis net revenue represents gross\nprofit and gross margin before FV adjustments on sales generated from wholesale bulk cannabis only.\nManagement believes that these measures provide useful information to assess the profitability of our operations as it represents\nthe cash gross profit and margin generated from operations and excludes (i) out-of-period adjustments to provide information that\nreflects current period results; and (ii) excludes the effects of non-cash FV adjustments on inventory and biological assets, which are\nrequired by IFRS.\n• Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net income (loss) from continuing operations excluding income tax expense (recovery), other\nincome (expenses), share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, acquisition costs, changes in fair value of inventory\nsold, inventory impairment adjustments, changes in fair value of biological assets, costs related to our business transformation, out-\nof-period adjustments, non-recurring items and costs related to business operations focused on developing international markets\nprior to commercialization. Adjusted EBITDA is intended to provide a proxy for the Company’s operating cash flow and is widely\nused by industry analysts to compare Aurora to its competitors, and derive expectations of future financial performance for Aurora,\nand excludes out-of-period adjustments that are not reflective of current operating results.\n• Management believes that working capital is an important liquidity measure and is defined as current assets less current liabilities as\nstated on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n• Management believes that free cash flow presents meaningful information regarding the amount of cash flow required to maintain\nand organically grow the Company’s business and is an important liquidity measure.\n• Adjusted SG&A is defined as SG&A, less business transformation, non-recurring, market development and out-of-period costs.\nManagement believes this measure provides useful information to assess the recurring costs of our operations.\nNon-GAAP Measures should be considered together with other data prepared in accordance with IFRS to enable investors to evaluate the\nCompany’s operating results, underlying performance and prospects in a manner similar to Aurora’s management. Accordingly, these Non-\nGAAP Measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of\nperformance prepared in accordance with IFRS.\n24 | AURORA CANNABIS INC.

share and per share amounts)\nNote 1 Nature of Operations\nAurora Cannabis Inc. (the “Company” or “Aurora”) was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) on December 21,\n2006 as Milk Capital Corp. Effective October 2, 2014, the Company changed its name to Aurora Cannabis Inc. The Company’s shares are listed\non the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) under the trading symbol “ACB”, and on the Frankfurt Stock\nExchange (“FSE”) under the trading symbol “21P1”.\nThe Company’s head office and principal address is 2207 90B St. SW Edmonton, Alberta T6X 1V8. The Company’s registered and records office\naddress is Suite 1700, 666 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6C 2X8.\nThe Company’s principal strategic business lines are focused on the production, distribution and sale of cannabis related products in Canada and\ninternationally. Aurora currently conducts the following key business activities in the jurisdictions listed below:\n• Production, distribution and sale of medical and consumer cannabis products in Canada pursuant to the Cannabis Act;\n• Distribution of wholesale medical cannabis in the European Union (“EU”) pursuant to the German Medicinal Products Act and German\nNarcotic Drugs Act; and\n• Distribution of wholesale medical cannabis in various international markets, including Australia, New Zealand, the Caribbean, South\nAmerica and Israel.\nThe Company has a 50.1% controlling interest in Bevo Agtech Inc. (“Bevo”), the sole parent of Bevo Farms Ltd., a key supplier of propagated\nvegetables and ornamental plants in North America.\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements were approved and authorized for issue by the Audit Committee of the Company on\nNovember 5, 2024.\nNote 2 Material Accounting Policies and Judgments\n(a) Basis of Presentation and Measurement\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial\nReporting Standards (“IFRS”), and International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) 34, Interim Financial Reporting (“IAS 34”) as issued by the\nInternational Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). Unless otherwise noted, all amounts are presented in thousands of Canadian dollars, except\nshare and per share data.\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars and are prepared in accordance with the same\naccounting policies, critical estimates and methods described in the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements, except for the adoption\nof new accounting policies (Note 2(d)). Given that certain information and footnote disclosures, which are included in the annual audited\nconsolidated financial statements, have been condensed or excluded in accordance with IAS 34, these condensed consolidated interim financial\nstatements should be read in conjunction with our annual audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024,\nincluding the accompanying notes thereto.\n(b) Basis of Consolidation\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the financial results of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries include\nentities which are wholly-owned as well as entities over which Aurora has the authority or ability to exert control over the investee’s financial and/\nor operating decisions (i.e. control), which in turn may affect the Company’s exposure or rights to the variable returns from the investee. The\ncondensed consolidated interim financial statements include the operating results of acquired or disposed entities from the date control is\nobtained or the date control is lost, respectively. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.\nThe Company’s principal subsidiaries during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 are as follows:\nMajor subsidiaries Percentage Ownership Functional Currency\nAurora Cannabis Enterprises Inc. (“ACE”) 100% Canadian Dollar\nAurora Deutschland GmbH (“Aurora Deutschland”) 100% European Euro\nTerraFarma Inc. 100% Canadian Dollar\nWhistler Medical Marijuana Corporation (“Whistler”) 100% Canadian Dollar\nBevo Agtech Inc. (“Bevo”) 50.1% Canadian Dollar\nCannaHealth Therapeutics Inc. 100% Canadian Dollar\nACB Captive Insurance Company Inc. 100% Canadian Dollar\nIndica Industries Pty Ltd. (“MedReleaf Australia”) 100% Australian Dollar\nAll shareholdings are of ordinary shares or other equity. Other subsidiaries, while included in the condensed consolidated interim financial\nstatements, are not material and have not been reflected in the table above.\n9\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\n(c) Discontinued Operations\nThe Company reports financial results for discontinued operations separately from continuing operations to distinguish the financial impact of\ndisposal transactions from ongoing operations. Discontinued operations reporting occurs when the disposal of a component or a group of\ncomponents of the Company represents a strategic shift that will have an impact on the Company’s operations and financial results, and where\nthe operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the Company.\nThe results of discontinued operations are excluded from both continuing operations and business segment information in the condensed\nconsolidated interim financial statements and the notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements, unless otherwise noted, and\nare presented net of tax in the condensed consolidated interim statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) for the current and\ncomparative periods. Refer to Note 6(b) Discontinued Operations.\n(d) Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nAmendments to IAS 1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\nThe amendment clarifies the requirements relating to determining if a liability should be presented as current or non-current in the statement of\nfinancial position. Under the new requirement, the assessment of whether a liability is presented as current or non-current is based on the\ncontractual arrangements in place as at the reporting date and does not impact the amount or timing of recognition. The amendment applies\nretrospectively for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. The Company has applied the amendments effective April 1,\n2024, retrospectively and it did not impact the classification of current or non-current liabilities.\n(e) New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nThe following IFRS standards have been recently issued by the IASB. Pronouncements that are irrelevant or not expected to have a significant\nimpact have been excluded.\nIFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosures in Financial Statements\nIFRS 18, Presentation and Disclosures in Financial Statements, replaces IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements for reporting periods\nbeginning on or after January 1, 2027, including for interim financial statements with retrospective application. IFRS 18, introduces a specified\nstructure for the income statement by requiring income and expenses to be presented into the three defined categories of operating, investing\nand financing, and by specifying certain defined totals and subtotals.\nWhere company-specific measures related to the income statement are provided, IFRS 18 requires companies to disclose explanations around\nthese measures, which are referred to as management defined performance measures. IFRS 18 also provides additional guidance on principles\nof aggregation and disaggregation which apply to the primary financial statements and the notes. IFRS 18 will not affect the recognition and\nmeasurement of items in the financial statements, nor will it affect which items are classified in other comprehensive income and how these items\nare classified. The Company is currently assessing the effect of this new standard on its financial statements.\n10\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and

Other than the claims\ndescribed below, as of the date of this report, Aurora is not aware of any other material or significant claims against the Company.\nOn November 21, 2019, a purported class action proceeding was commenced in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey\nagainst the Company and certain of its current and former directors and officers on behalf of persons or entities who purchased, or otherwise\nacquired, publicly traded Aurora securities between October 23, 2018 and February 6, 2020. The parties have received preliminary approval of a\n$8 million settlement, which will be covered by insurance.\nOn June 16, 2020, the Company and its subsidiary, ACE, were named in a purported class action proceeding in the Province of Alberta in relation\nto the alleged mislabeling of cannabis products with inaccurate THC/CBD content. The class action involved a number of other parties including\nAleafia Health Inc., Hexo Corp, Tilray Canada Ltd., among others. The plaintiffs have filed a Discontinuance of Claim for this matter, as such, this\nclaim is no longer active.\nOn June 15, 2020, a claim was filed with the King's Bench of Alberta by a party to a former term sheet against Aurora and a former officer\nalleging a claim of breach of obligations under said term sheet, with the plaintiff seeking $18.0 million in damages. While this matter is ongoing,\nthe Company believes the action to be without merit and intends to defend the claim.\nOn August 10, 2020, a purported class action lawsuit was filed with the King's Bench of Alberta against Aurora and certain executive officers in\nthe Province of Alberta on behalf of persons or entities who purchased, or otherwise acquired, publicly traded Aurora securities and allegedly\n22\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nsuffered losses as a result of Aurora releasing statements containing misrepresentations during the period of September 11, 2019 and December\n21, 2019. Plaintiff and Defendant have each prepared factums for a leave application. Prior to the hearing, Defendants filed a request for\nadjournment and leave to amend their pleadings. The amended Statement of Claim was filed on March 8, 2024. The Company has filed a motion\nto strike the amendment. The Company’s motion to strike will be heard the week of November 18, 2024. The Company disputes the allegations\nand intends to vigorously defend against the claims. Estimating an amount or range of possible losses resulting from litigation proceedings is\ninherently difficult, particularly where the matters involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages and are in the stages of the proceedings\nwhere key factual and legal issues have not been resolved. For these reasons, the Company is currently unable to predict the ultimate timing or\noutcome of or reasonably estimate the possible losses or a range of possible losses resulting from the matter described above.\nOn January 4, 2021, a civil claim was filed with the King’s Bench of Alberta against Aurora and Hempco by a former landlord regarding unpaid\nrent in the amount of $8.9 million, representing approximately $0.4 million for rent in arrears and costs, plus $8.5 million for loss of rent and\nremainder of the term. The Company filed a statement of defence on March 24, 2021. Plaintiffs brought an Application seeking summary\njudgment as against the Company and the Company has filed Affidavit evidence in response. Cross-examinations for the Company’s affiants and\nfor Plaintiff’s affiant have been completed. While this matter is ongoing, the Company intends to continue to defend against the claims.\nOn November 15, 2022, the Company, its subsidiary ACE, and MedReleaf Corp. (which amalgamated with ACE in July 2020) were named in a\npurported class action proceeding in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. The purported class action claims that the Company failed to warn of\ncertain risks purported to be associated with the consumption of cannabis. While this matter is ongoing, the Company intends to continue to\ndefend against the claims.\nThe Company is subject to litigation and similar claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims related to employment, human\nresources, product liability and commercial disputes. The Company has received notice of, or are aware of, certain possible claims against us\nwhere the magnitude of such claims is negligible, or it is not currently possible for us to predict the outcome of such claims, possible claims or\nlawsuits due to various factors including: the preliminary nature of some claims; an incomplete factual record; and the unpredictable nature of\nopposing parties and their demands. Management is of the opinion, based upon legal assessments and information presently available, that it is\nunlikely that any of these claims would result in liability to the Company, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, would\nhave a material effect on the consolidated financial statements, other than the claims described above.\nIn respect of the aforementioned claims, as at September 30, 2024 the Company has recognized total provisions of nil (March 31, 2024 – $2.3\nmillion) in provisions on the condensed consolidated interim statements of financial position.\n(b) Commitments\nThe Company has various lease commitments related to various office space, production equipment, vehicles, facilities and warehouses expiring\nup to June 2033. The Company has certain leases with optional renewal terms that the Company may exercise at its option.\nIn addition to lease liability commitments disclosed in Note 18(b) and loans and borrowing repayments in Note 8, the Company has $2.9 million in\nfuture capital commitments and purchase commitments payments, which are due over the next 12 months.\n23\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nNote 15 Revenue\nThe Company generates revenue from the transfer of goods at a point-in-time from the revenue streams below.

The change during the six months\nended September 30, 2024 of $8.0 million is recorded in deficit in the condensed consolidated interim statements of changes in equity.\nNote 18 Financial Instruments Risk\nThe Company is exposed to a variety of financial instrument related risks. The Board mitigates these risks by assessing, monitoring and\napproving the Company’s risk management processes.\n(a) Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of a potential loss to the Company if a customer or third party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual\nobligations. The Company is moderately exposed to credit risk from its cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and\nlease receivable. The risk exposure is limited to their carrying amounts reflected on the condensed consolidated interim statements of financial\nposition. The risk for cash and cash equivalents is mitigated by holding these instruments with highly rated Canadian financial institutions. Certain\nrestricted funds in the amount of $39.7 million are retained by an insurer under the Segregated Accounts Companies Act governed by the\nBermuda Monetary Authority. As the Company does not invest in asset-backed deposits or investments, it does not expect any credit losses. The\nCompany periodically assesses the quality of its investments and is satisfied with the credit rating of the financial institutions and the investment\ngrade of its Guaranteed Investment Certificates (“GICs”).\nThe Company provides credit to certain customers in the normal course of business and has established credit evaluation and monitoring\nprocesses to mitigate credit risk. Credit risk is generally minimal for receivables from government bodies, which generally have low default risk.\nCredit risk for non-government customers is assessed on a case-by-case basis and a provision is recorded where required. As of September 30,\n2024, $25.0 million of accounts receivable, net of allowances, are from non-government wholesale customers (March 31, 2024 – $22.8 million).\nAs at September 30, 2024, three customers made up 10% or more of trade accounts receivable (March 31, 2024 – two customers).\n27\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nAs at September 30, 2024, the provision for estimated credit losses is $1.3 million (March 31, 2024 – $1.3 million). During the three and six\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, the Company wrote off nil and nil, respectively (three and six months ended September 30, 2023 – $0.5\nmillion and $3.2 million, respectively) and recognized an expense for the three and six months ended of $0.2 million and nil, respectively (three\nand six months ended September 30, 2023 – expense of $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively) recorded in the condensed consolidated\ninterim statements of loss and comprehensive loss.\nThe Company’s aging of trade receivables, net was as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 March 31, 2024\n$ $\n0 – 60 days 27,385 33,239\n61+ days 7,541 7,303\n34,926 40,542\n(b) Liquidity risk\nThe composition of the Company’s accounts payable and accrued liabilities was as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 March 31, 2024\n$ $\nTrade payables 8,735 20,325\nAccrued liabilities 16,391 20,097\nPayroll liabilities 11,646 15,496\nExcise tax payable 2,249 2,500\nOther payables 11 145\n39,032 58,563\nIn addition to the commitments outlined in Note 14, the Company has the following undiscounted contractual obligations as at September 30,\n2024, which are expected to be payable in the following respective periods:\nOver 1 year - 3 Over 3 years - 5\nTotal ≤1 year years years > 5 years\n$ $ $ $ $\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 39,032 39,032 — — —\nLease liabilities (1) 89,394 8,282 22,014 10,804 48,294\nLoans and borrowings 57,563 53,737 3,826 — —\nCapital commitments(2) 2,858 2,858 — — —\n188,847 103,909 25,840 10,804 48,294\n(1) Includes interest payable until maturity date.\n(2) Relates to remaining commitments that the Company has made to vendors for equipment purchases and capital projects pertaining to existing construction.\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations associated with its financial liabilities when they are due.\nThe Company manages liquidity risk through the management of its capital structure and resources to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to\nsettle obligations and liabilities when they are due. Our ability to fund our operating requirements depends on future operating performance and\ncash flows, which are subject to economic, financial, competitive, business and regulatory conditions, and other factors, some of which are\nbeyond our control. Our primary short-term liquidity needs are to fund our net operating losses, capital expenditures to maintain existing facilities,\nshort and long-term loans and borrowings and lease payments. Our medium-term liquidity needs primarily relate to lease payments and our long-\nterm liquidity needs primarily relate to potential strategic plans.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company has access to the following capital resources available to fund operations and obligations:\n• $84.9 million cash and cash equivalents; and\n• access to the 2023 Shelf Prospectus (as defined below). The Company currently has access to securities registered for sale under the\n2023 Shelf Prospectus currently covering U.S.$650.0 million of issuable securities. Of the U.S.$650.0 million of securities registered\nunder the 2023 Shelf Prospectus and corresponding registration statement on form F-10 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission in the U.S., approximately U.S.$225.3 million is allocated to the potential exercise of currently outstanding warrants issued\nin financing transactions from 2022. Following the closing of the bought deal offering on October 3, 2023 and the expiration of warrants\nduring the year approximately U.S.$396.4 million is available for potential new issuances of Common Shares, warrants, options,\nsubscription receipts, debt securities or any combination thereof during the 25-month period that the 2023 Shelf Prospectus remains\neffective. Volatility in the cannabis industry, stock market and the Company’s share price may impact the amount and our ability to raise\nfinancing under the 2023 Shelf Prospectus.\n28\nAURORA CANNABIS INC.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n(Amounts reflected in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nBased on all of the aforementioned factors, the Company believes that its reduction of operating costs, current liquidity position, and access to\nthe 2023 Shelf Prospectus are adequate to fund operating activities and cash commitments for investing, financing and strategic activities for the\nforeseeable future. In addition, the Company could access restricted cash of $62.3 million relating to its self-insurance policy, if necessary.\n29"

We had a strong Q2 and look forward to building on that momentum. Our prime positioning as\na leader within nationally legal cannabis markets has set the foundation for topline growth and higher profitability\nas we further penetrate existing markets such as Canada, Europe, and, Australia, and enter new ones as they\nopen. In doing so, we will place more distance between ourselves and our peers by leaning into what sets Aurora\napart, including, first, capitalizing on rapidly evolving global medical cannabis opportunities backed by our EU\nGMP manufacturing facilities, unparalleled scientific knowledge, genetics, and regulatory expertise. Second,\nleveraging our continued focus on operational excellence, so that we can maintain our enviable margin profile in\nmedical cannabis, the highest margin industry segment. And third, maintaining and solidifying our balance sheet\nto maximize flexibility, while also continuously focusing on profitable growth, as evidenced by our record adjusted\nEBITDA.\nWith that, let me now briefly share some highlights related to our quarterly results. Net revenue grew 29%,\nincluding record revenue from global medical cannabis, which itself represented 41% year-over-year growth.\nWithin global medical cannabis, international revenue increased 93%. The contribution from high margin\ninternational revenue exceeded that of Canadian medical cannabis for the first time, and amounted to 57% of total\nglobal medical cannabis revenue. This shift demonstrates how we've successfully positioned ourselves to benefit\nfrom opportunities across the globe which are balanced by the stability we see in the maturing Canadian market.\nIn addition, let me touch on Bevo's performance. Bevo already has a formidable presence within North America's\ncontrolled environment agricultural industry, and is significantly increasing its production capacity to support\nhigher demand through the conversion of the Aurora Sky and Aurora Sun facilities. Even in its slower seasons,\nwhich correspond to our fiscal second and third quarters in Q2, we were able to increase revenue by a robust\n21% through organic growth and increased product offerings such as orchids arising from greater capacity. On\nprofitability, we achieved record outcomes in adjusted gross profit and adjusted EBITDA, which is the result of our\ncontinued focus on the profitable global medical cannabis business segments.\nLet's now discuss our business in greater detail. Global medical cannabis is our flagship segment serving the\ndiverse needs of patients across multiple, nationally regulated markets. It grew 41% year-over-year and\ngenerated 76% of our total revenue and 98% of our adjusted gross profit. Most of this growth stem from\ninternational markets. However, Canadian medical grew 3%, and we maintained our dominant leadership\nposition.\nThe Canadian market remains a stable contributor to our overall medical business as we benefit from a\ncombination of insurance covered and self-paying patients. Our ability to remain at the forefront of the domestic\nmedical cannabis industry is because of our ongoing investments in science and innovation, anchored by our\nbreeding and genetics facility in Comox, British Columbia. Over time, we believe there should be upside to\nunlocking the addressable usage market, which currently encompasses only 1% of the Canadian adult\npopulation.\nCanadian patients appreciate and seek out our steady stream of next-generation cultivars along with other\ninnovative products. And to take advantage of increased interest in medical cannabis as part of healthcare\noptions made available to them, we launched a newly-developed CBD lozenge in collaboration with Vectura\nFertin Pharma.\nLet's now turn to our international business, beginning with Australia, our second largest market after Canada. We\nare number two in Australia, which is emerging as the largest medical market in the world outside of North\n3\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 06-Nov-2024\nAmerica, sized at AUD 400 million annually, according to the Pennington Institute. The Australian market's high\nregulatory standards represent significant barriers to entry, providing a distinct advantage to us over our\ncompetitors. Notably, we were one of the first Canadian LPs to receive Good Manufacturing Practice certification\nfrom the Australian Regulatory Authority, TGA, for our two largest Canadian manufacturing facilities. And, in fact,\n90% of our annual production comes from these EU GMP and TGA GMP-certified facilities.\nIn Q2, the following two factors drove our increased revenue and EBITDA contributions. First, we benefited from a\nfull quarter contribution from MedReleaf Australia, as all previously sold inventory has flowed through since we\ncompleted the purchase of the remaining interest in this subsidiary in February. And second, we experienced\nincreased sales due to a broadened product portfolio that includes pastilles, live resin cartridges, and an\nexpanded range of high-quality cultivars. Most recently, we announced an enhanced product range of premium\nmedical cannabis oils in Australia, which include a variety of cannabinoid ratios to support personalized treatment\noptions for patients. Our mission with MedReleaf Australia is to expand access to high-quality medical cannabis\noptions for patients across the country. And on a related note, our leadership there gives us an advantage in\nexpanding sales into New Zealand, a smaller but important emerging market in its own right.\nTurning to Europe, and beginning with Germany. Our operating history goes back more than six years, and our\ncredentials are virtually unmatched, as we hold the number three market share for flower and the number two\nmarket share for insured patients. Growth in the German market is due to cannabis descheduling, which\ncontributed to the significant increase in international medical cannabis revenue during Q2. It is clear that more\npatients will become registered, and pharmacies will expand to support the increase in prescription volumes. In\nfact, there's already a visible uptick in patients, including those that are self-paying.\nRight now, we are focused on maintaining consistent and reliable supply of our high-quality EU GMP\nmanufactured products to our pharmacy partners so that we can continue to meet the growing needs of German\npatients. And to that end, we have a considerable capacity to support higher product volumes through both our\nEU GMP facilities in Canada, as well as our facility in Leuna, Germany. The Leuna facility has also been granted\npermission to expand cultivation under Germany's new Medical Cannabis Act. And we're one of the select few\ncompanies to receive the enhanced license, exemplifying our commitment to high-quality manufacturing, long-\nestablished regulatory expertise, and unparalleled commitment to compliance.\nWe recognize that changes in Germany are also likely to have a broader effect on the expanding acceptance of\nmedical cannabis across Europe. And we will be ready for these opportunities. Our agility and unique set of\ncapabilities, including expertise in meeting high-regulatory requirements and cultivating high-quality products, will\nenable us to win as these markets develop.\nWith that in mind, let's discuss Poland, our second largest European market. After sales were impacted in Q1 due\nto the import permit process, they rebounded in Q2, because of increased permits and the continued strong\ndemand from Polish patients for high-quality medical cannabis.\nIn the U.K., we are gaining traction with patients through our latest innovation and widened distribution channels,\nresulting in significant revenue growth, leading to a new record quarter for this market.\nWe saw an increase in demand for EU GMP manufactured flower, which aligns well with 90% of our internal\nmanufacturing capacity being EU and TGA GMP certified. The expansion of our latest genetics offer higher yields\nand a lower cost per gram to produce, which has given us the ability to significantly increase our output capacity,\nespecially as these new cultivars begin to establish themselves in key international markets.\n4\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 06-Nov-2024\nGiven the success we have made with our medical first cannabis strategy through the first half of the fiscal year,\nwe think we are well-positioned for a successful fiscal 2025. Our optimism is anchored by our commitment to\ndelivering continued profitable growth, positive cash flow in Q3, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and\noperational excellence. These factors are the building blocks to being able to deliver ongoing and sustainable\nimprovements to our financial performance.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Simona for a detailed financial overview.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nSimona King\nChief Financial Officer, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nThank you, Miguel, and good morning, everyone. Q2's performance was underpinned by the following.\nFirst, net revenue of CAD 81.1 million represented 29% growth supported by record net revenue of CAD 61.3\nmillion from our high-margin medical cannabis segment.\nSecond, quarterly profitability consisted of consolidated adjusted gross margin at 54%, 300 basis points higher\nthan last year, resulting in a record adjusted gross profit of CAD 42.6 million.\nThird, adjusted EBITDA grew 210% to CAD 10.1 million, a new record for the company and our eighth\nconsecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA.\nAnd finally, we ended the quarter with approximately CAD 152 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt in\nour cannabis business.\nIt is these financial results that are true validation of our efforts, and I am pleased to now review them in detail\nwith you.\nMedical cannabis net revenue rose by 41% to CAD 61.3 million, which consisted of 3% growth in Canada and\n93% growth internationally. Medical cannabis comprised 76% of total net revenue and 98% of total adjusted gross\nprofit during the quarter. This marked an increase from 69% of net revenue and 85% of adjusted gross profit from\nthe year ago period, the result of higher medical revenue and higher medical margins in the current year quarter.\nThe increase in Canadian medical revenue was due to increased sales to insurance-covered patients with larger\nbasket sizes. The increase in international medical cannabis revenue was primarily due to higher sales in\nAustralia, Germany, Poland, and the U.K., driven by strong patient demand for our latest innovation and the\nsignificant overall growth in these markets.\nAdjusted gross margin for medical cannabis was 68%, up from 63% in the year ago period, which far exceeded\nour 60% target. Several factors drove this increase, including: first, sustainable cost reductions; second, higher\nselling prices in Australia; and third, improved efficiency in our production operations with our shift to supplying\nthe European markets from Canada.\nConsumer cannabis net revenue was CAD 10.4 million, down from CAD 12 million in the year ago period. The\ndecline was the expected result of our decision to prioritize the supply of our GMP manufactured product to our\nhigh-margin international business. Adjusted gross margin in consumer cannabis was 14% compared to 27% due\nto sales of our higher margin products in the year ago period.\n5\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 06-Nov-2024\nIn our plant propagation segment, net revenue increased to CAD 8.6 million, up from CAD 7.2 million in the year\nago period due to a combination of organic growth and increased product offerings. Recall that Bevo historically\ndelivers lower revenue in the summer and fall months with about 25% to 35% of plant propagation revenue and\nup to 20% of EBITDA earned in the second half of the calendar year. Plant propagation adjusted gross margin\nwas 19%, down from 22% in the year ago period, reflecting modest fluctuations due to the seasonal timing of\nlower margin product revenue and ramp up of the orchid business.\nOur consolidated adjusted SG&A rose to CAD 31.7 million, up from CAD 27.7 million in the year ago period due\nto the incremental SG&A following the acquisition and full ownership of MedReleaf Australia. This additional\nexpense is now being offset by increased revenue and EBITDA contributions. Our balance sheet remains one of\nthe strongest in the global cannabis industry. We held approximately CAD 152 million in cash and cash\nequivalents as of September 30. Our cannabis operations are completely debt-free while our Bevo business holds\nCAD 57.5 million in non-recourse debt that is secured by a significant fixed asset base held at Bevo. Cash used in\noperating activities was CAD 24.9 million, down from CAD 30.9 million in the year ago period. The improvement\nwas due to increased revenue and improved contribution margin and changes in working capital. In Q2, cash\nused in operating activities includes the net working capital investment due mainly to our payment of a number of\nannual and one-time cash items.\nLet me now provide some thoughts on Q3. We expect to see similar sequential net revenue and adjusted gross\nmargins across our global medical cannabis business, supported by year-over-year growth in Europe and\nAustralia. We expect to see seasonally reduced revenues and gross profit for plant propagation, in line with\nhistorical seasonal trends.\nPositive adjusted EBITDA is expected to continue, while our Q3 free cash flow is anticipated to be positive again\nbased upon the following. First, continued increases in global medical cannabis driven in part by the full\nrecognition of revenue in Australia and further growth in our key European markets. Second, operating\nexpenditure and adjusted gross margins in line with previously-stated targets. And third, disciplined working\ncapital management.\nTo conclude, with two fiscal quarters now behind us, the foundation for a successful fiscal 2025 is well-set, and\nwe will continue to focus on the execution of our stated plan.\nThank you for your time. I'll now turn the call back to Miguel.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMiguel Martin\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nThanks, Simona. Let's wrap up with a few key takeaways. Medical cannabis is a large addressable market with a\nbright future due to the increasing rate of patient access across the world. We have a unique ability to take\nadvantage of this opportunity due to our leadership position and the proven portability of our business model. We\nhave established a track record of profitability that we are able to continue and expand upon. And we have a\nstrong balance sheet with a sizable cash balance and no cannabis debt that enables us to be opportunistic. Our\nexcitement and optimism are made possible by our high-performing team, who are dedicated to operational\nexcellence, as we continue to grow and open the world to cannabis.\nAnd with that, thank you for your interest in Aurora. And we can now take your questions. Operator, please open\nthe line.\n6\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 06-Nov-2024\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourselves to one\nquestion each. You may requeue if you have more questions. [Operator Instructions] One moment please. While\nwe poll for questions. The first question is from Frederico Gomes from ATB Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nFrederico Gomes Q\nAnalyst, ATB Capital Markets, Inc.\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the great quarter. First question on the revenue\ngrowth that you saw in the global medical cannabis sales. So we know those sales are sometimes it is quite\nvolatile because of the timing of some of those shipments, et cetera. So would you say that, the sales level is sort\nof representative of what you will be doing going forward and in terms – what sort of visibility you have on that?\nAnd is the growth sort of sustainable from these levels? Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMiguel Martin A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nYes. And, Fred, thanks for the question. Let me start, and then I'll let Simona give some points here.\nThe answer to your last part first. Yes, we do think these are sustainable. And as you mentioned, the shipments\nsometimes are lumpy. We've seen, as we mentioned in our comments around Poland, that sometimes the\npermitting process, which really is outside any sort of patient demand, or sort of, traditional sort of demand for\ngrowth, aren't always connected. But if you look at the breadth of our model, which allows us to have, I think,\nmore consistency, having significant sales in U.K., Germany, Poland, Australia, New Zealand, you see these\nthings smooth out.\nSo we think the baseline is there, and we think it can grow. Importantly, we think the margins are also solid in this\nbusiness, which is important. And we're also seeing new markets come on with a pretty consistent pattern. So\nwe're very bullish on international cannabis. It's hard, as we've mentioned, the regulatory hurdles are significant.\nThe products have to be EU GMP or TGA GMP, which is, you know, creates a barrier which we think is an\nadvantage for us. But overall, we think these levels are not only sustainable but are going to grow.\nAnything, Simona, you would add?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nSimona King A\nChief Financial Officer, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nNothing really except to point out that this is the first quarter that we're able to record the full revenue for our\nAustralian business post-acquisition. So that's contributed to the growth as well.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nFrederico Gomes Q\nAnalyst, ATB Capital Markets, Inc.\nPerfect. Thanks for that. Second question, I'm curious about your rec business in Canada. It's obviously much\nsmaller than the medical platform, and, I guess, most of your profits are coming from medical. So how do you\nthink about that rec platform? You see any chances of growing that? Does it make sense to keep it, given that\nyou're medically focused right now? So how should we think about recreational going forward?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n7\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 06-Nov-2024\nMiguel Martin A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nSure. Yes. It's a great question. So obviously, right now, you only have two countries internationally that allow rec\nsales. One is Canada, and one is Uruguay. Let's talk about Canada. The Canadian system is an interesting one.\nThe Canadian government has done more for recreational cannabis than anybody else. That being said, there are\nstill some challenges to it that make it difficult and also lower the margins on it significantly. So we, quite a bit,\nalmost three years ago, made the decision to focus on medical cannabis, which is the highest margin as growing\na piece. And I think if you look at our earnings this quarter, you'll see that that decision, was a good one.\nNow, we continue to keep a small position in Canadian rec. We have less than a two share, and we think that's\nimportant. First, we gain a lot of consumer insights about products, preferences, pricing, and a variety of different\nthings. Secondly, we do see interaction between recreation – recreational sales and medical sales. And so as\ninternationally, at some point, obviously not today, you would see environments go from medical to rec, we think\nthat would give us an advantage. And then third, it also helps us with different aspects of innovation. So we like it\nwhere it's at. We have a modest position in it in Canada. We learn a lot from it. It colors a lot of what we do. But\nno one should lose sight of the fact that our primary focus is the high-margin growing medical business where,\nwe're dominant in Canada, and we're leaders across the world.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nFrederico Gomes Q\nAnalyst, ATB Capital Markets, Inc.\nThanks for that, Miguel. And if I can ask just one more question here about capital allocation. You are now close\nto your free cash flow goal, I guess, for next quarter. And you have lots of cash in the balance sheet that's free.\nSo how do you plan to allocate [ph] net capital in those M&A (23:47) something that you would be more, I guess,\nactively considering now that you are free cash flow positive? Do you plan to invest organically in the business?\nJust capital allocation options and how you're looking at them.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMiguel Martin A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nYes. Let me start it and then Simona can take the tail end of it. I think, from our standpoint, we look at capital\nallocation in three ways. First is, you're right, we took a lot of time and a lot of hard work in order to clean up the\nbalance sheet. And we're proud to have one of the strongest cash positions with no debt on our cannabis\nbusiness. And so that was an important piece for us. Second, we do continue to invest in our own business,\nwhether that's enhancements to our EU GMP, and TGA GMP facilities, or the world-class genetics, or the science\nand innovation. Those are internal investments that we see return on right away. And then third, we like to have\nthat balance sheet in order to be opportunistic. And if something were to come available, particularly, as\nvaluations have become more reasonable, we think we'd be in a strong position.\nSimona, anything you'd like to add to that?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nSimona King A\nChief Financial Officer, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nNo. I think you covered it, Miguel.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMiguel Martin A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nAll right. Thank you. Thank you, Fred.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n8\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 06-Nov-2024\nFrederico Gomes Q\nAnalyst, ATB Capital Markets, Inc.\nThank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: As a reminder, to ask a question, please press star one. The next question is from Pablo Zuanic from\nZuanic & Associates. Please go ahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPablo Zuanic Q\nAnalyst, Zuanic & Associates LLC\nThank you. Miguel, I have a few questions. But first, can I ask by asking you, your impressions following the\nresults of the U.S. election? How does that impact Aurora, if in any way? And what would you say to those\ncannabis investors that were so vested on Florida going rec or the reform process in the U.S. that are so focused\non MSO stocks? What would you say from your perspective? Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMiguel Martin A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nYes. I mean, Pablo, it's a great question. And obviously, the U.S. is the largest potentially addressable market.\nAurora for a long time has said a couple of things. First is that medical cannabis, conservative global medical\ncannabis is the most consistent, highest margin and predictable part of the overall segment. This election, and\nwhat happened in those four states, I think, continue to reinforce that the position that we took is right. You had\nfour states look at it. Florida was obviously the big one. They needed 60%. They came in at 55%. The only state\nin the U.S. of the four that passed was Nebraska. And it was a medical provision that went through. And so I think\nit reinforces the position we've taken our investments and with our focus around the world.\nI think secondly, both candidates and obviously now with the Trump administration, have talked about medical\ncannabis, as sort of a piece there. And so what I would say to investors is it's a big world out there. And I\nunderstand the interest in the U.S., and I understand the amount of focus that was on Florida. But investors in the\ncannabis companies that want to look for sustainability and profitability should be aware that there are large\ngrowing markets, as you well know, in Australia and Germany and Poland and U.K. with more coming on all the\ntime. And those are more consistent and more predictable. And the companies that are being successful in those\nmarkets are the same ones time and time again like Aurora.\nAnd so, while I'm sure there's disappointment for what happened, particularly in Florida, there's a lot of bright\nnews and a lot of optimism that investors should have about what's happening in Europe and Australia and other\nparts of the world on cannabis. I think the U.S. will get there at some point. Today is not that point. What I do\nbelieve and what we've said consistently is that it will be medical first, the FDA will be involved in the regulation of\nit, and that Aurora is the largest medical cannabis company in Canada with a strong relationship between Health\nCanada and the FDA. And everything we do around the world will be well, well positioned for the U.S. when they\nget there.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPablo Zuanic Q\nAnalyst, Zuanic & Associates LLC\nThank you. Look, and just moving on to just comparing your Australian and German operation. I mean, obviously\nfrom the acquisition you made in Australia, you have more control of the overall business, and that's leading to\ngrowth apparently based on what you described. Is that an opportunity in Germany, or you're pretty much fully\n9\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 06-Nov-2024\nintegrated there, at least from a sales and distribution perspective there? I'm just trying to understand, even in\nPoland, if there's room to do what you did in Australia, to do in Germany and Poland? Or you were already there?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMiguel Martin A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nYes, I think we're already there. I mean, if you look at what we – and you would know this. You look at what we\nhave in Germany. First and foremost, the point of differentiation is we have a production facility in Germany.\nWe're one of only three. So that's different than, say, Poland or Australia. Secondly, as we've talked about,\nGermany is expanding quite rapidly, but we've got not only all the infrastructure and the people and the trade\nrelationships that we need in Germany, but I think we're also expanding into some of the different aspects of the\nGerman growth. Australia was about getting that infrastructure, I think, to be honest, and catching up in a way to\nwhere we were with Germany.\nMedReleaf Australia is the number two player in Australia, and so we wanted to have full control over that entity. I\nwas down there a bit ago. And it's a great market, a fast-growing market, and we think one that's really going to\nreward companies with high-quality, innovative products. The other thing that's different about Australia than\nGermany is you can sell a broader breadth of products. So whether it's ingestibles or different aspects of a full\nmedical portfolio, there's greater opportunity with that, which I think better takes advantage of the full portfolio of\nmedical products that we have produced in Canada and shipped to Australia.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPablo Zuanic Q\nAnalyst, Zuanic & Associates LLC\nOkay. And one last one, if I can. We're starting to hear about some cities in Germany doing this pilot programs, I\nguess, for a quasi-rec program. Could have that any – an impact on medical sales or on the way the medical\nmarket develops in Germany? And I guess part B of that question, just remind us in terms of what do you see as\nunderlying growth in the German market, right now, and whether you are running at that rate or slightly below or\nslightly above.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMiguel Martin A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nYes. So let me try to take those in order. So as you well know, there were provisions in the descheduling that\nwould allow individuals to grow their own plans and to have these social clubs. We've not seen particularly in\nmarkets that have reimbursed, provisions like, say, in Canada, that impact. So we're not worried about that. And\nit's early days.\nI will say, the regulators in Germany and others that regulate that industry, these sort of early days there. But\nthere is significant amount of growth in patient growth, particularly in the self-payer market where we're number\none in Germany. So we don't see any sort of impact from any of those provisions.\nI think in terms of the percentage growth, it's hard to give you a specific number, because there isn't syndicated\ndata that would give you an exact number. I think, overall, we would be comfortable in saying we're seeing pretty\nsignificant growth in Germany, and we need a little bit more time in order to quantify exactly what that looks like,\nsay, quarter-over-quarter.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPablo Zuanic Q\nAnalyst, Zuanic & Associates LLC\nThank you.\n10\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nAurora Cannabis, Inc.\n(ACB.CA) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 06-Nov-2024\nMiguel Martin A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Aurora Cannabis, Inc.\nThank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session.
