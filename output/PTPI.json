These forward-looking statements are based upon Petros Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (“Petros,” “we,” “our,” “us” or the “Company”) management’s\nassumptions, expectations, projections, intentions and beliefs about future events. In some cases, predictive, future-tense or forward- looking words such as “intend,” “plan,” “may,”\n“will,” “project,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “continue,” “potential,” “opportunity,” “forecast,” “should” and similar expressions, whether in the negative or affirmative, are\nintended to identify forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. Actual results and the timing of certain events and circumstances may\ndiffer materially from those described by the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, Petros’ ability to execute on its business\nstrategy, including its plans to develop and commercialize its product candidates; Petros’ ability to comply with obligations as a public reporting company; the ability of Petros to timely\nand effectively implement controls and procedures required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; the risk that the financial performance of Petros may not be as\nanticipated by the merger transactions that resulted in the Company’s creation; risks resulting from Petros’ status as an emerging growth company, including that reduced disclosure\nrequirements may make shares of Petros common stock less attractive to investors; risks related to Petros’ ability to continue as a going concern; risks related to Petros’ dependence on\nthe commercialization of a single product, Stendra®, and on a single distributor thereof; risks related to Petros’ commercial supply agreement with Vivus; and risks related to Petros’\nability to obtain regulatory approvals for, or market acceptance of, any of its products or product candidates. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from\nthe results anticipated in these forward-looking statements are contained in the joint proxy/prospectus on Form S-4 and in periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the “SEC”) under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and elsewhere and in other\nfilings that the Company may make with the SEC. The Company cautions readers that the forward- looking statements included in this presentation represent our beliefs, expectations,\nestimates and assumptions only as of the date of hereof and are not intended to give any assurance as to future results. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for\nus to predict all of these factors. Further, the Company cannot assess the effect of each such factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may\ncause actual results to be materially different from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Accordingly, you should not unduly rely on any forward-looking statements.\nThe Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this presentation, whether as a result of new information, future events, a\nchange in our views or expectations or otherwise, except as required by federal securities laws.\n2\nInvestment Highlights\n• First Mover Potential: Currently pursuing FDA approval for patent\nprotected prescription erectile dysfunction therapy, STENDRA, for Over the\nCounter (OTC), nonprescription access\n• ED Market Opportunity: US ED Drug market estimated at $1.8B by\n20281, likely to be much higher with over-the-counter availability\n• Platform Opportunity: Emerging proprietary technology may be\napplied to Rx-to-OTC switch market estimated at $38.7 billion in 2023 and\nprojected to reach $66.5 billion by 20332\n• Experienced Management Team: With a proven track record in\npharmaceutical, OTC switch and Direct to Consumer (DTC) industry\nleading performances\n1.
