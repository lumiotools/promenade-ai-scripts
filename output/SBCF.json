Shaffer, Seacoast's Chairman and CEO, said, “As the complexity of our successful period of sequential acquisitions falls further in the rearview mirror, I was pleased with our focus on organic customer acquisition, which resulted in growth in noninterest-bearing accounts and strong annualized deposit growth of 8%. Over the past 24 months, we have focused on acquiring the best banking talent across Florida, and we are now seeing an accelerated return on that investment. The combination of strategic investments in talent, marketing, and innovative products is driving growth across our markets, and we are exiting the first quarter with robust pipelines across all of our businesses.”\n\nShaffer added, “We are well positioned at this point, with the completion of our expense initiative, fortress balance sheet with industry-leading capital levels, ample liquidity, and an incredibly engaged and excited banking team, we are primed to continue to take market share across one of the strongest markets in the country.”\n\n**Financial Results**\n\n**_Income Statement_**\n\n  * **Net income** in the first quarter of 2024 was $26.0 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to $29.5 million, or $0.35 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $11.8 million, or $0.15 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income1 for the first quarter of 2024 was $31.1 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to $31.4 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the prior quarter, and $23.7 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, for the prior year quarter.\n  * **Net revenues** were $125.6 million in the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of $2.6 million, or 2%, compared to the prior quarter, and a decrease of $28.0 million, or 18%, compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted net revenues1 were $125.6 million in the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of $5.2 million, or 4%, compared to the prior quarter, and a decrease of $26.0 million, or 17%, compared to the prior year quarter.\n  * **Pre-tax pre-provision earnings****1** were $35.7 million in the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of 15% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 and a decrease of 25% compared to the first quarter of 2023.

During the first quarter of 2024, higher interest expense on deposits reflects growth in deposit balances and the impact of the continuing elevated rate environment. Accretion on acquired loans totaled $10.6 million in the first quarter of 2024, $11.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, and $15.9 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n  * **Net interest margin** decreased 12 basis points to 3.24% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to 3.36% in the fourth quarter of 2023.

The effect on loan yields of accretion of purchase discounts on acquired loans was an increase of 42 basis points in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 45 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2023 and an increase of 69 basis points in the first quarter of 2023. Securities yields expanded five basis points to 3.47%, compared to 3.42% in the prior quarter. The cost of deposits increased 19 basis points, from 2.00% in the prior quarter, to 2.19% in the first quarter of 2024. The decline in margin quarter-over-quarter was driven in part by the success in growing deposits.\n  * **Noninterest income** totaled $20.5 million in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of $3.2 million, or 18%, compared to the prior quarter, and a decrease of $1.9 million, or 9%, compared to the prior year quarter. Changes compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 included: \n    * Interchange income decreased $0.5 million, or 22%, to $1.9 million, with the prior quarter benefiting from an annual volume-based incentive earned from the payment network provider.\n    * The wealth management division continues to demonstrate success in building relationships, and during the first quarter of 2024, assets under management grew $160 million, driving a $0.3 million or 9%, increase in wealth management income. The team enters the second quarter with a robust pipeline.\n    * Insurance agency income increased $0.2 million, or 21%, to $1.3 million, reflecting a record quarter for the agency.\n    * Other income increased $0.5 million, or 12%, to $5.2 million, with increases in marine and aircraft loan production sold, and in SBIC income.\n    * Net securities gains of $0.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 include gains of $4.1 million on the sale of the Company’s holdings of Visa Class B stock. This was largely offset by losses of $3.8 million on the sale of $86.8 million or 3% of the bank’s investment securities portfolio. The securities were reinvested at a yield of 5.53%, with an expected earnback on the trade of 1.9 years.\n  * The **provision for credit losses** was $1.4 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $4.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $31.6 million in the first quarter of 2023. The first quarter of 2023 included a $26.6 million day-one provision associated with a bank acquisition.\n  * **Noninterest expense** was $90.4 million in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of $4.0 million, or 5%, compared to the prior quarter, and a decrease of $17.1 million, or 16%, compared to the prior year quarter. Changes compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 included: \n    * Salaries and wages increased $1.9 million, or 5%, to $40.3 million, including $2.1 million in severance-related expenses arising from reductions in the workforce early in the first quarter of 2024.\n    * Employee benefits increased $1.2 million, or 18%, to $7.9 million, reflecting higher seasonal payroll taxes and 401(k) contributions.\n    * Outsourced data processing costs increased $3.5 million, or 41%, to $12.1 million and included $4.1 million in charges associated with contract terminations and modifications to consolidate systems, which will lead to lower ongoing operating expenses.\n    * Occupancy costs increased $0.5 million, or 7%, to $8.0 million in the first quarter of 2024 and included charges of $0.8 million associated with early lease terminations and consolidation of locations. Occupancy expenses will be lower going forward.\n    * Legal and professional fees decreased $1.1 million, or 35%, to $2.2 million, with the fourth quarter of 2023 impacted by one-time legal fees associated with a closed matter.\n  * Seacoast recorded $7.8 million of**income tax expense** in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $8.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, and $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2023. Tax expense related to stock-based compensation was nominal in the first quarter of 2024 and tax benefits related to stock-based compensation totaled $0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $0.2 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n  * The **efficiency ratio** was 66.78% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to 60.32% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 64.62% in the prior year quarter. The **adjusted efficiency ratio****1** was 61.13% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to 60.32% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 53.10% in the prior year quarter. The Company continues to remain keenly focused on disciplined expense control. The increase in the adjusted efficiency ratio in the first quarter of 2024 reflects the continued impact of higher deposit rates mitigated partially by disciplined expense management.\n\n\n\n**_Balance Sheet_**\n\n  * At March 31, 2024, the Company had **total assets** of $14.8 billion and **total** **shareholders' equity** of $2.1 billion. **Book value per share** was $24.93 as of March 31, 2024, compared to $24.84 as of December 31, 2023, and $24.24 as of March 31, 2023. **Tangible book value per share** increased to $15.26 as of March 31, 2024, compared to $15.08 as of December 31, 2023, and $14.25 as of March 31, 2023.\n  * **Debt securities** totaled $2.6 billion as of March 31, 2024, an increase of $103.0 million, or 4%, compared to December 31, 2023. Debt securities include approximately $1.9 billion in securities classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value. The unrealized loss on these securities is fully reflected in the value presented on the balance sheet. The portfolio also includes $669.9 million in securities classified as held to maturity with a fair value of $540.2 million. Held-to-maturity securities consist solely of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, each of which is expected to recover any price depreciation over its holding period as the debt securities move to maturity. The Company has significant liquidity and available borrowing capacity and has the intent and ability to hold these investments to maturity.\n  * **Loans** decreased $84.9 million from December 31, 2023, totaling $10.0 billion as of March 31, 2024. Loan originations were $368.3 million in the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of 23%, consistent with typical seasonality, compared to $477.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company continues to exercise a disciplined approach to lending, carefully underwriting loans to strict underwriting guidelines and setting high expectations for risk adjusted returns.\n  * **Loan pipelines** (loans in underwriting and approval or approved and not yet closed) totaled $572.9 million as of March 31, 2024, an increase of 46% from December 31, 2023, and an increase of 46% from March 31, 2023. \n    * Commercial pipelines were $498.6 million as of March 31, 2024, an increase of 63% from $306.5 million at December 31, 2023, and an increase of 72% from $289.2 million at March 31, 2023. The Company is benefiting from the investment made in recent years to attract talent from regional banks across its markets. This talent is onboarding significant new relationships, resulting in higher deposit growth and growing pipelines.\n    * SBA pipelines were $15.6 million as of March 31, 2024, a decrease of 24% from $20.6 million at December 31, 2023, and an increase of 90% from $8.2 million at March 31, 2023.\n    * Consumer pipelines were $25.1 million as of March 31, 2024, an increase of $6.3 million, or 34%, from $18.7 million at December 31, 2023, and a decrease of $13.7 million, or 35%, from $38.7 million at March 31, 2023.\n    * Residential saleable pipelines were $9.3 million as of March 31, 2024, an increase of 249% from $2.7 million at December 31, 2023, and an increase of 40% from $6.6 million at March 31, 2023. Retained residential pipelines were $24.4 million as of March 31, 2024, a decrease of 45% from $44.4 million at December 31, 2023, and a decrease of 50% from $48.4 million at March 31, 2023.\n  * **Total deposits** were $12.0 billion as of March 31, 2024, an increase of $238.9 million, or 8% annualized, when compared to December 31, 2023. Seacoast’s granular, longstanding deposit base is a hallmark of our franchise and serves as a significant source of strength. \n    * At March 31, 2024, transaction account balances represented 52% of overall deposits.\n    * Noninterest demand deposits represent 30% of overall deposits and grew $10.4 million from the prior quarter.\n    * The Company benefits from a granular deposit franchise, with the top ten depositors representing only 4% of total deposits.\n    * Average deposits per banking center were $156.0 million at March 31, 2024, an increase of 2% from the prior quarter.\n    * Uninsured deposits represented only 35% of overall deposit accounts as of March 31, 2024. This includes public funds under the Florida Qualified Public Depository program, which provides loss protection to depositors beyond FDIC insurance limits. Excluding such balances, the uninsured and uncollateralized deposits were 29% of total deposits. The Company has liquidity sources including cash and lines of credit with the Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank that represent 138% of uninsured deposits, and 164% of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits.\n    * Consumer deposits represent 42% of overall deposit funding with an average consumer customer balance of $25 thousand. Commercial deposits represent 58% of overall deposit funding with an average business customer balance of $110 thousand.\n  * Federal Home Loan Bank advances totaled $110.0 million at March 31, 2024 with a weighted average interest rate of 4.15%. In the aggregate, borrowed funds, including FHLB advances, long-term debt and brokered deposits represented only 2.8% of total liabilities as of March 31, 2024.\n\n\n\n**_Asset Quality_**\n\n  * **Nonperforming loans** were $77.2 million at March 31, 2024, an increase from $65.1 million at December 31, 2023, and $50.8 million at March 31, 2023. Nonperforming loans to total loans outstanding were 0.77% at March 31, 2024, 0.65% at December 31, 2023, and 0.50% at March 31, 2023.\n  * **Nonperforming assets to total assets** increased to 0.57% at March 31, 2024, compared to 0.50% at December 31, 2023, and 0.38% at March 31, 2023.\n  * **The** **ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans** was 1.47% at March 31, 2024, 1.48% at December 31, 2023, and 1.54% at March 31, 2023.\n  * **Net charge-offs** were $3.6 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $4.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $3.2 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n  * **Portfolio diversification** , in terms of asset mix, industry, and loan type, has been a critical element of the Company's lending strategy. Exposure across industries and collateral types is broadly distributed. Seacoast's average loan size is $332 thousand, and the average commercial loan size is $742 thousand, reflecting an ability to maintain granularity within the overall loan portfolio.\n  * **Constr****uction and land development** and **commercial real estate loans** remain well below regulatory guidance at 39% and 236% of total bank-level risk-based capital, respectively, compared to 48% and 244%, respectively, at December 31, 2023. On a consolidated basis, construction and land development and commercial real estate loans represent 36% and 222%, respectively, of total consolidated risk-based capital.\n\n\n\n**_Capital and Liquidity_**\n\n  * The Company continues to operate with a fortress balance sheet with a **Tier 1 capital ratio** at March 31, 2024 of 14.6% compared to 14.5% at December 31, 2023, and 13.4% at March 31, 2023. The **Total capital ratio** was 16.0%, the **Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio** was 14.0%, and the**Tier 1 leverage ratio** was 11.1% at March 31, 2024. The Company is considered “well capitalized” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements.\n  * **Cash and cash equivalents** at March 31, 2024 totaled $682.7 million.\n  * The Company’s **loan to deposit ratio** was 83.1% at March 31, 2024, which should provide liquidity and flexibility moving forward.\n  * **Tangible common equity to tangible assets** was 9.25% at March 31, 2024, compared to 9.31% at December 31, 2023, and 8.36% at March 31, 2023. If all held-to-maturity securities were adjusted to fair value, the tangible common equity ratio would have been 8.59%.\n  * At March 31, 2024, in addition to $682.7 million in cash, the Company had $5.1 billion in **available borrowing capacity** , including $4.4 billion in available collateralized lines of credit, $0.4 billion of unpledged debt securities available as collateral for potential additional borrowings, and available unsecured lines of credit of $0.3 billion.

These forward-looking statements may not be realized due to a variety of factors, including, without limitation: the impact of current and future economic and market conditions generally (including seasonality) and in the financial services industry, nationally and within Seacoast’s primary market areas, including the effects of inflationary pressures, changes in interest rates, slowdowns in economic growth, and the potential for high unemployment rates, as well as the financial stress on borrowers and changes to customer and client behavior and credit risk as a result of the foregoing;

changes in accounting policies, rules and practices; changes in retail distribution strategies, customer preferences and behavior generally and as a result of economic factors, including heightened inflation; changes in the availability and cost of credit and capital in the financial markets; changes in the prices, values and sales volumes of residential and commercial real estate, especially as they relate to the value of collateral supporting the Company’s loans;

the risks that deferred tax assets could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income from the Company’s operations and tax planning strategies are less than currently estimated, the results of tax audit findings, challenges to our tax positions, or adverse changes or interpretations of tax laws; the effects of competition from other commercial banks, thrifts, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, credit unions, non-bank financial technology providers, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market and other mutual funds and other financial institutions; the failure of assumptions underlying the establishment of reserves for expected credit losses; risks related to, and the costs associated with, environmental, social and governance matters, including the scope and pace of related rulemaking activity and disclosure requirements;

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of the Company’s performance and believes these presentations provide useful supplemental information, and a clearer understanding of the Company’s performance. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures enhance investors’ understanding of the Company’s business and performance and if not provided would be requested by the investor community. These measures are also useful in understanding performance trends and facilitate comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. The limitations associated with operating measures are the risk that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items comprising these measures and that different companies might define or calculate these measures differently. The Company provides reconciliations between GAAP and these non-GAAP measures. These disclosures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP.  \n  \n**GAAP TO NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION**| (Unaudited)  \n---|---  \n_SEACOAST BANKING CORPORATION OF FLORIDA AND SUBSIDIARIES_

Seacoast’s ability to maintain\nadequate internal controls over financial reporting; potential claims, damages, penalties, fines, costs and\nreputational damage resulting from pending or future litigation, regulatory proceedings and enforcement actions;\nthe risks that deferred tax assets could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income from the Company’s\noperations and tax planning strategies are less than currently estimated, the results of tax audit findings, challenges\nto our tax positions, or adverse changes or interpretations of tax laws; the effects of competition from other\ncommercial banks, thrifts, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, credit unions, non-bank financial\ntechnology providers, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market and other mutual funds and\nother financial institutions; the failure of assumptions underlying the establishment of reserves for expected credit\nlosses; risks related to, and the costs associated with, environmental, social and governance matters, including the\nscope and pace of related rulemaking activity and disclosure requirements;

Management uses these non-\nGAAP financial measures in its analysis of the Company’s performance and believes these presentations provide useful supplemental information, and a clearer\nunderstanding of the Company’s performance. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures enhance investors’ understanding of the Company’s business and\nperformance and if not provided would be requested by the investor community. These measures are also useful in understanding performance trends and facilitate\ncomparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. The limitations associated with operating measures are the risk that persons might disagree as to the\nappropriateness of items comprising these measures and that different companies might define or calculate these measures differently. The Company provides reconciliations\nbetween GAAP and these non-GAAP measures. These disclosures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP.\nGAAP TO NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION (Unaudited)\nSEACOAST BANKING CORPORATION OF FLORIDA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nQuarterly Trends\n(Amounts in

10/24/2024 4:49 PM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\n**Strong Growth in Loans and Deposits**\n\n**Annualized****20%****Increase in Tangible Book Value Per Share**\n\n**Well-Positioned Balance Sheet with Strong Capital and Liquidity**\n\nSTUART, Fla., Oct. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Seacoast Banking Corporation of Florida (\"Seacoast\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: SBCF) today reported net income in the third quarter of 2024 of $30.7 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to $30.2 million, or $0.36 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2024 and $31.4 million, or $0.37 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nPre-tax pre-provision earnings1 were $46.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 3% compared to the second quarter of 2024 and an increase of 6% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted pre-tax pre-provision earnings1 were $46.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 4% compared to the second quarter of 2024 and a decrease of 2% compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, return on average tangible assets was 0.99% and return on average tangible shareholders' equity was 10.31%, compared to 1.00% and 10.75%, respectively, in the prior quarter, and 1.04% and 11.90%, respectively, in the prior year quarter.\n\nCharles M. Shaffer, Chairman and CEO of Seacoast, stated, \"I would like to thank all of the Seacoast associates for their unwavering dedication during the challenging impact of back-to-back significant hurricanes. Your commitment to our customers and the well-being of our communities is commendable. I am very proud to serve alongside such an amazing and dedicated group of bankers. Furthermore, our hearts and sympathy go out to all those in our communities who lost loved ones and experienced catastrophic outcomes as a result of the storms.\"\n\nShaffer added, \"Turning to third quarter results, this marks the turn in organic growth we had anticipated, with nearly 7% annualized loan growth and 7% annualized customer deposit growth, clearly showcasing the results of our previous investments in banking teams across the state. Additionally, this quarter demonstrated continued growth in net interest income, noninterest income and, when removing accretion on acquired loans, expansion in the net interest margin. Our competitive transformation is taking shape as we build Seacoast into Florida’s leading regional bank. We expect to continue to see positive results from recent talent acquisitions, which will drive further organic growth in the coming periods.\"\n\nShaffer concluded, \"We remain committed to a disciplined approach to credit, and our balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry, with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 14.8%2 as of September 30, 2024. The ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets has increased to a strong 9.64%. Our liquidity position is also robust, with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 83%, providing us with balance sheet flexibility as we continue to work towards stronger earnings in the coming periods.\"\n\n**Update on Hurricane Recovery**\n\nIn late September and early October 2024, communities across our corporate footprint were impacted by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. We maintained uninterrupted digital and telephone access for our customers and, having experienced minimal impacts to our branch properties, we fully reopened to serve our communities shortly after each storm passed. Recovery efforts in many areas continue and the full impacts on people and businesses in the most hard-hit regions are not fully known. We do not expect a significant impact from Hurricane Helene, but an additional provision for credit losses may be warranted in the fourth quarter of 2024 for Hurricane Milton, in a range between approximately $5 million and $10 million.\n\n**Financial Results**\n\n**_Income Statement_**\n\n  * **Net income** in the third quarter of 2024 was $30.7 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to $30.2 million, or $0.36 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $31.4 million, or $0.37 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income was $86.9 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, compared to $74.5 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted net income1 for the third quarter of 2024 was $30.5 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to $30.3 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the prior quarter, and $34.2 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the prior year quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, adjusted net income1 was $91.9 million, or $1.08 per diluted share, compared to $101.9 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * **Net revenues** were $130.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $3.7 million, or 3%, compared to the prior quarter, and a decrease of $6.8 million, or 5%, compared to the prior year quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net revenues were $382.5 million, a decrease of $56.7 million, or 13%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted net revenues1 were $130.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $3.6 million, or 3%, compared to the prior quarter, and a decrease of $7.2 million, or 5%, compared to the prior year quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, adjusted net revenues1 were $382.9 million, a decrease of $55.2 million, or 13%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * **Pre-tax pre-provision earnings****1** were $46.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.5 million, or 3%, compared to the second quarter of 2024 and an increase of $2.7 million, or 6%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, pre-tax pre-provision earnings1 were $126.3 million, a decrease of $5.5 million, or 4%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted pre-tax pre-provision earnings1 were $46.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.9 million, or 4%, compared to the second quarter of 2024 and a decrease of $1.0 million, or 2%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, adjusted pre-tax pre-provision earnings1 were $133.4 million, a decrease of $35.5 million, or 21%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * **Net interest income** totaled $106.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.2 million, or 2%, compared to the prior quarter, and a decrease of $12.6 million, or 11%, compared to the prior year quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income was $316.2 million, a decrease of $61.3 million, or 16%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In the loan portfolio, higher interest income from new loan production was partially offset by lower accretion of purchase discount on acquired loans. Included in loan interest income was accretion on acquired loans of $9.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, $10.2 million in the second quarter of 2024, and $14.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, accretion on acquired loans totaled $30.0 million, compared to $45.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Recent purchases in the securities portfolio contributed to higher securities yields. Higher interest expense on deposits reflects the impact of higher rates, with cuts to the federal funds rate late in the quarter not yet fully impacting the third quarter 2024 results.\n  * **Net interest margin** decreased one basis point to 3.17% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.18% in the second quarter of 2024. Excluding the effects of accretion on acquired loans, net interest margin increased three basis points to 2.90% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.87% in the second quarter of 2024. Loan yields were 5.94%, an increase of one basis point from the prior quarter. Securities yields increased six basis points to 3.75%, compared to 3.69% in the prior quarter. The cost of deposits increased three basis points from 2.31% in the prior quarter, to 2.34% in the third quarter of 2024. We expect the cost of deposits to decline in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n  * **Noninterest income** totaled $23.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.5 million, or 7%, compared to the prior quarter, and an increase of $5.9 million, or 33%, compared to the prior year quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest income totaled $66.4 million, an increase of $4.5 million, or 7%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Results in the third quarter of 2024 included: \n    * Service charges on deposits totaled $5.4 million, an increase of $0.1 million, or 1%, from the prior quarter and an increase of $0.8 million, or 16%, from the prior year quarter. Our investments in talent and significant market expansion across the state have resulted in continued growth in treasury management services to commercial customers.\n    * Wealth management income totaled $3.8 million, an increase of $0.1 million, or 2%, from the prior quarter and an increase of $0.7 million, or 22%, from the prior year quarter. The wealth management division continues to grow and add new relationships, with assets under management increasing 26% year over year to $2.0 billion at September 30, 2024.\n    * Insurance agency income totaled $1.4 million, an increase of 3% from the prior quarter and an increase of 18% from the prior year quarter, reflecting continued growth and expansion of services.\n    * SBA gains totaled $0.4 million, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 44%, from the prior quarter and a decrease of $0.2 million, or 36%, from the prior year quarter, due to lower saleable originations.\n    * Other income totaled $7.5 million, an increase of $1.5 million, or 26%, from the prior quarter and an increase of $3.2 million, or 74% from the prior year quarter. Increases in the third quarter of 2024 include gains on SBIC investments and higher swap-related fees.\n  * The **provision for credit losses** was $6.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $4.9 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Noninterest expense** was $84.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.3 million, or 3%, compared to the prior quarter, and a decrease of $9.1 million, or 10%, compared to the prior year quarter. Noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled $257.7 million, a decrease of $51.5 million, or 17%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. With significant cost-saving initiatives now complete, Seacoast has prudently managed expenses while strategically investing to support continued growth. Results in the third quarter of 2024 included: \n    * Salaries and wages totaled $40.7 million, an increase of $1.8 million, or 5%, compared to the prior quarter and a decrease $5.7 million, or 12%, from the prior year quarter. The third quarter of 2024 reflects continued additions to the banking team as the Company focuses on organic growth.\n    * Outsourced data processing costs totaled $8.0 million, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 3%, compared to the prior quarter and a decrease of $0.7 million, or 8%, from the prior year quarter, reflecting the benefit of lower negotiated rates with key service providers.\n    * Marketing expenses totaled $2.7 million, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 16%, compared to the prior quarter and an increase of $0.9 million, or 45%, from the prior year quarter, primarily associated with the timing of various campaigns. We will continue to invest in marketing and branding supporting customer growth.\n    * Legal and professional fees totaled $2.7 million, an increase of $0.7 million, or 37%, compared to the prior quarter and an increase of $29 thousand, or 1%, from the prior year quarter. Professional services engaged in connection with contract negotiations contributed to the increase in the third quarter of 2024.\n  * Seacoast recorded $8.6 million of**income tax expense** in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $8.9 million in the second quarter of 2024, and $9.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. Tax benefits related to stock-based compensation totaled $0.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to tax expense of $0.2 million in the second quarter of 2024 and a nominal tax benefit in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * The **efficiency ratio** was 59.84% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 60.21% in the second quarter of 2024 and 62.60% in the prior year quarter. The **adjusted efficiency ratio****1** was 59.84% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 60.21% in the second quarter of 2024 and 60.19% in the prior year quarter. The Company continues to remain keenly focused on disciplined expense control, while making investments for growth.\n\n\n\n**_Balance Sheet_**\n\n  * At September 30, 2024, the Company had **total assets** of $15.2 billion and **total** **shareholders' equity** of $2.2 billion. **Book value per share** was $25.68 as of September 30, 2024, compared to $24.98 as of June 30, 2024, and $24.06 as of September 30, 2023. **Tangible book value per share** increased 20% annualized from the prior quarter to $16.20 as of September 30, 2024, compared to $15.41 as of June 30, 2024, and $14.26 as of September 30, 2023.\n  * **Debt securities** totaled $2.8 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $180.8 million compared to June 30, 2024. Debt securities include approximately $2.2 billion in securities classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value. \n    * During the third quarter of 2024, net unrealized losses associated with available for sale securities declined by $59.6 million due to changes in the interest rate environment. This contributed $0.53 to the increase in tangible book value per share during the quarter. The unrealized loss on available for sale securities is fully reflected in the value presented on the balance sheet.\n    * The portfolio also includes $646.1 million in securities classified as held to maturity with a fair value of $538.5 million. Held-to-maturity securities consist solely of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, each of which is expected to recover any price depreciation over its holding period as the debt securities move to maturity. The Company has significant liquidity and available borrowing capacity and has the intent and ability to hold these investments to maturity.\n    * In October, we took advantage of favorable market conditions and repositioned a portion of the available for sale securities portfolio. We sold securities with an average book yield of 2.8%, resulting in a pre-tax loss of approximately $8.0 million impacting fourth quarter results. The proceeds, approximately $113 million, were reinvested in agency mortgage-backed securities with an average book yield of 5.4%, for an estimated earnback of less than three years.\n  * **Loans** increased $166.8 million, or 6.6% annualized, totaling $10.2 billion as of September 30, 2024. Loan originations increased 22% to $657.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $538.0 million in the second quarter of 2024. The Company continues to exercise a disciplined approach to lending and is benefiting from the investments made in recent years to attract talent from large regional banks across its markets. This talent is onboarding significant new relationships, resulting in increased loan production.\n  * **Loan pipelines** (loans in underwriting and approval or approved and not yet closed) totaled $831.1 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $834.4 million at June 30, 2024 and $353.0 million at September 30, 2023. \n    * Commercial pipelines were $744.5 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $743.8 million at June 30, 2024, and $259.4 million at September 30, 2023.\n    * SBA pipelines were $28.9 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $29.3 million at June 30, 2024, and $41.4 million at September 30, 2023.\n    * Residential saleable pipelines were $11.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $12.1 million at June 30, 2024, and $6.8 million at September 30, 2023. Retained residential pipelines were $21.9 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $24.7 million at June 30, 2024, and $20.9 million at September 30, 2023.\n    * Consumer pipelines were $24.4 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $24.5 million at both June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\n  * **Total deposits** were $12.2 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $127.5 million, or 4.2% annualized, when compared to June 30, 2024. Excluding brokered balances, total deposits increased $195.9 million, or 6.6% annualized, in the third quarter of 2024. \n    * Commercial deposits increased $133.0 million, or 2%, compared to the prior quarter. Of note, commercial noninterest bearing deposits increased $67.2 million, or 3%, from the prior quarter, the result of onboarding new clients.\n    * Total noninterest bearing deposits increased $45.5 million, or 5.3% annualized, from the prior quarter.\n    * At September 30, 2024, customer transaction account balances represented 49% of total deposits.\n    * The Company benefits from a granular deposit franchise, with the top ten depositors representing approximately 3% of total deposits.\n    * Average deposits per banking center were $159 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $157 million at June 30, 2024.\n    * Uninsured deposits represented only 36% of overall deposit accounts as of September 30, 2024. This includes public funds under the Florida Qualified Public Depository program, which provides loss protection to depositors beyond FDIC insurance limits. Excluding such balances, the uninsured and uncollateralized deposits were 31% of total deposits. The Company has liquidity sources including cash and lines of credit with the Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank that represent 145% of uninsured deposits, and 167% of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits.\n    * Consumer deposits represent 43% of overall deposit funding with an average consumer customer balance of $26 thousand. Commercial deposits represent 57% of overall deposit funding with an average business customer balance of $117 thousand.\n  * **Federal****Home Loan Bank advances** totaled $245.0 million at September 30, 2024 with a weighted average interest rate of 4.19%.\n\n\n\n**_Asset Quality_**\n\n  * **Nonperforming loans** were $80.9 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $59.9 million at June 30, 2024, and $41.5 million at September 30, 2023. New nonperforming loans in the third quarter of 2024 have collateral values well in excess of balances outstanding, and therefore, no loss is expected. Nonperforming loans to total loans outstanding were 0.79% at September 30, 2024, 0.60% at June 30, 2024, and 0.41% at September 30, 2023.\n  * **Accruing past due loans** were $50.7 million, or 0.50% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to $39.6 million, or 0.39% of total loans, at June 30, 2024, and $35.5 million, or 0.33% of total loans, at September 30, 2023. A limited number of larger-balance residential mortgage loans, which returned to current status in October, comprise the majority of the increase from the prior quarter.\n  * **Nonperforming assets to total assets** were 0.58% at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.45% at June 30, 2024, and 0.33% at September 30, 2023.\n  * **The** **ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans** was 1.38% at September 30, 2024, 1.41% at June 30, 2024, and 1.49% at September 30, 2023.\n  * **Net charge-offs** were $7.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $9.9 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $12.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Charge-offs during the quarter primarily reflect specifically identified reserves previously established in the allowance for credit losses.\n  * **Portfolio diversification** , in terms of asset mix, industry, and loan type, has been a critical element of the Company's lending strategy. Exposure across industries and collateral types is broadly distributed. Seacoast's average loan size is $360 thousand, and the average commercial loan size is $789 thousand, reflecting an ability to maintain granularity within the overall loan portfolio.\n  * **Constr****uction and land development** and **commercial real estate loans** remain well below regulatory guidance at 36% and 241% of total bank-level risk-based capital2, respectively, compared to 36% and 235%, respectively, at June 30, 2024. On a consolidated basis, construction and land development and commercial real estate loans represent 34% and 227%, respectively, of total consolidated risk-based capital2.\n\n\n\n**_Capital and Liquidity_**\n\n  * The Company continues to operate with a fortress balance sheet with a **Tier 1 capital ratio** at September 30, 2024 of 14.8%2 compared to 14.8% at June 30, 2024, and 14.0% at September 30, 2023. The **Total capital ratio** was 16.2%2, the **Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio** was 14.1%2, and the**Tier 1 leverage ratio** was 11.2%2 at September 30, 2024. The Company is considered “well capitalized” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements.\n  * **Cash and cash equivalents** at September 30, 2024 totaled $637.1 million.\n  * The Company’s **loan to deposit ratio** was 83.4% at September 30, 2024, which should provide liquidity and flexibility moving forward.\n  * **Tangible common equity to tangible assets** was 9.64% at September 30, 2024, compared to 9.30% at June 30, 2024, and 8.68% at September 30, 2023. If all held-to-maturity securities were adjusted to fair value, the tangible common equity ratio would have been 9.11% at September 30, 2024.\n  * At September 30, 2024, in addition to $637.1 million in cash, the Company had $5.6 billion in **available borrowing capacity** , including $4.1 billion in available collateralized lines of credit, $1.2 billion of unpledged debt securities available as collateral for potential additional borrowings, and available unsecured lines of credit of $0.3 billion. These liquidity sources as of September 30, 2024, represented 167% of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits.\n\n\n\n_1_ _Non-GAAP measure, see “Explanation of Certain Unaudited Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for more information and for a reconciliation to GAAP.__2_ _Estimated._\n\n**FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**  \n---  \n(Amounts in thousands except per share data)| (Unaudited)  \nQuarterly Trends  \n**3Q'24**|  2Q'24| 1Q'24| 4Q'23| 3Q'23  \nSelected balance sheet data:  \nGross loans| **$**| **10,205,281**|  $| 10,038,508| $| 9,978,052| $| 10,062,940| $| 10,011,186  \nTotal deposits| **12,243,585**|  12,116,118| 12,015,840| 11,776,935| 12,107,834  \nTotal assets| **15,168,371**|  14,952,613| 14,830,015| 14,580,249| 14,823,007  \nPerformance measures:  \nNet income| **$**| **30,651**|  $| 30,244| $| 26,006| $| 29,543| $| 31,414  \nNet interest margin| **3.17**| **%**|  3.18| %| 3.24| %| 3.36| %| 3.57| %  \nPre-tax pre-provision earnings1| **$**| **46,086**|  $| 44,555| $| 35,674| $| 42,006| $| 43,383  \nAverage diluted shares outstanding| **85,069**|  84,816| 85,270| 85,336| 85,666  \nDiluted earnings per share (EPS)| **0.36**|  0.36| 0.31| 0.35| 0.37  \nReturn on (annualized):  \nAverage assets (ROA)| **0.81**| **%**|  0.82| %| 0.71| %| 0.80| %| 0.84| %  \nAverage tangible assets (ROTA)2| **0.99**|  1.00| 0.89| 0.99| 1.04  \nAverage tangible common equity (ROTCE)2| **10.31**|  10.75| 9.55| 11.22| 11.90  \nTangible common equity to tangible assets2| **9.64**|  9.30| 9.25| 9.31| 8.68  \nTangible book value per share2| **$**| **16.20**|  $| 15.41| $| 15.26| $| 15.08| $| 14.26  \nEfficiency ratio| **59.84**| **%**|  60.21| %| 66.78| %| 60.32| %| 62.60| %  \nAdjusted operating measures1:  \nAdjusted net income4| **$**| **30,511**|  $| 30,277| $| 31,132| $| 31,363| $| 34,170  \nAdjusted pre-tax pre-provision earnings4| **46,390**|  44,490| 42,513| 45,016| 47,349  \nAdjusted diluted EPS4| **0.36**|  0.36| 0.37| 0.37| 0.40  \nAdjusted ROTA2| **0.98**| **%**|  1.00| %| 1.04| %| 1.04| %| 1.12| %  \nAdjusted ROTCE2| **10.27**|  10.76| 11.15| 11.80| 12.79  \nAdjusted efficiency ratio| **59.84**|  60.21| 61.13| 60.32| 60.19  \nNet adjusted noninterest expense as a percent of average tangible assets2| **2.19**| **%**|  2.19| %| 2.23| %| 2.25| %| 2.34| %  \nOther data:  \nMarket capitalization3| **$**| **2,277,003**|  $| 2,016,472| $| 2,156,529| $| 2,415,158| $| 1,869,891  \nFull-time equivalent employees| **1,493**|  1,449| 1,445| 1,541| 1,570  \nNumber of ATMs| **96**|  95| 95| 96| 97  \nFull-service banking offices| **77**|  77| 77| 77| 77  \n _1_ _Non-GAAP measure, see “Explanation of Certain Unaudited Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for more information and a reconciliation to GAAP._  \n_2_ _The Company defines tangible assets as total assets less intangible assets, and tangible common equity as total shareholders' equity less intangible assets._  \n_3_ _Common shares outstanding multiplied by closing bid price on last day of each period._  \n_4_ _As of 1Q’24, amortization of intangibles is excluded from adjustments to noninterest expense; prior periods have been updated to reflect the change._  \n  \n**OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nSeacoast will host a conference call October 25, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) to discuss the third quarter of 2024 earnings results and business trends.

These forward-looking statements may not be realized due to a variety of factors, including, without limitation: the impact of current and future economic and market conditions generally (including seasonality) and in the financial services industry, nationally and within Seacoast’s primary market areas, including the effects of inflationary pressures, changes in interest rates, slowdowns in economic growth, and the potential for high unemployment rates, as well as the financial stress on borrowers and changes to customer and client behavior and credit risk as a result of the foregoing;

changes in accounting policies, rules and practices; changes in retail distribution strategies, customer preferences and behavior generally and as a result of economic factors, including heightened inflation; changes in the availability and cost of credit and capital in the financial markets; changes in the prices, values and sales volumes of residential and commercial real estate, especially as they relate to the value of collateral supporting the Company’s loans;

inaccuracies or other failures from the use of models, including the failure of assumptions and estimates, as well as differences in, and changes to, economic, market and credit conditions; the impact on the valuation of Seacoast’s investments due to market volatility or counterparty payment risk, as well as the effect of a decline in stock market prices on our fee income from our wealth management business; statutory and regulatory dividend restrictions; increases in regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations generally; the risks of mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, including Seacoast’s ability to continue to identify acquisition targets, successfully acquire and integrate desirable financial institutions and realize expected revenues and revenue synergies; changes in technology or products that may be more difficult, costly, or less effective than anticipated; the Company’s ability to identify and address increased cybersecurity risks, including those impacting vendors and other third parties which may be exacerbated by developments in generative artificial intelligence;

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of the Company’s performance and believes these presentations provide useful supplemental information, and a clearer understanding of the Company’s performance. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures enhance investors’ understanding of the Company’s business and performance and if not provided would be requested by the investor community. These measures are also useful in understanding performance trends and facilitate comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. The limitations associated with operating measures are the risk that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items comprising these measures and that different companies might define or calculate these measures differently. The Company provides reconciliations between GAAP and these non-GAAP measures. These disclosures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. \n\n**GAAP TO NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION**| (Unaudited)  \n---|---  \n_SEACOAST BANKING CORPORATION OF FLORIDA AND SUBSIDIARIES_

Adjusted pre-tax pre-provision\nearnings1 were $46.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 4% compared to the second quarter of 2024\nand a decrease of 2% compared to the third quarter of 2023.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, return on average tangible assets was 0.99% and return on average tangible\nshareholders' equity was 10.31%, compared to 1.00% and 10.75%, respectively, in the prior quarter, and 1.04% and\n11.90%, respectively, in the prior year quarter.\nCharles M. Shaffer, Chairman and CEO of Seacoast, stated, \"I would like to thank all of the Seacoast associates for\ntheir unwavering dedication during the challenging impact of back-to-back significant hurricanes. Your commitment\nto our customers and the well-being of our communities is commendable. I am very proud to serve alongside such\nan amazing and dedicated group of bankers. Furthermore, our hearts and sympathy go out to all those in our\ncommunities who lost loved ones and experienced catastrophic outcomes as a result of the storms.\"\nShaffer added, \"Turning to third quarter results, this marks the turn in organic growth we had anticipated, with\nnearly 7% annualized loan growth and 7% annualized customer deposit growth, clearly showcasing the results of\nour previous investments in banking teams across the state. Additionally, this quarter demonstrated continued\ngrowth in net interest income, noninterest income and, when removing accretion on acquired loans, expansion in the\nnet interest margin. Our competitive transformation is taking shape as we build Seacoast into Florida’s leading\nregional bank. We expect to continue to see positive results from recent talent acquisitions, which will drive further\norganic growth in the coming periods.\"\nShaffer concluded, \"We remain committed to a disciplined approach to credit, and our balance sheet is one of the\nstrongest in the industry, with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 14.8%2 as of September 30, 2024. The ratio of tangible\ncommon equity to tangible assets has increased to a strong 9.64%. Our liquidity position is also robust, with a loan-\nto-deposit ratio of 83%, providing us with balance sheet flexibility as we continue to work towards stronger earnings\nin the coming periods.\"\nUpdate on Hurricane Recovery\nIn late September and early October 2024, communities across our corporate footprint were impacted by Hurricanes\nHelene and Milton. We maintained uninterrupted digital and telephone access for our customers and, having\nexperienced minimal impacts to our branch properties, we fully reopened to serve our communities shortly after\neach storm passed. Recovery efforts in many areas continue and the full impacts on people and businesses in the\nmost hard-hit regions are not fully known. We do not expect a significant impact from Hurricane Helene, but an\nadditional provision for credit losses may be warranted in the fourth quarter of 2024 for Hurricane Milton, in a range\nbetween approximately $5 million and $10 million.\n1Non-GAAP measure, see “Explanation of Certain Unaudited Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for more information and for a\nreconciliation to GAAP.\n2Estimated.\nFinancial Results\nIncome Statement\n• Net income in the third quarter of 2024 was $30.7 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to $30.2\nmillion, or $0.36 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $31.4 million, or $0.37 per diluted share in the prior\nyear quarter.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, adjusted net income1 was $91.9 million,\nor $1.08 per diluted share, compared to $101.9 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\n• Net revenues were $130.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $3.7 million, or 3%, compared to\nthe prior quarter, and a decrease of $6.8 million, or 5%, compared to the prior year quarter.

Adjusted\npre-tax pre-provision earnings1 were $46.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.9 million, or\n4%, compared to the second quarter of 2024 and a decrease of $1.0 million, or 2%, compared to the third\nquarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, adjusted pre-tax pre-provision earnings1 were\n$133.4 million, a decrease of $35.5 million, or 21%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n• Net interest income totaled $106.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.2 million, or 2%,\ncompared to the prior quarter, and a decrease of $12.6 million, or 11%, compared to the prior year quarter.

In the loan portfolio, higher interest income\nfrom new loan production was partially offset by lower accretion of purchase discount on acquired loans.\nIncluded in loan interest income was accretion on acquired loans of $9.2 million in the third quarter of 2024,\n$10.2 million in the second quarter of 2024, and $14.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, accretion on acquired loans totaled $30.0 million, compared to $45.4 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. Recent purchases in the securities portfolio contributed to higher\nsecurities yields. Higher interest expense on deposits reflects the impact of higher rates, with cuts to the federal\nfunds rate late in the quarter not yet fully impacting the third quarter 2024 results.\n• Net interest margin decreased one basis point to 3.17% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.18% in the\nsecond quarter of 2024.

Tangible book value per share increased 20% annualized from the prior\nquarter to $16.20 as of September 30, 2024, compared to $15.41 as of June 30, 2024, and $14.26 as of\nSeptember 30, 2023.\n• Debt securities totaled $2.8 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $180.8 million compared to June\n30, 2024. Debt securities include approximately $2.2 billion in securities classified as available for sale and\nrecorded at fair value.\n• During the third quarter of 2024, net unrealized losses associated with available for sale securities\ndeclined by $59.6 million due to changes in the interest rate environment. This contributed $0.53 to the\nincrease in tangible book value per share during the quarter. The unrealized loss on available for sale\nsecurities is fully reflected in the value presented on the balance sheet.\n• The portfolio also includes $646.1 million in securities classified as held to maturity with a fair value\nof $538.5 million. Held-to-maturity securities consist solely of mortgage-backed securities and\ncollateralized mortgage obligations guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, each of which is\nexpected to recover any price depreciation over its holding period as the debt securities move to\nmaturity. The Company has significant liquidity and available borrowing capacity and has the intent\nand ability to hold these investments to maturity.\n• In October, we took advantage of favorable market conditions and repositioned a portion of the\navailable for sale securities portfolio. We sold securities with an average book yield of 2.8%, resulting\nin a pre-tax loss of approximately $8.0 million impacting fourth quarter results. The proceeds,\napproximately $113 million, were reinvested in agency mortgage-backed securities with an average\nbook yield of 5.4%, for an estimated earnback of less than three years.\n• Loans increased $166.8 million, or 6.6% annualized, totaling $10.2 billion as of September 30, 2024. Loan\noriginations increased 22% to $657.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $538.0 million in the\nsecond quarter of 2024. The Company continues to exercise a disciplined approach to lending and is benefiting\nfrom the investments made in recent years to attract talent from large regional banks across its markets. This\ntalent is onboarding significant new relationships, resulting in increased loan production.\n• Loan pipelines (loans in underwriting and approval or approved and not yet closed) totaled $831.1 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to $834.4 million at June 30, 2024 and $353.0 million at September 30, 2023.\n• Commercial pipelines were $744.5 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $743.8 million at\nJune 30, 2024, and $259.4 million at September 30, 2023.\n• SBA pipelines were $28.9 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $29.3 million at June 30,\n2024, and $41.4 million at September 30, 2023.\n• Residential saleable pipelines were $11.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $12.1 million\nat June 30, 2024, and $6.8 million at September 30, 2023. Retained residential pipelines were $21.9\nmillion as of September 30, 2024, compared to $24.7 million at June 30, 2024, and $20.9 million at\nSeptember 30, 2023.\n• Consumer pipelines were $24.4 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $24.5 million at both\nJune 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\n• Total deposits were $12.2 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $127.5 million, or 4.2% annualized,\nwhen compared to June 30, 2024. Excluding brokered balances, total deposits increased $195.9 million, or 6.6%\nannualized, in the third quarter of 2024.\n• Commercial deposits increased $133.0 million, or 2%, compared to the prior quarter. Of note,\ncommercial noninterest bearing deposits increased $67.2 million, or 3%, from the prior quarter, the\nresult of onboarding new clients.\n1Non-GAAP measure, see “Explanation of Certain Unaudited Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for more information and for a\nreconciliation to GAAP.\n• Total noninterest bearing deposits increased $45.5 million, or 5.3% annualized, from the prior quarter.\n• At September 30, 2024, customer transaction account balances represented 49% of total deposits.\n• The Company benefits from a granular deposit franchise, with the top ten depositors representing\napproximately 3% of total deposits.\n• Average deposits per banking center were $159 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $157\nmillion at June 30, 2024.\n• Uninsured deposits represented only 36% of overall deposit accounts as of September 30, 2024. This\nincludes public funds under the Florida Qualified Public Depository program, which provides loss\nprotection to depositors beyond FDIC insurance limits. Excluding such balances, the uninsured and\nuncollateralized deposits were 31% of total deposits. The Company has liquidity sources including\ncash and lines of credit with the Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank that represent 145% of\nuninsured deposits, and 167% of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits.\n• Consumer deposits represent 43% of overall deposit funding with an average consumer customer\nbalance of $26 thousand. Commercial deposits represent 57% of overall deposit funding with an\naverage business customer balance of $117 thousand.\n• Federal Home Loan Bank advances totaled $245.0 million at September 30, 2024 with a weighted average\ninterest rate of 4.19%.\nAsset Quality\n• Nonperforming loans were $80.9 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $59.9 million at June 30, 2024,\nand $41.5 million at September 30, 2023. New nonperforming loans in the third quarter of 2024 have collateral\nvalues well in excess of balances outstanding, and therefore, no loss is expected. Nonperforming loans to total\nloans outstanding were 0.79% at September 30, 2024, 0.60% at June 30, 2024, and 0.41% at September 30,\n2023.\n• Accruing past due loans were $50.7 million, or 0.50% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to\n$39.6 million, or 0.39% of total loans, at June 30, 2024, and $35.5 million, or 0.33% of total loans, at\nSeptember 30, 2023. A limited number of larger-balance residential mortgage loans, which returned to current\nstatus in October, comprise the majority of the increase from the prior quarter.\n• Nonperforming assets to total assets were 0.58% at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.45% at June 30, 2024,\nand 0.33% at September 30, 2023.\n• The ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.38% at September 30, 2024, 1.41% at June 30,\n2024, and 1.49% at September 30, 2023.\n• Net charge-offs were $7.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $9.9 million in the second quarter\nof 2024 and $12.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Charge-offs during the quarter primarily reflect\nspecifically identified reserves previously established in the allowance for credit losses.\n• Portfolio diversification, in terms of asset mix, industry, and loan type, has been a critical element of the\nCompany's lending strategy. Exposure across industries and collateral types is broadly distributed. Seacoast's\naverage loan size is $360 thousand, and the average commercial loan size is $789 thousand, reflecting an ability\nto maintain granularity within the overall loan portfolio.\n• Construction and land development and commercial real estate loans remain well below regulatory\nguidance at 36% and 241% of total bank-level risk-based capital2, respectively, compared to 36% and 235%,\nrespectively, at June 30, 2024. On a consolidated basis, construction and land development and commercial real\nestate loans represent 34% and 227%, respectively, of total consolidated risk-based capital2.\n1Non-GAAP measure, see “Explanation of Certain Unaudited Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for more information and for a\nreconciliation to GAAP.\n2Estimated.\nCapital and Liquidity\n• The Company continues to operate with a fortress balance sheet with a Tier 1 capital ratio at September 30,\n2024 of 14.8%2 compared to 14.8% at June 30, 2024, and 14.0% at September 30, 2023. The Total capital\nratio was 16.2%2, the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.1%2, and the Tier 1 leverage ratio was\n11.2%2 at September 30, 2024. The Company is considered “well capitalized” based on applicable U.S.\nregulatory capital ratio requirements.\n• Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 totaled $637.1 million.\n• The Company’s loan to deposit ratio was 83.4% at September 30, 2024, which should provide liquidity and\nflexibility moving forward.\n• Tangible common equity to tangible assets was 9.64% at September 30, 2024, compared to 9.30% at June 30,\n2024, and 8.68% at September 30, 2023. If all held-to-maturity securities were adjusted to fair value, the\ntangible common equity ratio would have been 9.11% at September 30, 2024.\n• At September 30, 2024, in addition to $637.1 million in cash, the Company had $5.6 billion in available\nborrowing capacity, including $4.1 billion in available collateralized lines of credit, $1.2 billion of unpledged\ndebt securities available as collateral for potential additional borrowings, and available unsecured lines of credit\nof $0.3 billion.

Management uses these non-\nGAAP financial measures in its analysis of the Company’s performance and believes these presentations provide useful supplemental information, and a clearer\nunderstanding of the Company’s performance. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures enhance investors’ understanding of the Company’s business and\nperformance and if not provided would be requested by the investor community. These measures are also useful in understanding performance trends and facilitate\ncomparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. The limitations associated with operating measures are the risk that persons might disagree as to the\nappropriateness of items comprising these measures and that different companies might define or calculate these measures differently. The Company provides reconciliations\nbetween GAAP and these non-GAAP measures. These disclosures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP.\nGAAP TO NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION (Unaudited)\nSEACOAST BANKING CORPORATION OF FLORIDA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nQuarterly Trends Nine Months
