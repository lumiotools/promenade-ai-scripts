(NASDAQ: HDL and HKEX: 9658) (“Super Hi” or the “Company”), a leading Chinese cuisine restaurant brand operating Haidilao hot pot restaurants in the international market, today announced its unaudited financial results for the third quarter of FY2024 ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * **Revenue** was US$198.6 million, representing an increase of 14.6% from US$173.3 million in the same period of 2023.\n  * In the third quarter of 2024, the Company maintained its existing restaurant footprint with no new openings. The Company temporarily closed 1 restaurant in Southeast Asia in anticipation to relaunch the restaurant as a secondary branded restaurant in the near future. The total number of Haidilao restaurants as of September 30, 2024 was 121, reflecting a net increase of 6 since December 31, 2023.\n  * **Total table turnover rate****1** was 3.8 times per day, compared to 3.7 times per day in the same period of 2023.\n  * Had over 7.4 million **total** **guest visits** , representing an increase of 4.2% from 7.1 million in the same period of 2023.\n  * **Same-store sales growth****2** was 5.6%.\n  * **Income from operation margin** 3 was 7.5%, compared to 5.7% in the same period of 2023.\n\n\n\nMs. Yang Lijuan, CEO & Executive Director of Super Hi, commented, “In the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a quarterly revenue of US$198.6 million, reflecting a 14.6% year-over-year growth. Our income from operation margin3 was 7.5%, increasing by 1.8 percentage points from the same period of the last year. This growth stems not only from the increasing influence of our brand but also from the dedication of our entire team in elevating customer experience, broadening our customer reach, and perfecting our operational execution across all consumer scenarios. At the same time, we will remain focused on enhancing our core competencies across supply chain optimization, innovative product development, strategic brand building, and digital transformation to drive superior restaurant performance.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results****Revenue** was US$198.6 million, representing an increase of 14.6% from US$173.3 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n  * Revenue from Haidilao restaurant operations was US$190.9 million, representing an increase of 14.5% from US$166.7 million in the same period of 2023. The increase was mainly driven by (i) ongoing business expansion and increased brand influence; (ii) continuous efforts to increase guest visits and table turnover rate; and (iii) an increase in average spending per guest.\n  * Revenue from delivery business was US$2.6 million, representing an increase of 8.3% from US$2.4 million in the same period of 2023, primarily due to enhanced partnerships with local delivery platforms.\n  * Revenue from other business was US$5.1 million, representing an increase of 21.4% from US$4.2 million in the same period of 2023, driven by the growing popularity for hot pot condiment products and Haidilao-branded and sub-branded food products among local customers and retailers.\n\n\n\n**Raw materials and consumables used** were US$65.5 million, representing an increase of 9.9% from US$59.6 million in the same period of 2023. As a percentage of revenue, raw materials and consumables used decreased to 33.0% in the third quarter of 2024 from 34.4% in the same period of 2023.\n\n**Staff costs** were US$65.8 million, representing an increase of 15.2% from US$57.1 million in the same period of 2023. As a percentage of revenue, staff costs accounted for 33.1%, compared to 32.9% in the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in the number of employees in line with restaurant network expansion compared to the same period of 2023, and an increase in guest visits and table turnover rate; (ii) the Company’s operational strategy of ensuring sufficient number of employees to provide superior customer experience; and (iii) an increase in statutory minimum wages in several countries.\n\n**Income from operations****4** was US$14.9 million, representing an increase of 52.0% from US$9.8 million in the same period of 2023. Income from operation margin3 was 7.5%, compared to 5.7% in the same period of 2023. This increase in income from operations was mainly attributable to (i) an increase in revenue and table turnover rate as described above; and (ii) an improvement in operational efficiency, especially through optimization of the global supply chain and enhanced cost control.\n\n**Profit for the period** was US$37.7 million, compared to a loss of US$1.4 million in the same period of 2023. This change was mainly due to (i) an increase in revenue driven by ongoing business expansion and continuous efforts in increasing guest visits and table turnover rate; (ii) an improvement in operational efficiency; and (iii) in addition to the aforementioned factors that affect the Company’s income from operations, an increase in net foreign exchange gains of US$34.6 million compared to the same period of 2023.\n\n**Basic and diluted****net profit per sha****re** were both US$0.06, compared to an approximating nil in the same period of 2023.\n\n________________________1 Calculated by dividing the total tables served for the period by the product of total Haidilao restaurant operation days for the period and average table count during the period.2 Refers to the year-over-year growth of the aggregate gross revenue from Haidilao restaurant operations at the Company’s same stores for the period indicated.3 Calculated by dividing income from operation4 by total revenue.4 Calculated by excluding interest income, finance costs, unrealized foreign exchange differences arising from remeasurement of balances which are not denominated in functional currency, net gain arising on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and income tax expense from (loss) profit for the period.\n\n**Operational Highlights**\n\n_Haidilao Restaurant Performance_ The following table summarizes key performance indicators of Haidilao’s restaurants for the quarters indicated.\n\n**As of/For the Three Months EndedSeptember 30,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n**Number of restaurants**  \nSoutheast Asia| 73| 69  \nEast Asia| 18| 17  \nNorth America| 20| 18  \nOthers(1)| 10| 10  \n**Total**| **121**| **114**  \n**Total guest visits** **(million)**  \nSoutheast Asia| 5.2| 4.9  \nEast Asia| 0.8| 0.8  \nNorth America| 0.9| 0.8  \nOthers(1)| 0.5| 0.6  \n**Overall**| **7.4**| **7.1**  \n**Table turnover rate****(****2)****(times per day)**  \nSoutheast Asia| 3.6| 3.5  \nEast Asia| 4.3| 3.9  \nNorth America| 3.9| 3.9  \nOthers(1)| 3.8| 3.9  \n**Overall**| **3.8**| **3.7**  \n**Average spending per guest****(****3)****(US$)**  \nSoutheast Asia| 20.4| 18.7  \nEast Asia| 29.2| 26.0  \nNorth America| 43.5| 41.2  \nOthers(1)| 43.0| 38.8  \n**Overall**| **25.8**| **23.7**  \n  \n**Average daily revenue per restaurant****(****4)****(US$ in thousands)**  \n---  \nSoutheast Asia| 15.7| 14.7  \nEast Asia| 17.7| 13.0  \nNorth America| 21.5| 20.4  \nOthers(1)| 24.3| 23.2  \n**Overall**| **17.7**| **16.1**  \n  \nNotes:(1) Others include Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n(2) Calculated by dividing total number of tables served for the periods by the product of total Haidilao restaurant operation days for the period and average table count during the period in the same geographic region.\n\n(3) Calculated by dividing gross revenue of Haidilao restaurant operation for the periods by total guests served for the periods in the same geographic region.\n\n(4) Calculated by dividing the revenue of Haidilao restaurant operation for the periods by the total Haidilao restaurant operation days of the periods in the same geographic region.\n\n_Same-Store Sales_ The following table sets forth details of the Company’s same store sales for the quarters indicated.\n\n**As of/For the Three Months EndedSeptember 30,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n**Number of Same Stores****(****1)**  \nSoutheast Asia| 65  \nEast Asia| 13  \nNorth America| 18  \nOthers(5)| 10  \n**Total**| **106**  \n**Same Store Sales****(****2)****(US$ in thousands)**  \nSoutheast Asia| 96,839| 93,131  \nEast Asia| 20,374| 16,907  \nNorth America| 36,096| 34,635  \nOthers(5)| 22,449| 21,773  \n**Total**| **175,758**| **166,446**  \n  \n**Average same store sales per day****(****3)****(US$ in thousands)**  \n---  \nSoutheast Asia| 16.2| 15.6  \nEast Asia| 17.1| 14.1  \nNorth America| 21.8| 20.9  \nOthers(5)| 24.4| 23.7  \n**Total**| **18.0**| **17.1**  \n**Average same store table turnover rate****(****4)****(times/day)**  \nSoutheast Asia| 3.6| 3.6  \nEast Asia| 4.3| 4.0  \nNorth America| 4.0| 3.9  \nOthers(5)| 3.8| 3.9  \n**Total**| **3.7**| **3.7**  \n  \nNotes:\n\n(1) Includes restaurants that commenced operations prior to the beginning of the periods under comparison and opened for more than 75 days in the third quarter of 2023 and 2024, respectively.\n\n(2) Refers to the aggregate gross revenue from Haidilao restaurant operation at the Company’s same stores for the periods indicated.\n\n(3) Calculated by dividing the gross revenue from Haidilao restaurant operation for the periods by the total Haidilao restaurant operation days at the Company’s same stores for the periods.\n\n(4) Calculated by dividing the total tables served for the periods by the product of total Haidilao restaurant operation days for the period and average table count at the Company’s same stores during the periods.\n\n(5) Others include Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n**About Super Hi** Super Hi operates Haidilao hot pot restaurants in the international market.

(NASDAQ: HDL and HKEX: 9658) (“Super Hi” or the “Company”), a leading Chinese cuisine restaurant brand operating Haidilao hot pot restaurants in the international market, today announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter of FY2024 ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * **Revenue** was US$183.3 million, representing an increase of 12.5% from US$163.0 million in the same period of 2023.\n  * In the second quarter of 2024, the Company opened 4 new Haidilao restaurants and closed 1 restaurant in Southeast Asia that had been underperforming for a prolonged period, resulting in an increase of 3**net new Haidilao restaurants**. Total number of Haidilao restaurants expanded from 119 as of March 31, 2024 to 122 as of June 30, 2024.\n  * **Total table turnover rate****1** and**same-store table turnover rate****2** were both 3.8 times per day, compared to 3.3 times per day in the same period of 2023.\n  * Had over 7.2 million **total** **guest visits** , representing an increase of 14.3% from 6.3 million in the same period of 2023.\n  * **Same-store sales growth****3** was 6.6%.\n\n\n\nMs. Yang Lijuan, CEO & Executive Director of Super Hi, commented, “During the second quarter of 2024, we focused on enhancing our local restaurant management across key areas including environment, services, products, and food safety. This approach aims to improve guest satisfaction, strengthen guest connections, and boost operational efficiency. Our efforts yielded tangible results, with our table turnover rate increasing to 3.8 times per day, up 0.5 times per day from the same period of last year. During the quarter, revenue grew by 12.5% year over year, driven by the ongoing recovery of the macro environment and our local restaurants’ concerted efforts to improve performance by enhancing guest satisfaction, expanding our guest base, capturing more diverse consumption scenarios, and optimizing product offerings. Our achievements underscore our commitment to sustainable growth and position us well for continued success in the evolving restaurant industry landscape.”\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results****Revenue** was US$183.3 million, representing an increase of 12.5% from US$163.0 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n  * Revenue from Haidilao restaurant operations was US$176.2 million, representing an increase of 12.3% from US$156.9 million in the same period of 2023. The increase was mainly driven by (i) continued recovery in international markets; (ii) our continuous efforts in increasing guest visits and table turnover rates; and (iii) ongoing business expansion and increased brand influence.\n  * Revenue from delivery business was US$2.3 million, representing a decline of 11.5% from US$2.6 million in the same period of 2023. The decline was primarily attributable to the strategic decision of some restaurants to prioritize the dine-in business compared to the same period of last year.\n  * Revenue from other business was US$4.8 million, representing an increase of 37.1% from US$3.5 million in the same period of 2023. The increase was a result of the growing popularity of hot pot condiment products and Haidilao-branded and sub-branded food products to local customers and retailers.\n\n\n\n**Raw materials and consumables used** were US$61.7 million, representing an increase of 11.4% from US$55.4 million in the same period of 2023. As a percentage of revenue, raw materials and consumables decreased slightly to 33.7% in the second quarter of 2024 from 34.0% in the same period of 2023.\n\n**Staff costs** were US$62.7 million, representing an increase of 14.8% from US$54.6 million in the same period of 2023. As a percentage of revenue, staff costs were 34.2%, compared to 33.5% in the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to (i) the increase in the number of employees in line with the expansion of restaurant network, and the increase in guest visits and table turnover rate, (ii) the Company’s operation strategy of ensuring sufficient number of employees to provide superior customer experience, and (iii) the increase in statutory minimum wages in several countries.\n\n**Income from operations****4** was US$8.5 million, representing a decline of 14.1% from US$9.9 million in the same period of 2023. Income from operation margin5 was 4.6%, compared to 6.1% in the same period of 2023. This decline in income from operations was primarily due to (i) an increase in rentals and related expenses of US$1.9 million, mainly representing increased property management fees resulting from the opening of new restaurants and the increase in variable lease payments in line with the increase in revenue from relevant restaurants, and (ii) listing expenses of US$1.8 million.\n\n**Loss for the period** was US$0.1 million, compared to a loss of US$2.2 million in the same period of 2023. This change was mainly due to an increase in revenue compared to the same period of 2023.\n\n**Basic and diluted****net loss per sha****re** were both approximating nil, remaining flat compared to the same period of 2023.\n\n_____________________________________1 Calculated by dividing the total tables served for the period by the product of total Haidilao restaurant operation days for the period and average table count during the period.2 Calculated by dividing the total tables served for the period by the product of total Haidilao restaurant operation days for the period and average table

The increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in the number of employees in line with restaurant network expansion compared to the same period of 2023, and an increase in guest visits and table turnover rate; (ii) the Company’s operational strategy of ensuring sufficient number of employees to provide superior customer experience; and (iii) an increase in statutory minimum wages in several countries.\n\n**Income from operations****4** was US$14.9 million, representing an increase of 52.0% from US$9.8 million in the same period of 2023. Income from operation margin3 was 7.5%, compared to 5.7% in the same period of 2023. This increase in income from operations was mainly attributable to (i) an increase in revenue and table turnover rate as described above; and (ii) an improvement in operational efficiency, especially through optimization of the global supply chain and enhanced cost control.\n\n**Profit for the period** was US$37.7 million, compared to a loss of US$1.4 million in the same period of 2023. This change was mainly due to (i) an increase in revenue driven by ongoing business expansion and continuous efforts in increasing guest visits and table turnover rate; (ii) an improvement in operational efficiency; and (iii) in addition to the aforementioned factors that affect the Company’s income from operations, an increase in net foreign exchange gains of US$34.6 million compared to the same period of 2023.\n\n**Basic and diluted****net profit per sha****re** were both US$0.06, compared to an approximating nil in the same period of 2023.\n\n________________________1 Calculated by dividing the total tables served for the period by the product of total Haidilao restaurant operation days for the period and average table count during the period.2 Refers to the year-over-year growth of the aggregate gross revenue from Haidilao restaurant operations at the Company’s same stores for the period indicated.3 Calculated by dividing income from operation4 by total revenue.4 Calculated by excluding interest income, finance costs, unrealized foreign exchange differences arising from remeasurement of balances which are not denominated in functional currency, net gain arising on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and income tax expense from (loss) profit for the period.\n\n**Operational Highlights**\n\n_Haidilao Restaurant Performance_ The following table summarizes key performance indicators of Haidilao’s restaurants for the quarters indicated.\n\n**As of/For the Three Months EndedSeptember 30,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n**Number of restaurants**  \nSoutheast Asia| 73| 69  \nEast Asia| 18| 17  \nNorth America| 20| 18  \nOthers(1)| 10| 10  \n**Total**| **121**| **114**  \n**Total guest visits** **(million)**  \nSoutheast Asia| 5.2| 4.9  \nEast Asia| 0.8| 0.8  \nNorth America| 0.9| 0.8  \nOthers(1)| 0.5| 0.6  \n**Overall**| **7.4**| **7.1**  \n**Table turnover rate****(****2)****(times per day)**  \nSoutheast Asia| 3.6| 3.5  \nEast Asia| 4.3| 3.9  \nNorth America| 3.9| 3.9  \nOthers(1)| 3.8| 3.9  \n**Overall**| **3.8**| **3.7**  \n**Average spending per guest****(****3)****(US$)**  \nSoutheast Asia| 20.4| 18.7  \nEast Asia| 29.2| 26.0  \nNorth America| 43.5| 41.2  \nOthers(1)| 43.0| 38.8  \n**Overall**| **25.8**| **23.7**  \n  \n**Average daily revenue per restaurant****(****4)****(US$ in thousands)**  \n---  \nSoutheast Asia| 15.7| 14.7  \nEast Asia| 17.7| 13.0  \nNorth America| 21.5| 20.4  \nOthers(1)| 24.3| 23.2  \n**Overall**| **17.7**| **16.1**  \n  \nNotes:(1) Others include Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n(2) Calculated by dividing total number of tables served for the periods by the product of total Haidilao restaurant operation days for the period and average table count during the period in the same geographic region.\n\n(3) Calculated by dividing gross revenue of Haidilao restaurant operation for the periods by total guests served for the periods in the same geographic region.\n\n(4) Calculated by dividing the revenue of Haidilao restaurant operation for the periods by the total Haidilao restaurant operation days of the periods in the same geographic region.\n\n_Same-Store Sales_ The following table sets forth details of the Company’s same store sales for the quarters indicated.\n\n**As of/For the Three Months EndedSeptember 30,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n**Number of Same Stores****(****1)**  \nSoutheast Asia| 65  \nEast Asia| 13  \nNorth America| 18  \nOthers(5)| 10  \n**Total**| **106**  \n**Same Store Sales****(****2)****(US$ in thousands)**  \nSoutheast Asia| 96,839| 93,131  \nEast Asia| 20,374| 16,907  \nNorth America| 36,096| 34,635  \nOthers(5)| 22,449| 21,773  \n**Total**| **175,758**| **166,446**  \n  \n**Average same store sales per day****(****3)****(US$ in thousands)**  \n---  \nSoutheast Asia| 16.2| 15.6  \nEast Asia| 17.1| 14.1  \nNorth America| 21.8| 20.9  \nOthers(5)| 24.4| 23.7  \n**Total**| **18.0**| **17.1**  \n**Average same store table turnover rate****(****4)****(times/day)**  \nSoutheast Asia| 3.6| 3.6  \nEast Asia| 4.3| 4.0  \nNorth America| 4.0| 3.9  \nOthers(5)| 3.8| 3.9  \n**Total**| **3.7**| **3.7**  \n  \nNotes:\n\n(1) Includes restaurants that commenced operations prior to the beginning of the periods under comparison and opened for more than 75 days in the third quarter of 2023 and 2024, respectively.\n\n(2) Refers to the aggregate gross revenue from Haidilao restaurant operation at the Company’s same stores for the periods indicated.\n\n(3) Calculated by dividing the gross revenue from Haidilao restaurant operation for the periods by the total Haidilao restaurant operation days at the Company’s same stores for the periods.\n\n(4) Calculated by dividing the total tables served for the periods by the product of total Haidilao restaurant operation days for the period and average table count at the Company’s same stores during the periods.\n\n(5) Others include Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n**About Super Hi** Super Hi operates Haidilao hot pot restaurants in the international market.
