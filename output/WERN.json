These achievements reflect Werner’s strong track record of creating sustainable, fulfilling career paths for veterans and military spouses. \n\n“At Werner, we deeply value the skills, dedication and resilience that veterans and military families bring to our organization,” said Werner’s Chairman and CEO, Derek Leathers. “These recognitions are a testament to our commitment to providing meaningful career opportunities that honor their service and support their growth in civilian life.” \n\nWith approximately 20% of its workforce comprised of veterans, Werner offers specialized programs and benefits tailored to the military community. Key initiatives include a Military Skills Test Waiver Program, SkillBridge/Career Skills Program, VA Educational Benefits, Operation Freedom Fleet, ‘WEVets’ Veteran Resource Group and Deployment Support. \n\nMore than 2,800 organizations compete annually for Military Friendly® designations, and Werner consistently distinguishes itself through commitment, effort and success in building rewarding career paths for the military community.

          "content": "3Q24 EARNINGS PRESENTATION\nOctober 29, 2024\n1\nDISCLOSURE STATEMENT\nThis presentation may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.\nSuch forward-looking statements are based on information presently available to the Company’s management and are current only as of the date made. Such\nstatements are by nature subject to uncertainties and risks, including, but not limited to, operational, financial, legal risks detailed in our latest available Annual Report on\nForm 10-K and any subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results or events to differ materially from\nhistorical results or those anticipated.\nFor those reasons, undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statement. The Company assumes no duty or obligation to update or revise any\nforward-looking statement, although it may do so from time to time as management believes is warranted or as may be required by applicable securities law. Any such\nupdates or revisions may be made by filing reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, through the issuance of press releases or by other methods of\npublic disclosure.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations\nTo supplement our financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), we provide certain\nnon-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC Regulation G, including non-GAAP adjusted operating income; non-GAAP adjusted operating margin; non-GAAP\nadjusted operating margin, net of fuel surcharge; non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to Werner; non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share; non-GAAP free\ncash flow; non-GAAP EBITDA; non-GAAP net debt; non-GAAP adjusted operating revenues, net of fuel surcharge; non-GAAP adjusted operating revenues, less\npurchased transportation expense; non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses; non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses, net of fuel surcharge; non-GAAP adjusted\noperating ratio; and non-GAAP adjusted operating ratio, net of fuel surcharge. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide a more useful comparison of our\nperformance from period to period because they exclude the effect of items that, in our opinion, do not reflect our core operating performance. Our non-GAAP financial\nmeasures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as substitutes for their comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our\nconsolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. Although we believe that they\nimprove comparability in analyzing our period-to-period performance, they could limit comparability to other companies in our industry if those companies define these\nmeasures differently. Because of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered measures of income generated by our business.\nManagement compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis.\n2\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nDEREK LEATHERS\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\nWERNER OVERVIEW (WERN)\n6TH TOTALDRIVERS IN COMPANY\n68 2,260\nYEARS IN OMAHA,NE HISTORYWITHONE MILLION\nBUSINESS LARGEST OR MORE SAFE DRIVING\nHEADQUARTERS DEDICATED MILES WITHWERNER\nCARRIERINU.S.3\n4,9054\nDEDICATED\n> 90%\n2,5404\nDEDICATED ONE-WAYTRUCKLOAD\nCUSTOMER\n$2.3B1 1.5%1 13,1172 2902\nRETENTIONRATE\n7,4454\nTTSTRUCKS\nMARKETCAP DIVIDENDYIELD ASSOCIATES INDEPENDENT\nCONTRACTORS\n18% 16% 55%\n29,3354\nTRAILING\nEMISSIONS ASSETS\nWERNERCOMPANYDRIVERS REDUCTION\nWERNERCOMPANY\nDRIVERSWITH WHOAREWOMEN GOALBY2035\n(HIGHERTHAN INDUSTRYAVERAGE)\nMILITARYEXPERIENCE\n1Asof10/25/24forMarketCap andDividendYield.\n2Number of Associates and Independent Contractors as of9/30/24.\n44\n3Source:TransportTopics\n4As of 9/30/24; TTS includes Dedicated and One-Way Truckload.

non-GAAP adjusted operating margin; non-GAAP adjusted operating margin, net of fuel surcharge; non-GAAP adjusted net income\nattributable to Werner; non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share; non-GAAP free cash flow; non-GAAP EBITDA; non-GAAP net debt; non-GAAP adjusted operating revenues,\nnet of fuel surcharge; non-GAAP adjusted operating revenues, less purchased transportation expense; non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses; non-GAAP adjusted operating\nexpenses, net of fuel surcharge; non-GAAP adjusted operating ratio; and non-GAAP adjusted operating ratio, net of fuel surcharge should be considered in addition to, rather than\nas substitutes for, GAAP operating income; GAAP operating margin; GAAP net income attributable to Werner; GAAP diluted earnings per share; GAAP net cash provided by\noperating activities; GAAP net income; GAAP total debt; GAAP operating revenues; GAAP operating expenses; and GAAP operating ratio, which are their most directly comparable\nGAAP financial measures.\n(2) We accrued pre-tax insurance and claims expense for interest related to a previously disclosed excess adverse jury verdict rendered on May 17, 2018 in a lawsuit arising from a\nDecember 2014 accident. The Company is appealing this verdict. Additional information about the accident was included in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 17, 2018.\nUnder our insurance policies in effect on the date of this accident, our maximum liability for this accident is $10.0 million (plus pre-judgment and post-judgment interest) with\npremium-based insurance coverage that exceeds the jury verdict amount. We continue to accrue pre-tax insurance and claims expense for interest at $0.5 million per month until\nsuch time as the outcome of our appeal is finalized. Management believes excluding the effect of this item provides a more useful comparison of our performance from period to\nperiod. This item is included in the Truckload Transportation Services segment.\n(3) We incurred business acquisition-related expenses including legal and professional fees. Acquisition-related expenses are excluded as management believes these costs are\nnot representative of the costs of managing our on-going business. The expenses are included in our Corporate segment.\n(4) Amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in our business acquisitions is excluded because management does not believe it is indicative of our core operating\nperformance. This item is included in our Truckload Transportation Services and Werner Logistics segments.\n(5) Represents non-operating mark-to-market adjustments for gains/losses on our minority equity investments, which we account for under Accounting Standards Codification\n(\"ASC\") 321, Investments - Equity Securities. Management believes excluding the effect of gains/losses on our investments in equity securities provides a more useful comparison\nof our performance from period to period.\n(6) Represents earnings/losses from our equity method investment, which we account for under ASC 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures. Management believes\nexcluding the effect of earnings/losses from our equity method investment provides a more useful comparison of our performance from period to period.\n(7) The income tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments is calculated using the incremental income tax rate excluding discrete items, and the income tax effect for 2023 has been\nupdated to reflect the annual incremental income tax rate.\n(8) We consider free cash flow (net cash provided by operating activities less net expenditures for property and equipment) to be a useful measure of our liquidity. We believe it is a\nmore conservative measure of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow does not represent residual cash flows available for\ndiscretionary expenditures, as the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view\nfree cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n(9) We consider EBITDA to be an important measure of our financial performance and of our ability to generate cash flows to service debt obligations, fund capital expenditures and\nfund other corporate investing and financing activities. EBITDA eliminates the non-cash effect of depreciation and amortization. Net debt is used in our net debt to EBITDA ratio. We\nbelieve the net debt to EBITDA ratio is useful in evaluating our ability to service our debt.\n(10) Fluctuating fuel prices and fuel surcharge revenues impact the total company operating ratio and the TTS segment operating ratio when fuel surcharges are reported on a gross\nbasis as revenues versus netting the fuel surcharges against fuel expenses. Management believes netting fuel surcharge revenues, which are generally a more volatile source of\nrevenue, against fuel expenses provides a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period to period.\n(11) Management believes excluding purchased transportation expense from Werner Logistics operating revenues provides a useful measurement of our ability to source and sell\nservices provided by third parties.\n2277\nFOR MORE INFORMATION, VISIT WERNER.COM"

I would now like to turn the\nconference over to Chris Neil, Senior Vice President of Pricing and Strategic Planning. Please\ngo ahead.\nChris Neil\nGood afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, we issued our earnings release with our third quarter\nresults. The release and a supplemental presentation are available in the investors section of our\nwebsite at werner.com. Today's webcast is being recorded and will be available for replay later\ntoday.\nPlease see the disclosure statement on slide two of the presentation as well as the disclaimers in\nour earnings release related to forward-looking statements. Today's remarks contain forward-\nlooking statements that may involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual\nresults to differ materially.\nThe company reports results using non-GAAP measures, which we believe provides additional\ninformation for investors to help facilitate the comparison of past and present performance. A\nreconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the tables attached\nto the earnings release and in the appendix of the slide presentation.\nOn today's call with me are Derek Leathers, Chairman and CEO and Chris Wikoff, Executive Vice\nPresident, Treasurer and CFO.\nI'll now turn the call over to Derek.\nDerek Leathers\nThank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today.\nBefore we begin, our thoughts and prayers are with those impacted by the recent natural disasters\nin the Southeast. Hurricanes Helene and Milton have brought devastation to the region, and we\nwish all those affected by these events a swift recovery. Many of our colleagues and customers\nhave been directly impacted, and I want to thank our team members for providing support to those\nin need.\nMoving to our results for the third quarter. We continue to see positive signs that we believe point\nto the early stages of an improving operating environment. West Coast imports have been strong,\nwe've secured some contractual rate increases and excess capacity continues to exit, albeit at a\nslow pace. However, the backdrop for the third quarter remained challenging.\nThese positive signs were more than offset by several factors, including elevated health insurance\nclaims, higher interest expense, pressure on Logistics gross margin and higher costs in the school\nnetwork. As a result of these factors, our operating income and EPS declined slightly from second\nto third quarter.\nThe combined impact from elevated healthcare claims and driver school costs negatively\nimpacted EPS by over 5 cents per share compared to Q2. Core sequential operational\nimprovement would have been realized in our results if not for these headwinds. While the quarter\nWerner Enterprises, Inc.\nTuesday, October 29, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n2\nremained challenging, underlying data points reflect a market in transition. This is resulting in\ncross currents for Werner. The improvements we have been making to our business to drive\nlong-term growth and value creation are being primarily offset by a challenging macro\nenvironment. While this is painful, it is also temporary.\nWe remain disciplined on executing our strategy and are continuing to improve the business for\ntoday and for the future. As we navigate through this turbulent environment, I'm pleased to report\nthat in Q3, One-Way utilization improved year-over-year for the sixth consecutive quarter and rate\nper total mile inflected positive.\nStrength and momentum continued in our Mexico cross border, Intermodal and Power Only\nservices. Our Dedicated fleet size grew sequentially and revenue per truck increased. We\nmaintained high customer retention in Dedicated, and our cost savings program progressed.\nIn addition, I'm pleased to report that a small group of professional drivers from our ECM transport\nsubsidiary decertified the union's representation and decided to work directly with company\nmanagement. In our ongoing effort to remain the best workplace for professional drivers, this\ndemonstrates that our driver-centric culture at Werner is working and that it is as strong as ever.\nWhen the going gets tough, the tough get going. And thanks to Werner's over 13,000 talented\nteam members, their grit and determination is positioning Werner for improved operating leverage\nand long-term value creation as the market improves.\nLet's move to slide five and highlight our Q3 results. During the quarter, revenues were 9% lower\nversus the prior year. Adjusted EPS was 15 cents. Adjusted operating margin was 2.9%.\nAdjusted TTS operating margin was 5.3% net of fuel surcharges.\nDedicated demonstrated its resiliency and durability during the quarter. Revenue per truck per\nweek increased year-over-year in Q3 while truck count grew sequentially, and our customer\nretention rate remained strong at over 90%. While One-Way Truckload remains more pressured\nrelative to Dedicated, we were pleased with another quarter of improved utilization and revenue\nper total mile turning positive year-over-year for the first time in seven quarters. Our pricing\ndiscipline combined with better freight options and strong miles per truck led to revenue per truck\nper week that increased nearly 7%.\nLogistics reported adjusted operating income that was slightly positive. Gross margins were\npressured while volumes declined less than 1% sequentially. Our Logistics business is a key\ncomponent of our strategy. Through our Brokerage, Intermodal and Final Mile offerings, we can\nprovide a greater portfolio of solutions to our larger customers while also expanding our reach to\nsmall and mid-sized customers.\nOur Truckload Brokerage business complements One-Way trucking by assigning partner carriers\nto lanes that are less optimal for our own network while adding incremental revenue and earnings.\nFurthermore, Brokerage provides an opportunity to introduce our service product to customers in\na transactional or low risk setting. After showcasing our service and capabilities and developing\na relationship with the customer, our business often expands to One-Way Truckload or Dedicated.\nOur continued advancement in technology is one of the key enablers of growth in Logistics with\na minimal capital investment. Through 2023, we demonstrated 13 consecutive quarters of growth\nin Logistics. Our business fundamentals remain strong today. We've made two logistics\nacquisitions in recent years and have moved all of our Logistics business except Final Mile to our\nWerner Enterprises, Inc.\nTuesday, October 29, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n3\nEdge TMS platform. As greater demand returns, we expect improved results in Logistics through\nboth higher rates, as well as, more volume and transactional opportunities.\nIn short, despite an operating environment that remains challenging, we continue to see positive\nsigns across the business from early One-Way rate improvement to a strong Dedicated pipeline.\nEvidence of some market tightening response to supply chain disruptions, growing Power Only\nvolumes, and anticipated peak volumes slightly higher than last year.\nMoving to slide six, before discussing our 2024 strategic priorities, I want to spend a few minutes\nunderlining the strength and competitive advantage of our Dedicated solution.\nWerner is one of the largest, most well-respected dedicated providers in the US. With our focus\non safety and service, Werner provides a highly integrated dedicated solution to large enterprise\ncustomers who look to us to service complex and hard-to-serve networks. Our ability to design,\nbuild, operate, and maintain fleets sets us apart. We solve problems and add value for our\ncustomers that view their supply chain as a competitive advantage. This has enabled us to\nmaintain over a 90% customer retention rate.\nGiven the characteristics of a true dedicated model, our Dedicated business has shown resiliency\nthrough this prolonged and unprecedented down cycle. By the numbers, revenue per truck per\nweek has increased year-over-year 26 of the last 27 quarters. And fleet size has increased year-\nover-year for 14 of the last 16 years.\nWhile the overall dedicated environment has experienced greater pressure than past down\ncycles, we do not believe that there has been a fundamental change in the dedicated model.\nRather, looking ahead, we see opportunities to preserve and grow our existing Dedicated\nbusiness and to stimulate progress through vertical expansion and private fleet conversion.\nWith market momentum shifting back to prioritizing capacity, reliability, and service, combined\nwith a total addressable market exceeding $30 billion, we believe Werner is well positioned to\ncapitalize on a robust pipeline of opportunities.\nMoving to slide seven, our DRIVE framework continues to inform our decisions over the long term,\nrepresenting our commitment to durability, results, innovation, values, our associates, and the\nenvironment. With two months until year end, we want to provide an update on progress towards\nthe strategic priorities we laid out for 2024 at the beginning of this year.\nWhen we set these goals, we anticipated a more robust acceleration of macro and industry trends\nin the second half of the year. While continued softness has impacted outcomes, we are making\nprogress. Our three priorities to generate earnings power and drive value creation are driving\ngrowth in core business, driving operational excellence as a core competency, and driving capital\nefficiency.\nRelative to our first priority, driving growth in core business, we are focused on controlling the\ncontrollables and implementing changes that position us to grow and capture operating leverage\nwhen the market inflects.\nFor example, we are seeing benefits from consolidating freight into a single platform. With\nTruckload Logistics now completely transitioned to our Edge TMS platform, and alongside\nprogress converting One-Way trucking customers, both operations now have visibility to freight\nWerner Enterprises, Inc.\nTuesday, October 29, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n4\nneeds of select customers. This shared visibility allows us to optimize operators executed and\nserviced in real time.\nThe synergies we are creating are already driving incremental revenue, and the benefits will only\ngrow as more One-Way customers are integrated into the platform. Our technology stack is\nanchored by our in-house designed and architected Edge TMS platform, which is underpinned by\na robust API structure.\nThis allows for seamless and real-time data exchange across other systems and winning\ntechnologies, significantly improving decision-making, operational efficiency, and scalability. This\nseamless connectivity results in benefits such as rate automation and optimized freight selection.\nBeyond technology, we've realized other advances that are driving revenue. One-Way miles per\ntruck and revenue per total mile are improving. Mexico volumes are growing, and Power Only\nrevenues are also growing, increasing mid-teens year-over-year and high single-digits\nsequentially.\nWe remain confident in the roadmap to get back to our long-term target range of 12% to 17%.\nPace and timing are difficult to predict, but the pathway is clear. Later on, Chris will discuss these\nkey levers to bridge the gap to our long-term expectations.\nRelative to our second priority of driving operational excellence as a core competency, we've seen\nadvancements here also. In fact, everything we do here at Werner is done with an attention to\nexcellence. As a recent example, Ferguson, a valued customer, recently announced that Werner\nreceived their carrier of the year in 2024 in the truckload category. We appreciate these\nrelationships and customers that value how we approach safety, reliable service, and unmatched\ncapability.\nAs communicated previously, our technology roadmap has been a key focus. In addition to the\npreviously mentioned benefits of our business, migrating to our Edge TMS platform, several other\nexamples illustrate progress in our technology journey, including the automation of our accounts\npayable processes, being close to completing the migration of our back office to workday and\nstreamlining our internal operations and reducing the time it takes to qualify, onboard, audit, and\npay third-party carriers in Brokerage. These benefits continue to advance us towards processes\nthat are better, faster, and cheaper for the long-term.\nThrough Q3, we've realized $40 million in savings through initiatives focused on innovation,\nleveraging technology, and further integrating and centralizing processes across our legacy and\nacquired businesses. We continue to invest in our future through the 5-T's, trucks, trailers,\nterminals, talent, and technology, all to position us well when the market turns.\nAnd lastly, our third priority, driving capital efficiency. We reported another solid quarter of\noperating cash flow, and our year-to-date free cash flow is up year-over-year. CapEx spend and\nfleet age remain low. Despite the prolonged down cycle, I'm proud of our team's progress on\nthese fronts. These results prove that during the ebbs and flows of market demand, we remain\nfocused on controlling what we can. We continue to push forward with implementing structural\nimprovements that will position Werner for success as the market normalizes.\nWith that I will turn it over to Chris for a deeper dive into our Q3 performance.\nWerner Enterprises, Inc.\nTuesday, October 29, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n5\nChris Wikoff\nThank you, Derek. Let's continue on slide nine. Third quarter revenues totaled $746 million, 9%\nlower versus prior year. Adjusted operating income was $21.6 million and adjusted operating\nmargin was 2.9%, a decrease of 48% and 220 basis points, respectively. Adjusted EPS of 15\ncents declined 27 cents, primarily driven by a softer used equipment market, lower gains and\nhigher interest expense combined with rate pressure in One-Way and Logistics.\nTurning to slide 10, Truckload Transportation Services total revenue for the third quarter was $523\nmillion, down 9%. Revenues, net of fuel surcharges, declined 6% to $460 million. TTS adjusted\noperating income was $24.5 million, 41% lower versus prior year. Adjusted operating margin, net\nof fuel, was 5.3%, a decrease of 320 basis points year-over-year, but a 30-basis-point\nimprovement from second quarter. Lower equipment gains drove over 40% of the TTS decline in\noperating income.\nDuring the quarter, consolidated gains on sale of property and equipment totaled $2.6 million, a\ndecline of $6.5 million or down over 71% compared to last year. Net of fuel surcharges and\nequipment gains, TTS operating expenses reflected our intentional commitment to control costs,\ndeclining modestly year-over-year and sequentially, but were more than offset by a 10% smaller\naverage fleet size and a revenue per mile decline of 1%. Year-over-year, One-Way revenue per\ntotal mile increased 0.3% in the third quarter and was down 1.2% year-to-date.\nSeveral TTS expense categories showed improvement in the quarter. Insurance and claims\nexpense dropped $3 million or 10% versus prior year. Operating supplies and maintenance and\ngeneral supply expense was down $1 million or 2%. We remain focused on producing higher\noperating margins and overtime, returning to our long-term TTS operating margin target range.\nThe building blocks to bridge the gap remain clear. They include first rate improvement in One-\nWay. Second, incremental growth for existing fleets in Dedicated at a higher contribution margin\nas we return to normalized volume, third, normalization in the used equipment market and fourth,\nstructural improvements through technology and our cost savings initiatives.\nWe are seeing pockets of progress in these areas. Our focus and intentionality to influence rate\nlift is showing as One-Way rate improved year-over-year and sequentially during the quarter, and\nour cost savings program remains on track and growing.\nLet's turn to slide 11 to review our fleet metrics. TTS average trucks declined to 7,414 during the\nquarter. We ended third quarter with the TTS fleet down 15 trucks sequentially and 9% year-\nover-year. TTS revenue per truck per week, net of fuel, increased at 3.5% year-over-year during\nthe quarter and has increased year-over-year for 22 of the last 27 quarters.\nWithin TTS for the third quarter, Dedicated revenue, net of fuel, was $285 million, down 7% year-\nover-year. Dedicated represented 63% of TTS revenue, consistent with the year ago. Dedicated\naverage trucks decreased 8.5% to 4,809 trucks. At quarter end, Dedicated represented 66% of\nthe TTS fleet. Dedicated revenue per truck per week increased 1.7% year-over-year, growing 26\nof the last 27 quarters.\nIn an improving market, we remain confident in our position to return the fleet to growth, given\ndemand improvement within some of our existing fleets and our high customer retention. Growth\nopportunity remains in retail while also focusing on gaining traction in other high-value verticals\nand hard-to-serve freight opportunities at re-investable margins.\nWerner Enterprises, Inc.\nTuesday, October 29, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n6\nIn our One-Way business for the third quarter, trucking revenue net of fuel was $165 million, a\ndecrease of 6% versus prior year. Average truck count declined 12% to 2,605 trucks. Revenue\nper truck per week was up 7% year-over-year.\nOne-Way freight conditions in the quarter were similar to Q2, but there were pockets throughout\nthe country where better freight options existed. West Coast Imports, for example, allowed us to\nimprove our freight mix in the West. We operated some pop-up trucks throughout the quarter and\nhad the opportunity to participate in numerous projects at improving rates. We will continue to\nutilize our freight selection tools while being methodical, disciplined, and proactive in transitioning\nour One-Way portfolio to improved rates.\nAfter two quarters of double-digit year-over-year gains, One-Way miles per truck increased a solid\n7%. Total miles decreased 7% versus prior year with 12% fewer average trucks. We are lapping\nstrong gains in production and utility and expect year-over-year improvements will moderate.\nIn addition, our Power Only offering within Logistics continues to grow. Increased miles in Power\nOnly offset the decline in One-Way Truckload miles, ultimately resulting in combined miles that\nwere flat year-over-year.\nAs a carrier of scale and reach, our ability to produce similar miles with a smaller fleet is unique,\nand in a tighter market with better rates, the combination of One-Way production gains plus Power\nOnly volume growth translates to improved ROI and provides more optionality for our customers.\nNow turning to Logistics on slide 12. In the third quarter, Logistics revenue was $207 million,\nrepresenting 28% of total third quarter revenues. Revenues were down 10% year-over-year and\n1% sequentially.\nRevenue in Truckload Logistics declined 12% and shipments decreased 10%. Shipments\ndecreased less than 1% sequentially as volumes from the existing customer base were generally\nsteady. Intermodal revenues, which make up approximately 14% of Logistics revenue, decreased\n1% sequentially but increased 7% year-over-year due to 19% more shipments. This was partially\noffset by a 10% decrease in revenue per shipment. Final Mile revenues decreased 5%\nsequentially and 17% year-over-year.\nAn ongoing competitive environment led to slightly lower sequential Truckload Logistics volumes\nand gross margins, resulting in adjusted operating income of $0.8 million. Adjusted operating\nmargin was 0.4%, down 100 basis points year-over-year, driven by rate and gross margin\ncompression.\nIt continues to be a very competitive operating environment, which is pressuring Logistics margins\nin the short term. We have taken recent actions, including certain headcount reductions and\nimplementation of other cost controls, to further lower our cost to serve. We are working to\nimprove revenue quality, as well as building our infrastructure and technology to continue to\nprovide industry-leading service and expertise at greater scale.\nMoving to slide 13 to discuss our cost savings program. We are increasing our 2024 program\nagain and are now targeting $50 million. Through the third quarter, we have realized 80% of our\nrevised full year target. We have clear line of sight on the rest of the program and expect to reach\nour target by the end of the year. As a reminder, these cost savings are largely long-term and\nsustainable.\nWerner Enterprises, Inc.\nTuesday, October 29, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n7\nWhile we have been on a journey to reduce costs during this inflationary environment over the\nlast few years, we have continued to reinvest in the business. We have maintained a new fleet\nand acquired real estate in key geographies. We have also upgraded our terminal network to\nprovide best-in-class amenities to our drivers and create more capacity to perform repairs at our\nlocations.\nAnd finally, we have pushed forward with investing time, energy, and capital towards our\ntechnology journey as we work to transition all business units to one TMS platform and build tools\nto enhance our customers' experience and greater efficiency for our associates.\nLet's review our cash flow on slide 14. We ended the third quarter with $55 million in cash and\ncash equivalents. Operating cash flow was $61 million for the quarter or 8% of total revenue,\nslightly lower than the prior year. As expected, net CapEx continues to trend down. Third quarter\nwas $88 million, down $32 million or 27% year-over-year. Year-to-date net CapEx is 9% of\nrevenue compared to 15% for the same period last year, yet we continue to maintain a low-\naverage age fleet. As a result, free cash flow through the first nine months of this year was $53\nmillion or 2% of total revenues, up 300 basis points year-over-year. Total liquidity at quarter end\nwas $434 million, including cash and availability on our revolver.\nMoving to slide 15, we ended the quarter with $690 million in debt, up $20 million or 3%\nsequentially but flat from a year earlier. Net debt decreased $12 million, or 2% year-over-year.\nNet debt-to-EBITDA was 1.6 times, driven by EBITDA margin compression. We continue to have\na very healthy balance sheet, access to capital, relatively low leverage, and no near-term\nmaturities in our debt structure.\nOn slide 16, let's recap our strategic priorities related to capital allocation. We continue to prioritize\nstrategic reinvestment in the business while also being balanced over the long term between\nreturning capital to shareholders, reducing debt and funding M&A. Through the first nine months\nof the year, we generated nearly $260 million in operating cash flow. We utilized $206 million net\nof used equipment sales for reinvestment in our fleet, terminals, technology, and school network.\n$26 million year-to-date was a return to shareholders through our quarterly dividend. We did not\nrepurchase shares during the quarter and, therefore, remained flat at $67 million in share\nrepurchases year-to-date. We have 3.9 million shares remaining under the board-approved\nprogram.\nLet's continue on slide 17 and a review of our full year 2024 guidance. Our full year fleet guidance\nhas been adjusted from being down 3% to 6% to being down 6% to 8% year-to-date. We are\noperating 7% fewer trucks. We see potential for a lower Dedicated fleet in the fourth quarter but\nexpect any decline will be partially offset by growth in our One-Way fleet. Our full year net CapEx\nguidance range has tightened to be between $240 million and $260 million, with the midpoint\nunchanged at $250 million.\nThrough three quarters, Dedicated revenue per truck grew by 1.1% year-over-year and is\nexpected to remain within our full year guidance range of zero percent to 3%. One-Way Truckload\nrevenue per total mile increased 0.3% in the third quarter, slightly better than the top end of our\ndown 3% to flat guidance. We expect the year-over-year change in the fourth quarter to be flat\nto up 3% as we see increasing opportunity for favorable rate changes going forward.\nTotal gains at $8.9 million year-to-date, including $1.8 million from the sale of real estate last\nquarter. Excluding the real estate, sales of used equipment and property resulted in a gain of\n$7.1 million. We are lowering the midpoint and tightening the range to be $7 million to $11 million.\nWerner Enterprises, Inc.\nTuesday, October 29, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n8\nOur tax rate was 23.5% in Q3 and 26.7% year-to-date, reflecting certain one-time discrete items\nin the first quarter. We are raising our full year guidance range to be between 25.5% and 26.5%.\nOur average age of our truck and trailer fleet at the end of the third quarter was 2.0 years and 5.2\nyears respectively.\nI'll now turn it back to Derek.\nDerek Leathers\nThank you, Chris. We continue to make progress on our near-term initiatives, structural\nimprovements, and strategic tech investments on our path to position Werner for growth as\ndemand returns.\nThe operating environment remains challenging, and while we were optimistic that the turn would\noccur before peak season, we are staying the course and focused on controlling what we can.\nWe are pleased that One-Way trucking revenue per total mile increased in Q3. One-Way miles\nper truck showed continued year-over-year improvement and the Dedicated fleet grew\nsequentially.\nAs a result of the intentional evolution in our business, Werner has never been stronger. We are\na more diversified company and better positioned to capitalize on a market turn. We are a cycle-\ntested team, and our historical results demonstrate our ability to generate earnings power as the\nmarket improves and demand accelerates. Through it all, we will remain steadfast in our\napproach to safety and delivering best-in-class service to our customers.\nWith that, let us open it up for questions.\nQUESTION AND ANSWER\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions)\nOur first question today is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker\nGreat. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on the health\ninsurance claims and the kind of cost headwinds that you mentioned in the quarter? Just how\nmany of these are one-time issues versus something that may sustain?\nChris Wikoff\nHey, Ravi. This is Chris. Sure, we can unpack that a little bit. Not a ton of specifics that we can\nreally provide around it other than it was uniquely elevated during the quarter, potentially even a\nrecord for us. So that's just why we called it out in the results. Certainly, something that can be\nvolatile from time-to-time, but this was more of an outsized level for us. So, it was about 5 cents\nof EPS impact, at least on a quarter-over-quarter basis, as we noted.\nRavi Shanker\nUnderstood. That's helpful. And maybe as a follow-up, you also said in your prepared remarks\nthat you secured some rate increases this quarter? Can you just talk about the magnitude of what\nyou're looking at for 2025 bid season, maybe starting now through going into the peak of it in like\n1Q, 2Q of next year?\nWerner Enterprises, Inc.\nTuesday, October 29, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n9\nDerek Leathers\nYes, Ravi, this is Derek. So, the rate increases that we've been achieving as we went through\nQ3, and into Q4, obviously we're addressing sort of the most under duress freight in our network\nfirst. So those numbers tend to be a little bit outsized, because that freight is freight that really\nneeds to, at this point, either be repriced or replaced, and so there's a level of assertiveness that\ngoes along with that ask based on the current state of pricing with certain customers in the\nnetwork.\nI think it's too early to try to predict what 2025 looks like. I think the next several weeks will really\nshape and tell us a lot about what to expect going into the formal bid season. What I can tell you\nis that the slow build that's been occurring in Q3 with some add-on in Q4 has been obviously\nsomewhat impacted by the very natural disasters we opened up the call talking about, and the\nport strikes as well.\nBut even in addition to that, there is an ongoing kind of subtle tightening taking place. So, I don't\nwant to call our shot just yet, because I'd like to understand just how much tighter it gets as we\ngo through this peak season. But it is our expectation as we look into 2025 that the time for rates\nto be going up is upon us. The question is the magnitude, and I think it's too early to tell.\nRavi Shanker\nUnderstood. Thanks, Derek.\nDerek Leathers\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group\nThanks. Good afternoon. I think the last couple quarters you've talked about modest sequential\nmargin improvement, which is how it's played out. I don't know, Derek, any thoughts there on\nhow to think about the margins Q3 to Q4? And then can you just clarify? I thought I heard that\nDedicated fleet might be lower in Q4, but the One-Way fleet higher. That feels like a change from\nlast couple quarters of trends. I just want to make sure I heard that right.\nDerek Leathers\nYes, I'll start with the latter part of that question, Scott, which is relative to Dedicated. So, I think\nthe issue in Dedicated right now as we look at Q4 is we know and have decided on a couple of\nfinal exits where we don't believe the profile fits our long-term pricing discipline or our long-term\nalignment relative to a couple of customers and what their expectations are.\nAs a result of that, but at the same time, add-backs starting to happen within Dedicated, it's very\ndifficult to predict exactly where that fleet lands, because what happens is we're starting the early\nsigns, and this is what you always see in the early signs of a turn, to start seeing individual\nDedicated fleets adding capacity back, adding trucks back in, and they may or may not offset a\ncouple of known exits that we've decided upon. So that's the white noise perhaps you're picking\nup in trying to understand what's happening there.\nAs it relates to One-Way, it has more to do with two things. One, proper retention of some of\nthose quality drivers in the short-term, because our pipeline in Dedicated remains robust and so\nWerner Enterprises, Inc.\nTuesday, October 29, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n10\nthere are temporary placements where you want to protect and preserve the relationship with\nsome very high-quality drivers we have in those fleets.\nAnd then secondly, but equally important, is as we go into peak and conversations we're having\nwith customers, it's about right sizing the fleet on a very temporary basis to be able to serve our\ncustomers and really participate in kind of that opportunity to both serve, but also at more of a\npremium rate environment over the standard contract language where we're needed. So, we're\noptimistic about that. It's not a change in strategy, and it is not a long-term read-through, I can\nassure you.\nOn the first part of your question on margins, look, we're battling away every day and we've been\nvery careful to word it as moderate. I think that's still the same theme. Chris referenced a very\nabnormal health insurance quarter that hit us in Q3, that's why we called it out. Absent that, the\noperational improvements have continued to take place. The moderate margin improvements\nhave continued to take place. We expect to be able to continue to see that as we go into Q4. But\nwe're early in the peak season.\nThe dialogues are good. Several commitments have landed, there's others still being worked,\nbut it will be moderate because we do still have the macro, which it's hard to own the macro at a\npoint like this in the cycle. And instead, it's going to be focusing on things like the productivity\ngains we've made and now being able to put those to work in a little bit of a higher-rate\nenvironment, the improvements we've made in optimization and collapsing around core\ncustomers that look at their supply chain as a competitive advantage, and then maintaining pricing\ndiscipline, which will come potentially at the expense of fleet size. But we believe that at this\npoint, that's the right move, given that there is better times on the horizon relative to market\nconditions.\nScott Group\nThat's helpful. And just lastly, I haven't really heard anyone talk about the November 18th deadline\nwith the Clearinghouse, so maybe it's not a big deal. But just wondering your take, Derek, if you\nthink this matters from a capacity standpoint for the industry going forward.\nDerek Leathers\nI think it certainly could. It depends on how that implementation, if that implementation happens.\nAnd I think, Scott, what you're probably hearing in terms of quietness out of the conversations\nwith fleets is a lack of confidence in where that lands, how that lands and the significance of any\nenforcement/implementation.\nI would put it in the same category, for instance, as some tightening of visa requirements that are\ntaking place right now relative to the southern border, that we're very encouraged by, but I'll\nbelieve it when I see it.\nAnd so, if you go from sort of these six-month visa enhancements that drivers can get and then\noperate under a B-1 program, and you reduce that to potentially as short as a 10-day visa, it really\nputs some tightening on capacity because now they really have to do what the law says they\nshould have been doing all along, which is to go into the country, deliver a load, and then exit.\nThat's not what we know is happening in practice.\nSo, there's a couple of potential capacity catalysts or constraining catalysts, I should say, that\nwe're pretty excited about. But, look, it's been a rough couple of years, and so we're not going to\nWerner Enterprises, Inc.\nTuesday, October 29, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n11\nbank on that. We're going to keep our head down, focusing on what we can improve internally,\nbut certainly be excited if we see those things come through.\nScott Group\nThank you, guys. Appreciate the time.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nBrian Ossenbeck\nHey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe, Derek, just to follow up on\nyour last comment there about maybe engineering the One-Way fleet down a little bit more, just\nto obviously the fourth quarter you mentioned is going up, but do you feel like you're at a point,\nwhere you don't need to make any more of those adjustments to kind of drive further utilization or\nis it still maybe a little bit more to go as you continue to shift the mix more towards Dedicated over\ntime as you have been?\nDerek Leathers\nYes, I mean, we've said on prior calls, and I still feel this way, Dedicated as a percent of total fleet\nwill rise further from where it's at today, most likely. We have other alternatives in the One-Way\nmarketplace to provide our customers both with pure Brokerage, as well as Power Only. I think\nwhat they're more interested in is the visibility, the suite of services, the portfolio that we bring to\nthe table.\nBut if we can create efficiencies at their dock with a unified trailer pool, provide seamless service\nand visibility to them along the way, that product continues to gain traction and that's why it's one\nof the fastest growing products in our fleet. So, as it relates to utilization, I want to be clear, these\nutilization miles per truck increase isn't driven by us shrinking the fleet, although obviously a\nsmaller fleet forces more demand through it.\nIt really is the result of ongoing engineering and efforts with some of the tech investments we've\nmade to be able to put trucks in the right position to maximize their miles, which both is good for\nthe driver, it's great for the customer, because on those lanes where we do operate with our own\nequipment, we can further enhance both service, safety and along the way overall productivity.\nSo that's exciting stuff. It's also a reflection of leaning into Mexico cross-border. It's a reflection\nof leaning into harder to serve markets where time sensitivity is paramount. All of those things\ntogether is why we believe that's a sustainable system change that's taking place here that we\ncan hold on to and will mean a heck of a lot more from an operating leverage perspective as rates\nimprove and those additional miles are not such small margin miles.\nSo that's what gives us the excitement that we talk about a stronger foundation going into a market\nturn. It's those things, those operational structural improvements that have been very difficult and\ndon't pay great dividends in a market rate structure like the one we're in today, but pay off in a\nsignificant more, a larger contribution rate as rates improve.\nBrian Ossenbeck\nOkay. And then thanks for that. Just another follow-up maybe on Logistics. Can you give a little\nbit more color in terms of what the levers of profitability you think might be out there? You\nmentioned a few of them, account reduction, cost controls, revenue quality. But I would assume\nsome of that improvement on the profitability side looking to get to would probably just take more\nWerner Enterprises, Inc.\nTuesday, October 29, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n12\nof a stronger, less competitive market. But I don't know how much of that you feel you can get to\nyour goal from more of those self-help levers or what really needs a stronger market to get you\nback to that or get you to the single-digit target? Thank you.\nChris Wikoff\nYes, Brian. This is Chris. Maybe a couple of things there. I mean, number one, I think the\nfundamentals in Logistics continue to be strong. We've got high customer retention there, serving\nlarge enterprise customers and there's a number of things on the horizon, near-term and long-\nterm, that we're optimistic about within Logistics, including how we're leveraging the technology\nthere to improve not only how we're going about serving large enterprise customers, but also the\nability to gain more share with small and medium-sized customers within Brokerage.\nSo that's just overall, we're happy with the segment. It continues to be a competitive space,\nchallenging, particularly within Brokerage. But there's continued strength in Power Only within\nthe Truckload Logistics that is continuing to grow double digits and a lot of positive aspects for\nthat. That's becoming just a greater mix of the Truckload Logistics. It's growing domestic and\ncross-border. And again, we're utilizing technology there to capture more overflow from assets\ninto the Power Only business. So, I think that's positive as we go forward.\nAnd then, there are certain actions, we've been taking actions on the cost side. Overall, year-to-\ndate, year-over-year, the SG&A expense within that segment are down 9%, specifically around\nthe personnel cost. Those are down 10% year-over-year. But we're obviously focused on staying\npositive in operating income and gradually expanding the OI margin there. So, we are taking\nadditional actions in terms of, you know, getting further or more lean in the operations as well as\nother aspects improvements in Final Mile and some other actions that we are taking. So, a lot\nthere, but we are focused on it. And long-term, we feel good about it, but also focused on what\nwe can control in the short term.\nDerek Leathers\nOne of the things I would just add is our tech journey has been most pronounced in the logistic\nspace and that's where we are furthest along. Everything but Final Mile is now residing on our\nEdge TMS platform. We are seeing seat level productivity that gives us strong confidence that\nthere is a lot of cap space if you will at a seat level to be able to grow revenues and grow margin\nover time through higher seat level contribution rates. And so, we are excited about that. We\nneed the volume that come along with it, and we needed to make sure we didn't over cut, or build\na bridge too far when we feel as though we are as close as we are to a stronger market. So when\nall that comes together that's something that gives us a lot of encouragement looking forward.\nBrian Ossenbeck\nOkay. Thanks very much guys.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nJeff Kauffman\nThank you very much. I wanted to focus a little bit more on pivoting for growth and longer term.\nI guess two parts to this. Number one, the driver market and not just getting drivers but quality\ndrivers. How long will it take you to pivot to grow, if let's say, you start to see the things you want\nto see in first quarter, second quarter, next year.\nWerner Enterprises, Inc.\nTuesday, October 29, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n13\nAnd then separate from that fleet planning with all the new CARB regulations and the ’27 EPA\nout there. How do you feel about managing fleet age and your ability to navigate growth over the\nnext 18 to 24 months.\nDerek Leathers\nYes, great question. So, let's start with the driver side. First off, this is where our school network\nand our vertically integrated approach to developing high quality drivers is a true asset. It's one\nof the toughest areas over the last couple of quarters because financially, it obviously\nunderperforms when you are shrinking your fleet or even holding your fleet stagnant. That creates\na cost overhang that's real, and tough decisions have to be made. It's my belief that having to\ncurtail that capability for short-term gain would have been a major strategic error.\nWe feel very good about our ability in a stronger market. If we are in a position where we need\nto grow, specifically Dedicated, and add to those fleets and do so in short order, not only do we\nget the benefit of having larger fleet and under long-term contracts and higher margin profile, but\nwe also improve and get some self-help on the school side through greater throughputs. That\nnetwork is built to produce, you know, a larger driver count than what it's being asked to produce\ntoday both for Werner and the industry.\nThe demand for those high-quality drivers increases kind of right alongside overall market\ndemand and the folks coming through those schools both perform better financially because less\nbad debt, less other kind of other negative issues that go along with a market that maybe isn't as\nrobust from a hiring perspective because remember, roughly half of those graduates end up at\nWerner but about half of them end up in industry placements. Not all driving trucks by the way but\nwhether that be busses or other activities and across the board that demand has been off, and\nso we feel really good about our ability to respond from the driver side.\nAs far as the fleet age and all of the emission changes, I love our positioning there. So that's one\nof these areas that's underappreciated. It doesn't matter much when the financial results aren't\nwhere everybody would like to see them, but the fact that we haven't aged out that fleet and have\na bunch of sort of fleet, you know, age debt if you will, where we got to go out and spend tons of\nmoney to refresh it and prepare it for potential emission changes puts us in a very unique position.\nIt allows us to use CapEx to grow if growth is there for the taking, particularly on Dedicated again,\nI want to reinforce that, without having to have outsize CapEx just to try to get our fleet age down\nto where we would traditionally want it.\nSo, I think we are in a great position. Our testing on all of the above as it relates to different\nmission and hand seen technologies is at the forefront. So, we are testing electric. We have got\na hydrogen beta test underway right now. We are going to know and be as knowledgeable as\nanyone on how we can work through that.\nAnd then lastly, you mentioned how will tech enable us as it relates to network design and some\nof these emission changes. And I think us, like others, are looking at all kinds of creative solutions\nas to how fleets might manage which trucks and how often they go into an out of certain regions\nand geographies. And I think that our ongoing Edge TMS journey uniquely positions us to be able\nto handle that very, very well and to be able to use some of these engineered solutions to design\nfleets within fleets, to be able to both comply but not be over exposed to some technologies that\nare very much still yet to be proven. So, we will be able to manage it I think well, and I like the\npositioning overall.\nWerner Enterprises, Inc.\nTuesday, October 29, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n14\nChris Wikoff\nAnd Jeff, I would just add one more comment to that back to your first question around the schools\nand the drivers. During this down-cycle, we have increased our school network in those locations\nby call it about 50%. We’ve added several locations over the last couple of years which might\nsound counter intuitive in the down-cycle to be investing in that area, but it does take a couple of\nyears to create awareness of those schools being in certain geographies. So, we've taken some\nof the investment and pain in doing that despite a down-cycle. And so, we even more positioned\nnow for this up-cycle with 50% more schools in key geographies than we've been in the past.\nJeff Kauffman\nThank you very much.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Jason Seidel with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJason Seidel\nThanks Operator. Hey, Derek. Hey, Chris. Hope you guys are doing well. Two quick things.\nYou talked about getting some sequential rate increases, I think, here on the contractual side.\nHow should we think about the upcoming bid season and what do you think you guys need to get\nto make sure that you can secure some earnings growth for 2025?\nAnd then my second question revolves around that $50 million target on the savings side. You\nsaid you guys are well on the way. You said the overwhelming majority is more what you would\nconsider permanent savings. I was wondering if you can maybe drill down a little bit on that, and\njust tell us how much is permanent under that $50 million.\nDerek Leathers\nYes, Jason. Thanks for the question. We are, you know, as I mentioned earlier on the call, it is\ntoo early for us to predict where the rate environment is ultimately going to land as we get firmly\ninto the bid season. What I can tell you is that early returns have been positive. You can see that\nin the fact that we had our first year-over-year improvement in rate per mile in the One-Way\ndivision, in I think seven quarters. We believe we can build upon that momentum as we go into\nQ4. We believe that sets the stage and we've seen through recent events that we are closer to\ntightness than we've been in a long time. Those events being both the port strikes as well as the\nhurricanes and even some of the pull forward on the west coast that may have happened.\nIn all cases, it's driven, kind of, a sudden, immediate and relatively steep reaction in the spot\nmarket. We've seen across our network, our spot pricing now roughly equate to equal to contracts\nand in certain geographies now exceed contract for the first time in a long time. And so, all of that\nare indications of where we are at in the cycle.\nAs we go into this bid season, there is a clear-cut cost need. So, as it relates to cost justifying\nincreases, that's pretty apparent and easy to do across the industry relative to how difficult this\nperiod has been. And then there is the market drivers' where we ultimately will land. I think if you\nlook at the last couple of up-cycles, we've performed head-to-head with the sort of best performers\nas it relates to rate. It's our expectation we will do the same again, it’s just too early to give you\nan exact number.\nJason Seidel\nUnderstood and then on the cost side?\nWerner Enterprises, Inc.\nTuesday, October 29, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n15\nChris Wikoff\nYes, hey, Jason. So again, just recapping, it's almost $100 million over the last two-year period\nfrom these cost saving programs. I think you specifically were just asking about the extent that\nthey are permanent. We've said that well over 60% of these are structural and sustainable and I\nthink as we go forward, there will continue to be a high degree of savings that we are realizing\nand executing on just by their nature are structural and lasting over time.\nThe way that we approach this is really focusing around operational innovation, leveraging\ntechnology as well as M&A integration. So just by the nature of our process, how we go about\nseeking those opportunities and executing on them, how we identify and prioritize those\nopportunities they are just naturally areas that come from change that is lasting and permanent.\nThat's not to say all of them are that way but for sure the vast majority are.\nJason Seidel\nOkay. Fair enough. Appreciate the time, gentlemen.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Imbro\nYes, good evening, guys. I want to step back a bit on the demand backdrop. I think others'\ndiscerning season has sounded more mixed on peak season expectations, but in the prepared\nremarks, you mentioned seeing price opportunities and some underlying improvements though.\nDerek, try to square that away, and square away kind of what you're seeing in the business that\ngives you confidence into a more normal peak season. Is that what you're hearing from your\ncustomers or kind of what you're seeing in the market? Is there any more color on why you'd\nsound maybe more bullish on the fourth quarter?\nDerek Leathers\nYes, I don't know that I want the read through to be that I'm bullish on the fourth quarter. But as it\nrelates to peak, I can't speak to where others are coming from. I don't know what their dialogues\nwith their customer base is. What I know is in our customer base, we believe we're going to have\nboth a price and volume incremental lift this peak season compared to last. Both of those things\nare positive. When you can put them together, they're a little more positive.\nSo that's exciting, but we also know, obviously, that there's ongoing macro headwinds, and peak\nis only a small part of the overall organization as we think about fourth quarter. And so, it's a\nmixed bag, right? But yes, in terms of what's the source of my statements, the source is our\ncustomers. It's our ongoing relationships that we've built over many, many years. It's their\nconfidence in our ability to actually serve that peak and do what we say we're going to do. And\nit's our ability to ask for their support and gain it as it relates to the projects that we've signed up\nfor and we'll be performing and already have begun in some cases to perform.\nSo, you put all that together, that's what gives us the confidence to make the statements I'm\nmaking today. But I'd be remiss if I don't remind everybody that no matter how good peak is, it is\nstill a subset of the overall total network of Werner Enterprises. And so, I'm not saying that it's\ngoing to be some up and to the right major shift from Q3 to Q4, but it does set us up for sort of\nthat moderate sequential improvement as we go forward.\nWerner Enterprises, Inc.\nTuesday, October 29, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n16\nDaniel Imbro\nThat’s helpful. And maybe on the cash flow side, I think you mentioned you might have paused\nbuybacks this quarter, but following up on an earlier question, you invested a lot in the down cycle,\ndriver schools, reinvesting in the fleet. I guess into 2025, Chris, how would you expect CapEx to\ntrend versus this year? Could that actually moderate and still support growth, or is there further\ninvestment needed if we did see a market begin to recover? And then how would share buybacks\nfit into the algorithm?\nChris Wikoff\nYes, Daniel, first on the CapEx side, we certainly have the optionality and capability to invest in\ngrowth, and that is how we first and foremost prioritize capital allocation is reinvesting in the\nbusiness. So, where there's a need to do that, investing in growth, investing in finding ourselves\nin a turn and an up-cycle and needing to do that, we can certainly pull that lever and do that. I\nmean, it's too early to say specifically on what we expect the net CapEx to be for 2025, but\ncertainly we will invest in growth at the appropriate time. By and large, as a percent of revenue,\nour net CapEx has been trending down. And we think that certainly makes sense just as our\nportfolio continues to evolve to be more asset light.\nFrom a share repurchase perspective, we're pleased with the long-term value that we created\nwith the $67 million that we repurchased through the first half of the year. That's modestly\naccretive right now. Obviously, will be more accretive as earnings improve. And we have\nheadroom in our board approved program to lean back into that when it's opportunistic.\nBut we continue to evaluate all of the options in terms of deploying capital across a variety of\ncriteria, how it impacts earnings, how it contributes to our long-term strategy and all of that in the\ncontext of our leverage profile. So, we look at share repurchase, we look at M&A, where we've\nbeen active in looking at opportunities and we'll continue to be balanced in that approach as we\ngo forward.\nDaniel Imbro\nThanks so much.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Eric Morgan with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nEric Morgan\nHey. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the long-term margin\nrange in TTS. It sounds like you're still pretty confident getting back there and appreciate you\noutlining the drivers earlier. Just wondering if you could offer some high-level thoughts, if we sort\nof see an average up cycle from here, something akin to pre-pandemic, do you think you can get\nback in that range within a single cycle or do you think just given where your margins are running\ntoday that it could maybe take a little bit longer?\nDerek Leathers\nYes. I think we're certainly not able to commit that it could be done in a single calendar year, but\na single cycle whereby we see lots of drivers, why this up cycle would certainly be a multiyear\nevent. Those drivers being some of the regulatory environments, some of the emission changes,\nsome of the higher cost of capital, thus a little bit higher barrier-to-entry for the first time in a long\ntime with some of the new engines and emission changes, the ongoing onslaught of sort of\nnuclear verdicts and the risk profile of entering this business from the outside.\nWerner Enterprises, Inc.\nTuesday, October 29, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n17\nThere's lots of different things that make the potential for this up cycle to be a multiyear cycle.\nWe're going to work our tails off to get there as quickly as we can, and I think the timing and pace\nis it's just too early in this cycle to predict. But that's why we've sort of outlined the pillars of that,\nboth in some of the opening presentation, as well as in some of Chris' answers. Happy to\nelaborate on any of those if needed. But it's just a bit premature for us to give great granularity\nto the arrival point in that range.\nChris Wikoff\nBut, Eric, I would just reinforce again, I mean, we're seeing progress. As we go forward just as a\nmarket, the progress is going to be gradual. But we're seeing progress in all of those areas and\nthat's why we have confidence as we kind of dimension each of those building blocks out, that it\ngets us back to that long-term range and we're holding on to that long-term range.\nI mean, we've seen improvement, as we've talked already here on the One-Way side, which is\nprobably the largest contributor of those four building blocks. So, whether you look at spot, supply\nchain disruption lift, some of these early contract increases that we've talked about and then just\nwhat's coming from peak season, I mean, all that contributes to rate improvement from a One-\nWay standpoint. So, there’s progress there.\nThere's progress on the cost savings. It's really on normalization in that Dedicated demand and\nnormalization in the resale market that have a bit more progress for us to start to see overall\nprogress across all four of those pillars. But I think it's beginning.\nEric Morgan\nYes. Appreciate that. And just a quick follow-up on the guidance in Dedicated. You still have the\nzero percent to 3% revenue per tractor for the full year. Any way you can put a finer point on that,\njust given how far along we are in the year. Maybe some puts and takes that might take it up or\ndown from here?\nDerek Leathers\nI think the biggest reason that it's hard to put a finer point on it is that we're in conversations and\nactually have started to add back into Dedicated fleets some of those trucks that have exited\nduring the downturn. So, we've talked for several quarters about fleets that are off three to five,\nfive to eight trucks, and it's really the pace and placement of where they add back that will\ndetermine some of that.\nThere are certain Dedicated fleets that obviously operate at a much higher revenue per truck per\nweek profile, because they have higher utilization rates and others that are equally profitable, but\nhave a much lower utilization rate, therefore, a lower revenue per truck per week. All of that goes\ninto the soup and so it's difficult until we have greater clarity on exactly the pace and placement\nof those trucks to give any finer point than that.\nAgain, I think the takeaway is less about the percentage and more about the activity. And the\nactivity at this point is positive that we're starting to see some of those add backs. And\nunfortunately, in Q4, they're countered by the reality that we have a couple of exits that we've\ndecided to execute on relative to it not meeting our margin and long-term strategic profile that\nwe're looking for.\nEric Morgan\nUnderstood. Appreciate it.\nWerner Enterprises, Inc.\nTuesday, October 29, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n18\nOperator\nAnd the final question today will be from Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee\nHey. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to come back to, Derek, your comments\nabout the fourth quarter and I think you talked about it in the context of margins. Sometimes you\ntalk about it in the context, I think, of earnings as well. I'm just kind of curious how to think about\nthe progression to the fourth quarter.\nI guess, maybe specifically, is the 5 cents sort of these extraordinary cost items that you recognize\nin the quarter? Is that the base that we should be thinking about? So, I just want to make sure\nI'm understanding, like, kind of level set, how we should be expecting kind of the progression from\n3Q to 4Q in a rough sense?\nDerek Leathers\nYes. I think on the 5 cents, the concern I would have there is, I think, early in the call, somebody\nasked, is this a one-time event? While I'd love to be able to predict the future health of all of the\nassociates at Werner. I can't.\nWhat I can tell you is this was a very large anomaly in terms of the small number of very large\nclaims that occurred during the quarter. Because of HIPAA laws and other things, it's not like we\nhave great clarity on what exactly those claims were and are they going to recur or not. It would\nbe our belief that there certainly wouldn't be a repeat at nearly the magnitude because that's what\nhistory would tell us.\nBut it is one of the areas of the business that unfortunately we operate a little bit more blind than\nwe would like just out of privacy laws, HIPAA laws and other things where we'd simply like to be\nable to plan for it if it's an ongoing treatment that's going to extend it further into Q4. So, I don't\nthink it's as easy as just saying, the 5 cents will all come back and that was nothing, a one-and-\ndone situation. But we do believe that a decent proportion of that would likely, based on history,\nnot repeat itself. And then from there, it's just the ongoing grind of all of these operational things\nwe've been talking about continuing to take hold, as well as a potential for a little bit of lift across\nthe normal Q3 to Q4 peak season.\nIt's not yet a robust peak season. I'm not here to say that. I'm just saying in years past, we've\nbeen through a couple of years where we either had more volume but much lower price or perhaps\nprice held up okay, but there just wasn't a lot of peak there to be had. This one is slightly up in\nvolume, slightly up in price. So that has a good setup as we go from Q3 to Q4.\nSo, I guess that's about as good a clarity as I can give you at this point. And on the health side,\nit's just something that's an ongoing battle to try to do everything we can to maintain a healthy\nworkforce. But usually when you see these singular claims that are very large individual amounts,\nit isn't related to ongoing health and wellness. It's related to some sort of unique event that took\nplace and had to be addressed in the U.S. medical system, which is not a place that's got a low\nprice for admission.\nChris Wetherbee\nYes. That's for sure and I appreciate that clarity. That's helpful. And I guess just one other point\non the Dedicated fleet. So, I think your end of period count was above the average and I know it\nsounds like there's some exits that you're making. Do we think about that from the end of period\nfor the third quarter or off of the average number on the Dedicated fleet for 4Q?\nWerner Enterprises, Inc.\nTuesday, October 29, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n19\nDerek Leathers\nYes, great question. I think you think about it from the end of period. I think the end of period\nnumber was actually kind of materially up from the average number, which is really an indication\nof two basic things. One, the landing and implementation of some new business opportunities,\nsaid differently, Dedicated is still open for business and we're still landing new accounts.\nAnd two, the add backs that I've been referring to a few different times during the call where we're\nnow starting to see fleets kind of return to their normal size and shape, because even though\nthese Dedicated contracts are Dedicated in nature and binding, they do have certain levels of\nflexibility to ebb and flow, and as that flow starts to ebb up versus down, you get a lot of natural\nlift, because we have over 160 Dedicated fleets out there, and so when 2s and 3s start adding\nback, it really can add up to real numbers pretty quickly.\nAgain, those are offset in Q4 specifically by a couple of remaining exits that are still in front of us\nthat will be happening. Those are known and it's offset by how many more add backs, as well as\nsome new business coming in into the quarter.\nChris Wetherbee\nOkay. Very helpful.\nChris Wikoff\nYes. And just to be specific, the end of quarter Dedicated fleet from end of Q2 to end of Q3 was\nup 80 trucks, 1.6%. And you're looking at it exactly right, it sounds like. I mean, there was a late\nin the quarter strong push, particularly with large enterprise customers, both expanding existing\nfleets as well as recognizing and implementing some new business. So that was a late push and\nrealization late in the quarter.\nChris Wetherbee\nOkay. That's very helpful. I appreciate the color, guys. Thank you.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question and answer session. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Derek Leathers,\nwho will provide closing comments. Please go ahead, sir.\nCONCLUSION\nDerek Leathers\nYes. Thanks, Gary. I want to thank everybody for being with us today. Despite the difficult\nindustry environment, we've utilized this downturn to try to bolster Werner and invest for our future\npositioning. It'll take time for it to fall to the bottom line, but the ongoing progress in production,\nrevenue per truck, and now this quarter, early signs of rate inflection all lead us to better results\nover time.\nWe remain focused on sustainable cost cutting, but will not starve our strategic investments and\nfleet readiness or our technology roadmap or our commitment to safety and service. We'll\ncontinue to lean into our differentiators, that's Dedicated, Mexico cross-border and a stronger\nLogistics portfolio than we've had previously, all with an eye towards operating leverage as the\nmarket improves.\nI'll close by thanking our over 13,000 associates for their dedication and commitment to our\ncustomers, and frankly, to each other throughout this difficult market. Werner is a structurally\nWerner Enterprises, Inc.\nTuesday, October 29, 2024, 5:00 PM Eastern\n20\nstronger company today with a lot to be excited about moving forward. Thanks for your continued\ninterest and support.\nOperator\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

We are working\nhard to engage all associates and other stakeholders in this work. Below are some examples:\nEDGE-ucation Series\nThis new informational series keeps associates organized and updated about upcoming\ntechnology campaigns.\nInnovation Council\nThis internal, cross-functional group is aimed at advancing the Company’s efficiency, sustainability\nand technological growth in the trucking industry.\nInnovation Podcast Series\nThis informative podcast is ongoing and examines multiple tech topics, allowing drivers to help\nunderstand the Company’s efforts to be at the forefront of technology. The outreach is one of many\nchannels to help communicate with our professional drivers and non-driver associates. Podcast\ntopics cover driver tools, autonomous vehicles, alternative fuel options and more.\nProduct Days\nThis two-day event introduces internal associates to Werner's products and technologies,\nshowcasing their impact on our associates’ daily work.\nWerner launched these initiatives to foster transparent communication and engagement across our\norganization—connecting with professional drivers, office associates and suppliers/vendors on our\nlatest innovation efforts. Through these programs, we aim to promote open, enterprise-wide\ndialogue, inviting questions and encouraging active discussions to ensure everyone is informed and\nengaged in Werner’s journey of continuous innovation.\n17\nWerner's Associate\nOur Commitment to Hiring the Best:\nResource Groups\nBuilding an Inclusive Culture for Success\n(ARGs)\nIn today’s fast-paced job market, securing top talent is essential for staying ahead. At Werner, we believe hiring the best candidates for every position begins with fostering an inclusive\nculture. By embracing inclusion as a core value, we broaden our access to diverse talent pools, driving innovation, enhancing productivity and ensuring long-term business success.\nOur inclusive hiring approach enables us to reach candidates from diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. This helps ensure we never overlook potential talent—whether\nit’s seasoned professionals with years of experience or emerging leaders with fresh ideas. Our hiring process focuses on merit and role fit, allowing us to select the most qualified\nindividuals, which in turn strengthens our teams and accelerates our growth.\nOur commitment to hiring the best candidate for every role has a direct, positive impact on our business. Teams that are made up of individuals with a variety of perspectives are more\nagile, creative and effective in problem-solving. This leads to better decision-making, improved solutions and stronger overall performance.\nOur inclusive efforts have yielded impressive results across the Company:\n16% of our professional drivers are female, compared to the national average of 8%.\nWe also foster inclusion internally by offering associates opportunities to connect through our Associate Resource Groups (ARGs):\n37%\nof our non-driver associates belong to one or more of our 11 ARGs.\nALL\nsenior leaders participate in at least one ARG, ensuring leadership representation and support in fostering an inclusive environment.\nInclusion isn’t just about hiring—it’s about creating an environment where associates feel valued and supported. When associates feel included, they are more likely to stay with the\nCompany, which increases loyalty, engagement and productivity. This leads to greater workforce stability, minimizing the high costs associated with turnover, rehiring and training.\nTo ensure we consistently hire the best candidate for every role, we embed inclusion into every aspect of our hiring process and Company culture. Here’s how we put our\ncommitment into action:\n1.Evaluating Our Practices: We continue to review our hiring processes and internal culture to identify and eliminate any barriers that might prevent top candidates from\napplying or succeeding within the Company.\n2.Merit-Based Selection: Our hiring decisions are guided by a focus on qualifications, skills, and potential—helping to ensure that the best person for each role is always chosen,\nregardless of background.\n3.Developing Inclusive Policies: We maintain policies that support a range of candidate needs, including flexible work arrangements, parental leave and accommodations for\nvarious life circumstances, so that every associate has the opportunity to thrive.\n4.Providing Opportunities for Growth: Our leadership development and mentorship programs help provide associates with clear pathways to success, allowing us to retain top\ntalent and continuously build our leadership from within.\n5.Ongoing Improvement: Inclusion and merit-based hiring are ongoing efforts. We regularly gather feedback and refine our practices to help ensure that we continue to attract\nand hire the best candidates for each role.\nAt Werner, hiring the best candidate for every position is not just a goal—it’s a commitment. By fostering an inclusive culture, we help ensure the most qualified individuals join our\nteam. This approach not only enhances innovation and business performance but also strengthens our competitive advantage. In today’s ever-evolving market, our commitment to\nhiring for excellence ensures we remain successful for the long term.\n18\nWerner Leaders Recognized for\ntheir Sustainability Contributions\nAs part of our strategy to continually support and encourage our associates’ sustainability efforts,\nthe WernerBlue Award was established in recent years to recognize and celebrate associates who\nhelp influence and bring about cultural change in support of ESG initiatives at Werner.

There, she joined the National Cyber Security Director at the White\nHouse to discuss well-paying cybersecurity jobs for veterans and military spouses.\nCelebrating Driving Expertise & Community Spirit at the Inaugural Truck Rodeo\nWerner hosted its inaugural \"Truck Rodeo\" with the Nebraska National Guard, featuring a friendly\ncompetition between their truck driving school students and our experienced drivers.\nAmplifying Our Impact: The 50 Mile March\nLast year, three team members joined the annual 50 Mile March; this year, our participation doubled,\nunderscoring our dedication to veteran mental health. The 50 Mile March Foundation offers vital\nsupport for veterans facing mental health challenges and homelessness.\nHonoring Those Who Have Served\nOver Memorial Day Weekend, more than 100 Werner associates proudly marched in the Omaha\nPatriotic Parade, affirming our commitment to honoring our nation’s veterans. This show of unity\nreflects the pride and solidarity that define the Werner veterans community.\n22\nDedicated to Combatting Human Trafficking\nThis year, we launched our Pathways to Freedom Recognition Program, aimed at encouraging our customers, vendors and\ncarriers to join us in our anti-trafficking efforts. There are three levels of involvement:\n• Trailblazing Partner: Sign Department of Transportation’s (DOT) \"Transportation Leaders Against Human\nTrafficking Pledge.\"\n• Innovation Partner: Sign DOT’s Pledge; create a zero-tolerance company policy; engage professional drivers.\n• Impact Partner: Sign DOT’s Pledge; create a zero-tolerance company policy; engage Truckers Against Trafficking or OUR\nRescue (two organizations working to combat human trafficking); establish human trafficking prevention training at your\norganization.\nWe had several of our customers and suppliers sign up for our recognition program and we will work to grow membership and\nengagement in this inaugural year. Additionally, we successfully raised funds for two organizations working tirelessly to\ncombat human trafficking. This initiative not only provided financial support but also fostered a sense of community and\nshared responsibility among our partners.\nAt Werner, we recognize the critical role our industry plays in combatting this issue due to the nature of where our professional\ndrivers and associates operate—interstate corridors, truck stops and other high-risk areas. Last year, we doubled the training\nhours for our drivers and expanded this crucial education to all office and maintenance associates.\nWerner’s Commitment to Combating Human Trafficking:\nWerner continues to raise the bar in our efforts to prevent human trafficking and educate our associates on how they can\nmake a difference—and ultimately help save lives. The statistics underscore the urgency:\n• 50 million victims globally, with 35% being children, and 50% of those introduced by a family member.1\n• Human trafficking generates $236 billion1 in profits annually.\n• All 50 states have reported cases of trafficking.2\n1 Source: International Labor Organization. 2 Source: National Human Trafficking Hotline.\n23\nDedicated to Combatting\nHuman Trafficking\nWhy it Matters in Transportation:\nAs a key player in the transportation industry, Werner recognizes our sector\nis uniquely positioned to combat human trafficking. By raising awareness\nand training our professional drivers and associates, we can disrupt these\ncriminal activities.\nOur Milestones:\n• 2015: Partnered with Truckers Against Trafficking (TAT) and initiated\ndriver training.\n• 2021: Implemented a zero-tolerance policy, added to associate\nhandbooks and included the National Human Trafficking Hotline in the\nDrive Werner Pro app.\n• 2022: Doubled driver training hours.\n• 2023: Expanded training to all associates, with more than 15,000 total\nhours completed by the Werner team.\n• 2024: Added a Truckers Against Trafficking-wrapped truck to our fleet.\n• Recently: The DOT gave special recognition to Werner in their new 175-\npage report detailing challenges and successes in combating sex and\nforced labor trafficking in the transportation sector.\n• Ongoing Efforts: We will maintain strong collaboration with state and\ngovernment agencies to combat human trafficking. In addition, we are\ncommitted to raising awareness through various channels, including\nsocial media and targeted training campaigns. Key initiatives include\nrecognizing National Human Trafficking Awareness Month every January,\nas well as observing World Day Against Trafficking on July 30.\n24\nBenefits for our Associates\nWerner’s Commitment to Health, Wellness & Community\nAt Werner, we are committed to fostering a culture of health, wellness and community engagement for our associates.

These surveys provide associates with a platform to\nvoice their opinions, concerns and suggestions, which can lead to increased\nengagement and job satisfaction. By actively listening to and acting on this\nfeedback, we can identify areas for improvement, enhance our policies and\npractices and ultimately create a more inclusive and supportive environment.\nThe results from our recent associate survey reflect this commitment:\n• Werner has a greater than 80% favorable overall engagement score.\n• 90% of associates understand how their role contributes to the Company’s\nvision, strategy and goals.\n• More than 80% of people feel proud when they tell people they work for Werner.\n• 87% of associates feel their supervisor cares about them as a person.\nThis feedback highlights the success of our engagement efforts and reinforces why\nWerner was recently voted one of “America’s Best Large Employers” by Forbes.\n26\nIncreasing Associate Engagement\nWe prioritize connecting with all levels of our workforce, which creates a culture of engagement and open\ncommunication. Werner values our associates’ input, recognizing their contributions play an important role in our\ncollective performance. Key initiatives include:\nCustomer Service Appreciation Week\nWerner understands and appreciates the vital role our associates play in exceeding the expectations of our\ncustomers through exceptional service. Each fall, the Company dedicates a week to recognize and celebrate all\nassociates who contribute to our customer service success.\nDriver Appreciation Week\nA week dedicated to celebrating and expressing gratitude to our professional drivers, who play a crucial role in\nkeeping America moving. We go beyond the national week in September, also hosting spring celebrations every April.\nQuarterly Update Meetings\nWe host quarterly meetings to share important Company updates, while also encouraging associates to ask\nquestions directly to executives. These meetings provide an opportunity to gather valuable feedback, contributing\nto associate and driver satisfaction.\nTerminal and Facility Visits\nWerner executives actively engage with professional drivers and associates during regular facility visits, creating\nopportunities for valuable input and promoting a sense of connection with our leadership team. We take the\nfeedback very seriously and are committed to consistently enhancing the overall satisfaction of those who spend\ntime at our various locations.\nThese initiatives reflect Werner's commitment to promoting a positive and inclusive workplace culture where\nevery associate feels valued, heard and informed. By continually engaging with our associates, recognizing their\nachievements and providing opportunities for growth and feedback, we strive to create an environment where\neveryone can help drive our collective success.\n27\nSupported by\nRobust Governance\n& Ethical Practices\nFocus on Data Security Standards\nAs part of our \"Cloud First, Cloud Now\" strategy, we are committed to both sustainability and\ninnovation, ensuring our technological advancements contribute to a better future. A key element of\nthis strategy is the transition to cloud-based solutions, which allows us to reduce the footprint of our\ndata centers, significantly lowering energy consumption and minimizing our environmental impact. By\nmodernizing our tech stack and embracing cloud-based SaaS solutions, we not only enhance\noperational efficiency but also improve agility in serving our customers. Furthermore, our use of AI\nhelps optimize logistics, cutting down on empty miles, reducing carbon emissions and improving driver\nsafety. These initiatives exemplify our dedication to ESG principles, as we continue to evolve our\ntechnology to promote sustainability and responsible business practices.\nIn our \"Cloud First, Cloud Now\" strategy, we focus on driving innovation and the highest standards of\nsecurity. We invest in talent, partnerships and modern tools and processes to protect sensitive data\nacross our operations. With continuous monitoring and cutting-edge technology, we strive to stay\nahead of evolving threats and keep our systems secure and reliable for our customers, partners and\nassociates.\nThis commitment is reinforced by a strong culture of cybersecurity awareness, backed by regular\ntraining, simulations and clear response protocols. Our leadership actively oversees these efforts,\nintegrating security throughout the business. With proactive risk management and collaboration, we\nfoster the trust of our stakeholders to protect their data and keep the business resilient in a fast-\nchanging landscape.\n29\nGetting Ahead of Regulatory\nReporting Changes\nWe have invested in technology to help our customers and ourselves as we prepare for regulatory\nreporting changes. We have invested in both Salesforce’s Net Zero Cloud and Workiva’s ESG\nreporting platform. Combined, these tools bring the ability to have all our environmental\ninformation in one place and allows us to treat this data similarly to how we handle other\nfinancial reporting standards.\nBenefits of Salesforce Net Zero Cloud: a key tool to help with carbon accounting and reporting. We\nhave started by using it for our Scope 1 emissions and are expanding it to our Scope 2 emissions.\nThis will help us meet regulatory reporting requirements. It also consolidates all this information into\none common platform capable of providing real-time insights toward our sustainability goals.\nWe submit our data to CDP and are aligned with both Sustainability Accounting Standards Board\n(SASB) and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). We believe these frameworks\nprovide a common language as we talk about our initiatives with our stakeholders.\nAlso, we started to use Supplier.io which is a popular tool used by our customers. This tool allows us\nto be responsive to customer requests for supplier diversity data by measuring our supplier diversity\nand creating a better understanding of the demographics of our supplier base.\nAs of our 2024 annual stockholders’ meeting, more than half of our top customers have asked us for\nsupplier diversity data for their own tracking reasons. Certain customers require the information\nquarterly for their Tier 2 diversity reporting. It's important to respond accurately to their periodic\ninquiries and mandates. We consider our investment in technology that allows robust supplier\nreporting capabilities to be reasonable and necessary. It helps with customer reporting demands,\nincreasing our visibility to and improving our relationship with major customers that demand supplier\ndiversity data. Our focus is not to create supplier diversity by meeting any diversity targets, it is to\nincrease the competitive pool of vendors from which we draw.\n30\nOur Board of Directors Our leadership and the Board work together to take a measured, thoughtful approach to ESG efforts and\nexpenditures, keeping our focus reasonable and appropriate in the context of customer and investor\ndemands and increasing regulatory requirements.\nOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS TALENTED\nDEREK J.

The Council plays a critical role in helping Werner meet it sustainability goals, by researching and implementing eco-friendly technologies such as electric trucks, hydrogen trucks,\nalternative fuels and other carbon reduction strategies.\nWerner is actively working and has been recognized with various awards in terms of being an inclusive workplace. Werner's inclusive efforts have yielded impressive results across the Company:\n• 16% of our professional drivers are female, compared to the national average of 8%.\n• 18% of our associates are veterans, demonstrating our commitment to hiring individuals with a range of experiences and skills.\n• There are 11 different Associate Resources Groups (ARGs) and 37% of non-driver associates belong to one or more of our 11 ARGs.\n• All senior leaders participate in at least one ARG, ensuring leadership representation and support in fostering an inclusive environment.\nInclusion isn’t just about hiring—it’s about creating an environment where associates feel valued and supported.

Last year, we doubled the training hours for our drivers and expanded this crucial education to all office\nand maintenance associates.\nWe continue to maintain a late-model truck fleet, which allows us to take advantage of the latest technologies to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. Since 2020, we have reduced emissions by 16% and we are on\nthe right path to our goal of reducing carbon emissions by 55% by 2035. We are testing a variety of alternative fuels and alternative vehicles as part of our strategy. In 2024, we created a scorecard for energy usage and\nwaste flows.
