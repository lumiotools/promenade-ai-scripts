Foreign private issuers are exempt from the proxy rules under Rule 3a12-3(b) of the Exchange Act. As such, the Company follows local law proxy solicitation rules rather than U.S. federal or NASDAQ rules regarding proxy solicitation.\n\nYou can review and download the proxy statement and other proxy materials on below links:\n\n[Notice of Annual General Meeting 2023](https://broogeenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Brooge-Energy-Limited-AGM-Notice-2023.pdf)[Download](https://broogeenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Brooge-Energy-Limited-AGM-Notice-2023.pdf)\n\n[Annual General Meeting 2023 – Proxy Card](https://broogeenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Brooge-Energy-Limited-Proxy-Card.pdf)[Download](https://broogeenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Brooge-Energy-Limited-Proxy-Card.pdf)\n\n[Annual General Meeting 2023 – Proxy Statment](https://broogeenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Brooge-Energy-Limited-AGM-Proxy-Statement-2023.pdf)[Download](https://broogeenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Brooge-Energy-Limited-AGM-Proxy-Statement-2023.pdf)\n\n[![](https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_auto,q_glossy,ret_img,w_90,h_91/http://broogeenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/logo-footer.png)](http://broogeenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/logo-footer.png)\n\n _[BPGIC Terminal](https://bpgic.com/)_\n\n _[BPGIC Phase 3](https://bpgicphase3.com/)_\n\n#### Stock Ticker\n\n  * Loading stock data...\n\n\n\n©2021 All Rights Reserved by Brooge Energy Limited.
