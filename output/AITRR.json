AI,” “C3,” or the “Company”) (NYSE: AI), the Enterprise AI application software company, today announced financial results for its fiscal first quarter ended July 31, 2024. \n\n“We had a solid start to the fiscal year, with rising demand for Enterprise AI driving our sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth,” said Thomas M. Siebel, Chairman and CEO, C3 AI. “C3 AI is the original Enterprise AI company. Our unwavering commitment to solving the most challenging problems in the enterprise has led us to what we believe are the highest levels of customer satisfaction in the industry.” \n\n**Fiscal First Quarter 2025 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Revenue:** Total revenue for the quarter was $87.2 million, an increase of 21% compared to $72.4 million one year ago. \n\n\n  * **Subscription Revenue:** Subscription revenue for the quarter was $73.5 million, constituting 84% of total revenue, an increase of 20% compared to $61.4 million one year ago. \n\n\n  * **Gross Profit:** GAAP gross profit for the quarter was $52.2 million, representing a 60% gross margin.

Positive free cash flow of $7.1 million. \n\n\n\n**Business Highlights**\n\nC3 AI made significant progress in broadening our market presence with particularly strong momentum in Manufacturing and State and Local Government. \n\n  * In Q1, the Company closed 71 agreements (an increase of 122% year-over-year) including 52 pilots (an increase of 117% year-over-year). \n\n\n  * The Company significantly expanded its footprint across State and Local Government, closing 25 agreements with municipal, county, and state agencies in Texas, California, New Jersey, Georgia, Washington, Connecticut, Virginia, Rhode Island, Maine, New Mexico, and Florida. \n\n\n  * The Company entered into new agreements with GSK, Eletrobras, Valero, Swift, SmithRx, Sanofi, the U.S. Intelligence Community, the U.S. Department of Defense, Dolce & Gabbana, and Ingersoll Rand, among others. \n\n\n  * C3 AI’s Federal business continues to experience sustained momentum, representing over 30% of bookings for Q1.

Stock-based compensation expense-related charges, including employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions, are impacted by the timing of employee stock transactions, the future fair market value of our common stock, and our future hiring and retention needs, all of which are difficult to predict and subject to constant change. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in the financial statement tables for our historical non-GAAP results included in this press release. Our fiscal year ends April 30, and numbers are rounded for presentation purposes. \n\n**Conference Call Details**\n\nWhat:  |  C3 AI First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Financial Results Conference Call   \n---|---  \nWhen:  |  Wednesday, September 4, 2024  \nTime:  |  2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET  \nParticipant Registration:  |  [https://register.vevent.com/register/BI1316837a59134b1c95643d24f0bb2076](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fregister.vevent.com%2Fregister%2FBI1316837a59134b1c95643d24f0bb2076&esheet=54116794&newsitemid=20240904880249&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fregister.vevent.com%2Fregister%2FBI1316837a59134b1c95643d24f0bb2076&index=12&md5=bf35641ccc956e2af23c9a35faf0bd1d) (live)   \nWebcast:  |  [https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/mefprd7q/](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fedge.media-server.com%2Fmmc%2Fp%2Fmefprd7q%2F&esheet=54116794&newsitemid=20240904880249&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fedge.media-server.com%2Fmmc%2Fp%2Fmefprd7q%2F&index=13&md5=f0ece965db93acdca35bb53a081e4130) (live and replay)   \n  \n**Investor Presentation Details**\n\nAn investor presentation providing additional information and analysis can be found at our investor relations page at [ir.c3.ai](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fir.c3.ai&esheet=54116794&newsitemid=20240904880249&lan=en-US&anchor=ir.c3.ai&index=14&md5=8fe7278bdd800d18b4a5d9cd44e3c912). \n\n**Statement Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe Company reports the following non-GAAP financial measures, which have not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. \n\n  * **Non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP loss from operations, and non-GAAP net loss per share.** Our non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP loss from operations, and non-GAAP net loss per share exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expense-related charges and employer payroll tax expense related to employee stock-based compensation. We believe the presentation of operating results that exclude these non-cash items provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of our operating results and comparison of operating results across reporting periods. \n\n\n  * **Free cash flow**. We believe free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is useful in evaluating liquidity and provides information to management and investors about our ability to fund future operating needs and strategic initiatives. We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs. This non-GAAP financial measure may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Additionally, the utility of free cash flow is further limited as it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balances for a given period. \n\n\n\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We encourage investors to carefully consider our results under GAAP, as well as our supplemental non-GAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand our business. Please see the tables included at the end of this release for the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. \n\n**Use of Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “will” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. Forward-looking statements in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our market leadership position, anticipated benefits from our partnerships, financial outlook, our sales and customer opportunity pipeline including our industry diversification, the expected benefits of our offerings (including the potential benefits of our C3 Generative AI offerings), and our business strategies, plans, and objectives for future operations.

Some of these risks are described in greater detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, and other filings and reports we make the Securities and Exchange Commissions from time to time, including our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that will be filed for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2024, although new and unanticipated risks may arise. The future events and trends discussed in this press release may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, achievements, or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will occur.

A reliable manufacturing footprint is a more sustainable manufacturing footprint. Our growth strategy is directly linked to running our assets reliably,” said Melanie Kalmar, Corporate Vice President, Chief Information Officer and Chief Digital Officer, Dow. \n\n“Shell has worked with C3 AI and Microsoft over the last seven years to help us take our AI capabilities to scale,” said Dan Jeavons, Vice President, Digital Innovation, Shell. “Our co-innovation with C3 AI and Microsoft Azure has helped us develop solutions like predictive maintenance which are now rolled out widely across our enterprise, monitoring thousands of pieces of equipment every day. Seeing solutions like this become standard products on Azure is an enabler for digital transformation.” \n\nSince first entering a strategic alliance in 2018, Microsoft and C3 AI have partnered to deliver Enterprise AI solutions at-scale to some of the world’s largest organizations including Dow, Shell, and Nucor, among others. \n\nFor more information on C3 AI on Microsoft Azure, visit: [https://c3.ai/partners/microsoft-azure-partnership/](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fc3.ai%2Fpartners%2Fmicrosoft-azure-partnership%2F&esheet=54154572&newsitemid=20241119179010&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fc3.ai%2Fpartners%2Fmicrosoft-azure-partnership%2F&index=4&md5=5f06b09210dd3a3e230106877c5513bc). \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241119179010r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241119179010/en/>\n\n**C3 AI Public Relations** Edelman Lisa Kennedy 415-914-8336 pr@c3.ai\n\n**Investor Relations**ir@c3.ai\n\nSource: C3.ai\n\n[ View all news ](/news)\n\n## Contact Us\n\nIR@C3.ai\n\n## Quick Links\n\n## Investor Email Alerts\n\nEmail Address *  \n---  \n  \n[Unsubscribe](/unsubscribe)\n\n×\n\nSearch for:\n\n![](https://id.rlcdn.com/464526.gif)![](https://t.co/1/i/adsct?bci=4&dv=Asia%2FCalcutta%26en-US%26Google%20Inc.%26Win32%26255%261920%261080%2616%2624%261920%261080%260%26na&eci=3&event=%7B%7D&event_id=d3000f09-dae2-4cd2-89ba-68b1ffa8bc59&integration=advertiser&p_id=Twitter&p_user_id=0&pl_id=9e6bf563-1370-41cd-a44a-685e702cb6e5&tw_document_href=https%3A%2F%2Fir.c3.ai%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fc3-ai-and-microsoft-forge-strategic-alliance-accelerate&tw_iframe_status=0&txn_id=nyk3g&type=javascript&version=2.3.31)![](https://analytics.twitter.com/1/i/adsct?bci=4&dv=Asia%2FCalcutta%26en-US%26Google%20Inc.%26Win32%26255%261920%261080%2616%2624%261920%261080%260%26na&eci=3&event=%7B%7D&event_id=d3000f09-dae2-4cd2-89ba-68b1ffa8bc59&integration=advertiser&p_id=Twitter&p_user_id=0&pl_id=9e6bf563-1370-41cd-a44a-685e702cb6e5&tw_document_href=https%3A%2F%2Fir.c3.ai%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fc3-ai-and-microsoft-forge-strategic-alliance-accelerate&tw_iframe_status=0&txn_id=nyk3g&type=javascript&version=2.3.31)\n"
