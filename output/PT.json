At the same time, even amidst fluctuations in the market risks resulting from the sluggish macroeconomic recovery, we have adhered to a prudent risk management approach, enabling us to maintain stability and healthy asset quality in this challenging environment. We believe that lean financial performance and high-quality assets are fundamental to capturing long-term opportunities.\"\n\n\"Looking forward, we are committed to focusing on our core strategy, which is to prioritize financial stability and risk management to sustain solid growth in an uncertain macro environment. We remain dedicated to delivering financial digitization solutions to our business partners, financial partners, and end customers. The sustainable and quality-based development will continue to be the path we uphold. To achieve this goal, we will keep solidifying our competencies in overall risk management, attracting customers and strengthening partnerships, expanding our business, and refining operations while implementing cost-effective initiatives.\" Mr. Huang concluded.\n\n**First Half 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**_Revenues_**\n\nTotal revenues decreased by 57.47% to RMB14.92 million (US$2.09 million) for the first half of 2024 from RMB35.09 million for the same period of 2023.\n\n  * Revenues from technical service fees decreased by 86.6% to RMB2.66 million (US$0.37 million) for the first half of 2024 from RMB19.83 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease in revenues from technical service fees was mainly due to the gradual reduction of such business based on our overall operation realignment.\n  * Revenues from installment service fee decreased by 13.7% to RMB6.49 million (US$0.91 million) for the first half of 2024 from RMB7.53 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease in revenues from installment service fee was mainly due to the decrease in volume of both new and outstanding small and medium enterprises (\"SMEs\") loans under current marketing environment in the first half of 2024.\n  * Revenues from wealth management service fees decreased by 25.3% to RMB5.77 million (US$0.81 million) for the first half of 2024 from RMB7.73 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease in revenue of the wealth management was mainly due to that the new regulation issued by Chinese regulatory authority on insurance brokerage business which led to a scarcity of insurance products that comply with the new regulation and in turn caused the decrease in insurance brokerage business and revenue.\n\n\n\n**_Cost of Revenues_**\n\nCost of revenues decreased by 80.51% to RMB6.02 million (US$0.85 million) for the first half of 2024 from RMB30.88 million for the same period of 2023. This decrease was mainly attributable to:\n\n  * _Funding cost._ Funding cost mainly consists of interest expense the Company pays in relation to the funding debts to fund its financing receivables. Funding cost decreased RMB9.31 million to nil compared to funding cost of RMB9.31 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease was due to that we recorded interest expenses of RMB9.31 million during the first half of 2023, which was mainly represents an out-of-period adjustments amount to RMB9.31 million from prior years.\n  * _Reversal/(provision) of credit losses._ Provision of credit losses of RMB1.73 million (US$0.24 million) in first half of 2024 compared to reversal of credit losses of RMB0.38 million in the same period of 2023.\n  * _Origination and servicing cost._ Origination and servicing cost decreased by 78.8% to RMB5.05 million (US$0.71 million) compared to RMB23.86 million in the same period of 2023, which was mainly due to the decreased in revenue from technical services fees and its corresponding costs.\n\n\n\n**_Gross Profit_**\n\nGross profit increased to RMB8.90 million (US$1.25 million) for the first half of 2024 from RMB4.21 million for the same period of 2023. Gross margin was 59.66% in the first half of 2024 compared to 11.99% in the same period of 2023.\n\n**_Operating Expenses_**\n\nTotal operating expenses increased by 1.3% to RMB16.51 million (US$2.32 million) for the first half of 2024 from RMB16.30 million for the same period of 2023. The Company has been continuously optimizing and refining its organizational structure, marketing strategies and product matrix since the beginning of 2024.\n\n  * Sales and marketing expenses in the first half of 2024 increased by 0.3% to RMB8.54 million (US$1.20 million) from RMB8.51 million in the same period of 2023. This increase was primarily due to the addition of sales and marketing personnel to expand our Wealth Management Solutions services and business.\n  * General and administrative expenses in the first half of 2024 increased by 12.8% to RMB5.71 million (US$0.80 million) from RMB5.06 million in the same period of 2023. This increase was primarily driven by the reversal of share-based compensation in first half of 2023, which was an out-of-period adjustments from prior years and no such adjustments were recorded in first half of 2024.\n  * Research and development expenses in the first half of 2024 decreased by 17.0% to RMB2.26 million (US$0.32 million) from RMB2.73 million in the same period of 2023, primarily due to personnel structure optimization as part of the business transformation of the Company.\n\n\n\n**_Loss from operations_**\n\nLoss from operations decreased by 37.1% to RMB7.61 million (US$1.07 million) for the first half of 2024 from RMB12.09 million for the same period of 2023.\n\n**_Other income and expenses_**\n\nOther expenses, net decreased by 99.4% to RMB0.28 million (US$0.04 million) for the first half of 2024 from RMB45.59 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in impairment loss of long-lived assets of RMB3.74 million, decrease of interest expense of RMB4.41 million and the decrease in loss of RMB38.88 million from disposal of Sky City Holding Limited and eight of its subsidiaries in May 2023.\n\n**_Income tax (expense)/benefit_**\n\nIncome tax expense was recorded as RMB0.46 million for the first half of 2024 compared to income tax benefit of RMB11.38 million recorded for the first half of 2023.\n\n**_Net loss_**\n\nAs a result of the foregoing, net loss was recorded RMB8.34 million (US$1.17 million) for the first half of 2024 compared to RMB46.30 million recorded for the same period of 2023.\n\nNet loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was recorded RMB8.43 million (US$1.18 million) for the first half of 2024 compared to net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of RMB44.86 million recorded for the same period of 2023.\n\nAdjusted net loss was RMB8.34 million (US$1.17 million) for the first half of 2024 compared to RMB65.50 million for the same period of 2023.\n\n**_Net Loss Per Share_**\n\nBasic and diluted net loss per ordinary share in the first half of 2024 were both RMB0.02 (US$0.00). Basic and diluted net loss per American Depositary Share (\"ADS\") in the first half of 2024 were both RMB0.53 (US$0.07). Each ADS represents thirty-five of the Company's Class A ordinary shares.\n\nAdjusted basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share in the first half of 2024 were both RMB0.02 (US$0.00). Adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ADS in the first half of 2024 were both RMB0.53 (US$0.07).\n\n**_Balance Sheet_**\n\nThe Company has combined cash and cash equivalents and long-term restricted cash of RMB53.42 million (US$7.50 million) as of June 30, 2024, compared to RMB45.51 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**_Going Concern_**\n\nThe Company acknowledged that there were recurring losses from operation since year 2019. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company reported a net loss of RMB8.34 million (US$1.17 million). In addition, as of June 30, 2024, the Company reported a negative working capital of RMB388.96 million (US$54.58 million) and had an accumulated deficit of RMB2,520.97 million (US$353.73 million). The Company's operating results in future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties, and it is uncertain whether the Company will be able to reduce or eliminate its net loss in the foreseeable future. In order to alleviate the pressure on capital turnover, the Company has reached an agreement with a third-party institution to obtain a line of credit facility with an amount up to US$40 million with annual interest rate of 7% if used, which is effective until September 30, 2025.\n\nDue to the unpredictable future of the capital markets and the industry in which we operate, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in achieving its budget goals, that the Company's future capital raising will be sufficient to support its ongoing operations, or that any additional financing will be available in a timely manner or with acceptable terms, if at all. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient financing or events or circumstances occur such that the Company does not meet its budget goals, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and ability to achieve its intended business objectives. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business are dependent on, among other things, the Company's ability to operate profitably, to generate cash flows from operations, and to pursue financing arrangements to support its working capital requirements.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn evaluating its business, the Company considers and uses adjusted net income/loss as a supplemental measure to review and assess its operating performance. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company defines adjusted net income/loss as net income/loss excluding share-based compensation expenses and income tax benefit recognized due to reversal of uncertain tax position.\n\nThe Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure can help management evaluate the Company's operating performance and formulate business plans. Adjusted net income/loss enables management to assess operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses and income tax benefit recognized due to reversal of uncertain tax position. The Company also believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information about its operating results, enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allows for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by management in their financial and operational decision-making.\n\nThis non-GAAP financial measure is not defined under U.S. GAAP and is not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool. One of the key limitations of using adjusted net income/loss is that it does not reflect all items of income and expenses that affect the Company's operations. The Company will continue to incur share-based compensation expenses in its business, which are reflected in the presentation of its adjusted net income/loss. Further, this non-GAAP financial measure may differ from non-GAAP financial information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore its comparability may be limited.\n\nThe Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, net income/loss, which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. The Company encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\n**Exchange Rate**\n\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (\"USD\") at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise stated, all translations from RMB to USD were made at the rate of RMB7.1268 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in effect on June 28, 2024, in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board.

However, when preparing the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company noted the following errors were made inadvertently: 1) the cumulative foreign currency translation loss (recorded as accumulated other comprehensive loss) related to SCHL Group of RMB45.59 million should be treated as loss from disposal of SCHL Group which increased our net loss from RMB0.71 million to a net loss of RMB46.30 million; and 2) the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary included in SCHL Group of RMB139.34 million should be treated as other payable to non-controlling interest holders which increased accrued expenses and other liabilities from RMB 30.20 million to RMB 169.54 million and decreased the non-controlling interest from RMB 153.47 million to RMB 14.12 million. The complete, corrected release follows:\n\n### PINTEC ANNOUNCES UNAUDITED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2023\n\nBEIJING, May 6, 2024 /[PRNewswire](http://www.prnewswire.com/)/ -- Pintec Technology Holdings Limited (Nasdaq: PT) (\"Pintec\" or the \"Company\"), a Nasdaq-listed company providing technology enabled financial and digital services to micro, small and medium enterprises ecosystem, today announced its unaudited financial results for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n\n**First Half 2023 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Total revenues were RMB35.09 million (US$4.86 million) for the first half of 2023 compared to total revenues of RMB39.82 million for the same period of 2022.\n  * Gross profit decreased by 79.48% to RMB4.21 million (US$0.58 million) for the first half of 2023 from RMB20.51 million for the same period of 2022.

We believe that sustainable quality-based development is valuable.\" Mr. Huang concluded.\n\n**First Half 2023 Financial Results**\n\n**_Revenues_**\n\nTotal revenues decreased by 11.89% to RMB35.09 million (US$4.86 million) for the first half of 2023 from RMB39.82 million for the same period of 2022.\n\n  * Revenues from technical service fees decreased by 17.90% to RMB19.83 million (US$2.75 million) for the first half of 2023 from RMB24.16 million for the same period of 2022. The decrease in revenues from technical service fees was mainly due to we ceased the risk-sharing loan facilitation business.\n  * Revenues from installment service fee decreased by 16.55% to RMB7.53 million (US$1.04 million) for the first half of 2023 from RMB9.02 million for the same period of 2022. The decrease in revenues from installment service fee was mainly due to the decrease in volume of SMEs loans in the first half of 2023.\n  * Revenues from wealth management service fees increased by 16.32% to RMB7.73 million (US$1.07 million) for the first half of 2023 from RMB6.64 million for the same period of 2022. The increase in revenue of the wealth management was mainly due to increased revenue generated from our insurance brokerage service business.\n\n\n\n**_Cost of Revenues_**\n\nCost of revenues increased by 59.90% to RMB30.88 million (US$4.27 million) for the first half of 2023 from RMB19.31 million for the same period of 2022. This increase was mainly attributable to:\n\n  * _Funding cost._ Funding cost mainly consists of interest expense the Company pays in relation to the funding debts to fund its financing receivables. Funding cost increased RMB 9.28 million to RMB9.31 million (US$1.29 million) compared to funding cost of RMB0.03 million in the same period of 2022. We recorded interest expenses of RMB9.31 million during the first half of 2023, which was mainly represents an out-of-period adjustments amount to RMB9.30 million from prior years. In July 2018, Minheng, a subsidiary of our variable interest entity, entered into loan agreements with a shareholder of ours (the \"Lender\"), these loans have principal amount of RMB190 million, and the annual interest rates are 10.3%, which are similar to market interest rate. In August 2018, Minheng and the Lender entered into a supplementary agreement which changed the interest rates, retroactive to the first date of each loan, to 0.6%. The differences of interest expenses between the market interest rate and the actual rates amount to RMB9.30 million was deemed as contribution by the shareholder to the Company, which was an out-of-period adjustments to correct prior period errors relating to recording the additional paid-in capital and funding cost.\n  * _Reversal of credit losses._ Reversal of credit losses of RMB0.38 million (US$52 thousand) in first half of 2023 compared to provision for credit losses of RMB0.94 million in the same period of 2022, which was mainly due to collection of financial receivables exceeding the credit losses accrued during the first half of 2023.\n  * _Origination and servicing cost._ Origination and servicing cost increased by 27.76% to RMB23.86 million (US$3.30 million) compared to RMB18.67 million in the same period of 2022, which was mainly due to the increased cost of insurance brokerage services and credit assessment services.\n  * _Recover on guarantee._ Recover on guarantee increased by 422.80% to RMB1.90 million (US$0.26 million) compare to RMB0.36 million in the same period of 2022, as we purposely and gradually ceased providing credit enhancement for loans that we facilitated with any financial partners from 2020 in order to improve the overall quality of our off-balance-sheet loans, which lead to the increase of reimbursement for defaulted loans being outpaced by the recovery of reimbursement for defaulted loans in 2022 and 2023.\n  * _Service cost charged by the related party._ We had service cost charge by the related party of RMB0.03 million and nil for the first half of 2022 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily attributable to the expiration of the loan facilitated under risk-sharing model with Jimu Group, a related party.\n\n\n\n**_Gross Profit_**\n\nGross profit decreased to RMB4.21 million (US$0.58 million) for the first half of 2023 from RMB20.51 million for the same period of 2022. Gross margin was 11.99% in the first half of 2023 compared to 51.50% in the same period of 2022.\n\n**_Operating Expenses_**\n\nTotal operating expenses decreased by 62.96% to RMB16.30 million (US$2.26 million) for the first half of 2023 from RMB44.00 million for the same period of 2022. The Company has been continuously optimizing and refining its organizational structure, marketing strategies and product matrix to reduce expenses since the beginning of 2023.\n\n  * Sales and marketing expenses in the first half of 2023 decreased by 38.72% to RMB8.51 million (US$1.18 million) from RMB13.89 million in the same period of 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in payroll cost.\n  * General and administrative expenses in the first half of 2023 decreased by 74.15% to RMB5.06 million (US$0.70 million) from RMB19.57 million in the same period of 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by 1) the reversal of share-based compensation expense of RMB6.87 million; and 2) strict overall cost control for the reduction of various items including, among other things, professional services fees and payroll cost. The reversal of share-based compensation expense was RMB6.9 million during the first half of 2023 based on the actual forfeiture rate, which was an out-of-period adjustments from prior years.\n  * Research and development expenses in the first half of 2023 decreased by 74.13% to RMB2.73 million (US$0.38 million) from RMB10.54 million in the same period of 2022, primarily due to personnel structure optimization as part of the business transformation of the Company.\n\n\n\n**_Loss from operations_**\n\nLoss from operations decreased by 48.54% to RMB12.09 million (US$1.67 million) for the first half of 2023 from RMB23.49 million for the same period of 2022.\n\n**_Other income and expenses_**\n\nOther expenses, net decreased by 53.81% to RMB45.59 million (US$6.31 million) for the first half of 2023 from RMB98.70 million for the same period of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in impairment loss of long-term investments of RMB86.60 million and the increase in loss of RMB38.88 million from disposal of Sky City Holding Limited and eight of its subsidiaries (collectively, \"SCHL Group\") in May 2023.\n\n**_Income tax (expense)/benefit_**\n\nIncome tax was recorded as income tax benefit of RMB11.38 million (US$1.57 million) for the first half of 2023 compared to income tax expense of RMB1.41 million recorded for the first half of 2022. It was primarily attributable to the income tax benefit of RMB12.32 million (US$1.71 million) arose from the derecognition of income tax payable accrued in 2017, which now has passed the five-year statute of limitations and our tax filling in 2017 is no longer under examination by the PRC tax authority.\n\n**_Net loss_**\n\nAs a result of the foregoing, net loss was recorded RMB46.30 million (US$6.41 million) for the first half of 2023 compared to RMB123.60 million recorded for the same period of 2022.\n\nNet loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was recorded RMB44.86 million (US$6.21 million) for the first half of 2023 compared to net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of RMB122.04 million recorded for the same period of 2022.\n\nAdjusted net loss was RMB65.50 million (US$9.07 million) for the first half of 2023 compared to RMB119.22 million for the same period of 2022.\n\n**_Net Loss Per Share_**\n\nBasic and diluted net loss per ordinary share in the first half of 2023 were both RMB0.10 (US$0.01). Basic and diluted net loss per American Depositary Share (\"ADS\") in the first half of 2023 were RMB3.62 (US$0.50) and RMB3.61 (US$0.50), respectively. Each ADS represents thirty-five of the Company's Class A ordinary shares.\n\nAdjusted basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share in the first half of 2023 were both RMB0.15 (US$0.02). Adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ADS in the first half of 2023 were RMB5.17 (US$0.72) and RMB5.16 (US$0.71), respectively.\n\n**_Balance Sheet_**\n\nThe Company has combined cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash of RMB19.46 million (US$2.69 million) as of June 30, 2023, compared to RMB256.21 million as of December 31, 2022.\n\n**_Out-of-period adjustment_**\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an out-of-period adjustment to correct previous period errors relating to accounts receivable of RMB6.05 million (US$0.84 million). For six months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded an out-of-period adjustment to correct previous period errors relating to reclassification of additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficits of RMB7.69 million (US$1.06 million). We evaluated the impacts of the out-of-period adjustment to correct the errors for the year ended December 31, 2022, for the six months ended June 30, 2023, and for previous periods, both individually and in the aggregate, and concluded that the adjustments were not material to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, for the six months ended June 30, 2023, and all impacted periods.\n\nWe recorded two out-of-period adjustments to correct previous period errors relating to: (1) Cost of revenues and additional paid-in capital of RMB9.30 million (US$1.29 million); (2) General and administration expense and additional paid-in capital of RMB6.87 million (US$0.95 million). The net effect on net loss is RMB2.43 million (US$0.34 million). We evaluated the impacts of the out-of-period adjustment to correct the errors for the year ended December 31, 2022, for the six months ended June 30, 2023, and for previous periods, both individually and in the aggregate, and concluded that the adjustments were not material to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 and material for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n\n**_Disposal of SCHL Group_**\n\nOn May 26, 2023, the Company entered into an equity transfer agreement with Otov Alfa Holdings Limited (\"Otov Alfa\"), a British Virgin Islands business company designated by Ningxia Fengyin Enterprise Management Consulting LLP (\"Ningxia Fengyin\"), under which the Company transferred 100% of its equity interest in subsidiaries including Sky City Holding Limited, and its subsidiaries (collectively \"SCHL Group\") to Otov Alfa, at nil consideration (the \"Deconsolidation\"), in order to settle all outstanding convertible loan owed by the Group to Ningxia Fengyin. SCHL Group mainly served as a holding company for a group of investment companies with no material operations, and meanwhile, as the obligator of the outstanding convertible loan and interest. The Deconsolidation of SCHL Group was not a strategic shift as it has no material impact on the Group's business, therefore it was not qualified as discontinued operation. Upon the completion of the Deconsolidation, the control of SCHL Group was transferred to Otov Alfa on May 30, 2023 (the \"Closing Date\"), and the assets and liabilities of SCHL Group, including the outstanding convertible loan and interest payable, cash in bank, property and some other assets and liabilities with a net liability balance of RMB6.71 million were transferred to Otov Alfa, resulting in settlement of the outstanding convertible loan and a gain from disposal of RMB6.71 million. The cumulative foreign currency translation loss (recorded as accumulated other comprehensive loss) related to SCHL Group of RMB45.59 million was released as a loss, with a total loss of RMB38.88 million recognized related to the disposal of SCHL Group for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nThe non-controlling interest in a subsidiary included in SCHL Group of RMB139.34 million is included in the accrued expenses and other liabilities. The investment from the non-controlling interest holder was utilized by the Company in the form of working capital loan to its currently consolidated subsidiaries, VIEs and VIEs subsidiaries and was waived by SCHL Group before Deconsolidation. As the Group is not able to ascertain that the non-controlling interest holder will not claim from the Group for its interest in SCHL Group after the disposal of SCHL Group in the foreseeable future, the Group recognized balance of noncontrolling interest as of the disposal date as other payables due to the non-controlling interest holder upon Deconsolidation. \n\nOn May 26, 2023, as part of the Deconsolidation, the Company entered into a termination agreement with Otov Alfa (\"Warrant Termination Agreement\"), under which the Company and Otov Alfa agree that all terms and provisions in the warrant (which was accounted in the convertible loan together with consideration payable to Ningxia Fengyin) shall be terminated, and all rights and obligations of the relevant parties under the warrant shall be ceased and terminated with immediate effect upon the effectiveness of the Warrant Termination Agreement. The Company had pledged 100% equity interest of one of the consolidated VIE's subsidiary Ganzhou Aixin Network Micro Finance Co., Ltd to Ningxia Fengyin on December 2, 2020 to secure the convertible loan, such pledge was also released upon the Deconsolidation and the termination of the warrant.\n\n**_Going Concern_**\n\nThe Company acknowledged that there were recurring losses from operation since year 2019. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company reported a net loss of RMB46.30 million (US$6.41 million). In addition, as of June 30, 2023, the Company reported a negative working capital of RMB398.90 million (US$55.20 million) had an accumulated deficit of RMB2,478.84 million (US$343.05 million). The Company's operating results in future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties, and it is uncertain whether the Company will be able to reduce or eliminate its net loss in the foreseeable future. In order to alleviate the pressure on capital turnover, the Company has reached an agreement with a third-party institution to obtain a line of credit facility with an amount up to US$ 40 million.\n\nDue to the unpredictable future of the capital markets and the industry in which we operate, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in achieving its budget goals, that the Company's future capital raising will be sufficient to support its ongoing operations, or that any additional financing will be available in a timely manner or with acceptable terms, if at all. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient financing or events or circumstances occur such that the Company does not meet its budget goals, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and ability to achieve its intended business objectives. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business are dependent on, among other things, the Company's ability to operate profitably, to generate cash flows from operations, and to pursue financing arrangements to support its working capital requirements.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn evaluating its business, the Company considers and uses adjusted net income/loss as a supplemental measure to review and assess its operating performance. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company defines adjusted net income/loss as net income/loss excluding share-based compensation expenses and income tax benefit recognized due to reversal of uncertain tax position.\n\nThe Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure can help management evaluate the Company's operating performance and formulate business plans. Adjusted net income/loss enables management to assess operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses and income tax benefit recognized due to reversal of uncertain tax position. The Company also believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information about its operating results, enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allows for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by management in their financial and operational decision-making.\n\nThis non-GAAP financial measure is not defined under U.S. GAAP and is not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool. One of the key limitations of using adjusted net income/loss is that it does not reflect all items of income and expenses that affect the Company's operations. The Company will continue to incur share-based compensation expenses in its business, which are reflected in the presentation of its adjusted net income/loss. Further, this non-GAAP financial measure may differ from non-GAAP financial information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore its comparability may be limited.\n\nThe Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, net income/loss, which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. The Company encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\n**Exchange Rate**\n\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (\"USD\") at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise stated, all translations from RMB to USD were made at the rate of RMB7.2258 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in effect on June 30, 2023, in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board.
