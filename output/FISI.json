Announces Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nOctober 24, 2024\n\nWARSAW, N.Y., Oct. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Financial Institutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: FISI) (the \"Company,\" \"we\" or \"us\"), parent company of Five Star Bank (the \"Bank\") and Courier Capital, LLC (\"Courier Capital\"), today reported financial and operational results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nNet income was $13.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $25.6 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $14.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. After preferred dividends, net income available to common shareholders was $13.1 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $25.3 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2024, and $13.7 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2024 results included $384 thousand of professional services expenses attributed to the deposit-related fraud event disclosed in March 2024 that occurred in the first quarter of 2024. The Company's second quarter 2024 financial results benefited from a $13.5 million pre-tax gain associated with its previously disclosed insurance subsidiary asset sale, and also included $371 thousand of professional services expenses related to the fraud event that were partially offset by a recovery of $143 thousand. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $3.1 million in the current quarter, compared to a provision of $2.0 million in the linked quarter and a provision of $1.0 million in the prior year quarter.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Key Results:**\n\n  * Net interest margin was 2.89% for the third quarter of 2024, up two basis points compared to the second quarter of 2024, while net interest income of $40.7 million decreased by $512 thousand, or 1.2%, from the linked quarter.\n  * Noninterest income was $9.4 million for the current quarter, compared to $24.0 million in the linked quarter, when results benefited from a $13.5 million pre-tax gain associated with the Company's insurance subsidiary asset sale.\n  * Total deposits were $5.31 billion at September 30, 2024, up $173.3 million, or 3.4%, from June 30, 2024, driven by seasonality and new business in our public deposit portfolio and non-public deposit growth. Deposits were relatively flat with September 30, 2023, as a $313.3 million reduction in brokered deposits largely offset year-over-year growth in non-public and public deposits.\n  * Total loans were $4.40 billion at September 30, 2024, reflecting a decrease of $58.5 million, or 1.3%, from June 30, 2024 and a decrease of $28.2 million, or 0.6%, from September 30, 2023.\n  * Noninterest expense of $32.5 million for the current quarter was down $551 thousand, or 1.7%, from the second quarter of 2024 and down $2.3 million, or 6.5%, from the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Regulatory and tangible capital ratios continued to expand on a linked quarter and year-over-year basis.\n  * The Company maintained solid credit quality metrics, as measured by annualized net charge-offs to average loans of 0.15% for the current quarter, compared to 0.10% in the linked quarter and 0.14%, in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n\"Our third quarter results were highlighted by strong deposit growth, incremental net interest margin expansion, solid expense management, and continued build in our regulatory and tangible capital ratios. We remain very focused on driving sustainable growth across each of our retail banking, commercial banking and wealth management business lines. Supporting that focus is our strategic decision to begin to wind-down our Banking-as-a-Service, or BaaS, offerings, announced in September,\" said President and Chief Executive Officer Martin K. Birmingham.\n\n\"While total loans were down during the quarter, as growth in commercial mortgage and stability in residential loans and lines were offset by declines in commercial business and consumer indirect loans, we continue to see excellent opportunity in our geographic markets to drive credit-disciplined loan growth. Our regulatory and tangible capital positions further improved during the quarter, including a common equity tier 1 ratio of 10.28%, up 25 basis points from June 30, 2024 and up 102 basis points from September 30, 2023. Tangible common book value per share(1) grew by 8% and 32% from the end of the linked and year-ago quarters, respectively,\" Mr. Birmingham added.\n\nChief Financial Officer and Treasurer W. Jack Plants II commented, \"We saw further margin expansion on a linked quarter basis and our ability to drive solid deposit growth provided us with capacity to further reduce short-term borrowings during the quarter. From a credit perspective, we did move one commercial relationship to non-performing status during the third quarter, which drove the increase in non-performing assets as compared to June 30, 2024. We remain very confident in the overall health of our loan portfolio and we are comfortable with our reserve levels, as our allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans ratio expanded two basis points during the third quarter to 1.01%. As of September 30, 2024, we have approximately $1.4 billion in available liquidity and more than $1.1 billion in cash flow anticipated in the next 12 months.\"\n\n**Orderly Wind Down of BaaS Offerings**\n\nOn September 16, 2024, the Company announced its intent to begin an orderly wind down of its BaaS offerings, following a careful review by the Company’s executive management and the Board of Directors undertaken in conjunction with its annual strategic planning process. As of September 30, 2024, deposits and loans related to the Bank's BaaS offerings totaled $103 million and $29 million, respectively. The Company continues to preliminarily target completion of the wind down sometime in 2025.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\nNet interest income was $40.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of $512 thousand from the second quarter of 2024, of which $439 thousand was attributable to the impact of the increase in non-performing loans, partially offset by lower funding costs as a result of the Company's reduction of short term borrowings and brokered deposits, and a decrease of $1.0 million from the third quarter of 2023 due primarily to higher funding costs on a year-over-year basis.\n\nAverage interest-earning assets for the current quarter were $5.61 billion, a decrease of $154.2 million from the second quarter of 2024 due to an $84.6 million decrease in the average balance of Federal Reserve interest-earning cash, a $47.8 million decrease in the average balance of investment securities and a $21.8 million decrease in average loans. Average interest-earning assets for the current quarter were $92.4 million lower than the third quarter of 2023 due to an $83.5 million decrease in the average balance of investment securities and a $13.2 million decrease in the average balance of Federal Reserve interest-earning cash, partially offset by a $4.3 million increase in average loans.\n\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities for the current quarter were $4.40 billion, a decrease of $148.3 million from the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to a $97.8 million decrease in average savings and money market deposits, a $49.6 million decrease in average interest-bearing demand deposits, and an $11.0 million decrease in average short-term borrowings, partially offset by a $10.1 million increase in average time deposits. Average interest-bearing liabilities for the third quarter of 2024 were $27.2 million lower than the year-ago quarter primarily due to a $93.4 million decrease in average short-term borrowings, a $75.2 million decrease in average interest-bearing demand deposits, and a $48.3 million decrease in average time deposits, partially offset by a $189.7 million increase in average savings and money market account deposits.\n\nNet interest margin was 2.89% in the current quarter, 2.87% in the second quarter of 2024, and 2.91% in the third quarter of 2023. The linked quarter expansion was due to an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets, which was partially offset by an increase in the overall cost of funds. The year-over-year decline primarily was a result of higher funding costs amid the current high interest rate environment, partially offset by an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets.\n\n**Noninterest Income**\n\nNoninterest income was $9.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of $14.6 million from the second quarter of 2024 and a decrease of $1.0 million from the third quarter of 2023.\n\n  * The Company's sale of the assets of its insurance subsidiary generated a net gain of $13.5 million in the second quarter of 2024 and an additional gain on sale adjustment of $138 thousand in the third quarter of 2024. Given the April 1, 2024 transaction close, insurance income in the third quarter of 2024 was $3 thousand, compared to $4 thousand and $1.7 million in the linked and year-ago periods, respectively.\n  * Investment advisory income of $2.8 million was relatively flat with the second quarter of 2024 and up $253 thousand, or 9.9%, from the third quarter of 2023. The variance from the prior year period was largely due to a market-driven increase in assets under management in addition to business development.\n  * Income from company owned life insurance of $1.4 million was $44 thousand higher than the second quarter of 2024 and $377 thousand higher than the third quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase was due to a higher crediting rate on proceeds deployed during the previously disclosed surrender and redeploy strategy executed in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n  * Income from investments in limited partnerships of $400 thousand was $403 thousand lower than the second quarter of 2024 and flat with the third quarter of 2023. The Company previously made several investments in limited partnerships, primarily small business investment companies, and accounts for these investments under the equity method. Income from these investments fluctuates based on the maturity and performance of the underlying investments.\n  * Income from derivative instruments, net was $212 thousand in the current quarter, $377 thousand in the second quarter of 2024 and $219 thousand in the third quarter of 2023. Income from derivative instruments, net is based on the number and value of interest rate swap transactions executed during the quarter combined with the impact of changes in the fair value of borrower-facing trades.\n  * A net loss on tax credit investments of $170 thousand was recognized in the current quarter related to tax credit investments placed in service in the current and prior quarters. This compares to a net gain of $406 thousand and a net loss of $333 thousand in the second quarter of 2024 and third quarter of 2023, respectively.\n\n\n\n**Noninterest Expense**\n\nNoninterest expense was $32.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $33.0 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $34.7 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n  * Salaries and employee benefits expense of $15.9 million was $131 thousand higher than the second quarter of 2024 and $2.3 million lower than the third quarter of 2023. The decrease from the third quarter of 2023 was due to a combination of the previously mentioned insurance agency asset sale and the Company's previously disclosed fourth quarter 2023 leadership and organizational changes, which reduced salaries and wages between periods.\n  * Occupancy and equipment expenses of $3.4 million were $78 thousand and $421 thousand lower than the linked and year-ago quarter, respectively. The year-over-year variance was due in part to the timing of equipment purchases.\n  * Professional services expenses of $2.0 million were $171 thousand higher than the second quarter of 2024 and $889 thousand higher than the third quarter of 2023. Both the linked quarter and year-over-year variances were primarily attributable to legal expenses incurred in the second and third quarters of 2024 related to the Company's previously disclosed fraud event.\n  * Computer and data processing expense of $5.4 million was relatively flat with the second quarter of 2024 and $246 thousand higher than the third quarter of 2023, with the year-over-year variance due in part to an increase in digital banking expenses attributable to increased usage along with the Company’s investments in data efficiency and marketing technology.\n\n\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\nIncome tax expense was $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $4.5 million in the second quarter of 2024, and $2.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The higher level of income tax expense incurred during the second quarter of 2024 was due to a higher level of pre-tax income, reflecting the previously mentioned gain related to our insurance subsidiary asset sale. The Company also recognized federal and state tax benefits related to tax credit investments placed in service and/or amortized which resulted in income tax expense reductions of $1.3 million in both the third and second quarters of 2024, and $731 thousand in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe effective tax rate was 7.4% for the third quarter of 2024, 15.0% for the second quarter of 2024, and 14.8% for the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate fluctuates on a quarterly basis primarily due to the level of pre-tax earnings and may differ from statutory rates because of interest income from tax-exempt securities, earnings on company owned life insurance and the impact of tax credit investments.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Capital Management**\n\nTotal assets were $6.16 billion at September 30, 2024, up $24.5 million from June 30, 2024, and up $16.2 million from September 30, 2023.\n\nInvestment securities were $1.01 billion at September 30, 2024, up $8.2 million from June 30, 2024, and down $324 thousand from September 30, 2023.\n\nTotal loans were $4.40 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of $58.5 million, or 1.3%, from June 30, 2024, and a decrease of $28.2 million, or 0.6%, from September 30, 2023.\n\n  * Commercial business loans totaled $654.5 million at September 30, 2024, down $59.4 million, or 8.3%, from June 30, 2024, and down $57.0 million, or 8.0%, from September 30, 2023.\n  * Commercial mortgage loans totaled $2.11 billion at September 30, 2024, up $19.8 million, or 0.9%, from June 30, 2024, and up $120.4 million, or 6.1%, from September 30, 2023.\n  * Residential real estate loans totaled $648.2 million at September 30, 2024, up $566 thousand, or 0.1%, from June 30, 2024, and up $13.0 million, or 2.1%, from September 30, 2023.\n  * Consumer indirect loans totaled $874.7 million at September 30, 2024, down $19.9 million, or 2.2%, from June 30, 2024, and down $107.5 million, or 10.9%, from September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\nTotal deposits were $5.31 billion at September 30, 2024, up $173.3 million, or 3.4%, from June 30, 2024, and down $9.4 million, or 0.2%, from September 30, 2023. The increase from June 30, 2024 was due to an increase in public deposits, which was partly driven by seasonality, as well as an increase in nonpublic deposits, partly offset by a decline in reciprocal deposits. Public deposit balances represented 22% of total deposits at September 30, 2024, 20% at June 30, 2024 and 20% at September 30, 2023.\n\nShort-term borrowings were $55.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $202.0 million at June 30, 2024 and $70.0 million at September 30, 2023, as linked quarter deposit growth enabled the Company to pay down short-term borrowings, which have historically been utilized along with brokered deposits to manage the seasonality of public deposits.\n\nShareholders' equity was $500.3 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $467.7 million at June 30, 2024, and $408.7 million at September 30, 2023. The increase in shareholders' equity compared to the linked and year-ago period ends was primarily due to a reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss, with net income through the first nine months of 2024 also contributing to the year-over-year increase. Shareholders' equity has been negatively impacted since 2022 by an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with unrealized losses in the available for sale securities portfolio. Management believes the unrealized losses are temporary in nature, as they are associated with the current high interest rate environment. The securities portfolio continues to generate cash flow and, given the high credit quality of the agency mortgage-backed securities portfolio, management expects the bonds to ultimately mature at a terminal value equivalent to par.\n\nCommon book value per share was $31.22 at September 30, 2024, an increase of $2.11, or 7.2%, from $29.11 at June 30, 2024, and an increase of $5.81, or 22.9%, from $25.41 at September 30, 2023. Tangible common book value per share(1) was $27.28 at September 30, 2024, an increase of $2.11, or 8.4%, from $25.17 at June 30, 2024, and an increase of $6.59, or 31.9%, from $20.69 at September 30, 2023. The common equity to assets ratio was 7.85% at September 30, 2024, compared to 7.34% at June 30, 2024, and 6.37% at September 30, 2023. Tangible common equity to tangible assets(1), or the TCE ratio, was 6.93%, 6.41% and 5.25% at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The primary driver of variations in all four measures for the comparable linked and year-ago period ends was the previously described changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company declared a common stock dividend of $0.30 per common share, consistent with the linked and year-ago quarters.\n\nThe Company's regulatory capital ratios at September 30, 2024 continued to exceed all regulatory capital requirements to be considered well capitalized.\n\n  * Leverage Ratio was 8.98% compared to 8.61% and 8.20% at June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n  * Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 10.28% compared to 10.03% and 9.26% at June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n  * Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 10.62% compared to 10.36% and 9.58% at June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n  * Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio was 12.95% compared to 12.65% and 11.91% at June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n\n\n\n**Credit Quality**\n\nNon-performing loans were $40.7 million, or 0.93% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, as compared to $25.2 million, or 0.57% of total loans, at June 30, 2024 and $9.5 million, or 0.21% of total loans, at September 30, 2023. Non-performing loans at September 30, 2024 largely related to two separate commercial loan relationships, one of which was placed on nonaccrual during the third quarter of 2024 and the other in the fourth quarter of 2023. Net charge-offs were $1.7 million, representing 0.15% of average loans on an annualized basis, for the current quarter, as compared to $1.1 million, or an annualized 0.10% of average loans, in the second quarter of 2024 and $1.6 million, or an annualized 0.14%, in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans ratio was 1.01%, compared to 0.99% at June 30, 2024 and 1.12% at September 30, 2023.\n\nProvision for credit losses was $3.1 million in the current quarter, compared to $2.0 million in the linked quarter and $1.0 million in the prior year third quarter. Provision for credit losses on loans was $2.4 million in the current quarter, compared to $2.0 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $1.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The allowance for unfunded commitments, also included in provision for credit losses as required by the current expected credit loss standard (\"CECL\"), totaled a provision of $713 thousand in the third quarter of 2024, $43 thousand in the second quarter of 2024, and $426 thousand in the third quarter of 2023. The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 was driven by a combination of factors, including a slight increase in the national unemployment forecast and higher qualitative factors overall, partially offset by lower loan balances.\n\nThe Company has remained strategically focused on the importance of credit discipline, allocating resources to credit and risk management functions as the loan portfolio has grown. The ratio of allowance for credit losses on loans to non-performing loans was 110% at September 30, 2024, 174% at June 30, 2024, and 521% at September 30, 2023.\n\n**Subsequent Events**\n\nThe Company is required, under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), to evaluate subsequent events through the filing of its consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, on Form 10-Q. As a result, the Company will continue to evaluate the impact of any subsequent events on critical accounting assumptions and estimates made as of September 30, 2024, and will adjust amounts preliminarily reported, if necessary.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host an earnings conference call and audio webcast on October 25, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The call will be hosted by Martin K. Birmingham, President and Chief Executive Officer, and W. Jack Plants II, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. The live webcast will be available in listen-only mode on the Company's website at [www.FISI-Investors.com](http://www.FISI-Investors.com). Within the United States, listeners may also access the call by dialing 1-833-470-1428 and providing the access code 514361. The webcast replay will be available on the Company's website for at least 30 days.\n\n**About Financial Institutions, Inc.**\n\nFinancial Institutions, Inc.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures is included in Appendix A to this document.\n\nThe Company believes that providing certain non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with information useful in understanding our financial performance, performance trends and financial position. Our management uses these measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes and we believe that our presentation and discussion, together with the accompanying reconciliations, allows investors, security analysts and other interested parties to view our performance and the factors and trends affecting our business in a manner similar to management. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP measures, and we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not uniformly applied and are not audited. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. **Safe Harbor Statement**\n\n_This press release may contain forward-looking statements as defined by Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that involve significant risks and uncertainties. In this context, forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as \"believe,\" \"anticipate,\" \"continue,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"focus,\" \"forecast,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"plan,\" \"preliminary,\" \"should,\" \"target\" or \"will.\" Statements herein are based on certain assumptions and analyses by the Company and factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by such statements for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to: additional information regarding the deposit fraudulent activity; changes in interest rates; inflation; changes in deposit flows and the cost and availability of funds; the Company’s ability to implement its strategic plan, including by expanding its commercial lending footprint and integrating its acquisitions; whether the Company experiences greater credit losses than expected; whether the Company experiences breaches of its, or third party, information systems; the attitudes and preferences of the Company's customers; legal and regulatory proceedings and related matters, including any action described in our reports filed with the SEC, could adversely affect us and the banking industry in general; the competitive environment; fluctuations in the fair value of securities in its investment portfolio; changes in the regulatory environment and the Company's compliance with regulatory requirements; and general economic and credit market conditions nationally and regionally; and the macroeconomic volatility related to the impact of a pandemic or global political unrest. Consequently, all forward-looking statements made herein are qualified by these cautionary statements and the cautionary language and risk factors included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, its Quarterly Reports on_ _Form 10-Q_ _and other documents filed with the SEC. Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to revise these statements following the date of this press release._\n\n(1) See Appendix A — Reconciliation to Non-GAAP Financial

Announces Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nOctober 24, 2024\n\nWARSAW, N.Y., Oct. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Financial Institutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: FISI) (the \"Company,\" \"we\" or \"us\"), parent company of Five Star Bank (the \"Bank\") and Courier Capital, LLC (\"Courier Capital\"), today reported financial and operational results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nNet income was $13.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $25.6 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $14.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. After preferred dividends, net income available to common shareholders was $13.1 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $25.3 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2024, and $13.7 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2024 results included $384 thousand of professional services expenses attributed to the deposit-related fraud event disclosed in March 2024 that occurred in the first quarter of 2024. The Company's second quarter 2024 financial results benefited from a $13.5 million pre-tax gain associated with its previously disclosed insurance subsidiary asset sale, and also included $371 thousand of professional services expenses related to the fraud event that were partially offset by a recovery of $143 thousand. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $3.1 million in the current quarter, compared to a provision of $2.0 million in the linked quarter and a provision of $1.0 million in the prior year quarter.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Key Results:**\n\n  * Net interest margin was 2.89% for the third quarter of 2024, up two basis points compared to the second quarter of 2024, while net interest income of $40.7 million decreased by $512 thousand, or 1.2%, from the linked quarter.\n  * Noninterest income was $9.4 million for the current quarter, compared to $24.0 million in the linked quarter, when results benefited from a $13.5 million pre-tax gain associated with the Company's insurance subsidiary asset sale.\n  * Total deposits were $5.31 billion at September 30, 2024, up $173.3 million, or 3.4%, from June 30, 2024, driven by seasonality and new business in our public deposit portfolio and non-public deposit growth. Deposits were relatively flat with September 30, 2023, as a $313.3 million reduction in brokered deposits largely offset year-over-year growth in non-public and public deposits.\n  * Total loans were $4.40 billion at September 30, 2024, reflecting a decrease of $58.5 million, or 1.3%, from June 30, 2024 and a decrease of $28.2 million, or 0.6%, from September 30, 2023.\n  * Noninterest expense of $32.5 million for the current quarter was down $551 thousand, or 1.7%, from the second quarter of 2024 and down $2.3 million, or 6.5%, from the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Regulatory and tangible capital ratios continued to expand on a linked quarter and year-over-year basis.\n  * The Company maintained solid credit quality metrics, as measured by annualized net charge-offs to average loans of 0.15% for the current quarter, compared to 0.10% in the linked quarter and 0.14%, in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n\"Our third quarter results were highlighted by strong deposit growth, incremental net interest margin expansion, solid expense management, and continued build in our regulatory and tangible capital ratios. We remain very focused on driving sustainable growth across each of our retail banking, commercial banking and wealth management business lines. Supporting that focus is our strategic decision to begin to wind-down our Banking-as-a-Service, or BaaS, offerings, announced in September,\" said President and Chief Executive Officer Martin K. Birmingham.\n\n\"While total loans were down during the quarter, as growth in commercial mortgage and stability in residential loans and lines were offset by declines in commercial business and consumer indirect loans, we continue to see excellent opportunity in our geographic markets to drive credit-disciplined loan growth. Our regulatory and tangible capital positions further improved during the quarter, including a common equity tier 1 ratio of 10.28%, up 25 basis points from June 30, 2024 and up 102 basis points from September 30, 2023. Tangible common book value per share(1) grew by 8% and 32% from the end of the linked and year-ago quarters, respectively,\" Mr. Birmingham added.\n\nChief Financial Officer and Treasurer W. Jack Plants II commented, \"We saw further margin expansion on a linked quarter basis and our ability to drive solid deposit growth provided us with capacity to further reduce short-term borrowings during the quarter. From a credit perspective, we did move one commercial relationship to non-performing status during the third quarter, which drove the increase in non-performing assets as compared to June 30, 2024. We remain very confident in the overall health of our loan portfolio and we are comfortable with our reserve levels, as our allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans ratio expanded two basis points during the third quarter to 1.01%. As of September 30, 2024, we have approximately $1.4 billion in available liquidity and more than $1.1 billion in cash flow anticipated in the next 12 months.\"\n\n**Orderly Wind Down of BaaS Offerings**\n\nOn September 16, 2024, the Company announced its intent to begin an orderly wind down of its BaaS offerings, following a careful review by the Company’s executive management and the Board of Directors undertaken in conjunction with its annual strategic planning process. As of September 30, 2024, deposits and loans related to the Bank's BaaS offerings totaled $103 million and $29 million, respectively. The Company continues to preliminarily target completion of the wind down sometime in 2025.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\nNet interest income was $40.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of $512 thousand from the second quarter of 2024, of which $439 thousand was attributable to the impact of the increase in non-performing loans, partially offset by lower funding costs as a result of the Company's reduction of short term borrowings and brokered deposits, and a decrease of $1.0 million from the third quarter of 2023 due primarily to higher funding costs on a year-over-year basis.\n\nAverage interest-earning assets for the current quarter were $5.61 billion, a decrease of $154.2 million from the second quarter of 2024 due to an $84.6 million decrease in the average balance of Federal Reserve interest-earning cash, a $47.8 million decrease in the average balance of investment securities and a $21.8 million decrease in average loans. Average interest-earning assets for the current quarter were $92.4 million lower than the third quarter of 2023 due to an $83.5 million decrease in the average balance of investment securities and a $13.2 million decrease in the average balance of Federal Reserve interest-earning cash, partially offset by a $4.3 million increase in average loans.\n\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities for the current quarter were $4.40 billion, a decrease of $148.3 million from the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to a $97.8 million decrease in average savings and money market deposits, a $49.6 million decrease in average interest-bearing demand deposits, and an $11.0 million decrease in average short-term borrowings, partially offset by a $10.1 million increase in average time deposits. Average interest-bearing liabilities for the third quarter of 2024 were $27.2 million lower than the year-ago quarter primarily due to a $93.4 million decrease in average short-term borrowings, a $75.2 million decrease in average interest-bearing demand deposits, and a $48.3 million decrease in average time deposits, partially offset by a $189.7 million increase in average savings and money market account deposits.\n\nNet interest margin was 2.89% in the current quarter, 2.87% in the second quarter of 2024, and 2.91% in the third quarter of 2023. The linked quarter expansion was due to an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets, which was partially offset by an increase in the overall cost of funds. The year-over-year decline primarily was a result of higher funding costs amid the current high interest rate environment, partially offset by an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets.\n\n**Noninterest Income**\n\nNoninterest income was $9.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of $14.6 million from the second quarter of 2024 and a decrease of $1.0 million from the third quarter of 2023.\n\n  * The Company's sale of the assets of its insurance subsidiary generated a net gain of $13.5 million in the second quarter of 2024 and an additional gain on sale adjustment of $138 thousand in the third quarter of 2024. Given the April 1, 2024 transaction close, insurance income in the third quarter of 2024 was $3 thousand, compared to $4 thousand and $1.7 million in the linked and year-ago periods, respectively.\n  * Investment advisory income of $2.8 million was relatively flat with the second quarter of 2024 and up $253 thousand, or 9.9%, from the third quarter of 2023. The variance from the prior year period was largely due to a market-driven increase in assets under management in addition to business development.\n  * Income from company owned life insurance of $1.4 million was $44 thousand higher than the second quarter of 2024 and $377 thousand higher than the third quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase was due to a higher crediting rate on proceeds deployed during the previously disclosed surrender and redeploy strategy executed in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n  * Income from investments in limited partnerships of $400 thousand was $403 thousand lower than the second quarter of 2024 and flat with the third quarter of 2023. The Company previously made several investments in limited partnerships, primarily small business investment companies, and accounts for these investments under the equity method. Income from these investments fluctuates based on the maturity and performance of the underlying investments.\n  * Income from derivative instruments, net was $212 thousand in the current quarter, $377 thousand in the second quarter of 2024 and $219 thousand in the third quarter of 2023. Income from derivative instruments, net is based on the number and value of interest rate swap transactions executed during the quarter combined with the impact of changes in the fair value of borrower-facing trades.\n  * A net loss on tax credit investments of $170 thousand was recognized in the current quarter related to tax credit investments placed in service in the current and prior quarters. This compares to a net gain of $406 thousand and a net loss of $333 thousand in the second quarter of 2024 and third quarter of 2023, respectively.\n\n\n\n**Noninterest Expense**\n\nNoninterest expense was $32.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $33.0 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $34.7 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n  * Salaries and employee benefits expense of $15.9 million was $131 thousand higher than the second quarter of 2024 and $2.3 million lower than the third quarter of 2023. The decrease from the third quarter of 2023 was due to a combination of the previously mentioned insurance agency asset sale and the Company's previously disclosed fourth quarter 2023 leadership and organizational changes, which reduced salaries and wages between periods.\n  * Occupancy and equipment expenses of $3.4 million were $78 thousand and $421 thousand lower than the linked and year-ago quarter, respectively. The year-over-year variance was due in part to the timing of equipment purchases.\n  * Professional services expenses of $2.0 million were $171 thousand higher than the second quarter of 2024 and $889 thousand higher than the third quarter of 2023. Both the linked quarter and year-over-year variances were primarily attributable to legal expenses incurred in the second and third quarters of 2024 related to the Company's previously disclosed fraud event.\n  * Computer and data processing expense of $5.4 million was relatively flat with the second quarter of 2024 and $246 thousand higher than the third quarter of 2023, with the year-over-year variance due in part to an increase in digital banking expenses attributable to increased usage along with the Company’s investments in data efficiency and marketing technology.\n\n\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\nIncome tax expense was $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $4.5 million in the second quarter of 2024, and $2.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The higher level of income tax expense incurred during the second quarter of 2024 was due to a higher level of pre-tax income, reflecting the previously mentioned gain related to our insurance subsidiary asset sale. The Company also recognized federal and state tax benefits related to tax credit investments placed in service and/or amortized which resulted in income tax expense reductions of $1.3 million in both the third and second quarters of 2024, and $731 thousand in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe effective tax rate was 7.4% for the third quarter of 2024, 15.0% for the second quarter of 2024, and 14.8% for the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate fluctuates on a quarterly basis primarily due to the level of pre-tax earnings and may differ from statutory rates because of interest income from tax-exempt securities, earnings on company owned life insurance and the impact of tax credit investments.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Capital Management**\n\nTotal assets were $6.16 billion at September 30, 2024, up $24.5 million from June 30, 2024, and up $16.2 million from September 30, 2023.\n\nInvestment securities were $1.01 billion at September 30, 2024, up $8.2 million from June 30, 2024, and down $324 thousand from September 30, 2023.\n\nTotal loans were $4.40 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of $58.5 million, or 1.3%, from June 30, 2024, and a decrease of $28.2 million, or 0.6%, from September 30, 2023.\n\n  * Commercial business loans totaled $654.5 million at September 30, 2024, down $59.4 million, or 8.3%, from June 30, 2024, and down $57.0 million, or 8.0%, from September 30, 2023.\n  * Commercial mortgage loans totaled $2.11 billion at September 30, 2024, up $19.8 million, or 0.9%, from June 30, 2024, and up $120.4 million, or 6.1%, from September 30, 2023.\n  * Residential real estate loans totaled $648.2 million at September 30, 2024, up $566 thousand, or 0.1%, from June 30, 2024, and up $13.0 million, or 2.1%, from September 30, 2023.\n  * Consumer indirect loans totaled $874.7 million at September 30, 2024, down $19.9 million, or 2.2%, from June 30, 2024, and down $107.5 million, or 10.9%, from September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\nTotal deposits were $5.31 billion at September 30, 2024, up $173.3 million, or 3.4%, from June 30, 2024, and down $9.4 million, or 0.2%, from September 30, 2023. The increase from June 30, 2024 was due to an increase in public deposits, which was partly driven by seasonality, as well as an increase in nonpublic deposits, partly offset by a decline in reciprocal deposits. Public deposit balances represented 22% of total deposits at September 30, 2024, 20% at June 30, 2024 and 20% at September 30, 2023.\n\nShort-term borrowings were $55.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $202.0 million at June 30, 2024 and $70.0 million at September 30, 2023, as linked quarter deposit growth enabled the Company to pay down short-term borrowings, which have historically been utilized along with brokered deposits to manage the seasonality of public deposits.\n\nShareholders' equity was $500.3 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $467.7 million at June 30, 2024, and $408.7 million at September 30, 2023. The increase in shareholders' equity compared to the linked and year-ago period ends was primarily due to a reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss, with net income through the first nine months of 2024 also contributing to the year-over-year increase. Shareholders' equity has been negatively impacted since 2022 by an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with unrealized losses in the available for sale securities portfolio. Management believes the unrealized losses are temporary in nature, as they are associated with the current high interest rate environment. The securities portfolio continues to generate cash flow and, given the high credit quality of the agency mortgage-backed securities portfolio, management expects the bonds to ultimately mature at a terminal value equivalent to par.\n\nCommon book value per share was $31.22 at September 30, 2024, an increase of $2.11, or 7.2%, from $29.11 at June 30, 2024, and an increase of $5.81, or 22.9%, from $25.41 at September 30, 2023. Tangible common book value per share(1) was $27.28 at September 30, 2024, an increase of $2.11, or 8.4%, from $25.17 at June 30, 2024, and an increase of $6.59, or 31.9%, from $20.69 at September 30, 2023. The common equity to assets ratio was 7.85% at September 30, 2024, compared to 7.34% at June 30, 2024, and 6.37% at September 30, 2023. Tangible common equity to tangible assets(1), or the TCE ratio, was 6.93%, 6.41% and 5.25% at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The primary driver of variations in all four measures for the comparable linked and year-ago period ends was the previously described changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company declared a common stock dividend of $0.30 per common share, consistent with the linked and year-ago quarters.\n\nThe Company's regulatory capital ratios at September 30, 2024 continued to exceed all regulatory capital requirements to be considered well capitalized.\n\n  * Leverage Ratio was 8.98% compared to 8.61% and 8.20% at June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n  * Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 10.28% compared to 10.03% and 9.26% at June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n  * Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 10.62% compared to 10.36% and 9.58% at June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n  * Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio was 12.95% compared to 12.65% and 11.91% at June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n\n\n\n**Credit Quality**\n\nNon-performing loans were $40.7 million, or 0.93% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, as compared to $25.2 million, or 0.57% of total loans, at June 30, 2024 and $9.5 million, or 0.21% of total loans, at September 30, 2023. Non-performing loans at September 30, 2024 largely related to two separate commercial loan relationships, one of which was placed on nonaccrual during the third quarter of 2024 and the other in the fourth quarter of 2023. Net charge-offs were $1.7 million, representing 0.15% of average loans on an annualized basis, for the current quarter, as compared to $1.1 million, or an annualized 0.10% of average loans, in the second quarter of 2024 and $1.6 million, or an annualized 0.14%, in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans ratio was 1.01%, compared to 0.99% at June 30, 2024 and 1.12% at September 30, 2023.\n\nProvision for credit losses was $3.1 million in the current quarter, compared to $2.0 million in the linked quarter and $1.0 million in the prior year third quarter. Provision for credit losses on loans was $2.4 million in the current quarter, compared to $2.0 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $1.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The allowance for unfunded commitments, also included in provision for credit losses as required by the current expected credit loss standard (\"CECL\"), totaled a provision of $713 thousand in the third quarter of 2024, $43 thousand in the second quarter of 2024, and $426 thousand in the third quarter of 2023. The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 was driven by a combination of factors, including a slight increase in the national unemployment forecast and higher qualitative factors overall, partially offset by lower loan balances.\n\nThe Company has remained strategically focused on the importance of credit discipline, allocating resources to credit and risk management functions as the loan portfolio has grown. The ratio of allowance for credit losses on loans to non-performing loans was 110% at September 30, 2024, 174% at June 30, 2024, and 521% at September 30, 2023.\n\n**Subsequent Events**\n\nThe Company is required, under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), to evaluate subsequent events through the filing of its consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, on Form 10-Q. As a result, the Company will continue to evaluate the impact of any subsequent events on critical accounting assumptions and estimates made as of September 30, 2024, and will adjust amounts preliminarily reported, if necessary.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host an earnings conference call and audio webcast on October 25, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures is included in Appendix A to this document.\n\nThe Company believes that providing certain non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with information useful in understanding our financial performance, performance trends and financial position. Our management uses these measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes and we believe that our presentation and discussion, together with the accompanying reconciliations, allows investors, security analysts and other interested parties to view our performance and the factors and trends affecting our business in a manner similar to management. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP measures, and we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not uniformly applied and are not audited. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. **Safe Harbor Statement**\n\n_This press release may contain forward-looking statements as defined by Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that involve significant risks and uncertainties.

The Company believes that providing certain non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with information useful in understanding our financial\nperformance, performance trends and financial position. Our management uses these measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes and we believe that\nour presentation and discussion, together with the accompanying reconciliations, allows investors, security analysts and other interested parties to view our\nperformance and the factors and trends affecting our business in a manner similar to management. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a\nsubstitute for GAAP measures and we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single\nfinancial measure to evaluate the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not uniformly applied and are not audited.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n(1.) BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nNature of Operations\nFinancial Institutions, Inc. (the “Company”) is a financial holding company organized in 1931 under the laws of New York State (“New York”). The Company\nprovides diversified financial services through its subsidiaries, Five Star Bank (the “Bank”) and Courier Capital, LLC (“Courier Capital”). The Company offers\na broad array of deposit, lending and other financial services to individuals, municipalities and businesses in Western and Central New York through its wholly\nowned New York chartered banking subsidiary, the Bank. The Bank also has commercial loan production offices in Ellicott City (Baltimore), Maryland and\nSyracuse, New York, and indirect lending network relationships with franchised automobile dealers in the Capital District of New York. Effective January 1,\n2024, the Company exited the Pennsylvania automobile market to align our focus more fully around its core Upstate New York market. Courier Capital provides\ncustomized investment management, investment consulting and retirement plan services to individuals, businesses, institutions, foundations and retirement\nplans. The Company’s Banking-as-a-Service (“BaaS”) business has offered banking capabilities to non-bank financial service providers and other financial\ntechnology firms, or FinTechs, allowing them to provide banking services to their end users. On September 16, 2024, the Company issued a press release\nannouncing its intent to begin an orderly wind down of its BaaS offerings, following a careful review by the Company’s executive management and Board of\nDirectors undertaken in conjunction with its annual strategic planning process.\nOn April 1, 2024, the Company announced and closed the sale of the assets of its former subsidiary SDN Insurance Agency, LLC (“SDN”), which provided a\nbroad range of insurance services to personal and business clients, to NFP Property & Casualty Services, Inc., a subsidiary of NFP Corp. The sale generated $27\nmillion in proceeds, or a pre-tax gain of $13.7 million, after selling costs, which was recorded to net gain (loss) on other assets on the Company’s statement of\nincome. The all-cash transaction value represented approximately four times our 2023 insurance revenue. Following the sale of the assets of SDN, the Company\nchanged the name of the entity to Five Star Advisors LLC and expects to utilize it to serve as a conduit to refer insurance business to NFP.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have\nbeen eliminated in consolidation. The accounting and reporting policies conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Certain\ninformation and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to\nsuch rules and regulations. However, in the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal and\nrecurring nature necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated statements of financial condition, income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’\nequity and cash flows for the periods indicated and contain adequate disclosures to make the information presented not misleading. These consolidated financial\nstatements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The results of operations for\nany interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results which may be expected for the entire year or any other period.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications of previously reported amounts have been made to conform to the current year’s presentation. Such reclassifications did not impact net\nincome or shareholders’ equity as previously reported.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts\nreported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates relate to the determination of\nthe allowance for credit losses, the carrying value of goodwill and deferred tax assets, and assumptions used in the defined benefit pension plan accounting.\nCash Flow Reporting\nSupplemental cash flow information is summarized as follows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n2024 2023\nSupplemental information:\nCash paid for interest $ 121,197 $ 95,913\nCash paid for income taxes 3,526 6,298\nNoncash investing and financing activities:\nReal estate and other assets acquired in settlement of loans 181 163\nAccrued and declared unpaid dividends 5,004 4,983\n9\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n(1.) BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nFraudulent Activity\nIn early March 2024, the Company experienced charge-offs associated with fraudulent activity pertaining to deposit transactions conducted over the course of\nseveral business days by an in-market business customer of the Bank, which resulted in an $18.2 million pre-tax loss for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024. The fraud exposure arose from non-contractual, external fraud, and was treated as an operational loss, recorded in deposit-related charged-off items, in\nnoninterest expense for the first quarter of 2024, with a small recovery of $143 thousand being recorded for the second quarter of 2024.\nThe Bank is working with the appropriate law enforcement authorities in connection with this matter and is aggressively pursuing all legal recourse available to\nrecover additional funds and minimize the loss. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to recover any further offset to the deposit\nloss. The ultimate financial impact could be lower and will depend, in part, on the Bank’s success in its efforts to recover the funds.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, Investments — Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit\nStructures Using the Proportional Amortization Method. The ASU allows for entities to consistently account for tax credit equity investments utilizing the\nproportional amortization method across all types of tax credits when certain requirements are met. The election of proportional amortization method must be\nmade on a programmatic basis rather than an individual investment basis. For previously held tax credit investments, the amendments will be applied either on a\nmodified retrospective basis or a retrospective basis. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim\nperiods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nStandards Not Yet Effective\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendments\nexpand the disclosure requirements of segment expenses, as well as adding disclosure of the title and position of the chief operation decision maker “CODM”\nand an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate\nresources is also required. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance may require additional disclosure in the Company’s financial statement\nrelated to segments.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Tax (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amendments expand the disclosure\nrequirements of income taxes, primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The guidance also eliminates certain existing\ndisclosure requirements related to uncertain tax positions and unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities. The amendments are effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of\nthis guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n10\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n(3.) INVESTMENT SECURITIES (Continued)\nThe total number of AFS securities’ positions in the investment portfolio in an unrealized loss position was 185 at September 30, 2024 and 201 at December 31,\n2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, the Company had a position in 183 investment securities with a fair value of $804.6 million and a total unrealized\nloss of $127.4 million that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. At September 30, 2024, there were a total of two\nsecurities’ positions in the Company’s investment portfolio with a fair value of $15 thousand and a total unrealized loss of less than $1 thousand that had been in\na continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months. At December 31, 2023, the Company had a position in 198 investment securities with a fair value\nof $835.5 million and a total unrealized loss of $151.5 million that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. At December 31,\n2023, there were a total of three securities’ positions in the Company’s investment portfolio with a fair value of $8 thousand and a total unrealized loss of less\nthan $1 thousand that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months. The unrealized loss on investment securities was predominantly\ncaused by changes in market interest rates subsequent to purchase. The fair value of the Company’s portfolio fluctuates as market interest rates change.\nSecurities Available for Sale\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no allowance for credit losses had been recognized on AFS securities in an unrealized loss position as\nmanagement does not believe any of the securities were impaired due to reasons of credit quality. This is based upon our analysis of the underlying risk\ncharacteristics, including credit ratings, and other qualitative factors related to our available for sale securities and in consideration of our historical credit loss\nexperience and internal forecasts. The issuers of these securities continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the\nsecurities. Furthermore, the Company expects to recover the amortized cost basis of its investments and more than likely will not need to sell before the\nrecovery period for operating purposes, with no impairment identified. As the portfolio is managed from a liquidity, earnings, and risk standpoint, sales from the\nAFS portfolio may be warranted based upon prevailing market factors. The unrealized losses are due to increases in market interest rates over the yields\navailable at the time the underlying securities were purchased. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing\ndate or if market yields for such investments decline.\nSecurities Held to Maturity\nThe Company’s HTM investment securities include debt securities that are issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.\nThese securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government, are widely recognized as “risk free,” and have a long history of zero credit\nloss. In addition, the Company’s HTM investment securities include debt securities that are issued by state and local government agencies, or municipal bonds.\nThe Company monitors the credit quality of our municipal bonds through the use of a credit rating agency or by ratings that are derived by an internal scoring\nmodel. The scoring methodology for the internally derived ratings is based on a series of financial ratios for the municipality being reviewed as compared to\ntypical industry figures. This information is used to determine the financial strengths and weaknesses of the municipality, which is indicated with a numeric\nrating. This number is then converted into a letter rating to better match the system used by the credit rating agencies. As of September 30, 2024, $45.3 million\nof our municipal bonds were rated as an equivalent to Standard & Poor’s A/AA/AAA, with $3.2 million internally rated to be the equivalent of Standard &\nPoor’s A/AA/AAA rating. Additionally, no municipal bonds were rated below investment grade. As of December 31, 2023, $64.6 million of our municipal\nbonds were rated as an equivalent to Standard & Poor’s A/AA/AAA, with $4.2 million internally rated to be the equivalent of Standard & Poor’s A/AA/AAA\nrating, and no municipal bonds were rated below investment grade.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no past due or nonaccrual held to maturity investment securities.\n15\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INC.

The Company analyzes commercial business and commercial mortgage loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. Risk ratings are\nupdated any time the situation warrants. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:\nSpecial Mention: Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these\npotential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the Company’s credit position at some future date.\nSubstandard: Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral\npledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the\ndistinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\nDoubtful: Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the\nweaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.\nLoans that do not meet the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the process described above are considered “uncriticized” or pass-rated loans\nand are included in groups of homogeneous loans with similar risk and loss characteristics.\n19\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n(4.) LOANS (Continued)\nRisk Characteristics\nLoans are pooled based on their homogeneous risk characteristics. The Company has divided its loan portfolio into segments, as the loans within each segment\nhave similar characteristics related to loan purpose, tenor, amortization, repayment source, payment frequency, collateral and recourse.\nCommercial business loans primarily consist of loans to small to mid-sized businesses in our market area in a diverse range of industries. These loans are\ntypically associated with higher credit risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s\nbusiness. Further, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value. The credit risk related to\ncommercial loans is largely influenced by general economic conditions, including inflation, and the resulting impact on a borrower’s operations or on the value\nof underlying collateral, if any.\nCommercial mortgage loans generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans, potentially resulting in higher\nlosses on an individual customer basis. Loan repayment is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the properties, as well as on the\ncollateral securing the loan. Economic events, including inflation, influencing the ability of the tenants to pay rent at these properties, or conditions in the real\nestate market could have an adverse impact on the cash flows generated by properties securing the Company’s commercial real estate loans and on the value of\nsuch properties. Beginning in the third quarter of 2024, the Company further disaggregated the commercial mortgage loans into the following categories:\nconstruction, multifamily, non-owner occupied, and owner occupied based on the risk characteristics of the loans and the Company’s methodology for\nmonitoring and assessing credit risk.\nResidential real estate loans (comprised of conventional mortgages and home equity loans) and residential real estate lines of credit (comprised of home equity\nlines of credit) are generally made based on the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income but are secured by real\nproperty whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable. Credit risk for these types of loans is generally influenced by general economic conditions, the\ncharacteristics of individual borrowers, and the nature of the loan collateral.\nConsumer indirect and other consumer loans may entail greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans and home equities, particularly in the case of other\nconsumer loans which are primarily unsecured or, in the case of some BaaS loans, secured by depreciable assets such as solar panels, and in the case of indirect\nconsumer loans, secured by depreciable assets such as automobiles. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an\nadequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial\nstability, and thus are more likely to be affected by inflation and adverse personal circumstances such as job loss, illness or personal bankruptcy, including the\nheightened risk that such circumstances may arise as a result of inflation. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy\nand insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans.\n(5.) LEASES\nThe Company is obligated under a number of non-cancellable operating lease agreements for land, buildings and equipment with terms, including renewal\noptions reasonably certain to be exercised, extending through 2061. Two building leases were subleased with terms that extended through December 31, 2024.\nThe following table represents the consolidated statements of financial condition classification of the Company’s right of use assets and lease liabilities:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\nBalance Sheet Location 2024 2023\nOperating Lease Right of Use Assets:\nGross carrying amount Other assets $ 39,342 $ 38,684\nAccumulated amortization Other assets (8,511) (7,160)\nNet book value $ 30,831 $ 31,524\nOperating Lease Liabilities:\nRight of use lease obligations Other liabilities $ 33,192 $ 33,788\nThe weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases was 20.0 years at September 30, 2024 and the weighted-average discount rate used in the\nmeasurement of operating lease liabilities was 3.92%. The Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, on a collateralized basis, over a\nsimilar term for the discount rate.\n25\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INC.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill\nThe carrying amount of goodwill totaled $58.1 million and $67.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. On April 1, 2024, the\nCompany announced and closed on the sale of the assets of its wholly owned subsidiary, SDN. The sale resulted in a $9.0 million reduction in the carrying\namount of goodwill.\nGoodwill is not amortized but, instead, is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change\nthat would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment test\nas of October 1st. The Company did not identify an indication of goodwill impairment for any of its reporting units during the quarter ended September 30,\n2024.\n26\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INC.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nRisk Management Objective of Using Derivatives\nThe Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to\na wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest\nrate, liquidity and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities, and the use of derivative financial\ninstruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the\nreceipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company’s derivative financial\ninstruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected\ncash payments.\nCash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk\nThe Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To\naccomplish this objective, the Company uses interest rate caps and interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate caps\ndesignated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange\nfor an up-front premium. Such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with short-term borrowings or brokered CDs. Interest rate\nswaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments\nover the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.\nThe following table summarizes the terms of the Company’s outstanding interest rate swap agreements entered into to manage its exposure to the variability in\nfuture cash flows at September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\nEffective Date Expiration Date Notional Amount Pay Fixed Rate\n4/11/2022 4/11/2027 $ 50,000 0.787%\n1/24/2023 1/24/2026 $ 30,000 3.669%\n5/5/2023 5/5/2026 $ 25,000 3.4615%\nFor derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.\nAmounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made\non the Company’s borrowings. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that $1.7 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to\nderivatives will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nThe Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. These interest rate\nswaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk\nexposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet hedge accounting requirements, changes in the\nfair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings.\nCredit-risk-related Contingent Features\nThe Company has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain one or more of the following provisions: (a) if the Company defaults on\nany of its indebtedness, including a default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, the Company could also be declared in\ndefault on its derivative obligations, and (b) if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well-capitalized institution, the counterparty could terminate the\nderivative positions and the Company would be required to settle its obligations under the agreements.\n29\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n(8.) DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES (Continued)\nMortgage Banking Derivatives\nThe Company extends rate lock agreements to borrowers related to the origination of residential mortgage loans. To mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in\nthese rate lock agreements when the Company intends to sell the related loan, once originated, as well as closed residential mortgage loans held for sale, the\nCompany enters into forward commitments to sell individual residential mortgages. Rate lock agreements and forward commitments are considered derivatives\nand are recorded at fair value.\nFair Values of Derivative Instruments on the Balance Sheet\nThe table below presents the notional amounts, respective fair values of the Company’s derivative financial instruments, as well as their classification on the\nbalance sheet as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nAsset derivatives Liability derivatives\nGross notional\namount Fair value Fair value\nBalance Balance\nSeptember December 31, sheet September 30, December 31, sheet September 30, December 31,\n30, 2024 2023 line item 2024 2023 line item 2024 2023\nDerivatives designated as\nhedging instruments\nCash flow hedges $ 105,000 $ 105,000 Other assets $ 4,097 $ 5,939 Other liabilities $ 31 $ —\nTotal derivatives $ 105,000 $ 105,000 $ 4,097 $ 5,939 $ 31 $ —\nDerivatives not designated\nas hedging instruments\nInterest rate swaps (1) $1,130,680 $ 1,104,804 Other assets $ 31,597 $ 37,517 Other liabilities $ 31,600 $ 37,519\nCredit contracts 81,878 81,211 Other assets — — Other liabilities — —\nMortgage banking 16,376 5,292 Other assets 159 50 Other liabilities 14 2\nTotal derivatives $1,228,934 $ 1,191,307 $ 31,756 $ 37,567 $ 31,614 $ 37,521\n(1) The Company was holding collateral of $28.3 million and $40.4 million against its net obligations under these contracts at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.\nEffect of Derivative Instruments on the Income Statement\nThe table below presents the effect of the Company’s derivative financial instruments on the income statement for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nGain (loss) recognized in income Gain (loss) recognized in income\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nLine item of gain (loss) September 30, September 30,\nUndesignated derivatives recognized in income 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest rate swaps Income from derivative instruments, net $ 212 $ 93 $ 661 $ 1,219\nCredit contracts Income from derivative instruments, net — 58 5 109\nMortgage banking Income from derivative instruments, net — 68 97 90\nTotal undesignated $ 212 $ 219 $ 763 $ 1,418\n30\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INC.

The RSUs and PSUs granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 will generally vest on the third anniversary of\nthe grant date assuming the recipient’s continuous service to the Company.\nThe Company amortizes the expense related to share-based compensation awards over the vesting period. Share-based compensation expense is recorded as a\ncomponent of salaries and employee benefits in the consolidated statements of income for awards granted to management and as a component of other\nnoninterest expense for awards granted to directors. The share-based compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of income, is as follows (in\nthousands):\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 450 $ 679 $ 1,485 $ 1,642\nOther noninterest expense 44 42 324 287\nTotal share-based compensation expense $ 494 $ 721 $ 1,809 $ 1,929\nIncome tax benefit realized for compensation costs $ — $ — $ — $ 438\nAt September 30, 2024, there was $3.6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units that\nis expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.94 years.\n36\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n(12.) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nThe Company participates in a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan for certain employees who meet participation requirements. The components of the\nCompany’s net periodic benefit expense for its pension obligations were as follows (in thousands):\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nService cost $ 490 $ 447 $ 1,472 $ 1,342\nInterest cost on projected benefit obligation 861 855 2,583 2,565\nExpected return on plan assets (1,004) (878) (3,013) (2,634)\nAmortization of unrecognized prior service credit (134) (123) (402) (368)\nAmortization of unrecognized net actuarial loss 358 316 1,073 948\nNet periodic benefit expense $ 571 $ 617 $ 1,713 $ 1,853\nThe net periodic benefit expense is recorded as a component of salaries and employee benefits in the consolidated statements of income. The Company’s\nfunding policy is to contribute, at a minimum, an actuarially determined amount that will satisfy the minimum funding requirements determined under the\nappropriate sections of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has no minimum required contribution for the 2024 fiscal year.\n(13.) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nFinancial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk\nThe Company has financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk established in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.\nThese financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit\nand interest rate risk extending beyond amounts recognized in the financial statements.\nThe Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and\nstandby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved with extending loans to customers. The Company uses the same credit underwriting policies in\nmaking commitments and conditional obligations as for on-balance sheet instruments.\nOff-balance sheet commitments consist of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nCommitments to extend credit $ 1,238,685 $ 1,200,617\nStandby letters of credit 18,334 13,498\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the agreement. Commitments\ngenerally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses which may require payment of a fee. Commitments may expire without being drawn upon;\ntherefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer’s creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case\nbasis. The amount of collateral obtained, if any, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the borrower. Standby letters of credit are conditional lending\ncommitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These standby letters of credit are primarily issued to support\nprivate borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to\ncustomers.\nUnfunded Commitments\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses for unfunded commitments totaled $3.8 million and $3.6 million, respectively,\nand was included in other liabilities on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition. The credit loss (benefit) for unfunded commitments was\nas follows (in thousands):\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCredit loss (benefit) for unfunded commitments $ 713 $ (426) $ 186 $ (129)\n37\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n(13.) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (continued)\nContingent Liabilities and Litigation\nIn the ordinary course of business, there are various threatened and pending legal proceedings against the Company. Management believes that the aggregate\nliability, if any, arising from such litigation, except for the matter described below, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nAs previously disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on March 13, 2024 and as\ndisclosed in Part II, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company is party to an action filed against it on May 16, 2017 by Matthew L. Chipego,\nCharlene Mowry, Constance C. Churchill and Joseph W. Ewing in the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Plaintiffs sought and were granted\nclass certification to represent classes of consumers in New York and Pennsylvania seeking to recover statutory damages, interest and declaratory relief. The\nplaintiffs specifically claim that the notices the Bank sent to defaulting consumers after their vehicles were repossessed did not comply with the relevant portions\nof the Uniform Commercial Code in New York and Pennsylvania. The Company disputes and believes it has meritorious defenses against these claims and plans\nto vigorously defend itself.\nOn September 30, 2021, the Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and certified four different classes (two classes of New York consumers and\ntwo classes of Pennsylvania consumers). There are approximately 5,200 members in the New York classes and 300 members in the Pennsylvania classes.\nOn September 26, 2022, the lower Court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment for most of the relief they seek and found that there were\nquestions of fact as to whether the members of the class had purchased the subject vehicles for “consumer use” within the meaning of the relevant statutes. The\nCourt also denied the Company’s motion for partial summary judgment and seeking an offset in the form of recoupment reducing any liability that may be\nimposed against the Company by the amounts that the borrowers owe for failing to repay their motor vehicle loans, determining that the Court could not enter a\njudgment on recoupment – which is a set off from liability – without first determining whether there was liability.\nDuring the July 11, 2024 pretrial conference, the Court instructed the parties to engage in further settlement of non-binding mediation discussions and set a\nSeptember 11, 2024 deadline to file motions in limine and a bench trial to commence on May 5, 2025.\nAll depositions and document productions have been completed. Plaintiff did not file a Motion in Limine by September 11, 2024. Plaintiffs however filed a\nmotion for partial judgment on October 8, 2024 asserting that the recoupment claims were barred because they were too distinct from the underlying claims. The\nCompany intends to file an opposition against the motion for partial summary judgment with the Court by the November 7, 2024 deadline. The parties continue\nto discuss potential candidates to serve as a mediator in response to the Court’s instruction that they explore further settlement or mediation discussions.\nThe Company has not accrued a contingent liability for this matter at this time because, given its defenses, it is unable to conclude whether a liability is probable\nto occur nor is it able to currently reasonably estimate the amount of potential loss.\nIf the Company settles these claims or the action is not resolved in its favor, the Company may suffer reputational damage and incur legal costs, settlements or\njudgments that exceed the amounts covered by its insurer. The Company can provide no assurances that its insurer will cover the full legal costs, settlements or\njudgments it incurs. If the Company is unsuccessful in defending itself from these claims or if its insurer does not cover the full amount of legal costs it incurs,\nthe result may materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n38\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n(14.) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nDetermination of Fair Value – Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring and Nonrecurring Basis\nValuation Hierarchy\nThe fair value of an asset or liability is the price that would be received to sell that asset or paid to transfer that liability in an orderly transaction occurring in the\nprincipal market (or most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market) for such asset or liability. Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)\nTopic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in\nactive markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. There have been no changes in the valuation techniques used\nduring the current period. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:\n• Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the\nmeasurement date.\n• Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These might\ninclude quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are\nnot active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as interest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit\nrisks, etc.) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market data by correlation or other means.\n• Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for determining the fair values of assets or liabilities that reflect an entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions\nthat market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.\nTransfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recorded as of the end of the reporting period.\nIn general, fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If such quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally\ndeveloped models that primarily use, as inputs, observable market-based parameters. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are\nrecorded at fair value. These adjustments may include amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality and the Company’s creditworthiness, among other things, as\nwell as unobservable parameters. Any such valuation adjustments are applied consistently over time. The Company’s valuation methodologies may produce a\nfair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While management believes the Company’s valuation\nmethodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of\ncertain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Furthermore, the reported fair value amounts have not been\ncomprehensively revalued since the presentation dates, and therefore, estimates of fair value after the balance sheet date may differ significantly from the\namounts presented herein. A more detailed description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value, as well as the general\nclassification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below.\nSecurities available for sale: Securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. The Company obtains fair value\nmeasurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market\nspreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and\nthe bond’s terms and conditions, among other things.\nDerivative instruments: The fair value of derivative instruments is determined using quoted secondary market prices for similar financial instruments\nand are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n39\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n(14.) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued)\nLoans held for sale: The fair value of loans held for sale is determined using quoted secondary market prices and investor commitments. Loans held for\nsale are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nCollateral dependent loans: Fair value of collateral dependent loans with specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses – loans is measured\nbased on the value of the collateral securing these loans and is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Collateral may be real estate and/or\nbusiness assets including equipment, inventory and/or accounts receivable and collateral value is determined based on appraisals performed by qualified\nlicensed appraisers hired by the Company. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including\ncomparable sales and the income approach. Appraised and reported values may be discounted based on management’s historical knowledge, changes in\nmarket conditions from the time of valuation, and/or management’s expertise and knowledge of the client and the client’s business. Such discounts are\ntypically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Collateral dependent loans are reviewed and evaluated\non at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly, based on the same factors identified above.\nLong-lived assets held for sale: The fair value of the long-lived assets held for sale was based on estimated market prices from independently prepared\ncurrent appraisals and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nLoan servicing rights: Loan servicing rights do not trade in an active market with readily observable market data. As a result, the Company estimates\nthe fair value of loan servicing rights by using a discounted cash flow model to calculate the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The\nassumptions used in the discounted cash flow model are those that management believes market participants would use in estimating future net servicing\nincome, including estimates of loan prepayment rates, servicing costs, ancillary income, impound account balances, and discount rates. The significant\nunobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s loan servicing rights are the constant prepayment rates and weighted average\ndiscount rate. Significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.\nAlthough the constant prepayment rate and the discount rate are not directly interrelated, they will generally move in opposite directions. Loan servicing\nrights are classified as Level 3 measurements due to the use of significant unobservable inputs, as well as significant management judgment and\nestimation.\nOther real estate owned (foreclosed assets): Nonrecurring adjustments to certain commercial and residential real estate properties classified as other\nreal estate owned are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell. Fair values are generally based on third party appraisals of\nthe property, resulting in a Level 3 classification. The appraisals are sometimes further discounted based on management’s historical knowledge, changes\nin market conditions from the time of valuation, and/or management’s expertise and knowledge of the client and client’s business. Such discounts are\ntypically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. In cases where the carrying amount exceeds the fair\nvalue, less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized.\nCommitments to extend credit and letters of credit: Commitments to extend credit and fund letters of credit are principally at current interest rates,\nand, therefore, the carrying amount approximates fair value. The fair value of commitments is not material.\n40\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n(14.)

Such estimates do not consider the tax impact of the realization\nof unrealized gains or losses. In some cases, the fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets. In addition, the disclosed\nfair value may not be realized in the immediate settlement of the financial instrument. Care should be exercised in deriving conclusions about our business, its\nvalue or financial position based on the fair value information of financial instruments presented below.\nThe estimated fair value approximates carrying value for cash and cash equivalents, Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) and Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”)\nstock, accrued interest receivable, non-maturity deposits, short-term borrowings and accrued interest payable. Fair value estimates for other financial\ninstruments not included elsewhere in this disclosure are discussed below.\nSecurities held to maturity: The fair value of the Company’s investment securities held to maturity is primarily measured using information from a\nthird-party pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S.\nTreasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond’s terms and\nconditions, among other things.\nLoans: The fair value of the Company’s loans was estimated by discounting the expected future cash flows using the current interest rates at which\nsimilar loans would be made for the same remaining maturities. Loans were first segregated by type, such as commercial, residential mortgage, and\nconsumer, and were then further segmented into fixed and variable rate and loan quality categories. Expected future cash flows were projected based on\ncontractual cash flows, adjusted for estimated prepayments.\nTime deposits: The fair value of time deposits was estimated using a discounted cash flow approach that applies prevailing market interest rates for\nsimilar maturity instruments. The fair values of the Company’s time deposit liabilities do not take into consideration the value of the Company’s long-\nterm relationships with depositors, which may have significant value.\nLong-term borrowings: Long-term borrowings consist of $75 million of subordinated notes and $50 million of long-term borrowings from the FHLB.\nThe subordinated notes are publicly traded and are valued based on market prices, which are characterized as Level 2 liabilities in the fair value\nhierarchy. The FHLB borrowings are valued using discounted cash flows based on current market rates for borrowings with similar remaining maturities\nand are characterized as Level 2 liabilities in the fair value hierarchy.\n43\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INC.

The Company offers a broad array of deposit, lending and other financial services to\nindividuals, municipalities and businesses in Western and Central New York through its wholly owned New York-chartered banking subsidiary, the Bank. The\nBank also has commercial loan production offices in Ellicott City (Baltimore), Maryland, and Syracuse, New York, serving the Mid-Atlantic and Central New\nYork regions. Our indirect lending network includes relationships with franchised automobile dealers in Western and Central New York, and the Capital District\nof New York. Effective January 1, 2024, we exited the Pennsylvania automobile market to align our focus more fully around our core Upstate New York market.\nCourier Capital provides customized investment advice, wealth management, investment consulting and retirement plan services to individuals, businesses,\ninstitutions, foundations and retirement plans.\nOn April 1, 2024, the Company announced and closed the sale of the assets of its wholly owned subsidiary, SDN Insurance Agency, LLC (“SDN”), which\nprovided a broad range of insurance services to personal and business clients, to NFP Property & Casualty Services, Inc. (“NFP”), a subsidiary of NFP Corp.\nThe sale generated $27 million in proceeds, or a pre-tax gain of $13.7 million, after selling costs, of which $13.5 million was recognized in the second quarter of\n2024. The all-cash transaction value represented approximately four times our 2023 insurance revenue. Following the sale of the assets of SDN, we changed the\nname of the entity to Five Star Advisors LLC and expect to utilize it to serve as a conduit to refer insurance business to NFP.\nOur primary sources of revenue are net interest income (interest earned on our loans and securities, net of interest paid on deposits and other funding sources)\nand noninterest income, particularly investment advisory and financial services provided to customers or ancillary services tied to loans and deposits, fees and\nother revenue from insurance, prior to the sale of the assets of SDN. Business volumes and pricing drive revenue potential, and tend to be influenced by overall\neconomic factors, including market interest rates, business spending, consumer confidence, economic growth, and competitive conditions within the\nmarketplace. We are not able to predict market interest rate fluctuations with certainty and our asset/liability management strategy may not prevent interest rate\nchanges from having a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and financial condition.\n48\nTable of Contents\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOur business strategy has been to maintain a community bank philosophy, which consists of focusing on and understanding the individualized banking and other\nfinancial needs of individuals, municipalities and businesses of the communities surrounding our primary service area. We believe this focus allows us to be\nmore responsive to our customers’ needs and provide a high level of personal service that differentiates us from larger competitors, resulting in long-standing\nand broad-based banking relationships. Our core customers are primarily small- to medium-sized businesses, individuals and community organizations who\nprefer to build banking and wealth management relationships with a community bank that combines high quality, competitively priced products and services\nwith personalized service. Because of our identity and origin as a locally operated bank, we believe that our level of personal service provides a competitive\nadvantage over larger banks, which tend to consolidate decision-making authority outside local communities.\nA key aspect of our current business strategy is to foster a community-oriented culture where our customers and employees establish long-standing and mutually\nbeneficial relationships. We believe that we are well-positioned to be a strong competitor within our market area because of our focus on community banking\nneeds and customer service, our comprehensive suite of deposit, loan, and wealth management products typically found at larger banks, our highly experienced\nmanagement team and our strategically located banking centers.\nWe prioritize customer acquisition through cost-effective, high-demand digital, virtual and physical channels, while maintaining a community bank\ndistinctiveness relative to larger banks and digital-only neobanks. We leverage the retail branch network and customer contact center to build trust and\ncredibility, provide personal financial education and advice, offer convenience, and bridge digital and physical channels. Our enhanced digital capabilities\ncomplement a continued focus on a consistent customer experience and engagement across physical and virtual channels, including using branches to create\ndeeper engagement and relationships with customers, balancing customer engagement with efficiency opportunities (e.g., framing outreach to the customer\ncontact center to teach customers how to use digital channels, in addition to addressing the reason for the call), and maintaining and expanding our customer\nreach digitally, physically or virtually. By employing digital channels across our current products and services, we deepen existing relationships and enter new\ngeographies or market segments that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive targets using traditional approaches. Deepening our existing digital capabilities\nallows us to capitalize on a shift in customer preferences away from physical branches. On September 16, 2024, we announced our intent to begin an orderly\nwind down of our BaaS offerings, following a careful review by the Company’s executive management and Board of Directors undertaken in conjunction with\nits annual strategic planning process.\nWe have evolved to meet changing customer needs by offering complementary physical, digital and virtual channels. We focus on technology to provide\nsolutions that fit our customers’ preferences for transacting business with us. Branches are staffed by certified personal bankers who are trained to meet a broad\narray of customer needs. Our digital banking capabilities, interactive teller machine (“ITM”) functionality and Customer Contact Center provide additional self-\nserve and phone options through which customer needs are met effectively.\nWe will continue to explore market expansion opportunities that complement current market areas as opportunities arise. Our primary focus will be on\nincreasing the Bank’s market share within existing markets, while taking advantage of potential growth opportunities within our noninterest income lines of\nbusiness by acquiring businesses that can be incorporated into existing operations. We believe our capital position remains strong enough to support an active\nmerger and acquisition strategy and the expansion of our core financial service businesses. Consequently, we continue to explore acquisition opportunities in\nthese activities. When evaluating acquisition opportunities, we will balance the potential for earnings accretion with maintaining adequate capital levels, which\ncould result in our common stock being the predominant form of consideration and/or the need for us to raise capital.\nConversations with potential strategic partners occur on a regular basis. The evaluation of any potential opportunity will favor a transaction that complements\nour core competencies and strategic intent, with a lesser emphasis being placed on geographic location or size. Additionally, we remain committed to\nmaintaining a diversified revenue stream. Our senior management team has experience in acquisitions and post-acquisition integration of operations and is\nprepared to act promptly should a potential opportunity arise but will remain disciplined with its approach. We believe this experience positions us to\nsuccessfully acquire and integrate additional financial services and banking businesses.\nCannabis Banking\nThe Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act was signed into law on March 31, 2021, legalizing the possession and sale of recreational marijuana in New York\nState for adults aged 21 or older and the state has issued adult-use cannabis cultivation, processing and retail dispensary licenses. We have implemented a\nprogram to provide financial products and services to legal cannabis-related businesses and partner with other financial institutions who provide such services.\n49\nTable of Contents\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOffering financial products and services to the cannabis industry presents a unique set of regulatory risks due to the conflict between state and federal laws, as\nmarijuana remains illegal at the federal level. In January 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) rescinded the “Cole Memo” and related memoranda\nwhich characterized the enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act against persons and entities complying with state regulatory systems permitting the use,\nmanufacture and sale of medical marijuana as an inefficient use of their prosecutorial resources and discretion. The impact of the DOJ’s rescission of the Cole\nMemo and related memoranda is unclear, but in the future may result in increased enforcement actions against the regulated cannabis industry generally. More\nrecently, the United States Attorney General has indicated that the DOJ, under his leadership, does not intend to pursue cases against parties who comply with\nthe laws in states which have legalized and are effectively regulating marijuana. However, enforcement policies and practices may be highly variable between\npolitical administrations. In addition, federal prosecutors have significant discretion and there can be no assurance that the federal prosecutor for any district in\nwhich we operate will not choose to strictly enforce the federal laws governing cannabis. In the future, enforcement actions may be taken against cannabis-\nrelated businesses or financial services providers that are viewed as aiding and abetting such activities.\nThe Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) published guidelines in 2014 for financial institutions servicing state-legal cannabis businesses. These\nguidelines were issued for the explicit purpose so “that financial institutions can provide services to marijuana-related businesses in a manner consistent with\ntheir obligations to know their customers and to report possible criminal activity.” The Bank has and will continue to follow this and other FinCEN guidance in\nthe areas of cannabis banking.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nRecent Events\nOn September 16, 2024, we announced our intent to begin an orderly wind down of our BaaS offerings, following a careful review by the executive\nmanagement and Board of Directors undertaken in conjunction with our annual strategic planning process. As of September 30, 2024, deposits and loans related\nto the Bank’s BaaS offerings totaled $103 million and $29 million, respectively. We continue to preliminarily target completion of the wind down sometime in\n2025.\nSummary of 2024 Third Quarter Results\nNet income decreased $556 thousand to $13.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $14.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. Net income available\nto common shareholders for the third quarter of 2024 was $13.1 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, compared with $13.7 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, for\nthe third quarter of 2023. Return on average common equity was 11.18% and return on average assets was 0.89% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to\n13.15% and 0.92%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2024 results included $384 thousand of professional services expenses attributed to\nthe deposit-related fraud event disclosed in March 2024 that occurred in the first quarter of 2024. We continue to aggressively pursue our legal rights and seek\nany and all recovery avenues to minimize the fraud loss.\nNet interest income totaled $40.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of $1.0 million compared to $41.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Average\ninterest-earning assets for the third quarter of 2024 were $92.4 million lower than the third quarter of 2023 due to an $83.5 million decrease in average\ninvestment securities, and a $13.2 million decrease in the average balance of Federal Reserve interest-earning cash, partially offset by a $4.3 million increase in\naverage loans. Average interest-bearing liabilities for the third quarter of 2024 were $27.2 million lower than the third quarter of 2023 due to a $93.4 million\ndecrease in average borrowings, a $75.2 million decrease in average interest-bearing demand deposits and a $48.3 million decrease in average time deposits,\npartially offset by a $189.7 million increase in average savings and money market account deposits.\nNet interest margin was 2.89% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.91% in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher funding costs amid the\ncurrent high interest rate environment, offset by an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets.\nThe provision for credit losses was $3.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a provision for credit losses of $1.0 million in the third quarter of 2023.\nThe provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by a combination of factors, including a slight increase in the national\nunemployment forecast and higher qualitative factors overall, partially offset by a lower loan balance. Net charge-offs during the recent quarter were $1.7\nmillion, representing 0.15% of average loans on an annualized basis, compared to $1.6 million, or an annualized 0.14% of average loans, in the third quarter of\n2023. See the “Allowance for Credit Losses – Loans” and “Non-Performing Assets and Potential Problem Loans” sections of this Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis for further discussion regarding the provision for credit losses and net charge-offs.\nNoninterest income totaled $9.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $10.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. The sale of the assets of our\ninsurance subsidiary in April 2024 resulted in a decrease in insurance income of $1.7 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. Partially offsetting this\ndecrease were increases of $377 thousand in company owned life insurance income, due to the higher crediting rate and associated impact to cash surrender\nvalue related to the surrender and redeploy strategy executed in the fourth quarter of 2023, and $253 thousand in investment advisory income largely due to\nmarket-driven increases in assets under management.\n50\nTable of Contents\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nNoninterest expense totaled $32.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $34.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in noninterest\nexpense for the third quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to a decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense of $2.3 million as a result of the sale of\nthe assets of our insurance subsidiary, and the previously disclosed fourth quarter 2023 leadership and organizational changes, which reduced salaries and wages\nexpense, $421 thousand in occupancy and equipment expense due in part to the timing of equipment purchases, and $414 thousand in other expenses. These\ndecreases were partially offset by an $889 thousand increase in professional services expense, due primarily to legal expenses related to the previously disclosed\ndeposit fraud-related event.\nThe regulatory Tier 1 Capital Ratio and Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio were 10.62%, and 12.95%, respectively, at September 30, 2024. See the “Liquidity and\nCapital Management” section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion regarding regulatory capital and the Basel III capital rules.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income is our primary source of revenue, comprising approximately 81% and 73% of revenue during the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2024, respectively. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and\ninterest expense on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings used to fund interest-earning and other assets or activities. Net interest income is affected by\nchanges in interest rates and by the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the sensitivity of the balance\nsheet to changes in interest rates, including characteristics such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial instruments, contractual maturities and repricing\nfrequencies.\nWe use interest rate spread and net interest margin to measure and explain changes in net interest income. Interest rate spread is the difference between the yield\non interest-earning assets and the rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities that fund those assets. The net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net\ninterest income to average earning assets. The net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because noninterest-bearing sources of funds (“net free\nfunds”), principally noninterest-bearing demand deposits and shareholders’ equity, also support earning assets. To compare tax-exempt asset yields to taxable\nyields, the yield on tax-exempt investment securities is computed on a taxable equivalent basis. Net interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin\nare discussed on a taxable equivalent basis.\nThe following table reconciles interest income per the consolidated statements of income to interest income adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis (dollars\nin thousands):\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest income per consolidated statements of income $ 77,911 $ 74,700 $ 235,112 $ 209,586\nAdjustment to fully taxable equivalent basis 65 93 232 327\nInterest income adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis 77,976 74,793 235,344 209,913\nInterest expense per consolidated statements of income 37,230 33,023 113,156 83,757\nNet interest income on a taxable equivalent basis $ 40,746 $ 41,770 $ 122,188 $ 126,156\nAnalysis of Net Interest Income for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nNet interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $40.7 million, a decrease of $1.0 million versus the\ncomparable quarter last year of $41.8 million. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to higher funding costs amid the current high interest rate\nenvironment.\nOur net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 2.89%, 2-basis points lower than 2.91% for the same period in 2023 due to higher funding costs as a\nresult of the continued high interest rate environment, offset by an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, the average yield on average interest earning assets of 5.53% was 32-basis points higher than the third quarter of 2023 of 5.21%\nprimarily due to an increase in market interest rates. Average loan yields increased 27-basis points during the third quarter of 2024 to 6.42% from 6.15% for the\nthird quarter of 2023, and the average yield on investment securities increased 26-basis points during the third quarter of 2024 to 2.14% from 1.88% for the third\nquarter of 2023. Overall, the average interest rate changes increased interest income by $3.8 million and volume variance decreased interest income by $578\nthousand during the third quarter of 2024, which collectively drove a favorable variance of $3.2 million.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nAverage interest-earning assets were $5.61 billion for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $5.70 billion for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of $92.4\nmillion, or 2%, from the comparable quarter last year, with a decrease in average securities of $83.5 million from $1.23 billion for the third quarter of 2023 to\n$1.15 billion for the third quarter of 2024, and a $13.2 million decrease in average Federal Reserve interest-earning cash, partially offset by an increase in\naverage loans of $4.3 million from $4.41 billion for the third quarter of 2023 to $4.42 billion for the third quarter of 2024. Average loans comprised 79% of\naverage interest-earning assets during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 77% during the third quarter of 2023. The increase in average loans was primarily\ndue to organic growth in commercial mortgages and stability in residential loans. Loans generally have significantly higher yields compared to other interest-\nearning assets and, as such, have a more positive effect on the net interest margin. The average yield on average loans was 6.42% for the third quarter of 2024,\nan increase of 27-basis points compared to 6.15% for the comparable quarter in 2023 due to the impact of the higher market interest rates. Interest rate changes\non average loans increased interest income by $2.9 million. Average investment securities represented 20% of average interest-earning assets during the third\nquarter of 2024 compared to 22% during the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in average investment securities was primarily due to maturities of investment\nsecurities, and the use of cash to fund loan originations and reduce short-term borrowings.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, the average cost of average interest-bearing liabilities of 3.37% was 41-basis points higher than the third quarter of 2023. The\naverage cost of interest-bearing deposits of 3.34% was 50-basis points higher than the third quarter of 2023 due to the continued repricing of deposits at higher\ninterest rates. The average cost of total borrowings decreased 55-basis points to 3.80% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 4.35% in the third quarter of\n2023. The reduction in the cost of total borrowings was driven by a wholesale mix shift, with a lower level of outstanding balances, and the benefit of the Bank’s\ncash flow hedging program.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities were $4.40 billion for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $4.43 billion for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of $27.2\nmillion, or 1%, driven by the $93.7 million decrease in the average balance of short-term borrowings, partially offset by a $66.2 million increase in average\ninterest-bearing deposits. On average, interest-bearing deposits grew from $4.08 billion for the third quarter of 2023 to $4.15 billion for the current quarter while\nnoninterest-bearing demand deposits (a principal component of net free funds) decreased $69.5 million to $953.0 million for the third quarter of 2024. The\nincrease in average interest-bearing deposits was due to growth in average non-public and public deposits, partially offset by decreases in average brokered and\nreciprocal deposits. For further discussion of our reciprocal and brokered deposits, refer to the “Funding Activities – Deposits” section of this Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis. The decrease in noninterest-bearing demand deposits was due to the interest rate environment driving customers to higher interest\nbearing accounts. Overall, interest-bearing deposit rate changes resulted in a $5.0 million increase in interest expense, and volume changes resulted in a $593\nthousand increase in interest expense during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior year quarter. A decrease in average short-term borrowings\ndecreased interest expense by $760 thousand, and a decrease in interest rates on short-term borrowings decreased interest expense by $619 thousand during the\nthird quarter of 2024.\nAnalysis of Net Interest Income for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nNet interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $122.2 million, a decrease of $4.0 million versus the\ncomparable period in 2023 of $126.2 million. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to higher funding costs amid the current high interest rate\nenvironment.\nOur net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.85%, 14-basis points lower than 2.99% for the same period in 2023 due to higher\nfunding costs as a result of the continued high interest rate environment, partially offset by an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average yield on average interest earning assets of 5.49% was 51-basis points higher than the nine months\nended September 30, 2023 of 4.98%. The average yield on loans increased 49-basis points during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to 6.39% from\n5.90% for the comparable period last year. The average yield on investment securities increased 25-basis points to 2.14% for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 compared to 1.89% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Overall, the impact of the interest rate increases in 2023 and 2024 has a positive\nimpact on yields, increasing interest income by $18.0 million, while volume variances in average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities\nincreased net interest income by $7.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nAverage interest-earning assets were $5.73 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $5.63 billion for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, an increase of $98.9 million, or 2%, with average loans up $150.2 million from $4.29 billion for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 to $4.44 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and a $40.7 million increase in average Federal Reserve interest-earning cash, partially\noffset by a decrease in average investment securities of $92.0 million from $1.27 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $1.17 billion for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024. Average investment securities represented 21% of average interest-earning assets during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to 23% during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in average investment securities was primarily due to\nmaturities of investment securities, and the use of cash to fund loan originations and reduce short-term borrowings. Loans comprised 78% of average interest-\nearning assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 76% during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in average\nloans was primarily due to organic growth in commercial mortgages and residential real estate loans, partially offset by a decrease in consumer indirect loans.\nLoans generally have significantly higher yields compared to other interest-earning assets and, as such, have a more positive effect on the net interest margin.\nHigher interest rates on loans increased interest income by $15.4 million, and an increase in the volume of average loans resulted in a $7.4 million increase in\ninterest income.\n52\nTable of Contents\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average cost of average interest-bearing liabilities of 3.34% was 77-basis points higher than the average cost\nof 2.57% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with the average cost of average interest-bearing deposits of 3.31% increasing 89-basis points from\n2.42% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the higher interest rate environment that began in 2023 and continued into 2024.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities of $4.52 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $170.1 million, or 3.9%, higher than the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by an increase in average interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a decrease in total average\nborrowings. On average, interest-bearing deposits increased $238.3 million from $4.01 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $4.25 billion for\nthe current period, while noninterest-bearing demand deposits (a principal component of net free funds) decreased $83.4 million to $955.4 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period. Total average borrowings decreased to $274.2 million for the current period, down\n$68.2 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as deposit growth enabled us to pay down short-term borrowings. The increase in average\ndeposits was primarily due to growth in non-public, reciprocal, and public deposits, partially offset by a decrease in brokered deposits. For further discussion of\nthe reciprocal deposit programs, refer to the “Funding Activities – Deposits” section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis. Overall, interest-bearing\ndeposit rate changes resulted in a $27.1 million increase in interest expense and volume changes contributed $5.5 million during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, primarily due to the higher interest rate environment.\n53\nTable of Contents\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nThe following tables set forth certain information relating to the consolidated balance sheets and reflects the average yields earned on interest-earning assets, as\nwell as the average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands).

The decrease in insurance income for the third quarter of 2024 and the first nine months of 2024 was\nreflective of the sale.\nInvestment advisory income increased $253 thousand, or 10%, to $2.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $2.5 million for the third quarter of\n2023, primarily due to a market-driven increase in assets under management in addition to business development. For the first nine months of 2024, investment\nadvisory income decreased $128 thousand, or 2%, to $8.2 million compared to $8.3 million for the first nine months of 2023.\nIncome from company owned life insurance increased $377 thousand, or 37%, to $1.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $1.0 million for the\nthird quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, income from company owned life insurance increased $1.1 million, or 37%, to $4.1 million compared to\n$3.0 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase in both periods was primarily due to the higher crediting rate and associated impact to cash surrender\nvalue recorded in the linked quarter related to the previously disclosed surrender and redeploy strategy executed in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nIncome from investments in limited partnerships of $400 thousand for the third quarter of 2024 was relatively flat compared to the third quarter of 2023. For the\nfirst nine months of 2024, income from investments in limited partnerships increased $434 thousand, or 39%, to $1.5 million compared to $1.1 million for the\nfirst nine months of 2023. We previously made several investments accounted for under the equity method. Income from these investments fluctuates based on\nthe maturity and performance of the underlying investments.\nIncome from derivative instruments, net of $212 thousand for the third quarter of 2024 was relatively flat compared to the third quarter of 2023. For the first\nnine months of 2024, income from derivative income from derivative instruments, net decreased $655 thousand, or 46%, to $763 thousand compared to $1.4\nmillion for the first nine months of 2023. Income from derivative instruments, net, is based on the number and value or interest rate swap transactions executed\nduring the quarter combined with the impact of changes in the fair value of borrower-facing trades.\n58\nTable of Contents\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table details the major categories of noninterest expense for the periods presented (in thousands):\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 15,879 $ 18,160 $ 48,967 $ 54,047\nOccupancy and equipment 3,370 3,791 10,570 11,059\nProfessional services 1,965 1,076 6,131 3,844\nComputer and data processing 5,353 5,107 16,081 14,548\nSupplies and postage 519 455 1,431 1,418\nFDIC assessments 1,092 1,232 3,733 3,586\nAdvertising and promotions 371 744 1,108 1,556\nAmortization of intangibles 112 225 443 689\nRestructuring recoveries — (55) — (74)\nDeposit-related charged-off items 410 188 19,987 978\nOther 3,398 3,812 11,051 10,527\nTotal noninterest expense $ 32,469 $ 34,735 $ 119,502 $ 102,178\nSalaries and employee benefits expense decreased $2.3 million, or 13%, to $15.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $18.2 million for the third\nquarter of 2023.

The increases in both periods were primarily due to higher legal expenses in 2024 attributed to the deposit-related fraud event, including $384\nthousand and $1.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 and first nine months of 2024, respectively.\nComputer and data processing expense increased $246 thousand, or 5%, to $5.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $5.1 million for the third\nquarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, computer and data processing expense increased $1.5 million, or 11%, to $16.1 million compared to $14.5\nmillion for the first nine months of 2023. The increase during the 2024 periods was due in part to an increase in digital banking expense attributable to increased\nusage along with our strategic investments in data efficiency and marketing technology.\nAdvertising and promotions expense decreased $373 thousand, or 50%, to $371 thousand for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $744 thousand for the third\nquarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, advertising and promotions expense decreased $448 thousand, or 29%, to $1.1 million, compared to $1.6\nmillion for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in both periods reflected higher advertising and promotions expense in the prior year periods related to\nthe money market campaign.\nDeposit-related charged-off items expense for the first nine months of 2024 included an $18.2 million loss associated with charge-offs associated with the\ndeposit-related fraudulent activity we experienced in early March 2024, including the $18.4 million recorded in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by $143\nthousand of recoveries recorded in the second quarter of 2024.\nOther expense decreased $414 thousand, or 11%, to $3.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $3.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. For the first\nnine months of 2024, other expense increased $524 thousand, or 5%, to $11.1 million compared to $10.5 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase\nfor the first nine months of 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in New York State capital base franchise tax accrual.\nOur efficiency ratio for the third quarter of 2024 and the first nine months of 2024 was 64.70% and 71.75%, respectively, compared with 66.47% and 64.25%\nfor the third quarter of 2023 and the first nine months of 2023, respectively. The higher efficiency ratio for the first nine months of 2024 was reflective of the\n$18.2 million pre-tax loss in deposit-related charged-off items and approximately $1.4 million of legal and consulting expenses, recorded in professional\nservices expense, attributed to the deposit-related fraud event, partially offset by the $13.7 million gain on the sale of the assets of our insurance subsidiary. The\nefficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total noninterest expense by net revenue, defined as the sum of tax-equivalent net interest income and noninterest\nincome before net gains on investment securities. An increase in the efficiency ratio indicates that more resources are being utilized to generate the same volume\nof income, while a decrease indicates a more efficient allocation of resources. The efficiency ratio, a banking industry financial measure, is not required by\nGAAP. However, the efficiency ratio is used by management in its assessment of financial performance specifically as it relates to noninterest expense control.\nManagement also believes such information is useful to investors in evaluating Company performance.\n59\nTable of Contents\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nIncome Taxes\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income tax expense of $1.1 million and $6.0 million, versus $2.4 million and $7.6\nmillion for the same periods in the prior year. In the third quarter of 2024, we recognized federal and state tax benefits related to tax credit investments placed in\nservice and/or amortized during the period resulting in a reduction in income tax expense of $1.3 million, versus $731 thousand for the same period in the prior\nyear. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 also included related tax credit investment benefits of $3.4 million and $2.1 million, respectively.\nOur effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.4% and 12.6%, versus 14.8% and 15.9%, respectively, for the same periods\nin the prior year. Effective tax rates are typically impacted by items of income and expense that are not subject to federal or state taxation. Our effective tax rates\nreflect the impact of these items, which include, but are not limited to, interest income from tax-exempt securities, earnings on company owned life insurance\nand the impact of tax credit investments. In addition, our effective tax rates for 2024 and 2023 reflect the New York State tax benefit generated by our real estate\ninvestment trust.\nANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nINVESTING ACTIVITIES\nInvestment Securities\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our investment securities portfolio as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\nInvestment Securities Portfolio Composition\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAmortized Fair Amortized Fair\nCost Value Cost Value\nSecurities available for sale:\nU.S. Government agency and government-sponsored enterprise securities $ 24,535 $ 22,588 $ 24,535 $ 21,811\nMortgage-backed securities:\nAgency mortgage-backed securities 978,658 855,139 1,013,455 865,594\nNon-Agency mortgage-backed securities — 382 — 325\nOther debt securities 8,656 8,707 — —\nTotal available for sale securities 1,011,849 886,816 1,037,990 887,730\nSecurities held to maturity:\nU.S. Government agency and government-sponsored enterprise securities 16,626 16,413 16,513 15,983\nState and political subdivisions 48,472 44,205 68,854 63,782\nMortgage-backed securities 56,184 51,995 62,793 57,265\nTotal held to maturity securities 121,282 112,613 148,160 137,030\nAllowance for credit losses – securities (3) (4)\nTotal held to maturity securities, net 121,279 148,156\nTotal investment securities $ 1,133,128 $ 999,429 $ 1,186,146 $ 1,024,760\nOur available for sale (“AFS”) investment securities portfolio decreased $26.1 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The AFS portfolio had a\nnet unrealized loss of $125.0 million at September 30, 2024 and $150.3 million at December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in the AFS portfolio balance\nwas primarily due to maturities of investment securities, and the use of cash to fund loan originations and reduce short-term borrowings in the first nine months\nof 2024.\n60\nTable of Contents\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nSecurity Yields and Maturities Schedule\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding the amortized cost (“Cost”), weighted average yields (“Yield”) and contractual maturities of our\ndebt securities portfolio as of September 30, 2024.

If either case is affirmative, any previously recognized allowances are charged-off and the security’s\namortized cost is written down to fair value through income. If neither case is affirmative, the security is evaluated to determine whether the decline in fair value\nhas resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any\nchanges to the rating of the security by a rating agency and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment\nindicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the\nsecurity. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is\nrecorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an\nallowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. Adjustments to the allowance are reported in our income statement as a component of\ncredit loss expense. AFS securities are charged-off against the allowance or, in the absence of any allowance, written down through income when deemed\nuncollectible by management or when either of the aforementioned criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. For the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, no allowance for credit losses was recognized on AFS securities in an unrealized loss position as management does not believe\nany of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality.\n61\nTable of Contents\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nLENDING ACTIVITIES\nTotal loans were $4.40 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of $59.2 million from $4.46 billion at December 31, 2023.

Commercial business loans of $654.5 million, or 15% of total loans, were down $81.2 million, or 11%, from December 31, 2023, and total\ncommercial mortgage loans of $2.11 billion, or 48% of total loans, were up $100.3 million, or 5% from December 31, 2023. The increase in commercial\nmortgage loans was attributable to increases in construction, multifamily, owner and non-owner occupied loans. As of September 30, 2024, commercial real\nestate (“CRE”) loans made up approximately 66% of total commercial loans, and 41% of total loans, commercial and industrial loans approximated 30% of total\ncommercial loans, and 19% of total loans, and business banking unit loans were approximately 4% of total commercial loans and 3% of total loans. Our CRE\ncommitted credit exposure at September 30, 2024 related to approximately 42% multi-family, 18% office, 8% industrial property, 7% retail, 7% hospitality, and\n6% home builder. Approximately 70% of our office exposure at September 30, 2024, or 12% of our total CRE exposure, related to Class B or medical office\nspace. More than 70% of our office and 90% of our multifamily CRE loans have full or limited personal or corporate recourse.\nTotal consumer loans of $1.64 billion, or 37% of total loans at September 30, 2024, decreased $78.3 million from December 31, 2023. Consumer loans at\nSeptember 30, 2024 were comprised of residential real estate loans and lines of credit of $724.4 million, or 16% of total loans, consumer indirect loans of\n$874.7 million, or 20% of total loans, and other consumer loans of $43.7 million, or 1% of total loans. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we\noriginated $170.5 million in indirect automobile loans with a mix of approximately 25% new automobile and 75% used automobile loans. This compares with\nthe $238.2 million originated of indirect automobile loans with a mix of approximately 27% new automobile and 73% used automobile loans for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. Origination volumes and the mix of new and used vehicles financed fluctuate depending on general market conditions.\nEffective January 1, 2024, we exited the Pennsylvania automobile market to align our focus more fully around our core Upstate New York market, which\nincludes a strong network of approximately 375 new automobile dealers.\nLoans Held for Sale and Loans Serviced for Others\nLoans held for sale (not included in the loan portfolio composition table) were entirely comprised of residential real estate loans and totaled $2.5 million and\n$1.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nWe sell certain qualifying newly originated or refinanced residential real estate loans on the secondary market. Residential real estate loans serviced for others,\nwhich are not included in the consolidated statements of financial condition, amounted to $276.8 million and $269.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.\n62\nTable of Contents\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nAllowance for Credit Losses – Loans\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for credit losses – loans for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands).\nCredit Loss – Loans Analysis\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nAllowance for credit losses – loans, beginning of period $ 43,952 $ 49,836 $ 51,082 $ 45,413\nNet charge-offs (recoveries):\nCommercial business (3) 32 (33) (59)\nCommercial mortgage - construction — — — —\nCommercial mortgage - multifamily 12 — 13 —\nCommercial mortgage - non-owner occupied (1) (886) (3) (887)\nCommercial mortgage - owner occupied (1) (86) (4) (71)\nResidential real estate loans (1) (4) 99 67\nResidential real estate lines — — — 41\nConsumer indirect 1,553 2,283 5,370 4,421\nOther consumer 106 259 466 811\nTotal net charge-offs 1,665 1,598 5,908 4,323\nProvision (benefit) for credit losses – loans 2,391 1,392 (496) 8,540\nAllowance for credit losses – loans, end of period $ 44,678 $ 49,630 $ 44,678 $ 49,630\nNet loan charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans:\nCommercial business 0.00% 0.02% -0.01% -0.01%\nCommercial mortgage - construction 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00%\nCommercial mortgage - multifamily 0.01% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00%\nCommercial mortgage - non-owner occupied 0.00% -0.46% 0.00% -0.16%\nCommercial mortgage - owner occupied 0.00% -0.13% 0.00% -0.04%\nResidential real estate loans 0.00% 0.00% 0.02% 0.01%\nResidential real estate lines 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 0.07%\nConsumer indirect 0.70% 0.92% 0.79% 0.59%\nOther consumer 0.95% 3.00% 1.33% 4.57%\nTotal loans 0.15% 0.14% 0.18% 0.13%\nAllowance for credit losses – loans to total loans 1.01% 1.12% 1.01% 1.12%\nAllowance for credit losses – loans to nonaccrual loans 110% 522% 192% 522%\nAllowance for credit losses – loans to non-performing\nloans 110% 521% 192% 521%\nLoans not analyzed for a specific reserve are segmented into “pools” of loans based on their homogeneous risk characteristics, including purpose, tenor,\namortization, repayment source, payment frequency, collateral and recourse. Once loans have been segmented into pools, a loss rate is applied to the amortized\ncost basis. This is referred to as the “pooled loan” component of the allowance for credit losses estimate. Loans have historically been divided into six portfolio\nsegments of loans including Commercial Loans/Lines, Commercial Mortgage, Indirect Loans, Direct Loans, Residential Lines of Credit, and Residential Loans.\nBeginning in the third quarter of 2024, we further disaggregated the Commercial Mortgage loans into the following categories: Construction, Multifamily, Non-\nOwner Occupied, and Owner Occupied based on the risk characteristics of the loans and our methodology for monitoring and assessing credit risk. The\nallowance for credit losses for pooled loans estimate is based upon periodic review of the collectability of the loans quantitatively correlating historical loan\nexperience with reasonable and supportable forecasts using forward looking information. Adjustments to the quantitative evaluation may be made for\ndifferences in current or expected qualitative risk characteristics such as changes in underwriting standards, delinquency level, regulatory environment,\neconomic condition, Company management and the status of portfolio administration including our Loan Review function. We establish a specific reserve for\nindividually evaluated loans which do not share similar risk characteristics with the loans included in the forecasted allowance for credit losses. These\nindividually evaluated loans are removed from the pooling approach discussed above for the forecasted allowance for credit losses, and include nonaccrual\nloans, and other loans deemed appropriate by management, collectively referred to as collateral dependent loans. See Note 4., Loans, of the notes to the\nconsolidated financial statements for further details on collateral dependent loans.\n63\nTable of Contents\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nAssessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses – loans involves substantial uncertainties and is based upon management’s evaluation of the amounts\nrequired to meet estimated charge-offs in the loan portfolio after weighing a variety of factors, including the risk profile of our loan products and customers.\nThe adequacy of the allowance for credit losses – loans is subject to ongoing management review. While management evaluates currently available information\nin establishing the allowance for credit losses – loans, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the\nassumptions used in making the evaluations. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review a\nfinancial institution’s allowance for credit losses – loans. Such agencies may require the financial institution to increase the allowance based on their judgments\nabout information available to them at the time of their examination.\nNet charge-offs of $1.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 represented 0.15% of average loans on an annualized basis compared to net charge-offs of $1.6\nmillion, or 0.14% of average loans for the third quarter of 2023. The allowance for credit losses – loans was $44.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared\nwith $49.6 million at September 30, 2023. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses – loans to total loans was 1.01% at September 30, 2024 and 1.12% at\nSeptember 30, 2023. The ratio of allowance for credit losses – loans to non-performing loans was 110% at September 30, 2024, compared with 521% at\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase in non-performing loans at September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023 was largely related to two separate and\ndistinct commercial real estate loan relationships in our Upstate New York market, one of which was placed on nonaccrual during the third quarter of 2024, and\nthe other in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nThe following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for credit losses – loans by loan category as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands). The\nallocation is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which actual losses may occur. The total allowance is available to\nabsorb losses from any segment of the loan portfolio.\nAllowance for Credit Losses – Loans by Loan Category\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nPercentage Percentage\nCredit of loans by Credit of loans by\nLoss category to Loss category to\nAllowance total loans Allowance total loans\nCommercial business $ 8,475 14.9% $ 13,102 16.5%\nCommercial mortgage - construction 5,402 12.1 3,710 11.0\nCommercial mortgage - multifamily 2,609 10.6 4,009 10.1\nCommercial mortgage - non-owner occupied 7,478 18.5 6,074 17.7\nCommercial mortgage - owner occupied 4,200 6.6 2,065 6.1\nResidential real estate loans 3,795 14.7 5,286 14.6\nResidential real estate lines 833 1.7 764 1.7\nConsumer indirect 11,346 19.9 14,099 21.3\nOther consumer 540 1.0 1,973 1.0\nTotal $ 44,678 100.0% $ 51,082 100.0%\n64\nTable of Contents\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nNon-Performing Assets and Potential Problem Loans\nThe table below summarizes our non-performing assets at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands).\nNon-Performing Assets\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nNonaccrual loans:\nCommercial business $ 5,752 $ 5,664\nCommercial mortgage - construction 20,280 5,320\nCommercial mortgage - multifamily 71 189\nCommercial mortgage - non-owner occupied 4,903 4,651\nCommercial mortgage - owner occupied 366 403\nResidential real estate loans 5,790 6,364\nResidential real estate lines 232 221\nConsumer indirect 3,291 3,814\nOther consumer 14 13\nTotal nonaccrual loans 40,699 26,639\nAccruing loans 90 days or more delinquent 43 21\nTotal non-performing loans 40,742 26,660\nForeclosed assets 109 142\nTotal non-performing assets $ 40,851 $ 26,802\nNonaccrual loans to total loans 0.92% 0.60%\nNon-performing loans to total loans 0.93% 0.60%\nNon-performing assets to total assets 0.66% 0.44%\nNon-performing assets include non-performing loans and foreclosed assets. Non-performing assets at September 30, 2024 were $40.9 million, an increase of\n$14.0 million from the $26.8 million balance at December 31, 2023. The primary component of non-performing assets is non-performing loans, which were\n$40.7 million or 0.93% of total loans at September 30, 2024 and $26.7 million or 0.60% of total loans at December 31, 2023. The increase in non-performing\nloans at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 was largely related to a commercial mortgage - construction relationship that was placed on\nnonaccrual during the third quarter of 2024.\nApproximately $1.2 million, or 3%, of the $40.7 million in non-performing loans as of September 30, 2024 were current with respect to payment of principal\nand interest but were classified as non-accruing because repayment in full of principal and/or interest was uncertain.\nForeclosed assets consist of real property formerly pledged as collateral for loans, which we have acquired through foreclosure proceedings or acceptance of a\ndeed in lieu of foreclosure. We had $109 thousand and $142 thousand of properties representing foreclosed asset holdings at September 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023, respectively.\nPotential problem loans are loans that are currently performing, but information known about possible credit problems of the borrowers causes us to have\nconcern as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan payment terms and may result in disclosure of such loans as non-performing at some\ntime in the future. These loans remain in a performing status due to a variety of factors, including payment history, the value of collateral supporting the credits,\nand/or personal or government guarantees. We consider loans classified as substandard, which continue to accrue interest, to be potential problem loans.

The portion of our time deposits by account that were in excess of the FDIC insurance limit was $348.6 million and $302.6 million at September\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The maturities of our uninsured time deposits at September 30, 2024 were as follows: $162.7 million in three\nmonths or less; $32.5 million between three months and six months; $93.6 million between six months and one year; and $59.7 million over one year.\nApproximately $1.12 billion and $956.3 million of reciprocal and public deposits, characterized as preferred deposits for FDIC call report purposes, were\ncollateralized by government-backed securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, estimated uninsured\nnonpublic deposits were approximately 18% of total deposits.\nWe offer a variety of deposit products designed to attract and retain customers, with the primary focus on building and expanding long-term relationships. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, total deposits were $5.31 billion, representing an increase of $93.7 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily\ndue to increases in public, and non-public deposits, partially offset by decreases in brokered and reciprocal deposits. While seasonality in our public deposit\nportfolio was a contributor, public deposits accounts maintained higher balances during typical outflow cycles while growing deposits with new and existing\nmunicipalities. This was complemented by solid growth of non-public deposits during the nine month period. Time deposits were approximately 28% and 27%\nof total deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nNon-public deposits, the largest component of our funding sources, totaled $3.23 billion and $3.12 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively, and represented 61% and 60% of total deposits as of each date, respectively. We have managed this segment of funding through a strategy of\ncompetitive pricing that minimizes the number of customer relationships that have only a single service high-cost deposit account.\nAs an additional source of funding, we offer a variety of public (municipal) deposit products to the towns, villages, counties and school districts within our\nmarket area. Public deposits generally range from 20% to 30% of our total deposits. There is a high degree of seasonality in this component of funding because\nthe level of deposits varies with the seasonal cash flows for these public customers. We maintain the necessary levels of short-term liquidity to accommodate the\nseasonality associated with public deposits. Total public deposits were $1.18 billion and $1.02 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively, and represented 22% of total deposits as of each date.\nWe also participate in reciprocal deposit programs, which enable depositors to receive FDIC insurance coverage for deposits otherwise exceeding the maximum\ninsurable amount. Through these programs, deposits in excess of the maximum insurable amount are placed with multiple participating financial institutions.\nReciprocal deposits totaled $816.1 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $817.6 million at December 31, 2023, as this product has been an attractive\noption for customers with more than $250 thousand on deposit desiring FDIC insurance. Reciprocal deposits represented 15% and 16% of total deposits as of\neach date, respectively.\nBrokered deposits totaled $79.4 million and $256.8 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and represented 2% and 5% of total\ndeposits as of each date. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $29.4 million and $206.8 million of interest-bearing demand deposits and $50.0\nmillion of time deposits were brokered deposit accounts. The Bank reduced the outstanding balance of the brokered sweep deposit portfolio by $180.0 million in\nApril 2024 through the utilization of more cost effective funding sources.\n67\nTable of Contents\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nBorrowings\nThe Company classifies borrowings as short-term or long-term in accordance with the original terms of the applicable agreement. Outstanding borrowings\nconsisted of the following as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nShort-term borrowings:\nFHLB $ 55,000 $ 107,000\nFRB — 78,000\nTotal short-term borrowings 55,000 185,000\nLong-term borrowings:\nFHLB 50,000 50,000\nSubordinated notes, net 74,765 74,532\nTotal long-term borrowings 124,765 124,532\nTotal borrowings $ 179,765 $ 309,532\nShort-term Borrowings\nShort-term Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) borrowings have original maturities of less than one year and include overnight borrowings which we typically\nutilize to address short term funding needs as they arise. Short-term FHLB borrowings at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled $55.0 million and\n$107.0 million, respectively. The FHLB borrowings are collateralized by securities from the Company’s investment portfolio and certain qualifying loans. In\nMay 2023, we borrowed $15.0 million under the Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) Bank Term funding program at a rate of 4.80%, which matured on May 8,\n2024. In December 2023, we borrowed an additional $50 million under the program at an interest rate of 4.89%, which matures on December 13, 2024, and\n$13.0 million at an interest rate of 4.88%, which matures on December 20, 2024. Short-term borrowings and brokered deposits have historically been utilized to\nmanage the seasonality of public deposits. We continue to be proactive in managing funding costs and reduced short-term borrowings in the third quarter.\nAs of September 30, 2024, $50.0 million of the short-term borrowings balance was designated as a cash-flow hedge, which became effective in April 2022, at a\nfixed rate of 0.787%, $30.0 million was designated as a cash-flow hedge, which became effective in January 2023, at a fixed rate of 3.669%, and $25.0 million\nwas designated as a cash-flow hedge, which became effective in May 2023, at a fixed rate of 3.4615%.\nWe have credit capacity with the FHLB and can borrow through facilities that include amortizing and term advances or repurchase agreements. We had\napproximately $284.7 million of immediate credit capacity with the FHLB, and approximately $878.6 million in secured borrowing capacity at the FRB\ndiscount window as of September 30, 2024. The FHLB and FRB credit capacity are collateralized by securities from our investment portfolio and certain\nqualifying loans. We had $155.0 million of credit available under unsecured federal funds purchased lines with various banks as of September 30, 2024, with no\namounts outstanding. Additionally, we had approximately $133.7 million of unencumbered liquid securities available for pledging at September 30, 2024.\nThe Parent has a revolving line of credit with a commercial bank allowing borrowings up to $20.0 million in total as an additional source of working capital. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, no amounts have been drawn on the line of credit.\nLong-term Borrowings\nAs of September 30, 2024 we had a long-term advance payable to FHLB of $50.0 million. The advance matures on January 20, 2026 and bears interest at a\nfixed rate of 4.05%. FHLB advances are collateralized by securities from our investment portfolio and certain qualifying loans.\nOn October 7, 2020, we completed a private placement of $35.0 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes to qualified\ninstitutional buyers and accredited institutional investors that were subsequently exchanged for subordinated notes with substantially the same terms (the “2020\nNotes”) registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2020 Notes have a maturity date of October 15, 2030 and bear interest, payable semi-\nannually, at the rate of 4.375% per annum, until October 15, 2025. Commencing on that date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum\nequal to the then current three-month SOFR plus 4.265%, payable quarterly until maturity. The 2020 Notes are redeemable by us, in whole or in part, on any\ninterest payment date on or after October 15, 2025, and we may redeem the Notes in whole at any time upon certain other specified events. We used the net\nproceeds for general corporate purposes, organic growth and to support regulatory capital ratios at Five Star Bank. Proceeds, net of debt issuance costs of $740\nthousand, were $34.3 million. The 2020 Notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes.\nOn April 15, 2015, we issued $40.0 million of subordinated notes (the “2015 Notes”) in a registered public offering. The 2015 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate\nof 6.0% per year, payable semi-annually, for the first 10 years. From April 15, 2025 to the April 15, 2030 maturity date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an\nannual interest rate equal to the then current three-month CME Term SOFR plus 4.20561%. The 2015 Notes are redeemable by us at any quarterly interest\npayment date beginning on April 15, 2025 to maturity at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Proceeds, net of debt issuance costs of $1.1 million, were $38.9\nmillion. The 2015 Notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes.\n68\nTable of Contents\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nLiquidity\nWe continue to actively monitor our liquidity profile and funding concentrations in accordance with our Board approved Liquidity Policy. Management is\nactively monitoring customer activity by way of commercial and consumer line of credit utilization, as well as deposit flows. As of September 30, 2024, all\nstructural liquidity ratios and early warning indicators remain in compliance, with what we believe are ample funding sources available in the event of a stress\nscenario.\nThe objective of maintaining adequate liquidity is to assure that we meet our financial obligations. These obligations include the withdrawal of deposits on\ndemand or at their contractual maturity, the repayment of matured borrowings, the ability to fund new and existing loan commitments and the ability to take\nadvantage of new business opportunities. We achieve liquidity by maintaining a strong base of both core customer funds and maturing short-term assets; we also\nrely on our ability to sell or pledge securities and lines-of-credit and our overall ability to access to the financial and capital markets.\nLiquidity for the Bank is managed through the monitoring of anticipated changes in loans, the investment portfolio, deposits and wholesale funds. The strength\nof the Bank’s liquidity position is a result of its base of core customer deposits. These core deposits are supplemented by wholesale funding sources that include\ncredit lines with other banking institutions, the FHLB, the FRB Discount Window, and brokered deposit relationships.\nThe primary source of our non-deposit short-term borrowings is FHLB advances, of which $55.0 million were outstanding at September 30, 2024. In addition to\nthis amount, we have additional collateralized wholesale borrowing capacity of approximately $1.32 billion as of September 30, 2024 from various funding\nsources which include the FHLB, the FRB and commercial banks that we can use to fund lending activities, liquidity needs, and/or to adjust and manage our\nasset and liability position.\nThe Parent’s funding requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders, debt service, income taxes, operating expenses, funding of non-bank\nsubsidiaries, repurchases of our stock, and acquisitions. The Parent obtains funding to meet obligations from dividends received from the Bank, net taxes\ncollected from subsidiaries included in the federal consolidated tax return, and the issuance of debt and equity securities. In addition, the Parent maintains a\nrevolving line of credit with a commercial bank for an aggregate amount of up to $20.0 million, all of which was available at September 30, 2024. The line of\ncredit has a one-year term and matures in May 2025. Funds drawn would be used for general corporate purposes and backup liquidity.\nCash and cash equivalents were $249.6 million as of September 30, 2024, up $125.1 million from $124.4 million as of December 31, 2023. During the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $50.1 million and the principal source of operating activity cash flow was\nnet income adjusted for noncash income and expense items. Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $126.7 million, which primarily included inflows\nfrom a decrease in net loans of $53.2 million, $51.0 million for net proceeds from investment securities, and $27.0 million for the proceeds from the sale of the\nassets of SDN, partially offset by outflows of $4.6 million for purchases of premises and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities of $51.7 million was\nprimarily attributed to a $130.0 million net decrease in short-term borrowings, and $15.0 million in dividend payments, partially offset by a $93.7 million net\nincrease in deposits.\nCapital Management\nWe actively manage capital, commensurate with our risk profile, to enhance shareholder value. We also seek to maintain capital levels for the Company and the\nBank at amounts in excess of the regulatory “well-capitalized” thresholds. Periodically, we may respond to market conditions by implementing changes to our\noverall balance sheet positioning to manage our capital position.\nBanks and financial holding companies are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies. Failure to\nmeet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a\ndirect material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Capital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations,\ninvolve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and\nclassifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors.\nShareholders’ equity was $500.3 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of $45.5 million from $454.8 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to net\nincome in the first nine months of 2024, and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $17.9 million during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 due primarily to a decrease in net unrealized losses on securities available for sale.\nThe FRB and FDIC have adopted a system using risk-based capital guidelines to evaluate the capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies on a\nconsolidated basis. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s capital levels remained characterized as “well-capitalized” under the Basel Committee on\nBanking Supervision’s (“BCBS”) capital guidelines for U.S. banks. See the “Basel III Capital Rules” section below for further discussion.\n69\nTable of Contents\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nThe following table reflects the ratios and their components (dollars in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nCommon shareholders’ equity $ 485,184 $ 441,773\nLess: Goodwill and other intangible assets 58,292 69,594\nNet unrealized loss on investment securities (1) (92,996) (111,761)\nHedging derivative instruments 2,530 3,911\nNet periodic pension and postretirement benefits plan adjustments (11,448) (11,946)\nOther (115) (145)\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) Capital 528,921 492,120\nPlus: Preferred stock 17,292 17,292\nTier 1 Capital 546,213 509,412\nPlus: Qualifying allowance for credit losses 45,581 48,916\nSubordinated Notes 74,765 74,532\nTotal regulatory capital $ 666,559 $ 632,860\nAdjusted average total assets (for leverage capital purposes) $ 6,082,367 $ 6,224,339\nTotal risk-weighted assets $ 5,145,278 $ 5,218,724\nRegulatory Capital Ratios\nTier 1 Leverage (Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets) 8.98% 8.18%\nCET1 Capital (CET1 capital to total risk-weighted assets) 10.28% 9.43%\nTier 1 Capital (Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets) 10.62% 9.76%\nTotal Risk-Based Capital (Total regulatory capital to total risk-weighted assets) 12.95% 12.13%\n(1) Includes unrealized gains and losses related to the Company’s reclassification of available for sale investment securities to the held to maturity\ncategory.\nWe have elected to apply the 2020 Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) transition provision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on\nregulatory capital, as provided by the US banking agencies’ March 2020 interim final rule. Under the 2020 CECL transition provision, the regulatory capital\nimpact of the Day 1 adjustment to the allowance for credit losses (after-tax) upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date has been deferred and has begun to\nphase into regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL, we were allowed to defer the regulatory capital\nimpact of the allowance for credit losses in an amount equal to 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses (pre-tax) recognized through earnings for\neach period between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustment to the allowance for credit losses between January 1, 2020, and\nDecember 31, 2021, also began to phase into regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022.\nBasel III Capital Rules\nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, the current minimum capital ratios, including an additional capital conservation buffer applicable to the Company and the\nBank, are:\n• 7.0% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;\n• 8.5% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and\n• 10.5% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets.\nBanking institutions with a capital conservation buffer below the minimum level will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based\non the amount of the shortfall. The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a “countercyclical capital buffer” that is applicable to only certain covered\ninstitutions and does not have any current applicability to the Company or the Bank. Strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also\nimplemented under the Basel III Capital Rules. As of September 30, 2024, the Company and Bank’s capital levels remained characterized as “well capitalized”\nunder the Basel III rules, including the additional capital conversion buffer.\n70\nTable of Contents\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nThe following table presents actual and required capital ratios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 for the Company and the Bank under the Basel\nIII Capital Rules.

Banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be paid. Approval by regulatory authorities is required\nif the effect of dividends declared would cause the regulatory capital of the Bank to fall below specified minimum levels. Approval is also required if dividends\ndeclared exceed the net profits for that year combined with the retained net profits for the preceding two years.\n71\nTable of Contents\nITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket risk refers to the potential impact on earnings or capital arising from movements in interest rates. The Bank’s market risk management framework has\nbeen developed to control both short-term and long-term exposure within Board approved policy limits and is monitored by the Asset-Liability Management\nCommittee and Board of Directors. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk were presented at December 31, 2023 in Item 7A of the\nCompany’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 13, 2024. The\nfollowing is an update of the discussion provided therein.\nPortfolio Composition\nThere was no material change in the composition of assets, deposit liabilities or borrowings from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. See the section\ntitled “Analysis of Financial Condition” in Part I, Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a\ndiscussion of asset, deposit and borrowing activity during the period.\nNet Interest Income at Risk\nA primary tool used to manage interest rate risk is “rate shock” simulation to measure the rate sensitivity. Rate shock simulation is a modeling technique used to\nestimate the impact of changes in rates on net interest income as well as economic value of equity.\nNet interest income at risk is measured by estimating the changes in net interest income resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates\nof different magnitudes over a period of 12 months. The following table sets forth the estimated changes to net interest income over the 12-month period ending\nSeptember 30, 2025, assuming instantaneous changes in interest rates for the given rate shock scenarios (dollars in thousands):\nChanges in Interest Rate\n-300 bp -200 bp -100 bp +100 bp\nEstimated change in net interest income $ (17,201) $ (11,660) $ (5,722) $ 3,649\n% Change -9.52% -6.45% -3.17% 2.02%\nIn the rising rate scenarios, the static model results indicate that net interest income is modeled to increase compared to the flat rate scenario over a one-year\ntime frame. This is a combination of an increase across the entire deposit portfolio, which has decreased wholesale borrowings and the higher cost associated\nwith the borrowings. This simulation does not consider balance sheet growth or a change in the balance sheet mix. As intermediate and longer-term assets\ncontinue to mature and are replaced at higher yields, net interest income should improve over the longer-term time frame. Model results in the declining rate\nscenario show a decrease in net interest income due to a combination of increases in the yield curve, as well as increases in higher paying public and nonpublic\ndeposits, which will reprice downward slower due to market deposit competition.\nIn addition to the changes in interest rate scenarios listed above, other scenarios are typically modeled to measure interest rate risk. These scenarios vary\ndepending on the economic and interest rate environment. Furthermore, given the static balance sheet approach, retained earnings are considered to be\nreinvested in a noninterest earning asset.\nThe simulation referenced above is based on our assumption as to the effect of interest rate changes on assets and liabilities and assumes a parallel shift of the\nyield curve. It also includes certain assumptions about the future pricing of loans and deposits in response to changes in interest rates. Further, it assumes that\ndelinquency rates would not change as a result of changes in interest rates, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. While this simulation is\na useful measure as to net interest income at risk due to a change in interest rates, it is not a forecast of future results, does not measure the effect of changing\ninterest rates on noninterest income and is based on many assumptions that, if changed, could cause a different outcome.\nEconomic Value of Equity at Risk\nThe economic (or “fair”) value of financial instruments on our balance sheet will also vary under the interest rate scenarios previously discussed. This variance\nis measured by simulating changes in our economic value of equity (“EVE”), which is calculated by subtracting the estimated fair value of liabilities from the\nestimated fair value of assets. Fair values for financial instruments are estimated by discounting projected cash flows (principal and interest) at current\nreplacement rates for each account type, while fair values of non-financial assets and liabilities are assumed to equal book value and do not vary with interest\nrate fluctuations. An economic value simulation is a static measure for balance sheet accounts at a given point in time, but this measurement can change\nsubstantially over time as the characteristics of our balance sheet evolve and as interest rate and yield curve assumptions are updated.\nThe amount of change in economic value under different interest rate scenarios depends on the characteristics of each class of financial instrument, including the\nstated interest rate or spread relative to current market rates or spreads, the likelihood of prepayment, whether the rate is fixed or floating, and the maturity date\nof the instrument. As a rule, fixed-rate financial assets become more valuable in declining rate scenarios and less valuable in rising rate scenarios, while fixed-\nrate financial liabilities gain in value as interest rates rise and lose value as interest rates decline. The longer the duration of the financial instrument, the greater\nthe impact a rate change will have on its value. In our economic value simulations, estimated prepayments are factored in for financial instruments with stated\nmaturity dates, and decay rates for non-maturity deposits are projected based on historical data (back-testing).\n72\nTable of Contents\nThe analysis that follows presents the estimated EVE resulting from market interest rates prevailing at a given quarter-end (“Pre-Shock Scenario”), and under\nother interest rate scenarios (each a “Rate Shock Scenario”) represented by immediate, permanent, parallel shifts in interest rates from those observed at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands). The analysis additionally presents a measurement of the interest rate sensitivity at September\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. EVE amounts are computed under each respective Pre-Shock Scenario and Rate Shock Scenario. An increase in the EVE\namount is considered favorable, while a decline is considered unfavorable. The following table sets forth the estimated changes to EVE assuming instantaneous\nchanges in interest rates for the given rate shock scenarios (dollars in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nPercentage Percentage\nRate Shock Scenario: EVE Change Change EVE Change Change\nPre-Shock Scenario $ 696,228 $ 627,519\n- 300 Basis Points 604,300 $ (91,928) -13.20% 584,066 $ (43,453) -6.92%\n- 200 Basis Points 641,432 (54,796) -7.87 603,181 (24,338) -3.88\n- 100 Basis Points 672,833 (23,395) -3.36 616,940 (10,579) -1.69\n+ 100 Basis Points 710,808 14,580 2.09 626,463 (1,056) -0.17\nThe increase in the Pre-Shock Scenario EVE at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 is the result of the overall value increase of the loan\nportfolio, slightly offset by deposits. The sensitivity in the down Rate Shock Scenarios to EVE grow more negative at September 30, 2024 compared to\nDecember 31, 2023. This is a result from concentrated efforts to grow the deposit portfolio to decrease wholesale borrowings, and a subsequent mix shift from\nnon-maturity deposits to time deposits. As a result, the shift from non-maturity to time deposits has made the deposit portfolio slightly less valuable in non-\npublic deposits which was slightly offset by the seasonal inflow of non-maturity public deposits.\nITEM 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including\nthe Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and\nprocedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b), as adopted by the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). Based upon that\nevaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective\nas of the end of the period covered by this report.\nDisclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that\nthe Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and\nforms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in\nthe reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company’s Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n73\nTable of Contents\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we are a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business. Regardless of the outcome,\nlitigation can have an adverse impact on us because of prosecution, defense and settlement costs, unfavorable awards, diversion of management resources and\nother factors.\nWe are party to an action filed against us on May 16, 2017 by Matthew L. Chipego, Charlene Mowry, Constance C. Churchill and Joseph W. Ewing in the Court\nof Common Pleas in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Plaintiffs sought class certification to represent classes of consumers in New York and Pennsylvania along with\nstatutory damages, interest and declaratory relief. The plaintiffs sought to represent a putative class of consumers who are alleged to have obtained direct or\nindirect financing from us for the purchase of vehicles that we later repossessed. The plaintiffs specifically claim that the notices the Bank sent to defaulting\nconsumers after their vehicles were repossessed did not comply with the relevant portions of the Uniform Commercial Code in New York and Pennsylvania. We\ndispute and believe we have meritorious defenses against these claims and plan to vigorously defend ourselves.\nOn September 30, 2021, the Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and certified four different classes (two classes of New York consumers and\ntwo classes of Pennsylvania consumers). There are approximately 5,200 members in the New York classes and 300 members in the Pennsylvania classes.\nOn September 26, 2022, the lower Court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment for most of the relief they seek and found that there were\nquestions of fact as to whether the members of the class had purchased the subject vehicles for “consumer use” within the meaning of the relevant statutes. The\nCourt also denied our motion for partial summary judgment seeking an offset in the form of recoupment reducing any liability that may be imposed against us\nby the amounts that the borrowers owe for failing to repay their motor vehicle loans, determining that the Court could not enter a judgment on recoupment –\nwhich is a set off from liability – without first determining whether there was liability.\nDuring the July 11, 2024 pretrial conference, the Court instructed the parties to engage in further settlement of non-binding mediation discussions and set a\nSeptember 11, 2024 deadline to file motions in limine and a bench trial to commence on May 5, 2025.\nAll depositions and document productions have been completed. Plaintiff did not file a Motion in Limine by September 11, 2024. Plaintiffs however filed a\nmotion for partial judgment on October 8, 2024 asserting that the recoupment claims were barred because they were too distinct from the underlying claims. We\nintend to file an opposition against the motion for partial summary judgment with the Court by the November 7, 2024 deadline. The parties continue to discuss\npotential candidates to serve as a mediator in response to the Court’s instruction that they explore further settlement or mediation discussions.\nWe have not accrued a contingent liability for this matter at this time because, given our defenses, we are unable to conclude whether a liability is probable to\noccur nor are we able to currently reasonably estimate the amount of potential loss.\nIf we settle these claims or the action is not resolved in our favor, we may suffer reputational damage and incur legal costs, settlements or judgments that exceed\nthe amounts covered by our insurer. We can provide no assurances that our insurer will cover the full legal costs, settlements or judgments we incur. If we are\nunsuccessful in defending ourselves from these claims or if our insurer does not cover the full amount of legal costs we incur, the result may materially\nadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to the risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-\nK for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also\nadversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n74\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nIn June 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 766,447 shares of common stock. The program will expire at\nthe earlier of the completion of all share repurchases or a Board vote to retire the program.\nThe Company’s repurchases of its common stock during the third quarter of 2024 were as follows:\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nTotal Number of Maximum Number\nShares Purchased of Shares that May\nas Part of Publicly Yet Be Purchased\nTotal Number of Average Price Paid Announced Plans or Under the Plans or\nPeriod Shares Purchased (1) Per Share Programs Programs\nJuly 1, 2024 – July 31, 2024 — $ — — 766,447\nAugust 1, 2024 – August 31, 2024 1,081 24.04 — 766,447\nSeptember 1, 2024 – September 30, 2024 — — — 766,447\nTotal 1,081 $ 24.04 — 766,447\n(1) This column reflects shares of common stock deemed surrendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of employee\nrestricted stock units.\nITEM 5.
