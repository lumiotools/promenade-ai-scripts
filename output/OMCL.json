(NASDAQ: OMCL) (“Omnicell”) today announced that it intends to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the “notes”) in a private placement (the “offering”) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Omnicell also intends to grant the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, during a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the first date on which the notes are issued, up to an additional $22.5 million aggregate principal amount of notes. \n\nThe notes will be general unsecured, senior obligations of Omnicell, will accrue interest payable semiannually in arrears and will mature on December 1, 2029, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. Upon conversion, Omnicell will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of Omnicell’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of Omnicell’s common stock, at Omnicell’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of Omnicell’s conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted. The interest rate, initial conversion rate, redemption or repurchase rights and other terms of the notes will be determined at the time of pricing of the offering. \n\nOmnicell expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions described below (after such cost is partially offset by the proceeds to Omnicell from the sale of warrants in the warrant transactions described below). In addition, Omnicell expects to use the remaining net proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand, to repurchase for cash up to $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of Omnicell’s outstanding 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 notes”) as described below. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Omnicell expects to sell additional warrants to the option counterparties and use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional notes, together with the proceeds from the sale of additional warrants, to enter into additional convertible note hedge transactions and the remaining net proceeds for repurchases of the 2025 notes or for working capital and other general corporate purposes. \n\nIn connection with the pricing of the notes, Omnicell expects to enter into convertible note hedge transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). Omnicell also expects to enter into warrant transactions with the option counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to Omnicell’s common stock upon any conversion of notes and/or offset any cash payments Omnicell is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be. However, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on Omnicell’s common stock to the extent that the market price per share of Omnicell’s common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Omnicell expects to enter into additional convertible note hedge transactions and additional warrant transactions with the option counterparties. \n\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedges of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, Omnicell expects the option counterparties or their respective affiliates to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Omnicell’s common stock and/or purchase shares of Omnicell’s common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Omnicell’s common stock or the notes at that time. \n\nIn addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Omnicell’s common stock and/or purchasing or selling Omnicell’s common stock or other securities of Omnicell in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so in connection with any conversion, redemption or repurchase of the notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Omnicell’s common stock or the notes, which could affect a noteholder’s ability to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the number of shares of Omnicell’s common stock, if any, and value of the consideration, if any, that a noteholder will receive upon conversion of the notes. \n\nConcurrently with the pricing of the notes in the offering, Omnicell expects to enter into one or more separate and individually negotiated transactions with certain holders of the 2025 notes to repurchase for cash up to $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2025 notes (the “note repurchases”). The terms of the note repurchases are anticipated to be individually negotiated with each holder of the 2025 notes and will depend on several factors, including the market price of Omnicell’s common stock and the trading price of the 2025 notes at the time of such note repurchases. No assurance can be given as to how much, if any, of the 2025 notes will be repurchased or the terms on which they will be repurchased. Omnicell expects to negotiate the note repurchases through one of the initial purchasers and/or its affiliate. This press release is not an offer to repurchase the 2025 notes and the offering of the notes is not contingent upon the repurchase of the 2025 notes. Omnicell may also repurchase additional outstanding 2025 notes following the completion of the offering. \n\nOmnicell expects that holders of the 2025 notes that are repurchased by Omnicell as described above may enter into or unwind various derivatives with respect to Omnicell’s common stock (including entering into derivatives with one or more of the initial purchasers in the offering or their respective affiliates) and/or purchase or sell shares of Omnicell’s common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. \n\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2025 notes, Omnicell entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the “existing convertible note hedge transactions”) and warrant transactions (the “existing warrant transactions” and, together with the existing convertible note hedge transactions, the “existing call spread transactions”) with one of the initial purchasers and certain financial institutions (the “existing counterparties”). To the extent Omnicell repurchases any 2025 notes, it may enter into agreements with the existing counterparties concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of this offering to unwind a portion of the existing convertible note hedge transactions in a notional amount corresponding to the principal amount of the 2025 notes so repurchased. In addition, Omnicell may enter into agreements with the existing counterparties concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of this offering to unwind a portion of the existing warrant transactions with respect to a number of shares of Omnicell’s common stock equal to the notional shares underlying such 2025 notes so repurchased. \n\nIn connection with such terminations and the related unwinding of the existing hedge position of the existing counterparties with respect to such transactions, such existing counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may sell shares of Omnicell’s common stock in secondary market transactions and/or unwind various derivative transactions with respect to Omnicell’s common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. \n\nThe repurchases of the 2025 notes and any unwind of the existing call spread transactions described above, and the potential related market activities by holders of the 2025 notes that are repurchased by Omnicell and the existing counterparties, as applicable, could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) or decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of Omnicell’s common stock, which may affect the trading price of the notes offered in the offering at that time and, to the extent effected concurrently with the pricing of this offering, the initial conversion price of the notes. Omnicell cannot predict the magnitude of such market activity or the overall effect it will have on the price of the notes offered in the offering or its common stock. \n\nNeither the notes, nor the shares of Omnicell’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, if any, have been, or will be, registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, absent registration or an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws. \n\nThis press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall it constitute an offer to sell, solicitation of an offer to buy or sale of any securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. \n\n**About Omnicell**\n\nSince 1992, Omnicell has been committed to transforming pharmacy care through outcomes-centric innovation designed to optimize clinical and business outcomes across all settings of care. Through a comprehensive portfolio of robotics, smart devices, intelligent software, and expert services, Omnicell solutions are helping healthcare facilities worldwide to reduce costs, improve labor efficiency, establish new revenue streams, enhance supply chain control, support compliance, and move closer to the industry vision of the Autonomous Pharmacy. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking” statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements concerning the proposed terms of the notes, the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the note repurchases and the unwind of the existing call spread transactions, the completion, timing and size of the proposed offering of the notes and the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the anticipated use of proceeds from the offering, including the proposed note repurchases, and the potential impact of the foregoing or related transactions on dilution to holders of Omnicell’s common stock, and the market price of Omnicell’s common stock or the notes or the conversion price of the notes. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual events to differ materially from Omnicell’s plans. These risks include, but are not limited to, market risks, trends and conditions, Omnicell’s ability to complete the proposed offering on the expected terms, or at all, whether Omnicell will be able to satisfy closing conditions related to the proposed offering, whether and on what terms Omnicell may repurchase any of the 2025 notes, changes in the structure or terms of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, changes in the structure or terms of the unwind of the existing call spread transactions and unanticipated uses of capital and those risks included in the section titled “Risk Factors” in Omnicell’s Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings and reports, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and other filings that Omnicell makes from time to time with the SEC, which are available on the SEC’s website at [www.sec.gov](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=54154658&newsitemid=20241118007741&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sec.gov&index=1&md5=d0261a7dd2599d7e28660f9ca045f52f).

(NASDAQ: OMCL) (“Omnicell”) today announced the pricing of $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the “notes”) in a private placement (the “offering”) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Omnicell also granted the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, during a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the first date on which the notes are issued, up to an additional $22.5 million aggregate principal amount of notes. The sale of the notes is expected to close on November 22, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. \n\nThe notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Omnicell and will accrue interest payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2025 at a rate of 1.00% per annum. The notes will mature on December 1, 2029, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. \n\nOmnicell estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $144.2 million (or approximately $166.0 million if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes in full), after deducting fees and estimated expenses. Omnicell expects to use approximately $13.1 million of the net proceeds from the offering to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions described below (after such cost is partially offset by the proceeds to Omnicell from the sale of warrants in the warrant transactions described below). In addition, Omnicell expects to use the remaining net proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand, to repurchase for approximately $391.2 million in cash $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of Omnicell’s outstanding 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 notes”) as described below. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Omnicell expects to sell additional warrants to the option counterparties and use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional notes, together with the proceeds from the additional warrants, to enter into additional convertible note hedge transactions and the remaining net proceeds for repurchases of the 2025 notes or for working capital and other general corporate purposes. \n\nNoteholders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding August 1, 2029 only upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. On or after August 1, 2029 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, noteholders may convert all or any portion of their notes at any time. \n\nUpon conversion, Omnicell will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of Omnicell’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of Omnicell’s common stock, at Omnicell’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of Omnicell’s conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted. The conversion rate will initially be 17.4662 shares of Omnicell’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $57.25 per share of Omnicell’s common stock). The initial conversion price of the notes represents a premium of approximately 35% over the last reported sale price of Omnicell’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on November 19, 2024. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or if Omnicell delivers a notice of redemption, Omnicell will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a noteholder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such a corporate event or notice of redemption, as the case may be. \n\nOmnicell may not redeem the notes prior to December 6, 2027. Omnicell may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes (subject to certain limitations), at Omnicell’s option, on or after December 6, 2027 if the last reported sale price of Omnicell’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which Omnicell provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, _plus_ accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the notes. \n\nIf Omnicell undergoes a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture that will govern the notes), then, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions, noteholders may require Omnicell to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, _plus_ accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. \n\nIn connection with the pricing of the notes, Omnicell entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates and certain other financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). Omnicell also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to Omnicell’s common stock upon any conversion of notes and/or offset any cash payments Omnicell is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be. However, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on Omnicell’s common stock to the extent that the market price per share of Omnicell’s common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants. The strike price of the warrant transactions will initially be $84.82 per share, which represents a premium of 100% over the last reported sale price of Omnicell’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on November 19, 2024, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the warrant transactions. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Omnicell expects to enter into additional convertible note hedge transactions and additional warrant transactions with the option counterparties. \n\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedges of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, Omnicell expects the option counterparties or their respective affiliates to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Omnicell’s common stock and/or purchase shares of Omnicell’s common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Omnicell’s common stock or the notes at that time. \n\nIn addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Omnicell’s common stock and/or purchasing or selling Omnicell’s common stock or other securities of Omnicell in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so in connection with any conversion, redemption or repurchase of the notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Omnicell’s common stock or the notes, which could affect a noteholder’s ability to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the number of shares of Omnicell’s common stock, if any, and value of the consideration, if any, that a noteholder will receive upon conversion of the notes. \n\nConcurrently with the pricing of the notes in the offering, Omnicell entered into separate and individually negotiated transactions with certain holders of the 2025 notes to repurchase for approximately $391.2 million in cash, $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2025 notes, including accrued and unpaid interest on the 2025 notes, on terms negotiated with each holder through one of the initial purchasers and/or its affiliate (the “note repurchases”). This press release is not an offer to repurchase the 2025 notes and the offering of the notes is not contingent upon the repurchase of the 2025 notes. \n\nOmnicell expects that holders of the 2025 notes that are repurchased by Omnicell as described above may enter into or unwind various derivatives with respect to Omnicell’s common stock (including entering into derivatives with one or more of the initial purchasers in the offering or their respective affiliates) and/or purchase or sell shares of Omnicell’s common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. In connection with the issuance of the 2025 notes, Omnicell entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the “existing convertible note hedge transactions”) and warrant transactions (the “existing warrant transactions” and, together with the existing convertible note hedge transactions, the “existing call spread transactions”) with one of their initial purchasers and certain financial institutions (the “existing counterparties”). In connection with the note repurchases, Omnicell expects to enter into agreements with the existing counterparties to unwind a portion of the existing convertible note hedge transactions in a notional amount corresponding to the principal amount of the 2025 notes so repurchased. In addition, Omnicell expects to enter into agreements with the existing counterparties to unwind a portion of the existing warrant transactions with respect to a number of shares of Omnicell’s common stock equal to the notional shares underlying such 2025 notes so repurchased. \n\nIn connection with such expected terminations and the related unwinding of the existing hedge position of the existing counterparties with respect to such transactions, such existing counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may sell shares of Omnicell’s common stock in secondary market transactions and/or unwind various derivative transactions with respect to Omnicell’s common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. \n\nThe repurchases of the 2025 notes and the expected unwind of the existing call spread transactions described above, and the potential related market activities by holders of the 2025 notes that are repurchased and the existing counterparties, as applicable, could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) or decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of Omnicell’s common stock, which may affect the trading price of the notes offered in the offering at that time and, to the extent effected concurrently with the pricing of this offering, the initial conversion price of the notes. Omnicell cannot predict the magnitude of such market activity or the overall effect it will have on the price of the notes offered in the offering or its common stock. Neither the notes, nor the shares of Omnicell’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, if any, have been, or will be, registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, absent registration or an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws. \n\nThis press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall it constitute an offer to sell, solicitation of an offer to buy or sale of any securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. \n\n**About Omnicell**\n\nSince 1992, Omnicell has been committed to transforming pharmacy care through outcomes-centric innovation designed to optimize clinical and business outcomes across all settings of care.

Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual events to differ materially from Omnicell’s plans. These risks include, but are not limited to, market risks, trends and conditions, Omnicell’s ability to complete the offering, the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the note repurchases and/or the unwind of the existing call spread transactions, on the expected terms, or at all, whether Omnicell will be able to satisfy closing conditions related to the offering, the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the note repurchases and/or the unwind of the existing call spread transactions, unanticipated uses of capital and those risks included in the section titled “Risk Factors” in Omnicell’s Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings and reports, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and other filings that Omnicell makes from time to time with the SEC, which are available on the SEC’s website at [www.sec.gov](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=54155747&newsitemid=20241119175512&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sec.gov&index=1&md5=49d85518e7d44977fa298fc99fcf471d).

(NASDAQ:OMCL) (“Omnicell,” “we,” “our,” “us,” “management,” or the “Company”), a leader in transforming the pharmacy care delivery model, today announced results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\nRandall Lipps, chairman, president, chief executive officer, and founder of Omnicell, said, “We are pleased to deliver another consecutive quarter of solid financial performance, with results within or exceeding each of our previously issued guidance ranges. As the macroeconomic environment within the healthcare sector continues to show signs of stabilization, we believe our outcomes-centric innovation and customer-first focus is resonating with the market.” \n\nMr. Lipps continued, “We are also excited to welcome Nnamdi Njoku to the Omnicell leadership team as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Nnamdi brings a depth of operational experience and a purpose-driven leadership ethos that we believe will be instrumental for Omnicell as we continue to scale our business.” \n\n**Financial Results**\n\nTotal revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $282 million, down $16 million, or 5%, from the third quarter of 2023. The year-over-year decrease in total revenues reflects the impact of a continued challenging environment for some of our health system customers and the timing of our XT Series automated dispensing systems lifecycle, as we are largely through the replacement cycle. \n\nTotal GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $9 million, or $0.19 per diluted share. This compares to GAAP net income of $6 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. \n\nTotal non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $26 million, or $0.56 per diluted share. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $28 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. \n\nTotal non-GAAP EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was $39 million. This compares to non-GAAP EBITDA of $41 million for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Omnicell’s balance sheet reflected cash and cash equivalents of $571 million, total debt (net of unamortized debt issuance costs) of $572 million, and total assets of $2.3 billion. Cash flows provided by operating activities in the third quarter of 2024 totaled $23 million. This compares to cash flows provided by operating activities totaling $57 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $350 million of availability under its revolving credit facility with no outstanding balance. \n\n**Corporate Highlights**\n\n  * The Company appointed Nnamdi Njoku as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. In this newly created role, Mr. Njoku – a seasoned business executive with approximately 25 years of experience with several global healthcare and medical technology organizations – will lead Omnicell’s global operations. \n\n\n  * The Company announced Central Med Automation Service, a comprehensive offering designed to streamline medication dispensing from a central fulfillment area throughout the entire health system enterprise, which is expected to enhance inventory visibility, scalability, and patient safety. Integrating enterprise-wide robotics, smart devices, and intelligent software with expert services in an effort to help health systems optimize central fill pharmacy operations, Central Med Automation Service is expected to help health systems develop and execute a central fill strategy while providing the expert support necessary to help ensure this environment meets current and future medication management needs. \n\n\n  * The Company’s EnlivenHealth ® brand continues to deliver innovative solutions designed to optimize population health, deliver exceptional patient care, and cultivate sustainable growth. One of the largest long-term care pharmacy companies in the United States implemented EnlivenHealth’s Medicare Match solution in order to provide cost estimates for patient out-of-pocket expenses; this is expected to reduce the staffing needed to provide accurate service and should give patients and caregivers more autonomy over their data. \n\n\n  * Omnicell’s IVX Station has been awarded Gold for Technical Innovation of the Year for Healthcare Technology by the 2024 Stevie ® Awards for Technology Excellence. As sterile compounding demands grow, we believe the importance of automating sterile compounding processes in an effort to enhance accuracy, support compliance, and improve workflow efficiency is more critical than ever. This award recognizes Omnicell’s innovative approach in working to help our healthcare partners address these challenges. \n\n\n\n**2024 Guidance**\n\nBased on strong performance during the first three quarters of 2024 and current visibility of the business, the Company is updating the previously provided 2024 annual guidance ranges. For the full year 2024, the Company expects bookings to be between $800 million and $875 million. The Company expects full year 2024 total revenues to be between $1.100 billion and $1.110 billion. The Company expects full year 2024 product revenues to be between $625 million and $630 million, and full year 2024 service revenues to be between $475 million and $480 million. The Company expects full year 2024 technical services revenues to be between $236 million and $238 million, and full year 2024 Advanced Services revenues to be between $239 million and $242 million. The Company expects full year 2024 non-GAAP EBITDA to be between $129 million and $134 million. The Company expects full year 2024 non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.65 and $1.72 per share. \n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company expects total revenues to be between $295 million and $305 million. The Company expects fourth quarter 2024 product revenues to be between $177 million and $182 million, and fourth quarter 2024 service revenues to be between $118 million and $123 million. The Company expects fourth quarter 2024 non-GAAP EBITDA to be between $40 million and $45 million. The Company expects fourth quarter 2024 non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.55 and $0.62 per share. \n\nThe table below summarizes Omnicell’s fourth quarter and full year 2024 guidance outlined above. \n\n**Q4’24** |  **2024**  \n---|---  \n**Bookings** |  Not provided  |  $800 million - $875 million   \n**Total Revenues** |  $295 million - $305 million  |  $1.100 billion - $1.110 billion   \n**Product Revenues** |  $177 million - $182 million  |  $625 million - $630 million   \n**Service Revenues** |  $118 million - $123 million  |  $475 million - $480 million   \n**Technical Services Revenues** |  Not provided  |  $236 million - $238 million   \n**Advanced Services Revenues** |  Not provided  |  $239 million - $242 million   \n**Non-GAAP EBITDA** |  $40 million - $45 million  |  $129 million - $134 million   \n**Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share** |  $0.55 - $0.62  |  $1.65 - $1.72   \n  \nThe Company does not provide guidance for GAAP net income or GAAP earnings per share, nor a reconciliation of any forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis, because it is unable to predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. These forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures do not include certain items, which may be significant, including, but not limited to, unusual gains and losses, costs associated with future restructurings, acquisition-related expenses, and certain tax and litigation outcomes. \n\n**Omnicell Conference Call Information**\n\nOmnicell will hold a conference call today, Wednesday, October 30, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss third quarter 2024 financial results.

These risks and uncertainties include, among other things, (i) unfavorable general economic and market conditions, including the impact and duration of inflationary pressures, (ii) Omnicell’s ability to take advantage of growth opportunities and develop and commercialize new solutions and enhance existing solutions, (iii) reduction in demand in the capital equipment market or reduction in the demand for or adoption of our solutions, systems, or services, (iv) delays in installations of our medication management solutions or our more complex medication packaging systems, (v) risks related to Omnicell’s investments in new business strategies or initiatives, including its transition to selling more products and services on a subscription basis, and its ability to acquire companies, businesses, or technologies and successfully integrate such acquisitions, (vi) ability to realize the benefits of our expense containment initiatives, (vii) risks related to failing to maintain expected service levels when providing our Advanced Services or retaining our Advanced Services customers, (viii) Omnicell’s ability to meet the demands of, or maintain relationships with, its institutional, retail, and specialty pharmacy customers, (ix) risks related to climate change, legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change and related emphasis on ESG matters by various stakeholders, (x) changes to the 340B Program, (xi) Omnicell’s substantial debt, which could impair its financial flexibility and access to capital, (xii) covenants in our credit agreement could restrict our business and operations, (xiii) continued and increased competition from current and future competitors in the medication management automation solutions market and the medication adherence solutions market, (xiv) risks presented by government regulations, legislative changes, fraud and anti-kickback statues, products liability claims, the outcome of legal proceedings, and other legal obligations related to healthcare, privacy, data protection, and information security, including any potential governmental investigations and enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties, exposure to indemnification obligations or other liabilities, and adverse publicity as a result of the previously disclosed ransomware incident, (xv) any disruption in Omnicell’s information technology systems and breaches of data security or cyber-attacks on its systems or solutions, including the previously disclosed ransomware incident and any potential adverse legal, reputational, and financial effects that may result from it and/or additional cybersecurity incidents, as well as the effectiveness of business continuity plans during any future cybersecurity incidents, (xvi) risks associated with operating in foreign countries, (xvii) Omnicell’s ability to recruit and retain skilled and motivated personnel, (xviii) Omnicell’s ability to protect its intellectual property, (xix) risks related to the availability and sources of raw materials and components or price fluctuations, shortages, or interruptions of supply, (xx) Omnicell’s dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain components, equipment, and raw materials, as well as technologies provided by third-party vendors, (xxi) fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results may make our future operating results difficult to predict, (xxii) failing to meet (or significantly exceeding) our publicly announced financial guidance, and (xxiii) other risks and uncertainties further described in the “Risk Factors” section of Omnicell’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in Omnicell’s other reports filed with or furnished to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), available at [www.sec.gov](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=54144430&newsitemid=20241030989631&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sec.gov&index=5&md5=d8857ec638c04791b9d1496a9cb7a98d). Forward-looking statements should be considered in light of these risks and uncertainties. Investors and others are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements contained in this press release speak only as of the date of this press release. Omnicell assumes no obligation to update any such statements publicly, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of changed circumstances, new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\nThis press release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). Management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various performance measures. In addition to Omnicell’s GAAP results, we also consider non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, non-GAAP diluted shares, non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP EBITDA margin, and non-GAAP free cash flow. These non-GAAP results and metrics should not be considered as an alternative to revenues, gross profit, operating expenses, income from operations, net income, net income per diluted share, diluted shares, net cash provided by operating activities, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. We present these non-GAAP results and metrics because management considers them to be important supplemental measures of Omnicell’s performance and refers to such measures when analyzing Omnicell’s strategy and operations. \n\nOur non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, non-GAAP EBITDA, and non-GAAP EBITDA margin are exclusive of certain items to facilitate management’s review of the comparability of Omnicell’s core operating results on a period-to-period basis because such items are not related to Omnicell’s ongoing core operating results as viewed by management. We define our “core operating results” as those revenues recorded in a particular period and the expenses incurred within such period that directly drive operating income in such period. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because, in addition to meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance, the measures give us a better understanding of how we believe we should invest in research and development, fund infrastructure growth, and evaluate the effectiveness of marketing strategies. In calculating the above non-GAAP results: non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin exclude from their GAAP equivalents items a), b), e), and g) below; non-GAAP operating expenses excludes from its GAAP equivalents items a), b), c), d), e), g), h) and i) below; non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP operating margin exclude from their GAAP equivalents items a), b), c), d), e), g), h) and i) below; and non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share exclude from their GAAP equivalents items a) through i) below. Non-GAAP EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation, as well as excluding certain other non-GAAP adjustments. Non-GAAP EBITDA and non-GAAP EBITDA margin exclude from their GAAP equivalents items a), c), d), e), f), g), h) and i) below: \n\na)  |  _Share-based compensation expense._ We excluded from our non-GAAP results the expense related to equity-based compensation plans as it represents expenses that do not require cash settlement from Omnicell.   \n---|---  \nb)  |  _Amortization of acquired intangible assets._ We excluded from our non-GAAP results the intangible assets amortization expense resulting from our past acquisitions. These non-cash charges are not considered by management to reflect the core cash-generating performance of the business and therefore are excluded from our non-GAAP results.   \nc)  |  _Acquisition-related expenses._ We excluded from our non-GAAP results the expenses related to recent acquisitions, including amortization of representations and warranties insurance. These expenses are unrelated to our ongoing operations, vary in size and frequency, and are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to varying levels of acquisition activity. We believe that excluding these expenses provides more meaningful comparisons of the financial results to our historical operations and forward-looking guidance, and to the financial results of peer companies.   \nd)  |  _Impairment and abandonment of operating lease right-of-use and other assets related to facilities._ We excluded from our non-GAAP results the impairment and abandonment of certain operating lease right-of-use assets, as well as property and equipment, incurred in connection with restructuring activities for optimization of certain leased facilities. These non-cash charges are not considered by management to reflect the core cash-generating performance of the business and therefore are excluded from our non-GAAP results.   \ne)  |  _Severance-related expenses._ We excluded from our non-GAAP results the expenses related to restructuring events, partially offset by reversals of previously recognized severance expenses in subsequent periods. These expenses are unrelated to our ongoing operations, vary in size and frequency, and are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to varying levels of restructuring activity. We believe that excluding these expenses provides more meaningful comparisons of the financial results to our historical operations and forward-looking guidance, and to the financial results of peer companies.   \nf)  |  _Amortization of debt issuance costs._ Debt issuance costs represent costs associated with the issuance of revolving credit facilities and convertible senior notes. The costs include underwriting fees, original issue discount, ticking fees, and legal fees. These non-cash expenses are not considered by management to reflect the core cash-generating performance of the business and therefore are excluded from our non-GAAP results.   \ng)  |  _RDS restructuring._ We excluded from our non-GAAP results the nonrecurring restructuring charges related to the wind down of the Company’s Medimat Robotic Dispensing System (“RDS”) product line, partially offset by reversals of previously recognized expenses in subsequent periods. For the period ended September 30, 2024, those charges consisted primarily of inventory write-down, severance and other related expenses. These expenses are unrelated to our ongoing operations and we believe that excluding these expenses provides more meaningful comparisons of the financial results to our historical operations and forward-looking guidance, and to the financial results of peer companies.   \nh)  |  _Executives transition costs._ We excluded from our non-GAAP results the executives transition costs associated with the departure of certain executive officers, primarily consisting of severance expenses. These expenses are unrelated to our ongoing operations and we do not expect them to occur in the ordinary course of business. We believe that excluding these expenses provides more meaningful comparisons of the financial results to our historical operations and forward-looking guidance, and to the financial results of peer companies.   \ni)  |  _Ransomware-related insurance recoveries._ We excluded from our non-GAAP results the insurance recoveries related to the previously disclosed ransomware incident identified by the Company on May 4, 2022. These recoveries are unrelated to our ongoing operations and would not have otherwise been received by us in the normal course of business. We believe that excluding these recoveries provides more meaningful comparisons of the financial results to our historical operations and forward-looking guidance, and to the financial results of peer companies.   \n  \nManagement adjusts for the above items because management believes that, in general, these items possess one or more of the following characteristics: their magnitude and timing is largely outside of Omnicell’s control; they are unrelated to the ongoing operation of the business in the ordinary course; they are unusual and we do not expect them to occur in the ordinary course of business; or they are non-operational or non-cash expenses involving stock compensation plans or other items. \n\nWe believe that the presentation of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, non-GAAP EBITDA, and non-GAAP EBITDA margin is warranted for several reasons: \n\na)  |  Such non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional analytical tool for understanding Omnicell’s financial performance by excluding the impact of items which may obscure trends in the core operating results of the business.   \n---|---  \nb)  |  Since we have historically reported non-GAAP results to the investment community, we believe the inclusion of non-GAAP numbers provides consistency and enhances investors’ ability to compare our performance across financial reporting periods.   \nc)  |  These non-GAAP financial measures are employed by management in its own evaluation of performance and are utilized in financial and operational decision-making processes, such as budget planning and forecasting.   \nd)  |  These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons to the operating results of other companies in our industry, which also use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results (although these companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than Omnicell does), thus enhancing the perspective of investors who wish to utilize such comparisons in their analysis of our performance.   \n  \nSet forth below are additional reasons why share-based compensation expense is excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures: \n\ni)  |  While share-based compensation calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718 constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense of Omnicell, it is not an expense that requires cash settlement by Omnicell. We therefore exclude these charges for purposes of evaluating core operating results. Thus, our non-GAAP measurements are presented exclusive of share-based compensation expense to assist management and investors in evaluating our core operating results.   \n---|---  \nii)  |  We present ASC 718 share-based payment compensation expense in our reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures on a pre-tax basis because the exact tax differences related to the timing and deductibility of share-based compensation under ASC 718 are dependent upon the trading price of Omnicell’s common stock and the timing and exercise by employees of their stock options. As a result of these timing and market uncertainties, the tax effect related to share-based compensation expense would be inconsistent in amount and frequency and is therefore excluded from our non-GAAP results.   \n  \nNon-GAAP diluted shares is defined as our GAAP diluted shares, excluding the impact of dilutive convertible senior notes for which the Company is economically hedged through its anti-dilutive convertible note hedge transaction. We believe non-GAAP diluted shares is a useful non-GAAP metric because it provides insight into the offsetting economic effect of the hedge transaction against potential conversion of the convertible senior notes. \n\nNon-GAAP free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for software development for external use and purchases of property and equipment. We believe free cash flow is important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allows for greater transparency in the review and understanding of our overall financial, operational, and economic performance, because free cash flow takes into account certain capital expenditures and cash used for software development necessary to operate our business. \n\nAs stated above, we present non-GAAP financial measures because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of performance. However, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for Omnicell’s GAAP results. In the future, we expect to incur expenses similar to certain of the non-GAAP adjustments described above and expect to continue reporting non-GAAP financial measures excluding such items. Some of the limitations in relying on non-GAAP financial measures are: \n\na)  |  Omnicell’s equity incentive plans and stock purchase plans are important components of incentive compensation arrangements and will be reflected as expenses in Omnicell’s GAAP results for the foreseeable future under ASC 718.   \n---|---  \nb)  |  Other companies, including companies in Omnicell’s industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than Omnicell, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.   \nc)  |  A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in Omnicell’s cash balance for the period.   \n  \nA detailed reconciliation between Omnicell’s non-GAAP and GAAP financial results is set forth in the financial tables at the end of this press release. Investors are advised to carefully review and consider this information strictly as a supplement to the GAAP results that are contained in this press release as well as in Omnicell’s other reports filed with or furnished to the SEC. \n\n**Omnicell, Inc.**  \n---  \n**Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations**  \n**(Unaudited, in thousands, except per share data)**  \n**Three Months Ended

On the call\nwith me today are Randall Lipps, Omnicell Chairman, President, CEO, and Founder, and Nchacha Etta,\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nThis call will contain forward-looking statements, including statements related to financial projections or\nperformance or other statements regarding Omnicell’s plans, strategy, objectives, goals, expectations,\nplanned investments, expense management initiatives, the new chief operating officer appointment,\nproducts, services or solutions, our ability to deliver more consistent performance and drive long-term\nsuccess, or market or company outlook that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could\ncause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied.\nFor a more detailed description of the risks that impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to\nthe information in our press release issued today, in the Omnicell annual report on Form 10-K filed with the\nSEC on February 28, 2024, and in other more recent reports filed with the SEC. Please be aware that you\nshould not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements made today. All forward-looking\nstatements speak only as of the date hereof or the date specified on the call. Except as required by law,\nwe do not assume any obligation to update or otherwise release publicly any revisions to our forward-\nlooking statements.\nOur results were released this morning and are posted in the “Investor Relations” section of our website at\nir.omnicell.com.\nAdditionally, we would like to remind you that during this call we will discuss some non-GAAP financial\nmeasures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial\nmeasures are included in our financial results press releases posted on our Investor Relations website.\nWith respect to forward-looking non-GAAP measures we do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking\nnon-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis as these items are\ninherently uncertain and difficult to estimate and cannot be predicted without unreasonable effort.\nWith that I will turn the call over to Randall. Randall?\nRandall Lipps:\nThank you, Kathleen.\nGood morning and thank you all for joining us to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of 2024\nand our updated outlook for the remainder of the year.\nOmnicell delivered another solid quarter. We remain focused on consistent execution, driving our business\nto generate more recurring and predictable revenues, investing in and delivering outcomes-centric\ninnovation, and empowering our people to support our customers not only where they are today, but where\nthey will be in future. We firmly believe that transforming the pharmacy care delivery model will result in\npositive customer experiences and improved patient outcomes.\nNow, before I get into the industry trends we are seeing and our third quarter financials, I would like to\nformally welcome Nnamdi Njoku to Omnicell. During the quarter, we announced the appointment of Nnamdi\nto the newly created role of Chief Operating Officer. As I have shared with you over the last several\nquarters, we are working diligently to strengthen the company’s financial performance and operational\nexcellence, while taking a customer-first approach to our strategy and business transformation. As we\nscale our business, we believe that having Nnamdi in this role to lead and drive our operational change\nmanagement initiatives and the evolution of our culture of care will be vital in delivering enhanced\nstakeholder returns. Whether it be supporting our objective to deliver consistent GAAP profitability or\nhelping shift our company further towards a service and solutions-based model, we believe a clear\ncommitment to operational excellence will be essential to our long-term success.\nI know I speak for everyone here at Omnicell in welcoming Nnamdi to our team.\nNow, let’s turn to a review of the macroeconomic landscape. We are pleased to note that we see signs of\ncontinued stabilization in our end markets. Coupled with improving provider fundamentals, these market\nconditions are generally favorable for creating increased demand for capital projects and system\nmodernization through automation, software and analytics.\nWe are continuing to invest in next-generation upgrades and outcomes-based solutions for our XT fleet of\nautomated medication dispensing systems as well as making investments in Specialty Pharmacy Services.\nWe remain excited as we move forward on our multi-year journey here at Omnicell and we believe our\nrefreshed product portfolio, including XT Amplify, is resonating well with customers and is addressing our\ncustomers’ focus on the future of healthcare, whether in an acute or outpatient setting.\nNow, turning to our quarterly financials. We are pleased to revise our full year outlook for 2024, as part of\nwhich we are raising our profitability guidance ranges as our global team continues to take what we believe\nare deliberate and disciplined actions on expense management while embracing our objective to streamline\nour internal processes and systems. And while it is early, this appears to be bearing fruit in terms of\nimproved forecasting and business planning.\nTurning to our third quarter results. We delivered solid results that were generally in-line with or exceeded\nthe upper end of our guidance ranges, which we believe reflects strong demand for Omnicell’s products\nand services, and sound execution by our global team.\nOur third quarter 2024 total revenue was $282 million, representing a sequential increase of $6 million over\nthe prior quarter and a decrease of $16 million over third quarter 2023. Third quarter 2024 earnings per\nshare in accordance with GAAP were a profit of $0.19 per share compared to a profit of $0.08 per share in\nthe prior quarter and a profit of $0.12 per share in the third quarter 2023.\nOur third quarter 2024 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.56 compared with $0.51 per share in the\nprior quarter and $0.62 per share in the same period last year.\nThird quarter 2024 non-GAAP EBITDA was $39 million, a decrease of $1 million compared to the previous\nquarter, and a decrease of $2 million when compared to the same period last year.\nNchacha will provide more details of the drivers for this quarter’s performance as well as further details\nregarding our outlook for the remainder of the year.\nI’ll now highlight a few of the key customer wins in the third quarter. I’m pleased with the team’s\nachievements this quarter. We are successfully positioning our full portfolio of solutions to address our\ncustomers medication management needs across the care continuum. We are also seeing continued\nmomentum from our XTAmplify program, and we are seeing some positive signs that this is resonating\nwith the market. We are embracing an agile and innovative approach to foster more flexible and responsive\nengagement, which we believe will result in better customer experiences.\nOur multi-year XTAmplify innovation program that we announced earlier this year appears to be gaining\nmarket momentum with several new customers choosing these offerings in an effort to maximize value\nacross their health systems. A Minnesota-based non-profit health system selected Omnicell as its long-\nterm partner to standardize medication management across 12 hospital campuses by upgrading their fleet\nof Point of Care solutions. Through XT and XTExtend, which is an integral part of our XTAmplify innovation\nprogram, they seek to enhance the clinician experience, as well as safety, and security.\nYou may have seen in some of the reporting on the recent weather events that a production shutdown due\nto the hurricanes has resulted in instances of IV fluid shortages, shining a light on the need for health\nsystems to have greater control of their IV supply chain and strategies to mitigate the potential impact of\nshortages.\nA non-profit health system in Ohio signed a 5-year IV Compounding Service agreement in an effort to help\noptimize IV compounding accuracy, safety, and importantly, supply chain control. The health system also\nupgraded their existing Point of Care solutions across nine hospitals as it looks to enhance safety and\nsecurity, benefitting from the innovations delivered through our XTAmplify program.\nWhile automated dispensing cabinets are the standard of care on nursing floors, adoption of automation in\nthe operating room setting has often lagged. A leading academic medical center in Boston chose to extend\nits partnership with Omnicell, expanding its automation footprint to all operating rooms across the system\nwith our Anesthesia Workstation. This is in addition to the XT automated dispensing cabinet upgrades and\nXTAmplify products they purchased. Our Anesthesia Workstation, with an integrated label printer, is\nintended to help this medical center enhance patient safety and medication security in perioperative\nsettings.\nAdvanced Services delivered another quarter of solid performance. One highlight is a large health system\nin the Southeast that selected Omnicell’s Central Pharmacy Dispensing Service in an effort to enable\nimproved medication dispensing operations. Adopting the XR2 robot within its central pharmacy as a\nstandard of care should help to streamline medication storing, picking, and dispensing. It is also intended\nto optimize inventory management, which should drive enhanced clinical and operational outcomes.\nOmnicell Specialty Pharmacy Services continues to help enable customers to enhance their in-house\nspecialty pharmacy programs to serve more patients, optimize care, and improve performance. In the third\nquarter, we opened two new Specialty Pharmacies for health system customers.\nOur EnlivenHealth brand, part of our Advanced Services portfolio, continues to deliver SaaS solutions\ndesigned to help retail pharmacies and health systems optimize patient care and drive improved\nperformance.\nSeveral of our health system customers, including large health systems in Georgia and Michigan, have\nselected EnlivenHealth’s patient engagement and clinical solutions as they seek to enhance medication\nmanagement outcomes across the continuum of care. We believe these health systems are recognizing\nthe need for comprehensive solutions that extend beyond the four walls of the hospital and are choosing\nOmnicell to support a better patient experience everywhere patients receive care.\nIn summary, Omnicell delivered a strong third quarter. The team is stepping up and taking actions that are\nintended to improve our financial performance and operational excellence and deliver consistent results. I\nam very proud of our team’s enthusiasm and focus on outcomes-centric innovation, customer success,\nand our purpose to be the healthcare providers’ most trusted partner to enable the Autonomous Pharmacy\ntransformation.\nEvery day, I see Omnicell employees showing up for each other, for our customers, and for our\ncommunities. And it is this commitment and focus that is driving more consistent financial performance.\nWe have work to do, but I’m confident we are on our way toward delivering long-term consistent results as\nwe progress along our multi-year growth journey. Thank you for your support of Omnicell as we work\ndiligently to modernize and transform the pharmacy care delivery model.\nAt this point, I’d like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Nchacha Etta, for a more detailed\nreview of our third quarter financial performance and revised guidance.\nNchacha Etta:\nThank you, Randall. We delivered solid third quarter financial results, generally in line with or higher than\nour previously stated guidance. We believe this reflects the stabilizing macroeconomic environment as\nwell as our commitment to consistent execution and our focus on expense control and process\nimprovements. I am going to walk you through some of the drivers for our third quarter 2024\nperformance as well as our updated 2024 full year guidance.\nTotal revenues came in at the upper end of our previously issued guidance range while Non-GAAP\nEarnings per Share and Non-GAAP EBITDA exceeded our previously provided third quarter guidance. I\nam proud of the Omnicell team who continue to demonstrate their commitment to our promise and our\nguiding principles on a daily basis.\nOur third quarter 2024 total revenues were $282 million, an increase of $6 million over the prior quarter\nand a decrease of $16 million over third quarter 2023. Revenues in the third quarter were aided by the\nstrong performance of our Advanced Services including EnlivenHealth and Specialty Pharmacy Services.\nProduct revenues were $158 million, an increase of $2 million over the previous quarter and down $30\nmillion compared to third quarter 2023. Product revenues in third quarter 2024 decreased compared to\nthird quarter 2023 primarily due to lower volumes from our automated dispensing systems business.\nService revenues were $124 million, an increase of $4 million over the previous quarter and an increase\nof $14 million over the third quarter 2023. Similar to last quarter, both Technical Services and Advanced\nServices contributed to the growth compared to the third quarter of 2023, reflecting the growing Technical\nServices install base and impact of our pricing actions, as well as strong customer demand for our\nAdvanced Services.\nNon-GAAP gross margin for third quarter 2024 was 44.5%, an increase of 30 basis points from the prior\nquarter.\nA full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results are included in each of our second and third\nquarter 2024 quarterly earnings press releases, which are posted on our Investor Relations website.\nOur third quarter 2024 earnings per share in accordance with GAAP were a profit of $0.19 per share\ncompared to a profit of $0.08 per share in the prior quarter and a profit of $0.12 per share in third quarter\n2023. As we have mentioned previously, it is management’s goal to return to consistent GAAP\nprofitability and we believe this is evidence of that progress.\nOur third quarter 2024 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.56 compared with $0.51 per share in the\nprior quarter and $0.62 per share in the same period last year. Third quarter non-GAAP EBITDA was\n$39 million, a decrease of $1 million compared to the previous quarter and a decrease of $2 million when\ncompared to the same period last year. Third quarter 2024 non-GAAP EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings\nper share reflect our strong cost and operating expense management.\nAt the end of third quarter 2024, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $571 million, up from $557\nmillion as of June 30, 2024. Non-GAAP free cash flow during third quarter 2024 was $9 million. Free\nCash Flow was lower in the third quarter compared to the prior quarter as a result of the timing of\nemployee compensation and the annual merit increase.\nIn terms of accounts receivable, days sales outstanding for third quarter 2024 was 83 days. We are\npleased with our continued strong quarterly collections and working capital management.\nInventories as of September 30, 2024, were $95 million, an increase of $2 million from the prior quarter\nand a decrease of $21 million from September 30, 2023.\nNow turning to guidance, based on our third quarter 2024 results and our current visibility for the\nremainder of the year, we are updating our full year 2024 outlook, including increasing the bottom end of\nthe guidance ranges for Bookings and Total Revenues and increasing both the top and bottom end of the\nranges for Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share and Non-GAAP EBITDA. For full year 2024, we anticipate\nbookings to be in the range of $800 million to $875 million. Total revenues are expected to be in the\nrange of $1.100 billion to $1.110 billion. Non-GAAP EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $129\nmillion to $134 million. Non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.72. We believe\nthese increases in our full year 2024 guidance ranges reflect strength in the commercial momentum and\na strong cost management culture of the organization.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, we are providing the following guidance. We expect total fourth quarter\n2024 revenues to be between $295 million and $305 million with product revenues to be between $177\nmillion and $182 million, and service revenues between $118 million and $123 million. The fourth quarter\nproduct revenues guidance reflects strong visibility to scheduled implementations and the overall strength\nwe are seeing in the commercial business.\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 non-GAAP EBITDA to be between $40 million and $45 million. We expect\nfourth quarter 2024 non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.55 per share and $0.62 per share.\nNon-GAAP EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter includes seasonal\nexpenses and continued investment in innovation. For full year 2024, we are continuing to assume an\neffective blended tax rate of approximately 19% in our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance.\nAs we announced on our last earnings call, beginning in 2025, we plan to change the Bookings metric\nthat we provide. As a reminder, our Bookings currently include Connected Devices and Software\nLicenses, Advanced Services and Consumables.\nBeginning with our 2025 guidance, we plan to provide Product Bookings, which will consist of Connected\nDevices and Software Licenses. We also plan to provide a new metric, Annual Recurring Revenue\n(ARR), which will consist of Advanced Services, Technical Services and Consumables.\nWe are planning to provide a 2024 reconciliation utilizing the historic Bookings metric, as well as the new\nProduct Bookings and ARR metrics, so you have a corresponding “apples-to-apples” comparison for\n2025. We believe these new metrics will better reflect how we manage the business internally,\nparticularly given our focus on growing recurring revenue, and should be helpful to you in understanding\nand modeling our company going forward.\nAs we wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are pleased with our solid results for the third quarter of 2024\nand the stronger outlook we have provided in the form of updated guidance for full year 2024. I would\nalso like to take a moment to thank the entire Omnicell team for their commitment to improved execution\nand their customer first focus.\nWe would now like to open the call for questions.\nQUESTIONS & ANSWERS:\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Matt Hewitt from Craig-\nHallum Capital Group. Please go ahead.\nMatt Hewitt: Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Maybe first up on the revenue side,\nobviously another strong performance from the services side. The product side, obviously, you're still\ndealing with a little bit of headwinds, but I'm just curious, was there anything related to the hurricanes?\nWere there any delayed implementations or anything that maybe is leading to the better anticipated\ngrowth here in Q4?\nNchacha Etta: Hey, Matt. Good morning. This is Nchacha. Thank you for the question. The hurricane\ndid not have any impact in our Q3 revenue. As you saw, the revenue was in line with our expectations,\nand we do also expect our Q4 revenue to increase.\nMatt Hewitt: Got it. And then product gross margins, a very nice pop here in the third quarter. I'm just\ncurious, do you see that continuing to trend higher? Are you still working through some of the inventories\npurchased during the supply challenges of COVID, and therefore that's creating a little bit of a headwind?\nAnd when do you think, or how long should it take to get back to maybe where you were just a couple\nyears ago, which is closer to 50% Gross margin? Thank you.\nNchacha Etta: Yeah, Matt, as you know, we've been focused on improving our overall financial\nperformance, and gross margin continues to be a key focus of ours. We do expect our gross margin to\nimprove over time as we continue to invest in Advanced Services at massive scales, but we are also in a\nposition where we believe the feedback that we're getting from our customers with regards to the initial\nXTAmplify launch will continue. And those should start contributing to having a positive impact in our\nmargins over the years as they start contributing to meaningful revenue.\nKathleen Nemeth: And Matt, it's Kathleen. I'll jump in there and just know; you referenced the margins\n50% from a few years ago. We do have a different mix of revenue streams now that you're seeing\nreflected. So, as you know, we have specialty that's flowing through that is still scaling. So, the margins\nthere are a bit lower. So, as we continue to progress, we'll continue – we expect that to strengthen, but\nbear in mind that the revenue mix is different than it was a few years ago.\nMatt Hewitt: That's really helpful. Thank you. And maybe one last one, if you don't mind, regarding the\nXTAmplify pipeline. Given that this is a different type of upgrade cycle than you've experienced over the\nlast few, where it was more of the big equipment, this is more of a software. Would you anticipate that\nthis would maybe not follow a typical bell-shaped replacement curve? Is there an opportunity here for this\nto be maybe a little bit more front-end loaded, if you will? Maybe over the first two to three years, you\nwould see greater demand than you typically would with an upgrade cycle. Thank you.\nRandall Lipps: Yeah. I think the XTAmplify is more than an upgrade cycle, right? It's an on-ramp to new\ntechnology that we've never had before. And so, while it does include console upgrade, which we call\nXTExtend, it really allows us to engage the customers on several levels to access new products like\nMedChill. And we've committed to you and to the market that we are going to continue with this strong\ninnovation path, and we really feel excited about it. And as we show customers some of these new\ninnovations that are coming out, it really reflects an uptake in solution selling that can solve some\nproblems that have never been solved before. And so, the X Amplify is much larger than just a console\nupgrade. It has more types of hardware and software to be deployed that is essential in today's\nhealthcare system.\nMatt Hewitt: That's great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Jessica Tassan from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nJessica Tassan: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to just\nask kind of directionally about the cabinet contribution, excluding Amplify, year-over-year in 2025. I know\nwe don't have guidance yet, but just should we be thinking about the cabinets as being essentially stable\nthrough the end of the XT cycle or will they continue to decline off of the 2024 base?\nRandall Lipps: Well, we have a couple of actions going on, right? The cycle of the XT upgrades from\nthe G Series is cycling down. So, there are less opportunities to do those upgrades, but we have a large\nfleet now of XT that are out in the market that have the opportunity to do expand with the XT Amplify. So,\nit looks differently. But as customers upgrade their G Series to XT Series or the XTAmplify Series, all of\nthese large providers are generally in the midst of expansion or adding on new hospitals and different\naccounts. So, it allows several modes of expansion, and of course, competitive wins as they come along.\nJessica Tassan: That's helpful. And then maybe, Randy, can you just provide some perspective on how\nwe should be thinking about the cabinet lifecycle? Does this Amplify refresh cycle kind of change the\nhistorical 10-year cadence of new product releases or is it just a component of that 10-year cycle, which\nis still intact? Would be helpful if you could just offer some thoughts. Thank you\nRandall Lipps: Yeah, Jess, that's a really good question. No, this is – this really extends and allows for\nthe on-ramp to our next generation of technology, software and hardware. So, one of the things that we\nreally want to achieve is to make it easier for customers to acquire new technologies, upgrade to new\ntechnologies without as much disruption. So, the Amplify is the on-ramp to all our next-generation\ntechnology, which is some of the coolest on the planet. And as we move forward in time, we'll be talking\nmore about these things, but the XTAmplify is how you start. And it really resonates with customers\ntoday. It really makes them feel good that we're investing in what they have and we're also investing in\ntheir future. So, they love that part. And it resonates with customers who've never used this before, right,\nboth new potential customers like what we're doing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Allen Lutz from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAllen Lutz: Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. One for Randy here. Just kind of at a\nhigh level, as we look at the product revenue over the past couple quarters and then look to 4Q, and I\nknow Matt kind of already asked about was there some type of push into 4Q, but just trying to figure out,\nthe guidance for 4Q product revenues is really strong. And just trying to dissect exactly what is driving the\nsequential change, because if we look back the past few years, there's been a sequential change to the\nnegative side, which I think was more around the market getting weaker. But what exactly is going on in\n4Q that gives you confidence around the product revenue side? Is it the market improving? Is it Extend\nand Amplify contributing more? Trying to get a sense of what's driving the improvement into the back\nquarter of the year. Thanks\nRandall Lipps: Yeah, good question. There's nothing substantially different. We've met our guidance\nbasically in Q3, and Q4 just represents what's on our schedule. We've been working really hard to create\ngreat predictability based on the schedule of customer resources and our own resources and being able\nto meet those. And those schedules are very strong and set up even before we ended the quarter. So, it\ngives us really high confidence that we can meet these ranges and feel confident about getting the right\nbalance of recurring revenue as well as product revenues. And we did – just to be clear, we raised the\nbottom end of guidance for our technical service, our advanced services, our product revenues and our\nbookings. So, I think we feel pretty good about fourth quarter.\nAllen Lutz: Thanks, Randy. And then a follow-up from a comment you made around the specialty\npharmacy business. You opened up to in the quarter, seems like there's continued momentum there. As\nwe think about the Inflation Reduction Act, there's a lot of impact there to specialty drug pricing and\n340B. And so, it seems like the IRA is causing a lot of changes to that part of your customers' business.\nHas that had any type of impact, either positive or negative, on your prospects or your conversations with\nthese customers? Is it bringing them in? Is it bringing them to the table? Trying to understand if there's\nanything to read from those changes that begin next year. Thanks.\nRandall Lipps: Well, I think specialty pharmacy was something in previous years that was focused\nmostly on very large entities. Now, with the types of services and things that we can bring to the table,\neven small hospital systems can take on the inside specialty pharmacy on their site. And so, I think it's\nbroadened the market. So, the market has broadened. It's gotten more complex because you have to\nhave the expertise to understand which drugs are kind of dropping off and which ones are coming on\nboard and the ability to deal with a large – a larger catalog there and be the expertise for these entities.\nSo, I'd say the demand is increasing, it's strong there and – particularly in the middle and smaller\nmarkets.\nAllen Lutz: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephanie Davis from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Davis: Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter and thank you so much for taking my question.\nI was hoping we could revisit your cost optimization initiatives, just given the magnitude [ph] of the recent\nearning fee and the creation of a COO seat. So, how should we think about the initiatives taken to date?\nHave there been any major opportunities unearthed by your third-party consultants? And acknowledging\nthat it's only been like a month, is there any early color from Nnamdi Njoku on his top priorities as he gets\ninto the COO seat?\nNchacha Etta: Yeah. Thank you for the question. So, as you know, over the last 12 months, we've taken\nquite a lot of actions or some actions to improve our financial performance. And some of the actions\nwe've taken have really been driven by opportunities that we've seen across the company. We continue\nto explore further opportunities where we can drive operational efficiencies and improve our overall\nfinancial results. And this has become really part of Omnicell that we want to make sure that we continue\nto [indiscernible] (00:36:16) investments in innovation. And so, you will see us continue to take actions as\nneeded to improve our overall financial performance that is part of our company culture today.\nStephanie Davis: Are there any broad strokes or buckets of initiatives you can talk about that give us\njust maybe like a one level deeper on granularity?\nNchacha Etta: Well, I mean, a few areas that we're looking at. Like I mentioned earlier, operational\nefficiencies is one key area that we will really focus on going forward, especially with Nnamdi coming on\nboard. We want to make sure that we are optimizing whatever opportunities we have within across the\ncompany, that we're not leaving any stone unturned. We will look at all areas across the business\ncontinuously as we've done in the past to identify opportunities to improve our overall performance.\nKathleen Nemeth: And I would just add, Stephanie, as you saw with one of our European operations\nthat we're winding down, we're taking that type of approach, really looking at the business, as Nchacha\nsaid, across the board and not leaving any stone unturned.\nStephanie Davis: Super helpful. And just a quick follow-up on Central Med Automation Services. Is\nthere any color you can give us around the adoption broad over the next few years? Is there any\nopportunity beyond the hospital just as supply chain and centralized med management is really top of\nmind for retail pharmacies right now as well?\nRandall Lipps: Yeah. We see an emerging consolidated service centers where, as these entities have\ngotten considerably larger that they can get quite a bit of gains by creating a central – a center to put all\nof their pharmacy services into and move some of the costs out of the individual hospitals and use\nrobotics. And we launched – we talked a little bit about launching our consolidated service center offering\nthat really allow for the use of our on-site central pharmacy services. And these are quite unique because\nwe are able to put two and three, and in some cases, four of these robots together to generate enormous\nefficiencies and accuracies for picking for not just a single hospital, but 20, 30, 40 hospitals.\nStephanie Davis: Awesome to hear. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anne Samuel from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAnne Samuel: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. You spoke to seeing some stabilization within the\nhospital market. And I'm hoping maybe you could just expand on that a little bit. Maybe discuss how\nthey're thinking about prioritization of spend and ROI? And then, are budgets loosening across the board\nor are you just seeing it kind of in specific product areas?\nRandall Lipps: Well, I think the key is that when you think about spending on pharmacies, a strategic\ninvestment for long-term return, like these consolidated service centers. So, these are significant\ndecisions that need to make and significant multi-year programs that involve not just rolling out some\nsystems for an upgrade in a particular year, but much longer term. And so, we're starting to see those\nconversations reengage and build into our pipeline that give us really comfort because we want these\ndecisions to be just not opportunistic events for one year, but multiyear, which means really rolling out\nour entire platform. And in order to have these sort of multiyear discussions about a strategic\nimplementation to really make pharmacy key and get the returns and the ROI you want from it, it's really\na multiyear event. And we're seeing our customers come to the table on these, and both engaging us\nand bringing us into the conversations as well as we approach them, getting them involved in this\nbroader-based discussion really at a C-suite level.\nAnne Samuel: That's great to hear. As we're coming up on the end of the year, I was hoping maybe you\ncould just speak a little bit to how we should be thinking about headwinds and tailwinds as you look out to\n2025? And then also, how we should be thinking about Amplify within that context?\nRandall Lipps: Well, I think we're on a good trajectory and that health systems have incrementally been\nimproving quarter-to-quarter, and I would assume that that would continue. Remember, just because a\nhealth system is now positive, doesn't mean they run out and spend capital. It takes several of those\nquarters in a row to give them comfort before they start investing in strategic projects. So, assuming that\ncontinues in that form, I think there is some interest rate sensitivity. As long as they flatten or continue to\ngo down, I see a more willingness to spend strategic capital. And to really lean into the pharmacy\nstrategic spending, it requires that affordable rate for monies to put into these projects. And I think that\none of the things that is just – it just doesn't seem to stop, but it's a good thing for us, I think, is the\ncontinued consolidation. I was just in two customers this week, and I went into to look at their operations\nand talk about their future. And they both had a lot going on and they both talked about new acquisitions\nthey were continuing to add to their system, which seems to be a continual trend, which just continues to\nbring the conversation to these much larger strategic levels. So, I think those are tailwinds. Headwinds\nwould be more macroeconomic. If there's some change in the way payers pay or some changes in the\namount of people insured and how they're insured, but I don't really see that as much. I just think it's a\nslowly – a slow, steadily improvement is what we're seeing out there.\nKathleen Nemeth: And Randy, what I would add as well is, as we think about it, certainly, we're seeing\nsome positive signs on the end markets and macro, as we all are. For Omnicell, as we've been sharing\nwith you over the last couple of quarters, we're well along the path from a bookings perspective on the\nXT upgrade cycle. So that's something to keep in mind as well as you think about Omnicell's business as\nwe go forward over the next four to six quarters.\nAnne Samuel: Great. Thanks. And then just maybe just to kind of follow up to the back half of that\nquestion, just how we should be thinking about kind of Amplify within the context of those headwinds and\ntailwinds for next year, maybe when we – I know it takes a little bit of time for kind of bookings to convert\nto revenue. So how should we be thinking about timing for that?\nRandall Lipps: Well, I think we just started and I think the conversations are rich. I think that as we\nlaunch new innovations that we will continue to do on a regular basis, that will even enrich those\nconversations even more and give more driving reasons for more customers to deploy the Amplify\nplatform sooner. And so, I think that it's not just about when does the Amplify revenue event take place,\nit's about getting the broader conversation to get the broader Amplify uplift from the platform. So, I intend\nto see – I expect to see that every customer at this point pretty much we are engaged in as the XT\nAmplify discussion. So, we're beginning that roadmap and that should be a good tailwind to us as we\nmove into 2025, even though we have the – we don't have as many upgrades from the G Series.\nAnne Samuel: Great. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schoenhaus from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nScott Schoenhaus: Hi, team. Thanks for the question. So just want to get more sense on the product\nside. Can you just give us any color on how far along you're away through the upgrade cycle of the XT\nSeries currently? And then, in sort of the opportunity set for XT Amplify heading into next year, you\nmentioned both software and hardware. Can you talk about where you see the most opportunity or the\nbookings currently between the mix of those two? Thanks.\nRandall Lipps: Well, I think we're substantially through the G Series upgrades and the XT Series. So\nwe're kind of at the [indiscernible] (00:45:10) from a booking standpoint. Yes. Thank you, Kathleen. From\na booking standpoint. The Amplify series allows customers to access more products like MedChill and\nother new products that we're innovating. So, there is a driving desire to get these other products\ndeployed in these – in fleet of XT's that we have out there in the marketplace as well as new software\nfeatures and functions and additive things. And so, it's not all about just upgrading at the end of a cycle.\nIt's about getting access to new solution sets and new ways of looking at products on the supply chain as\nwell as in ambulatory. So, customers want to figure out how we can get from where they are today to\nwhere they want to be over the next three, four years. And so, XT Amplify is that discussion that is the\non-ramp to that. And just it's a more positive discussion with a customer than saying, hey, you need to\nupgrade because this thing is old and – because we are then stepping into their world, helping them to\nsolve the problems, just not give them a new system. And so, I think that's why the XT Amplify is really\nresonating well with us. And we'll continue to see engagement on several levels because there's a lot of\nparts of XT Amplify that customers can access.\nScott Schoenhaus: Thanks, Randy, for the color. Moving on to Advanced Services, obviously, that's a\nmixture right now of comprehensive, complex services that you're helping these hospital systems with\ntheir advanced pharmacy need as well as software modules like 340B. How should we think about that\nmix heading into next year and then, obviously, the margins on the more services-oriented part of\nAdvanced Services and the more software revenue streams? Thanks\nNchacha Etta: Yeah. So, well, we do see an opportunity, as we – again, as I mentioned earlier, as we\ncontinue to invest in Advanced Services and as the business continues to scale, we do see that\ncontributing to our overall margins. But from an Advanced Services standpoint, I think if you look at our\nperformance this year, Advanced Services is growing – we do expect it to continue to grow for the rest of\nthe year. Also, I mean, I want to call the fact that we do expect Advanced Services for the full year to be\naround 14%. So, it's really solid growth going into 2025.\nRandall Lipps: Yeah, continued growth, double-digit growth into next year. Technical services is\nprobably not quite as fast, but we're really moving to this metric of ARR continued revenue, the recurring\nportion of our business. We think that really just helps to make our business more transparent, easy to\nunderstand and really run – that's the way we run the business. And so, we wanted to make sure that we\nset it up going that way going forward for all of you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sutherland from The Benchmark Company.\nPlease go ahead.\nBill Sutherland: Hey. Thanks, everybody. I wanted to get an update on the IVX that's had to go through\nsome redesign required by the FDA guidelines and kind of where we are with just the outlook for getting\nthat into the market and the potential bookings.\nRandall Lipps: Yeah, I'd say it's still slow, but we're very optimistic about it. We've got these next\nreleases lined up to help us optimize those requirements. And it's beginning to make more sense and to\nprovide better outcomes for our customers. So, we see – we believe we'll see increased adoption and\nincreased bookings over year to year. Maybe not quite as fast as everybody would like, but it's a great\nproduct and I think its momentum is building, but it's still slow.\nBill Sutherland: Got it. And I just wanted to ask also about capital deployment. Any updated thoughts\nthere? And particularly with the convert that's due next year, what the thinking might be around that?\nNchacha Etta: Yeah. We're very mindful of the timing of the convert maturity and we do have – or we\ncontinue to explore strategic options to ensure that there's no dilution from a shareholder value\nstandpoint. As you know, we're in a very strong cash position with close to $600 million on our balance\nsheet and a $350 million revolver. And so we do – we are looking at different options to ensure that we\nnot find ourselves in a position where we're not taking advantage of the timing that we have. But also,\nwe're in a very solid position, as you know, with a 0.25% in our convertible senior note. So, we will make\n– take some actions here in the near future.\nBill Sutherland: Got it. Thanks, Nchacha.\nKathleen Nemeth: Then, Bill, to your question on capital deployment, I would note that we've shared\nwith you that we have a goal to get to consistent GAAP performance, but we are also looking at that\nROIC metric as well, so improving that return on invested capital. And what you're seeing over the last\ncouple of prior quarters is we're getting much more disciplined in our decision-making when it comes to\ncapital deployment within the company.\nBill Sutherland: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stan Berenshteyn from Wells Fargo. Please go\nahead.\nStan Berenshteyn: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just a quick one on\nbookings guidance. Can you just talk us through what needs to happen to get to the upper end of the\nrange for bookings?\nNchacha Etta: Yeah, Stan, what we look at today, we're very comfortable or confident with the bookings\nthat we've achieved year-to-date. We do expect the strength that we've seen from our commercial\noperations, that momentum continues. And we're confident that as we go through the end of the year,\nthat momentum should get us to achieve our bookings revised guidance. Again, guiding the lower end –\nor improving the lower end of our bookings for the full year is a testament to the confidence that we have\nin our bookings guidance for the rest of the year.\nRandall Lipps: Yeah. And two primary things here – just, Stan, two primary things have changed over\nthe last few years. One is the economic conditions of our customers has improved and the other thing is\nwe've launched new products. So, we have more in the pipeline and more willing customers to buy. And I\nthink that's the strength of our pipeline for Q4.\nStan Berenshteyn: Okay. And a quick follow-up on product revenue. Obviously, you're seeing a ramp\ninto the fourth quarter. 3Q came out, I think, a little bit light versus guidance. Can you just talk us through\nwhat happened in the quarter and is that just the timing impact that's now being pushed into 4Q?\nNchacha Etta: Yeah. Our 3Q product revenue was in line with our expectations. And as I mentioned\nearlier, we are confident on our ability to achieve our full year revenue guidance. As you saw, we did\nincrease the lower end of our product revenue and total revenue as a matter of fact. And that – again,\nthat is just it gives us the confidence that we will be able to achieve our product revenue for the full year.\nStan Berenshteyn: All right. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Larsen from BTIG. Please go ahead.\nDavid Larsen: Hi. Can you talk a little bit about your sales force? Like, how large is it? How many of\nthose reps are quota carrying? What portion are allocated to like Advanced Services and Enliven versus\nproduct or is it all mixed together? Any sort of color around your go-forward strategy relative to like a year\nago or two years ago? Thanks very much.\nRandall Lipps: Yeah. We've been evolving our sales force and our strategy to do a better job of\nconnecting the customer with our enterprise solution set as opposed to just single product opportunities.\nAnd with that has come the reorganization of the sales force to have more dedicated people to accounts\nthat help with the relationship building. And then those that do have quota carrying are substantially all of\nthose, but maybe not as heavily weighted as it has been in the past because of the relationship building\nand long-term strategy we have to deploy more of the enterprise solution set instead of just a single\nevent. So, we will continue to evolve that as we move forward. We don't really disclose kind of the exact\nnumbers on those people, but I think that we've really seen much better performance from our sales force\nthis year and the predictability and the commitments they've made and the numbers that they've\nproduced. And so, we feel that we've really gone through somewhat of a sea change over the last couple\nof years and we're really happy with where we are.\nDavid Larsen: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then, can you maybe just talk a little bit about your\nCRM platform? I think a few years ago, you went through a process where you really sort of reviewed\neach account, each client, how you actually measure bookings and/or backlog. I think you got a little bit\nmore conservative in what you reported as your backlog number. Can you maybe just talk about that,\nplease? And then just how much of your 2025 revenue will be covered by your reported backlog, if and\nwhen you report it on the fourth quarter call? Thank you.\nRandall Lipps: Yeah, David, I think most of the backlog, we don't say specifically. We say generally the\nconnected devices are 12 to 18 months in install. So, most of that backlog that we report will be\nsomewhat coming out of backlog over the next 6 to 18 months, I suppose, but it's not a precise\nmeasurement. And we've spent a lot of time not just redesigning the sales force, per the last question,\nbut also redesigning our systems and creating a better understandable go-to-market for our customers to\neasily – more easily deploy their capital. And that's really allowed us to get – move our CRM system, our\npeople and our processes to deliver much better predictability, not just in terms of bookings, but I would\nsay quite a significant step up in our product revenues and our service revenues as well. So, I feel like\nwe've taken this time over the last two years to invest in these systems, processes and people. We've\ndone all three. And that is what's driving these much more consistent results and that is why we're\nconfident about Q4.\nDavid Larsen: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: As there are no further questions at this time, that concludes our Q&A session. I would like to\nturn the call over back to Randall Lipps for closing remarks.\nRandall Lipps: Well, I'd just like to send a big thank you to all the Omnicell team that has worked really\nhard over the last two years to really bring us to this new point. It's so exciting to see customers reengage\nwith us on innovation, helping them to solve these really difficult problems to make medication\nmanagement better for the whole world. And then the results of this hard work are flowing through the\nP&L and it's just refreshing. And finally, I just welcome Nnamdi to the team. And we look forward to your\nleadership and continuing to develop the great commercialization we have going to the next step. We'll\nsee you folks next time. Cheers."

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nNote 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBusiness\nOmnicell, Inc. was incorporated in California in 1992 under the name Omnicell Technologies, Inc. and reincorporated in Delaware in 2001 as\nOmnicell, Inc. The Company’s major products and related services are medication management solutions and adherence tools for healthcare systems and\npharmacies, which are sold in its principal market, the healthcare industry. The Company’s market is primarily located in the United States and Europe.\n“Omnicell” or the “Company” refer to Omnicell, Inc. and its subsidiaries, collectively.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect, in the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of\nnormal recurring adjustments and accruals, necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nthe results of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and cash flows for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance\nwith U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023,\nfiled with the SEC on February 28, 2024. The Company’s results of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the year\nending December 31, 2024, or for any future period.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts\nreported in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. These estimates are based on historical experience and\nvarious other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events\nand actions that may impact the Company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates.\nThe Company’s critical accounting policies are those that affect its financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective, or complex\njudgments by management. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is not aware of any events or circumstances that would require an update to its estimates,\njudgments, or revisions to the carrying value of its assets or liabilities.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company manages its operations as a single segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions. The Company’s\nChief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is its Chief Executive Officer. The CODM allocates resources and evaluates the performance of the Company at\nthe consolidated level using information about its revenues, gross profit, income from operations, and other key financial data. All significant operating\ndecisions are based upon an analysis of the Company as one operating segment, which is the same as its reporting segment.\nRecently Adopted Authoritative Guidance\nThere was no recently adopted authoritative guidance that is expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements through the reporting date.\n10\nTable of Contents\nRecently Issued Authoritative Guidance\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting\n(Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires public entities to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly\nprovided to the CODM. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as well as all\nexisting segment disclosures and reconciliation requirements in ASC 280, on an interim and annual basis. The amendments are effective for the Company’s\nannual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning January 1, 2025. Retrospective application is required, with\nearly adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2023-07 to have a material impact on its balance sheets, statements of operations,\nor statements of cash flows, as the anticipated changes will be the inclusion of additional disclosures related to the Company’s single reportable segment.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which includes amendments\nthat further enhance income tax disclosures, primarily through standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by\njurisdiction. The amendments are effective for the Company’s annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied\neither prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2023-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2024, the SEC issued final rules under SEC Release No. 33-11275, “The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures\nfor Investors,” to require registrants to disclose certain climate-related information, including Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions and other\nclimate-related topics, if material, in registration statements and annual reports. In April 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed its climate disclosure rules as a result\nof pending legal challenges to facilitate an orderly judicial resolution. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the SEC’s rule will have on its\nconsolidated financial statements.\nThere was no other recently issued and effective authoritative guidance that is expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements through the reporting date.\nNote 2.

The Prior A&R Credit Agreement provided for (a) a five-year revolving credit facility of $500.0 million (the “Prior Revolving Credit Facility”)\nand (b) an uncommitted incremental loan facility of up to $250.0 million (the “Prior Incremental Facility”). In addition, the Prior A&R Credit Agreement\nincluded a letter of credit sub-limit of up to $15.0 million and a swing line loan sub-limit of up to $25.0 million. The Prior A&R Credit Agreement was\nsubsequently amended on September 22, 2020 and March 29, 2023, to permit the issuance of the convertible senior notes and the purchase of the convertible\nnote hedge transactions (as described in Note 10, Convertible Senior Notes, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q), expand the Company’s flexibility to make restricted payments (including common stock repurchases), and replace the total net leverage\ncovenant, as well as to remove and replace the interest rate benchmark based on the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) and related LIBOR-based\nmechanics with an interest rate benchmark based on the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nand related SOFR-based mechanics.\nOmnicell, Inc. entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Second A&R Credit Agreement”) on October 10, 2023, with the\nlenders from time to time party thereto, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., PNC Capital Markets LLC and TD Securities (USA) LLC\nas joint lead arrangers and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent.

In addition, the Second A&R Credit Agreement includes a letter of credit sub-limit of up to $15.0 million and a swing line loan sub-limit of up to\n$25.0 million. The Second A&R Credit Agreement has an expiration date of October 10, 2028, subject to acceleration under certain conditions, upon which\ndate all remaining outstanding borrowings will be due and payable.\nLoans under the Current Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at Omnicell, Inc.’s option, at a rate equal to either (a) the Adjusted Term SOFR (as\ndefined in the Second A&R Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.25% per annum based on the Company’s Consolidated\nTotal Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Second A&R Credit Agreement), or (b) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the\nfederal funds rate plus 0.50%, and (iii) the Adjusted Term SOFR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.50%\nto 1.25% per annum based on the Company’s Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio. Undrawn commitments under the Current Revolving Credit Facility are\nsubject to a commitment fee ranging from 0.20% to 0.35% per annum based on the Company’s Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio on the average daily\nunused portion of the Current Revolving Credit Facility. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Current Revolving Credit Facility or Current Incremental\nFacility Omnicell, Inc. is permitted to\n18\nTable of Contents\nmake voluntary prepayments at any time without payment of a premium or penalty. The availability of funds under the Current Revolving Credit Facility may\nbe subject to reduction in order to maintain compliance with the financial covenants under the Second A&R Credit Agreement.\nThe Second A&R Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants applicable\nto the Company, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, dividends, and other distributions. The\nSecond A&R Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require the Company to not exceed a maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio (not to\nexceed 3.00:1) and maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio (not to be less than 3.00:1). In addition, the Second A&R Credit Agreement\ncontains certain customary events of default including, but not limited to, failure to pay interest, principal, and fees, or other amounts when due, material\nmisrepresentations or misstatements in any representation or warranty, covenant defaults, certain cross defaults to other material indebtedness, certain judgment\ndefaults, and events of bankruptcy.\nOmnicell, Inc.’s obligations under the Second A&R Credit Agreement and, at the election of Omnicell, Inc. and the contracting counterparty, any\nsecured swap obligations and banking services obligations owing to a lender (or an affiliate of a lender) are guaranteed by certain of its domestic subsidiaries\nand secured by substantially all of its and such subsidiary guarantors’ assets. In connection with entering into the Second A&R Credit Agreement, and as a\ncondition precedent to borrowing loans thereunder, Omnicell, Inc. and certain of Omnicell, Inc.’s other direct and indirect subsidiaries have entered into certain\nancillary agreements, including, but not limited to, a reaffirmation agreement, which amends certain terms of the existing collateral agreement and reaffirms\ntheir obligations under the existing guaranty agreement.\nThe refinancing of the Prior Credit Agreement on October 10, 2023 was evaluated in accordance with ASC 470-50, Debt - Modifications and\nExtinguishments. In determining whether the refinancing was to be accounted for as a debt extinguishment or a debt modification, the Company considered\nwhether lenders within the syndicate remained the same or changed and whether the changes in debt terms were substantial. This assessment was performed on\nan individual lender basis within the syndicate. As a result, the refinancing was accounted for as a modification with the exception of certain lenders that exited\nthe syndicate. The exit of certain lenders resulted in an immaterial write-off of existing unamortized debt issuance costs. The remaining unamortized debt\nissuance costs related to debt modification, along with the new deferred costs, will be amortized over the remaining term of the Second A&R Credit\nAgreement. The Company incurred and capitalized an additional $3.0 million of debt issuance costs which are being amortized to interest expense using the\nstraight-line method through 2028.\nAs of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $350.0 million of funds available under the Current Revolving Credit\nFacility. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no outstanding balance under the Current Revolving Credit Facility. The\nCompany was in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024.\nNote 10. Convertible Senior Notes\n0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025\nOn September 25, 2020, the Company completed a private offering of $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes\n(the “Notes”), including the exercise in full of the initial purchasers’ option to purchase up to an additional $75.0 million principal amount of the Notes. The\nCompany received proceeds from the issuance of the Notes of $559.7 million, net of $15.3 million of transaction fees and other debt issuance costs. The Notes\nbear interest at a rate of 0.25% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2021. The Notes\nwere issued pursuant to an indenture, dated September 25, 2020 (the “Indenture”), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The\nNotes are general senior, unsecured obligations of the Company and will mature on September 15, 2025, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased, or converted.\nThe Notes are convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding May 15,\n2025, only under the following circumstances: (i) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ended on December 31, 2020 (and only during\nsuch fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of\n30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the\nconversion price for the Notes on each applicable trading day; (ii) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the\n“measurement period”) in which the trading price (as defined in the Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes for each trading day of the\nmeasurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate for the Notes on\neach such trading day; (iii) if the Company calls such Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately\npreceding the redemption date, but only with respect to the Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption; and (iv) upon the occurrence of specified corporate\nevents, as specified in the Indenture. On or after May 15, 2025 until the close of business on\n19\nTable of Contents\nthe second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders of the Notes may convert all or any portion of their Notes at any time,\nregardless of the foregoing conditions.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, none of the conditional conversion features of the Notes were triggered,\nand therefore, the Notes are not convertible during the fourth quarter of 2024, commencing on October 1, 2024, and were not convertible during the first\nquarter of 2024, commencing on January 1, 2024. As such, the Company classified the Notes as a long-term liability in its Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements as of December 31, 2023. As the Notes will mature on September 15, 2025, the Company classified the Notes as a current liability as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. Whether the Notes will be convertible following the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024 will depend on the satisfaction of the conversion\nconditions in the future.\nUnder the original terms of the Indenture, upon conversion, the Company could satisfy its conversion obligation by paying or delivering cash, shares\nof its common stock, or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the Indenture. On\nDecember 13, 2021, the Company irrevocably elected to fix its settlement method to a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock with\nthe specified cash amount per $1,000 principal amount of Notes of at least $1,000. As a result, for Notes converted on or after December 13, 2021, a converting\nnoteholder will receive (i) up to $1,000 in cash per $1,000 principal amount of Notes and (ii) cash and/or shares of the Company’s common stock, at the\nCompany’s option for any conversion consideration in excess of $1,000. In addition, the Company continues to have the ability to set the specified cash amount\nper $1,000 principal amount of Notes above $1,000. The initial conversion rate for the Notes is 10.2751 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000\nprincipal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $97.32 per share of the Company’s common stock, subject to\nadjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate events that could occur prior to\nthe maturity date of the Notes or if the Company delivers a notice of redemption in respect of the Notes, the Company will, under certain circumstances,\nincrease the conversion rate of the Notes for a holder who elects to convert its Notes (or any portion thereof) in connection with such a corporate event or\nconvert its Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption during the related redemption period (as defined in the Indenture), as the case may be.\nIf the Company undergoes a fundamental change, holders may require, subject to certain exceptions, the Company to repurchase for cash all or any\nportion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid\ninterest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. As of September 30, 2024, none of the criteria for a fundamental change or a conversion\nrate adjustment had been met.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at its option, if the last reported sale price of the\nCompany’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price for the Notes then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive)\nduring any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding\nthe date on which the Company provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus\naccrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. If the Company redeems less than all of the outstanding Notes, at least $150.0 million\naggregate principal amount of Notes must be outstanding and not subject to redemption as of the date of the relevant notice of redemption. No sinking fund is\nprovided for in the Notes.\nThe debt issuance costs associated with the Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes using an effective interest rate of\n0.80%. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining life of the Notes and the related issuance cost accretion is approximately 1.0 year.\nThe maximum number of shares issuable upon conversion, including the effect of a fundamental change and subject to other conversion rate\nadjustments, would be 5.9 million shares. As of September 30, 2024, the if-converted value of the Notes did not exceed the principal amount.\nThe Notes consisted of the following balances reported in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nPrincipal amount $ 575,000 $ 575,000\nUnamortized debt issuance costs (3,003) (5,338)\nConvertible senior notes, net $ 571,997 $ 569,662\n20\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the components of interest expense resulting from the Notes recognized in interest and other income (expense), net in\nthe Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nContractual coupon interest $ 359 $ 359 $ 1,078 $ 1,078\nAmortization of debt issuance costs $ 780 $ 773 $ 2,335 $ 2,316\nConvertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions\nIn connection with the issuance of the Notes in September 2020, the Company entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with an\naffiliate of one of the initial purchasers of the Notes and certain other financial institutions (the “option counterparties”) with respect to the Company’s common\nstock.\nThe convertible note hedge consists of an option for the Company to purchase up to approximately 5.9 million shares of the Company’s common\nstock, which is equal to the number of shares of the Company’s common stock underlying the Notes, at an initial strike price of approximately $97.32 per\nshare. The convertible note hedge will expire upon the maturity of the Notes, if not earlier exercised or terminated. The cost of the convertible note hedge was\napproximately $100.6 million and was accounted for as an equity instrument, which was recorded in additional paid-in capital in the Condensed Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. The Company recorded a deferred tax asset of $25.8 million at issuance related to the convertible note hedge transaction. The convertible note\nhedge is expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any cash payments the\nCompany is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes.\nSeparately from the convertible note hedge, in September 2020, the Company entered into warrant transactions to sell to the option counterparties\nwarrants to acquire, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, up to approximately 5.9 million shares of its common stock in the aggregate at an initial\nstrike price of $141.56 per share. The warrants require net share or net cash settlement upon the Company’s election. The Company received aggregate\nproceeds of approximately $51.3 million for the issuance of the warrants, which was recorded in additional paid-in capital at issuance in the Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. The warrants could separately have a dilutive effect to the Company’s common stock to the extent that the market price per share\nof its common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants.\nNote 11. Lessor Leases\nSales-Type Leases\nThe Company enters into non-cancelable sales-type lease arrangements with the leases varying in length from one to ten years. The Company\noptimizes cash flows by selling a majority of its sales-type leases, other than those relating to U.S. government hospitals and Advanced Services products,\nincluding Central Pharmacy Dispensing Service and IV Compounding Service, to third-party leasing finance companies on a non-recourse basis. The Company\nhas no obligation to the leasing company once the lease has been sold.\nThe following table presents the Company’s income recognized from sales-type leases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nSales-type lease revenues $ 6,952 $ 14,388 $ 25,564 $ 27,960\nCost of sales-type lease revenues (3,912) (7,141) (15,209) (14,183)\nSelling profit on sales-type lease revenues $ 3,040 $ 7,247 $ 10,355 $ 13,777\n21\nTable of Contents\nThe receivables as a result of these types of transactions are collateralized by the underlying equipment leased and consist of the following\ncomponents at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nNet minimum lease payments to be received $ 74,595 $ 65,017\nLess: Unearned interest income portion (12,321) (10,196)\nNet investment in sales-type leases 62,274 54,821\nLess: Current portion (1) (11,699) (11,867)\nLong-term investment in sales-type leases, net $ 50,575 $ 42,954\n_________________________________________________\n(1) The current portion of the net investment in sales-type leases is included in other current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe carrying amount of the Company’s sales-type lease receivables is a reasonable estimate of fair value.\nThe maturity schedule of future minimum lease payments under sales-type leases retained in-house and the reconciliation to the net investment in\nsales-type leases reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was as follows:\nSeptember 30,\n2024\n(In thousands)\nRemaining three months of 2024 $ 3,795\n2025 14,238\n2026 12,627\n2027 11,080\n2028 10,094\nThereafter 22,761\nTotal future minimum sales-type lease payments 74,595\nPresent value adjustment (12,321)\nTotal net investment in sales-type leases $ 62,274\nOperating Leases\nThe following table represents the Company’s income recognized from operating leases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nRental income $ 1,230 $ 1,330 $ 2,797 $ 5,459\nNote 12.

Short-term lease costs and variable lease costs were not material for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company recorded impairment and abandonment charges to operating lease right-of-use assets\nof $7.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, in connection with restructuring activities to reduce its real estate footprint and for\noptimization of certain leased facilities. The impairment and abandonment charges were recorded to selling, general, and administrative expenses on the\nCompany’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer to Note 16, Restructuring Expenses, for additional information regarding the Company’s\nrestructuring activities.\nThe following table summarizes supplemental cash flow information related to the Company’s operating leases for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 9,891 $ 10,100\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new lease liabilities $ 5,831 $ 1,758\nThe following table summarizes the weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate related to the Company’s operating\nleases as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term, years 4.0 4.6\nWeighted-average discount rate, % 5.8 % 5.8 %\nNote 13. Commitments and Contingencies\nPurchase Obligations\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company issues purchase orders based on its current manufacturing needs. As of September 30, 2024, the\nCompany had non-cancelable purchase commitments of $111.2 million, of which $71.4 million are expected to be paid within the year ending December 31,\n2024.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is currently involved in various legal proceedings.\n23\nTable of Contents\nAs required under ASC 450, Contingencies, the Company accrues for contingencies when it believes that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably\nestimate the amount of any such loss. The Company has not recorded any material accrual for contingent liabilities associated with any current legal\nproceedings based on its belief that any potential material loss, while reasonably possible, is not probable. Furthermore, any possible range of loss in such\nmatters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The Company believes that it has valid defenses with respect to legal proceedings pending against it.\nHowever, litigation is inherently unpredictable, and it is possible that cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by\nthe unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or because of the diversion of management’s attention and the creation of significant expenses, regardless of\noutcome.\nThe Company is not a party to any legal proceedings that management believes may have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or\nresults of operations.\nNote 14. Income Taxes\nThe Company generally provides for income taxes in interim periods based on the estimated annual effective tax rate for the year, adjusting for\ndiscrete items in the quarter in which they arise. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a provision\nfor income taxes of $5.3 million and $4.4 million, respectively, by applying its estimated annual effective tax rate to its year-to-date measure of ordinary\nincome and adjusted for $4.9 million and $5.6 million, respectively, of discrete income tax expense primarily from equity compensation.\nThe effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, differed from the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the benefit of\nthe research and development credits and a foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”) benefit deduction, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the non-\ndeductible compensation and equity charges.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (“OECD”) introduced Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) Pillar Two rules\nthat impose a global minimum tax rate of 15% on multi-national corporations. The rules are effective for the Company’s financial year beginning January 1,\n2024. These rules did not have an impact on the Company’s provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $11.5 million and $10.7 million, respectively.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in interest and other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within other long-term liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount of accrued interest and penalties was $0.8 million and $0.4 million, respectively.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company\nis subject to examinations by taxing authorities, including major jurisdictions such as the United States, Germany, Italy, France, and the United Kingdom. With\nfew exceptions, as of September 30, 2024, the Company was no longer subject to U.S., state, and foreign tax examinations for years before 2020, 2019, and\n2019, respectively.\nAlthough the Company believes it has adequately provided for unrecognized tax benefits, the provisions on these positions may change as revised\nestimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. It is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate changes in the unrecognized\ntax benefits within the next twelve months.\nNote 15. Employee Benefits and Share-Based Compensation\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nThe following table sets forth the total share-based compensation expense recognized in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nOperations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nCost of product and service revenues $ 1,709 $ 2,213 $ 4,884 $ 6,489\nResearch and development 1,062 1,917 3,276 5,220\nSelling, general, and administrative 8,834 10,852 22,117 31,404\nTotal share-based compensation expense $ 11,605 $ 14,982 $ 30,277 $ 43,113\n24\nTable of Contents\nThe Company capitalized approximately $1.0 million and $1.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and\n$2.7 million and $3.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of non-cash share-based compensation expense to\ninternal-use and external-use software development costs related to internal labor.

The 2016 Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number of\nshares, and the Company may terminate or suspend the 2016 Repurchase Program at any time.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not repurchase any of its outstanding common stock under\nthe 2016 Repurchase Program.\nNote 16. Restructuring Expenses\nOn November 23, 2022, the Company committed to a plan to reduce the Company’s headcount (the “2022 Plan”), as part of the Company’s expense\ncontainment efforts being implemented due to ongoing macroeconomic headwinds. During the first quarter of 2023, as a result of continued exploration of\nexpense containment measures, the Company committed to further reduce its headcount across many of its functions, and also committed to reduce its real\nestate footprint to align with its broader hybrid work strategy and in an effort to further reduce costs. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the\nCompany recorded an immaterial reversal of previously recognized restructuring expenses associated with the 2022 Plan.

The term “Omnicell, Inc.” refers only to Omnicell, Inc., excluding its subsidiaries.\nWe own various registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks used in our business, some of which appear in this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q, including Omnicell®. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may also include the trademarks and service marks of other companies. Such\ntrademarks and service marks are the marks of their respective owners.\nOVERVIEW\nOur Business\nOmnicell, a leader in transforming the pharmacy care delivery model, is committed to solving the critical challenges inherent in medication\nmanagement and elevating the role of clinicians within healthcare as an essential component of care delivery. Omnicell is focused on helping its customers to\ndefine and deliver a cost effective medication management strategy that is designed to equip and empower pharmacists and nurses to focus on patient care\nrather than administrative tasks, and to drive improved clinical, operational, and financial outcomes across all care settings. We are doing this with an industry-\nleading medication management infrastructure which includes robotics, smart devices, intelligent software, and expert services. This comprehensive set of\nsolutions provides the critical foundation for customers to realize the industry vision of the Autonomous Pharmacy, a vision defined by pharmacy leaders for\nimproving operational efficiencies and ultimately targeting zero-error medication management.\nOmnicell solutions are helping healthcare facilities worldwide to reduce costs, improve labor efficiency, establish new revenue streams, enhance\nsupply chain control, support compliance, and move closer to the industry vision of the Autonomous Pharmacy. We sell our product and consumable solutions\ntogether with related service offerings. Revenues generated in the United States represented 91% of our total revenues for both the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, and 91% and 88% of our total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOver the past several years, our business has expanded from a single-point solution to a platform of products and services that will help to further\nadvance the industry vision of the Autonomous Pharmacy. This expansion has resulted in larger deal sizes across multiple products, services, and\nimplementations for customers and, we believe, more comprehensive,\n29\nTable of Contents\nvaluable, and enduring relationships. As our business evolves, we continue to evaluate the metrics and methods we use to measure the success of our business.\nWe utilize bookings as an indicator of the success of our business. We define bookings generally as: (i) the value of non-cancelable contracts for our\nconnected devices, software products, and Advanced Services (although, for those Advanced Services contracts without a minimum commitment, bookings\nonly include the amount of revenue that has been recognized once the services have been provided); and (ii) for our consumables, the value of orders placed\nthrough our Omnicell Storefront online platform or through written or telephonic orders. We typically exclude technical services and other less significant\nitems ancillary to our products and services, such as freight revenue, from bookings. In addition, dependent upon counterparty or credit risk, which is evaluated\nat the time of contract signing, for a given multi-year subscription contract we may reduce the portion of the contractual commitment booked at a given time.\nAs noted, the portfolio of products, solutions and services we offer has evolved. As a result, the ordering process for certain of our solutions has also evolved.\nFor example, orders for certain solutions may not include a purchase order. Connected devices and software license bookings are recorded as revenue upon\ncustomer acceptance of the installation or receipt of goods. Revenues from Advanced Services bookings are recorded over the contractual term.\nWe generally provide installation planning and consulting as part of most connected device product sales, which are typically included in the initial\nprice of the solution. To help ensure the maximum availability of our systems, our customers typically purchase technical services contracts (maintenance and\nsupport) in increments of one to five years. In addition to connected device product sales, we provide a range of services to our customers. We also provide\nAdvanced Services such as Central Pharmacy Dispensing Service (service portion), IV Compounding Service (service portion), EnlivenHealth, Specialty\nPharmacy Services, 340B solutions, Inventory Optimization Service, and other software solutions, which typically are provided over two to seven years.\nThe following table summarizes each revenue category:\nRevenue Category Revenue Type Income Statement Classification Included in Bookings\nConnected devices, software licenses, and other Nonrecurring Product Yes (1)\nConsumables Recurring Product Yes\nTechnical services Recurring Service No\nAdvanced Services (2) (3) Recurring Service Yes\n_________________________________________________\n(1) Certain other insignificant revenue streams ancillary to our products and services, such as freight revenue, are not included in bookings.\n(2) Includes Central Pharmacy Dispensing Service (service portion), IV Compounding Service (service portion), EnlivenHealth, Specialty Pharmacy Services, 340B solutions,\nInventory Optimization Service, and other software solutions.\n(3) For those Advanced Services contracts without a minimum commitment, bookings only include the amount of revenue that has been recognized once the services have been\nprovided.\nOur full-time employee headcount was approximately 3,660 and 3,650 on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nOperating Segments\nWe manage our operations as a single segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions. Our Chief Operating\nDecision Maker (“CODM”) is our Chief Executive Officer. The CODM allocates resources and evaluates the performance of Omnicell at the consolidated\nlevel using information about our revenues, gross profit, income from operations, and other key financial data. All significant operating decisions are based\nupon an analysis of Omnicell as one operating segment, which is the same as our reporting segment.\nBusiness Strategy\nThe U.S. spent a total of $634 billion on prescription drugs in 2022, an increase of 9% compared to 2021, and prescription drugs impact the vast\nmajority of patients in virtually all settings of care. We believe there are significant challenges facing the practice of pharmacy today including, but not limited\nto, budget constraints, increased healthcare worker turnover rates, labor shortages, drug shortages, drug diversion, manual and error-prone processes, complex\ncompliance requirements, and limited inventory visibility. Each of these challenges may lead to poor medication management outcomes including, but not\nlimited to, medication errors, adverse drug events, lack of patient adherence, and medication waste. We also recognize that these challenges may impact the\ntiming of contracting for, or implementing, our products, solutions, or services. However, we believe that over time these significant challenges to the practice\nof pharmacy will drive demand for increased\n30\nTable of Contents\nautomation, visibility, insights, and improved medication management outcomes that our solutions are designed to enable. Because of this, we believe that our\nsolutions are well-positioned to address the evolving needs of healthcare institutions and therefore present opportunities for long-term growth.\nIn an effort to address these challenges and deliver solutions to help drive positive medication management outcomes, we continue to make significant\ninvestments in our research and development efforts to further advance the industry vision of the Autonomous Pharmacy. Furthermore, we believe a\ncombination of robotics, smart devices, intelligent software, and expert services is needed in every care setting where medications are managed. We are focused\non delivering solutions to help our customers realize the industry vision of the Autonomous Pharmacy and drive positive medication management outcomes\nwith outstanding customer experience through a mature channel in four market categories:\n• Point of Care. As a market leader, we expect to continue expansion into this product market as customers increase the use of our dispensing systems\nin more areas within their hospitals and increasingly in ambulatory care settings. While the macroeconomic environment is showing some signs of\nimprovement, we recognize that some health system customers may still be facing budgetary or labor constraints, which may impact our customers’\nconsiderations in the near term when they are determining whether to implement new solutions and workflows. As we are largely through the\nreplacement cycle of our previous generation of automated dispensing systems, we are seeing demand moderate. With the launch of next-generation\nenhancements and solutions for points of care, we believe we are providing a path for customers to maximize the value of their existing technology\ninvestments through upgrades and acquisitions of new program offerings for their current installed base. We also believe there is an opportunity for us\nto expand this offering and define a new standard for dispensing systems in ambulatory settings. We believe our current solutions within the Point of\nCare market and new innovation and services will continue to help customers drive improved clinical and financial outcomes.\n• Central Pharmacy and IV Compounding. This market represents the beginning of the medication management process in acute care settings, and\nwe believe it is a significant automation opportunity for high volumes of manual, repetitive, and error-prone processes that are often common in\npharmacies today. Manual medication dispensing processes are usually labor intensive, error-prone, and may lead to excess medication waste and\nexpirations for our healthcare partners. Automating the central pharmacy dispensing process should enable customers to reallocate pharmacy labor,\nenhance dispensing accuracy and patient safety, and reduce medication waste and expirations. Likewise, the manual compounding of sterile IV\npreparations can be error-prone and create significant patient safety risks, and outsourcing sterile IV compounding could lead to increased medication\ncosts and lack of access to needed medications as a result of being unable to source medications when they are required. As a result, we believe IV\nautomation provides a significant opportunity to enhance patient safety and reduce costs. We anticipate that these technology-enabled services will\nbecome more critical as health systems continue to face labor shortages, increased financial pressure, and supply chain disruptions. As health systems\nexpand and grow, we find that traditional methods of medication management may lead to multi-vendor environments that may complicate\nworkflows, often creating unnecessary redundancy and increasing chances for potential errors. We believe health systems need a single source for\ntechnology and resources that is designed to execute and optimize centralized medication management strategies to better meet current and future\nhealth system needs.\n• Specialty Pharmacy and 340B Program. We believe that health systems will continue to invest in programs that are intended to improve patient\noutcomes and drive cost savings by utilizing specialty pharmacies and the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program (the “340B Program”). The 340B\nProgram allows qualifying hospitals and health systems to stretch federal resources and expand patient access to healthcare by requiring\nmanufacturers participating in Medicaid to sell outpatient drugs at discounted prices to eligible healthcare organizations and covered entities. Specialty\ndrugs are used for treatment of complex conditions and often require intensive patient management and specialized workflows for dispensing and care\ncoordination. Specialty medications are projected to account for nearly 60% of U.S. total spending on medications, with total spending projected to be\napproximately $420 billion in 2025. Specialty pharmacies serve as the connection between patients, prescribing physicians, and payers and work to\nstreamline access and adherence to these specialty drugs. We believe a solution that is designed to help health systems start or optimize their specialty\npharmacy programs and the related pharmaceutical aspects of patient care will help ensure continuity of care and should contribute to the revenue and\nprofitability of those organizations. We believe that a fully optimized specialty pharmacy operation represents one of the largest economic\nopportunities for hospitals and health systems.\n31\nTable of Contents\n• Retail, Institutional, and Payer. We believe the Retail, Institutional, and Payer market represents a significant opportunity as healthcare evolves.\nRetail drug prescriptions represent 85% of all prescription drugs dispensed in the U.S., growing at a rate of 2.7% annually through 2024. Additionally,\nthe COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift of outpatient care from hospitals and physician offices to other, more convenient settings, such as retail\npharmacies and the home (including through telehealth technologies). New technologies and increased scope of practice for pharmacists appear to be\nspurring innovation and expansion of the provision of clinical services by retail pharmacies, which, combined with the move to value-based care, we\nbelieve will drive the adoption of our patient engagement solutions, that are intended to help providers (including pharmacists) and payers engage\npatients in new ways that are expected to improve outcomes, reduce the total cost of care, and lead to more profitable operations. Because of the\ncomplexity of relationships between payers and providers, as well as the large number of retail pharmacies, including a significant number of\nindependent pharmacies, we believe a network of established relationships between payers, providers and pharmacies will continue to be important.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which\nhave been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to\nmake certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of\nthe financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We regularly review our estimates and assumptions,\nwhich are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the\nbasis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ\nfrom these estimates and assumptions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements:\n• Revenue recognition;\n• Lessor leases;\n• Allowance for credit losses;\n• Inventory;\n• Internal-use and external-use software development costs;\n• Lessee leases;\n• Business combinations;\n• Valuation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets;\n• Share-based compensation; and\n• Accounting for income taxes.\nThere were no material changes in the matters for which we make critical accounting estimates in the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to those disclosed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nRecently Issued Authoritative Guidance\nRefer to “Recently Issued Authoritative Guidance” in Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements,\nincluding the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\n32\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTotal Revenues\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nChange in\n2024 2023 $ %\n(Dollars in thousands)\nProduct revenues $ 158,361 $ 188,755 $ (30,394) (16)%\nPercentage of total revenues 56% 63%\nService revenues 124,059 109,908 $ 14,151 13%\nPercentage of total revenues 44% 37%\nTotal revenues $ 282,420 $ 298,663 $ (16,243) (5)%\nProduct revenues represented 56% and 63% of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

We are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future periods will be impacted\nby changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur ability to continue to grow revenues is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain orders from customers, which may be dependent upon\ncustomers’ capital equipment budgets and/or capital equipment approval cycles, our ability to produce quality products and consumables to fulfill customer\ndemand, the volume of installations we are able to complete, our ability to meet customer needs by providing a quality installation experience, our ability to\ndevelop new or enhance existing\n33\nTable of Contents\nsolutions, and our flexibility in workforce allocations among customers to complete installations on a timely basis. The timing of our product revenues for\nequipment is primarily dependent on when our customers’ schedules and/or staffing levels allow for installations.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Profit\nCost of revenues is primarily comprised of three general categories: (i) standard product costs which account for the majority of the product cost of\nrevenues that are provided to customers, and are inclusive of purchased material, labor to build the product, and overhead costs associated with production; (ii)\ncosts of providing services and installation costs, including costs of personnel and other expenses; and (iii) other costs, including variances in standard costs\nand overhead, scrap costs, rework, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, and amortization of software development costs and intangibles.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nChange in\n2024 2023 $ %\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCost of revenues:\nCost of product revenues $ 94,448 $ 106,311 $ (11,863) (11)%\nAs a percentage of related revenues 60% 56%\nCost of service revenues 65,704 60,388 $ 5,316 9%\nAs a percentage of related revenues 53% 55%\nTotal cost of revenues $ 160,152 $ 166,699 $ (6,547) (4)%\nAs a percentage of total revenues 57% 56%\nGross profit $ 122,268 $ 131,964 $ (9,696) (7)%\nGross margin 43% 44%\nCost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 decreased by $6.5 million,\nprimarily driven by a $11.9 million decrease in cost of product revenues, partially offset by a $5.3 million increase in cost of service revenues.\nThe decrease in cost of product revenues was primarily driven by the decrease in product revenues of $30.4 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Our gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $329.2 million, as compared to $391.4 million\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nOperating Expenses and Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nChange in\n2024 2023 $ %\n(Dollars in thousands)\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development $ 21,214 $ 24,281 $ (3,067) (13)%\nAs a percentage of total revenues 8% 8%\nSelling, general, and administrative 94,490 103,971 $ (9,481) (9)%\nAs a percentage of total revenues 33% 35%\nTotal operating expenses $ 115,704 $ 128,252 $ (12,548) (10)%\nAs a percentage of total revenues 41% 43%\nInterest and other income (expense), net $ 5,063 $ 3,670 $ 1,393 38%\n35\nTable of Contents\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses decreased by $3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared\nto the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributed to a decrease in employee-related expenses as a result of lower\nheadcount.\nSelling, General, and Administrative. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by $9.5 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $6.6 million in employee-\nrelated expenses as a result of lower headcount and a decrease of $1.1 million in freight out for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023, as well as $1.3 million of executives transition costs incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net.

The increase in other income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is\nprimarily attributable to higher interest income received due to higher cash and cash equivalents balances.\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nChange in\n2024 2023 $ %\n(Dollars in thousands)\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development $ 64,372 $ 70,296 $ (5,924) (8)%\nAs a percentage of total revenues 8% 8%\nSelling, general, and administrative 276,929 332,643 $ (55,714) (17)%\nAs a percentage of total revenues 34% 37%\nTotal operating expenses $ 341,301 $ 402,939 $ (61,638) (15)%\nAs a percentage of total revenues 42% 45%\nInterest and other income (expense), net $ 14,052 $ 9,912 $ 4,140 42%\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses decreased by $5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared\nto the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributed to a decrease of $11.8 million in employee-related expenses as a result of\nlower headcount, partially offset by an increase of $2.1 million due to the timing of capitalized software projects, an increase of $1.6 million in cloud hosting\nservices expenses, and an increase of $1.3 million in consulting expenses.\nSelling, General, and Administrative. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by $55.7 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $28.9 million in employee-\nrelated expenses as a result of lower headcount, a decrease of $8.4 million in impairment and abandonment charges of operating lease right-of-use and other\nassets in connection with restructuring activities of certain leased facilities, a decrease of $4.7 million in restructuring costs, a decrease of $3.3 million in\ncommissions expenses, a decrease of $2.6 million in freight out, and a decrease of $2.2 million in executives transition costs.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net. Interest and other income (expense), net changed by $4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by a $5.1 million increase in other income and a $1.0 million increase in other\nexpense. The increase in other income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is\nprimarily attributable to higher interest income received due to higher interest rates and higher cash and cash equivalents balances.\n36\nTable of Contents\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nChange in\n2024 2023 $ %\n(Dollars in thousands)\nProvision for income taxes $ 2,997 $ 1,829 $ 1,168 64%\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nChange in\n2024 2023 $ %\n(Dollars in thousands)\nProvision for income taxes $ 5,304 $ 4,405 $ 899 20%\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $5.3 million and $4.4 million, respectively, by\napplying our estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date measure of ordinary income and adjusted for $4.9 million and $5.6 million, respectively, of\ndiscrete income tax expense primarily from equity compensation. The change in the provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to the provision for income taxes for the same period in 2023 was insignificant, consisting of various offsetting components of annual effective tax\nrate and discrete income tax expense.\nRefer to Note 14, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for\nadditional information.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $570.6 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $468.0 million at December 31, 2023. All of our cash and\ncash equivalents are invested in bank accounts and money market funds held in sweep and asset management accounts with financial institutions of high credit\nquality.\nOur cash position and working capital at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 570,628 $ 467,972\nWorking capital (1) $ 49,745 $ 559,779\n_________________________________________________\n(1) The decrease in working capital as of September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the classification of our convertible senior notes as a current rather than long-term liability.\nRefer to Note 10, Convertible Senior Notes, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional\ninformation.\nOur ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.1:1 and 2.5:1 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nSources of Cash\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn November 15, 2019, Omnicell, Inc. entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Prior A&R Credit Agreement”)\nwith the lenders from time to time party thereto, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Citizens Bank, N.A., and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as joint lead arrangers,\nand Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. The Prior A&R Credit Agreement provided for (a) a five-year revolving credit facility of\n$500.0 million (the “Prior Revolving Credit Facility”) and (b) an uncommitted incremental loan facility of up to $250.0 million (the “Prior Incremental\nFacility”). In addition, the Prior A&R Credit Agreement included a letter of credit sub-limit of up to $15.0 million and a swing line loan sub-limit of up to\n$25.0 million. The Prior A&R Credit Agreement was subsequently amended on September 22, 2020 and March 29, 2023 to permit the issuance of the\nconvertible senior notes and the purchase of the convertible note hedge transactions (as described in Note 10, Convertible Senior Notes, of the Notes to\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n37\nTable of Contents\nincluded in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), expand our flexibility to make restricted payments (including common stock repurchases), and replace the\ntotal net leverage covenant, as well as to remove and replace the interest rate benchmark based on the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) and related\nLIBOR-based mechanics with an interest rate benchmark based on the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank\nof New York and related SOFR-based mechanics.\nOn October 10, 2023, Omnicell, Inc. entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Second A&R Credit Agreement”) with the\nlenders from time to time party thereto, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., PNC Capital Markets LLC and TD Securities (USA) LLC\nas joint lead arrangers and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. The Second A&R Credit Agreement supersedes the Prior A&R\nCredit Agreement and provides for (a) a five-year revolving credit facility of $350.0 million (the “Current Revolving Credit Facility”) and (b) an uncommitted\nincremental loan facility of up to an amount equal to the sum of (i) the greater of $250.0 million and 100% of the adjusted consolidated EBITDA for the last\nfour quarters and (ii) additional amounts subject to pro forma compliance with certain consolidated secured net leverage ratio (the “Current Incremental\nFacility”). In addition, the Second A&R Credit Agreement includes a letter of credit sub-limit of up to $15.0 million and a swing line loan sub-limit of up to\n$25.0 million. The Second A&R Credit Agreement has an expiration date of October 10, 2028, subject to acceleration under certain conditions, upon which\ndate all remaining outstanding borrowings will be due and payable.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $350.0 million of funds available under the Current Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, there was\nno outstanding balance under the Current Revolving Credit Facility and we were in full compliance with all covenants. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Credit\nAgreement, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. We\nexpect to use future loans under the Current Revolving Credit Facility, if any, for working capital, potential acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes.\nUses of Cash\nOur future uses of cash are expected to be primarily for working capital, capital expenditures, and other contractual obligations. We also expect a\ncontinued use of cash for potential acquisitions and acquisition-related activities, as well as repurchases of our common stock. In addition, we may also use a\nportion of our cash as we consider various options related to our outstanding debt.\nThe 2016 Repurchase Program has a total of $2.7 million remaining for future repurchases as of September 30, 2024, which may result in additional\nuse of cash. There were no stock repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to “Stock Repurchase Programs” under Note 15,\nEmployee Benefits and Share-Based Compensation, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q for additional information.\nBased on our current business plan and backlog, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, our anticipated cash flows from operations,\ncash generated from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), along with the availability of\nfunds under the Current Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions,\noutstanding debt, and other contractual obligations for at least the next twelve months. For periods beyond the next twelve months, we also anticipate that our\nnet operating cash flows plus existing balances of cash and cash equivalents will suffice to fund the growth of our business.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 131,407 $ 142,680\nInvesting activities (39,225) (42,644)\nFinancing activities (1,148) 10,290\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 879 (464)\nNet increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 91,913 $ 109,862\n38\nTable of Contents\nOperating Activities\nWe expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of our billings and\ncollections, our operating results, and the timing of other liability payments.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $131.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily consisting of operating inflows\nof $93.8 million and favorable working capital movements of $37.6 million. Operating inflows consisted of a net loss of $3.3 million, adjusted for non-cash\nitems of $97.1 million, which consisted primarily of depreciation and amortization expense of $62.3 million, share-based compensation expense of\n$30.3 million, inventory write-down charges of $5.4 million, amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets of $5.3 million, and a change in deferred\nincome taxes of $9.4 million. The favorable working capital was primarily due to an increase in deferred revenues of $27.7 million driven by an increase in\nbillings, a decrease in inventories of $10.0 million resulting from inventory management initiatives, a decrease of $8.4 million in other current assets due to a\ndecrease in income tax receivables, and an increase of $7.0 million in accrued liabilities due to an increase in rebate liabilities. These cash inflows were\npartially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in operating lease liabilities, an increase of $7.5 million in investment in sales-type leases resulting from growth in\nour Advanced Services offerings, and a decrease in accrued compensation of $6.7 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $142.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily consisting of operating inflows\nof $107.8 million and favorable working capital movements of $34.9 million. Operating inflows consisted of a net loss of $6.0 million, adjusted for non-cash\nitems of $113.8 million, which consisted primarily of depreciation and amortization expense of $65.6 million, share-based compensation expense of\n$43.1 million, impairment and abandonment of operating lease right-of-use assets related to facilities of $7.8 million, amortization of operating lease right-of-\nuse assets of $6.2 million, and a change in deferred income taxes of $14.2 million. The favorable working capital was primarily due to a decrease in inventories\nof $31.7 million primarily due to management of inventory levels to align with the current forecasted demand, a decrease in accounts receivable and unbilled\nreceivables of $27.1 million primarily due to the timing of billings, shipments, and collections, as well as the impacts of lower revenues, an increase in deferred\nrevenues of $23.6 million primarily due to an increase in billings for certain service and subscription offerings, and a decrease in prepaid commissions of $5.5\nmillion. These cash inflows were partially offset by a decrease in accrued compensation of $29.4 million primarily due to a decrease in the accrual for\nrestructuring initiatives, lower commissions, as well as timing of payroll and ESPP purchases, a decrease in accounts payable of $13.4 million primarily due to\nan overall decrease in spending, as well as the timing of payments, an increase in investment in sales-type leases of $8.8 million primarily due to the\nacceptance of certain Advanced Services products under sales-type lease arrangements, and a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $8.1 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $39.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted of capital expenditures of\n$27.4 million for property and equipment and $11.8 million for external-use software development costs.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $42.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted of capital expenditures of\n$32.4 million for property and equipment, and $10.2 million for external-use software development costs.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a net change in the customer\nfunds balances of $10.7 million, partially offset by $13.1 million in proceeds from employee stock option exercises and ESPP purchases.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $10.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to $23.0 million in proceeds\nfrom employee stock option exercises and ESPP purchases, partially offset by $6.1 million in employees’ taxes paid related to restricted stock unit vesting and\na net change in the customer funds balances of $6.6 million.\nContractual Obligations\nThere have been no significant changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the contractual obligations disclosed in “Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” set forth in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\n39\nTable of Contents\nContractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 were as follows:\nPayments Due By Period\nTotal Remainder of 2024 2025 - 2026 2027 - 2028 2029 and thereafter\n(In thousands)\nOperating leases (1) $ 47,310 $ 3,296 $ 23,993 $ 17,750 $ 2,271\nPurchase obligations (2) $ 111,167 71,423 39,666 78 —\nConvertible senior notes (3) $ 576,438 — 576,438 — —\nTotal (4) $ 734,915 $ 74,719 $ 640,097 $ 17,828 $ 2,271\n_________________________________________________\n(1) Commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leased office buildings, data centers, office equipment, and vehicles. Refer to Note 12, Lessee Leases, of the Notes\nto Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\n(2) We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of\nbusiness, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. These amounts are associated with agreements that are\nenforceable and legally binding. The amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because we believe that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely and we\nexpect to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials.\n(3) We issued convertible senior notes in September 2020 that are due in September 2025. The obligations presented above include both principal and interest for these notes.\nAlthough these notes mature in 2025, they may be converted into cash and shares of our common stock prior to maturity if certain conditions are met. Any conversion prior\nto maturity can result in repayment of the principal amounts sooner than the scheduled repayment as indicated in the table above. Refer to Note 10, Convertible Senior\nNotes, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\n(4) Refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for\nadditional information.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe operate in foreign countries which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar\nand various foreign currencies, the most significant of which are the British Pound and the Euro. In order to manage foreign currency risk, at times we enter\ninto foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with changes in spot exchange rates of mainly non-functional currency denominated assets\nor liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries. In general, the market risk related to these contracts is offset by corresponding gains and losses on the hedged\ntransactions. By working only with major banks and closely monitoring current market conditions, we seek to limit the risk that counterparties to these\ncontracts may be unable to perform. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading purposes. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any outstanding\nforeign exchange forward contracts.\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk through our borrowing activities. As of September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding balance under the current\nSecond A&R Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreement, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\nThe net carrying amount under our convertible senior notes was $572.0 million as of September 30, 2024. Although our convertible senior notes are\nbased on a fixed rate, changes in interest rates could impact the fair value of such notes. As of September 30, 2024, the fair market value of our convertible\nsenior notes was $548.8 million. Refer to Note 4, Cash and Cash Equivalents and Fair Value of Financial Instruments, and Note 10, Convertible Senior Notes,\nof the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\nWe have used, and in the future we may use, interest rate swap agreements to protect against adverse fluctuations in interest rates by reducing our\nexposure to variability in cash flows relating to interest payments on a portion of our outstanding debt. We do not hold or issue any derivative financial\ninstruments for speculative trading purposes. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any outstanding interest rate swap agreements.\n40\nTable of Contents\nThere were no significant changes in our market risk exposures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the market risk\nexposures disclosed in “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” set forth in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024.\nITEM 4.

All internal control\nsystems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are\nmet.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the\nExchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting during the three months\nended September 30, 2024.\n41\nTable of Contents\nPART II.
