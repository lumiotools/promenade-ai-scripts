Reporting entity:\nThe principal business of Ballard Power Systems Inc. (the “Corporation”) is the design, development,\nmanufacture, sale and service of proton exchange membrane (\"PEM\") fuel cell products for a variety of\napplications, focusing on power products for bus, truck, rail, marine, stationary and emerging market\n(material handling, off-road and other) applications, as well as the delivery of services, including technology\nsolutions, after sales services and training. A fuel cell is an environmentally clean electrochemical device\nthat combines hydrogen fuel with oxygen (from the air) to produce electricity.\nThe Corporation is a company domiciled in Canada and its registered office is located at 9000 Glenlyon\nParkway, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, V5J 5J8. The condensed consolidated interim financial\nstatements of the Corporation as at and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023 comprise the Corporation and its subsidiaries.\n2. Basis of preparation:\n(a) Statement of compliance:\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Corporation have been prepared in\naccordance with International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the\nInternational Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), on a basis consistent with those material accounting\npolicies followed in the most recent annual consolidated financial statements except as noted below, and\ntherefore should be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2023 audited consolidated financial\nstatements and the notes thereto.\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements were authorized for issue by the Audit Committee\nof the Board of Directors on November 4, 2024.\n(b) Basis of measurement:\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis\nexcept for the following material items in the statement of financial position:\n• Financial assets classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL); and\n• Employee future benefits liability is recognized as the net of the present value of the defined benefit\nobligation, less the fair value of plan assets.\n(c) Functional and presentation currency:\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, which is the\nCorporation’s functional currency.\n(d) Use of estimates:\nThe preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements in conformity with IFRS\naccounting standards requires the Corporation’s management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and\nexpenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n6\nBALLARD POWER SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nUnaudited\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except number of shares)\n2. Basis of preparation (cont'd):\n(d) Use of estimates (cont'd):\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting\nestimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.\nSignificant areas having estimation uncertainty include revenue recognition, asset impairment including\ngoodwill and property, plant, and equipment, inventory and onerous contracts provisions, and fair value\nmeasurement (including long-term financial investments). These assumptions are unchanged in these\ncondensed consolidated interim financial statements and are the same as those applied in the\nCorporation’s consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nHowever, in the current environment, certain of these estimation uncertainty risks have increased in\nmagnitude, primarily fair value measurement of goodwill.\n(e) Future operations:\nThe Corporation is required to assess its ability to continue as a going concern or whether substantial doubt\nexists as to the Corporation’s ability to continue as a going concern into the foreseeable future. The\nCorporation has forecast its cash flows for the foreseeable future and despite the ongoing volatility and\nuncertainties inherent in the business, the Corporation believes it has adequate liquidity in cash and\nworking capital to achieve its liquidity objective. The Corporation’s ability to continue as a going concern and\nrealize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business is\ndependent upon the Corporation having adequate liquidity and achieving profitable operations that are\nsustainable.\nThe Corporation’s strategy to mitigate this uncertainty is to continue its drive to attain profitable operations\nthat are sustainable by executing a business plan that continues to focus on revenue growth, improving\noverall gross margins, maintaining discipline over cash operating expenses, managing working capital and\ncapital expenditure requirements, and securing additional financing to fund operations as needed until the\nCorporation does achieve profitable operations that are sustainable. Failure to implement this plan could\nhave a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s financial condition and or results of operations.\n3. Material accounting policies:\nEffective January 1, 2024, the Corporation adopted a number of new standards and interpretation, but they\ndid not have a material impact on the Corporation's condensed consolidated interim financial statements.\nThe accounting policies in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are the same as\nthose applied in the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\n4. Critical judgments in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty:\nCritical judgments in applying accounting policies:\nCritical judgments that management has made in the process of applying the Corporation’s accounting\npolicies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the condensed consolidated\ninterim financial statements are limited to management’s assessment of the Corporation’s ability to continue\nas a going concern (note 2(e)).\n7\nBALLARD POWER SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nUnaudited\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except number of shares)\n4. Critical judgments in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n(cont'd):\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty:\nKey assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty that have significant\nrisk of resulting in a material adjustment to the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses\nwithin the next fiscal year include the following: revenue recognition, asset impairment including goodwill\nand property, plant, and equipment, inventory and onerous contracts provisions, and fair value\nmeasurement (including long-term financial investments). These assumptions are unchanged in these\ncondensed consolidated interim financial statements and are the same as those applied in the\nCorporation’s consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nHowever, in the current environment, certain of these estimation uncertainty risks have increased in\nmagnitude, primarily fair value measurement of goodwill.\n5.

If any such indicator exists,\nthen the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite\nuseful lives, the recoverable amount is estimated annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate\nthat the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nAs a result of the decline in the Corporation's market capitalization, the global corporate restructuring (notes\n14 and 19) initiated in September 2024, and indicators of slowing hydrogen and fuel cell policy\nimplementation and market adoption, the Corporation has updated its goodwill and non-financial asset\nimpairment test as of September 30, 2024 due to these potential indicators of impairment. The recoverable\namount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to\nsell. However, individual assets within the cash-generating unit are not impaired below their residual value.\nThe Corporation recognized impairment charges on property, plant and equipment of $106,762,000 in the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting of an impairment allowance against\nconsolidated property, plant and equipment of $105,000,000 to impair these operating assets to estimated\nresidual value and a write-down of certain specific assets of $1,762,000 located primarily in Denmark and\nChina that are to be discontinued.\n24.

The delivery of services, including\ntechnology solutions, after sales service and training, are included in each of the respective markets.\n27. Financial Instruments:\n(a) Fair value:\nThe Corporation’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade\nand other receivables, long-term financial investments, and trade and other payables. The fair values of\ncash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables approximate their\ncarrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.\nLong-term financial investments (note 10) comprise investment in hydrogen infrastructure and growth equity\nfunds: HyCap Fund, Clean H2 Fund and Templewater, and an investment in Forsee Power, Wisdom Motor\nand Quantron AG. Changes in fair value and foreign exchange adjustments are recognized as gains or\nlosses in net loss and included in finance income and other (note 20). During the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, the Corporation recognized net mark to market and foreign exchange losses of\n($2,748,000) and ($7,371,000) (2023 - ($2,464,000) and ($2,568,000)).\nNine months ended Year ended\nIncrease (decrease) in fair value due to MTM and foreign exchange September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLong-term investment - Forsee Power $ (9,903) $ (3,501)\nLong-term investment - Wisdom Motor — (4,900)\nLong-term investment - Quantron AG (4,401) (4,237)\nLong-term investment - HyCap Fund 6,848 214\nLong-term investment - Clean H2 Fund 85 (473)\nLong-term investment - Templewater Fund — —\nDecrease in fair value of investments $ (7,371) $ (12,897)\n24\nBALLARD POWER SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nUnaudited\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except number of shares)\n27. Financial Instruments (cont'd):\n(b) Credit risk:\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments requires impairment losses to be recognized based on “expected losses” that\nwill occur in the future, incorporating forward looking information relating to defaults and applies a single\nECL impairment model that applies to all financial assets within scope. ECLs are a probability-weighted\nestimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the\ndifference between the cash flows due to the Corporation in accordance with the contract and the cash\nflows that the Corporation expects to receive). Under IFRS 9, at each reporting date the Corporation is\nrequired to assess whether financial assets carried at amortized cost are credit-impaired.\nAs a result of this review for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation did not\nrecognize any additional estimated ECL impairment losses, excluding specific impairment losses (note 19).\nAt September 30, 2024, the total amount accrued was $500,000.\n25"

Reporting entity:\nThe principal business of Ballard Power Systems Inc. (the “Corporation”) is the design, development,\nmanufacture, sale and service of proton exchange membrane (\"PEM\") fuel cell products for a variety of\napplications, focusing on power products for bus, truck, rail, marine, stationary and emerging market\n(material handling, off-road and other) applications, as well as the delivery of services, including technology\nsolutions, after sales services and training. A fuel cell is an environmentally clean electrochemical device\nthat combines hydrogen fuel with oxygen (from the air) to produce electricity.\nThe Corporation is a company domiciled in Canada and its registered office is located at 9000 Glenlyon\nParkway, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, V5J 5J8. The condensed consolidated interim financial\nstatements of the Corporation as at and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023 comprise the Corporation and its subsidiaries.\n2. Basis of preparation:\n(a) Statement of compliance:\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Corporation have been prepared in\naccordance with International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the\nInternational Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), on a basis consistent with those material accounting\npolicies followed in the most recent annual consolidated financial statements except as noted below, and\ntherefore should be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2023 audited consolidated financial\nstatements and the notes thereto.\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements were authorized for issue by the Audit Committee\nof the Board of Directors on November 4, 2024.\n(b) Basis of measurement:\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis\nexcept for the following material items in the statement of financial position:\n• Financial assets classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL); and\n• Employee future benefits liability is recognized as the net of the present value of the defined benefit\nobligation, less the fair value of plan assets.\n(c) Functional and presentation currency:\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, which is the\nCorporation’s functional currency.\n(d) Use of estimates:\nThe preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements in conformity with IFRS\naccounting standards requires the Corporation’s management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and\nexpenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n6\nBALLARD POWER SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nUnaudited\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except number of shares)\n2. Basis of preparation (cont'd):\n(d) Use of estimates (cont'd):\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting\nestimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.\nSignificant areas having estimation uncertainty include revenue recognition, asset impairment including\ngoodwill and property, plant, and equipment, inventory and onerous contracts provisions, and fair value\nmeasurement (including long-term financial investments). These assumptions are unchanged in these\ncondensed consolidated interim financial statements and are the same as those applied in the\nCorporation’s consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nHowever, in the current environment, certain of these estimation uncertainty risks have increased in\nmagnitude, primarily fair value measurement of goodwill.\n(e) Future operations:\nThe Corporation is required to assess its ability to continue as a going concern or whether substantial doubt\nexists as to the Corporation’s ability to continue as a going concern into the foreseeable future. The\nCorporation has forecast its cash flows for the foreseeable future and despite the ongoing volatility and\nuncertainties inherent in the business, the Corporation believes it has adequate liquidity in cash and\nworking capital to achieve its liquidity objective. The Corporation’s ability to continue as a going concern and\nrealize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business is\ndependent upon the Corporation having adequate liquidity and achieving profitable operations that are\nsustainable.\nThe Corporation’s strategy to mitigate this uncertainty is to continue its drive to attain profitable operations\nthat are sustainable by executing a business plan that continues to focus on revenue growth, improving\noverall gross margins, maintaining discipline over cash operating expenses, managing working capital and\ncapital expenditure requirements, and securing additional financing to fund operations as needed until the\nCorporation does achieve profitable operations that are sustainable. Failure to implement this plan could\nhave a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s financial condition and or results of operations.\n3. Material accounting policies:\nEffective January 1, 2024, the Corporation adopted a number of new standards and interpretation, but they\ndid not have a material impact on the Corporation's condensed consolidated interim financial statements.\nThe accounting policies in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are the same as\nthose applied in the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\n4. Critical judgments in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty:\nCritical judgments in applying accounting policies:\nCritical judgments that management has made in the process of applying the Corporation’s accounting\npolicies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the condensed consolidated\ninterim financial statements are limited to management’s assessment of the Corporation’s ability to continue\nas a going concern (note 2(e)).\n7\nBALLARD POWER SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nUnaudited\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except number of shares)\n4. Critical judgments in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n(cont'd):\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty:\nKey assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty that have significant\nrisk of resulting in a material adjustment to the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses\nwithin the next fiscal year include the following: revenue recognition, asset impairment including goodwill\nand property, plant, and equipment, inventory and onerous contracts provisions, and fair value\nmeasurement (including long-term financial investments). These assumptions are unchanged in these\ncondensed consolidated interim financial statements and are the same as those applied in the\nCorporation’s consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nHowever, in the current environment, certain of these estimation uncertainty risks have increased in\nmagnitude, primarily fair value measurement of goodwill.\n5.

INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Preparation of the MD&A\nThis discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of Ballard Power\nSystems Inc. (“Ballard”, “the Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is prepared as of November 4,\n2024 and should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated interim\nfinancial statements and accompanying notes for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023. The results reported herein are presented in U.S. dollars\nunless otherwise stated and have been prepared in accordance with International Financial\nReporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\nAdditional information relating to the Company, including our Annual Information Form, is\nfiled with Canadian (www.sedarplus.ca) and U.S. (www.sec.gov) securities regulatory\nauthorities and is also available on our website at www.ballard.com.\n1.2 Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Controls over Financial\nReporting\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that\nrelevant information is gathered and reported to senior management, including the Chief\nExecutive Officer (“CEO”) and the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), on a timely basis so that\nappropriate decisions can be made regarding public disclosures. We have also designed\ninternal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external\npurposes in accordance with IFRS. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there\nwere no changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or\nare reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting. Our design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial\nreporting includes controls, policies and procedures covering our subsidiaries including Ballard\nPower Systems Europe A/S, Ballard Fuel Cell Systems Inc., and Guangzhou Ballard Power\nSystems Co., Ltd.\n1.3 Risks and Uncertainties\nAn investment in our common shares involves risk. Investors should carefully consider the\nrisks and uncertainties described in our Annual Information Form. The risks and uncertainties\ndescribed in our Annual Information Form are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks\nand uncertainties, including those that we do not know about now or that we currently deem\nimmaterial, may also adversely affect our business. For a more complete discussion of the\nrisks and uncertainties which apply to our business and our operating results, please see our\nAnnual Information Form and other filings with Canadian (www.sedarplus.ca) and U.S.\n(www.sec.gov) securities regulatory authorities.\n2. CORE BUSINESS AND STRATEGY\n2.1 Core Business\nAt Ballard, our vision is to deliver fuel cell power for a sustainable planet. We are recognized\nas a world leader in proton exchange membrane (“PEM”) fuel cell power system development\nand commercialization.\nPage 4 of 43\nOur principal business is the design, development, manufacture, sale and service of PEM fuel\ncell products for a variety of applications, focusing on power products for bus, truck, rail,\nmarine, stationary and emerging market (material handling, off-road and other) applications,\nas well as the delivery of services, including technology solutions, after sales services and\ntraining.\nA fuel cell is an environmentally clean electrochemical device that combines hydrogen fuel\nwith oxygen (from the air) to produce electricity. The hydrogen fuel can be obtained from\nnatural gas, kerosene, methanol, ammonia, or other hydrocarbon fuels, or from water through\nelectrolysis. Ballard’s PEM fuel cell products are typically designed to feature high fuel\nefficiency, relatively low operating temperature, high durability, low noise and vibration,\ncompact size, quick response to changes in electrical demand, and modular design. Embedded\nin each Ballard fuel cell product lies a stack of unit cells designed with our proprietary PEM\nfuel cell technology. This technology includes membrane electrode assemblies, catalysts,\nplates, and other key components, and draw on intellectual property from our patent portfolio,\ntogether with our extensive experience and know-how, in key areas of PEM fuel cell stack\ndesign, operation, production processes and systems integration.\nWe are based in Canada, with head office, research, technology and product development,\nengineering services, testing, manufacturing and after-sale service facilities in Burnaby,\nBritish Columbia. We also have sales, assembly, research and development, certain\nengineering services and after-sale service facilities in Hobro, Denmark, a module assembly\nfacility in Bend, Oregon, and a sales, quality, supply chain, and after-sales service office in\nGuangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.\nWe also have a non-controlling, 49% interest in Weichai Ballard Hy-Energy Technologies Co.,\nLtd. (“Weichai Ballard JV”), located in Weifang, Shandong Province, China. Weichai Ballard\nJV’s business is to manufacture certain fuel cell products utilizing Ballard’s liquid cooled fuel\ncell stack (“LCS”) and LCS-based power modules for bus, commercial truck, and forklift\napplications with certain exclusive rights in China.\nFurthermore, we have certain non-controlling and non-equity accounted investments: (i) a\n3% equity interest in Quantron AG (“Quantron”), a global electric vehicle integrator and an\nemerging specialty OEM, to accelerate fuel cell truck adoption; (ii) a 6.7% equity interest in\nWisdom Group Holdings Ltd. (“Wisdom”), a Cayman Island holding company with operating\nsubsidiaries whose business includes the design and manufacture of vehicles, including zero\nemission fuel cell electric buses, trucks, and battery-electric vehicles; and (iii) a 7.3% equity\ninterest in Forsee Power SA (“Forsee Power”), a French company specializing in the design,\ndevelopment, manufacture, commercialization, and financing of smart battery systems for\nsustainable electric transport. We have invested in two hydrogen infrastructure and growth\nequity funds: (i) a 10.4% interest in the HyCap Fund I SCSP (“HyCap”), a special limited\npartnership registered in Luxembourg; and (ii) a 1.5% interest in Clean H2 Infra Fund (“Clean\nH2”), a special limited partnership registered in France. We have also invested in a\ndecarbonization and climate technology and growth equity fund holding a 2% interest in\nTemplewater Decarbonization I, L.P. (“Templewater”), a limited partnership registered in\nCayman Islands.\n2.2 Strategic Imperatives\nWe strive to build value for our shareholders by developing, manufacturing, selling, and\nPage 5 of 43\nservicing zero-emission, industry-leading PEM fuel cell technology products and services to\nmeet the needs of our customers in target markets. More specifically, our business plan is to\nleverage our core competencies of PEM fuel cell stack technology and engine development\nand manufacturing, our investments in advanced manufacturing and production capacity, and\nour product portfolio by marketing our products and services across select large and attractive\naddressable market applications and select geographic regions.\nWe typically select our target market applications based on use cases where the comparative\nuser value proposition for PEM fuel cells powered by hydrogen are strongest – such as where\noperators value low emission vehicles that require high utilization, long driving range, heavy\npayload, fast refueling, and similar user experiences to legacy diesel vehicles – and where the\nbarriers to entry for hydrogen refueling infrastructure are lowest – such as use cases where\nfuel cell vehicles typically return to a depot or hydrogen hub for centralized refueling and don’t\nrequire a distributed hydrogen refueling network. Our current target markets include certain\nmedium- and heavy-duty mobility applications for bus, truck, rail, and marine, along with\ncertain off-road mobility and stationary power applications.\nWe select our target geographic markets based on a variety of factors, including addressable\nmarket sizes of the target market applications in the geographic markets, historic\ndeployments and expected market adoption rates for hydrogen and fuel cells, supportive\ngovernment policies, existing and potential partner, customer, and end user relationships,\nand competitive dynamics. Our current target markets are the geographic regions of Europe,\nNorth America, and China.\nWhile we recognize addressing multiple market applications and geographic markets in\nparallel increases our near-term cost structure and investments, we believe offering the same\ncore PEM fuel cell technologies and substantially similar derivative PEM fuel cell products\nacross multiple mobility and power market applications and select geographic regions will\nsignificantly expand and strengthen our long-term business prospects by increasing volume\nscaling in our operations, enabling lower product and production costs for the benefit of all\nmarkets, improving our competitive positioning and market share, enabling diversified\nrevenue streams and profit pools, and improving our return on investment in our technology\nand product development programs and our investments in manufacturing.\nOur strategy is built on four key themes:\n• Double down in the fuel cell stack & module: invest in leading PEM fuel cell technology\nand products to provide leading value to our customers and end users on a total cost of\nownership basis;\n• Accelerate market development: deepen and create new partnerships to accelerate\nhydrogen and fuel cell market adoption and grow volumes for product sales;\n• Win in key regions: prioritize investments in North America and Europe, and monitor China\nbefore materially deepening our investment in China; and\n• Here for Life: deliver a compelling environmental, social and governance (“ESG”)\nproposition for our stakeholders.\nIn 2020 and 2021, we materially strengthened our financial position through equity\nfinancings. Following these financings, given strong indicators of long-term market adoption\nof hydrogen and zero-emission mobility, including certain policy announcements, given\nPage 6 of 43\ngrowing customer interest in our fuel cell products across multiple market applications, given\na growing opportunity set, and given an increasingly competitive PEM fuel cell environment,\nwe strategically decided to significantly increase and accelerate our investments ahead of the\nexpected market adoption curve. As a result, over the past three years, we increased and\naccelerated our investments in technology and product innovation, product cost reduction,\nproduction capacity expansion and localization plans, strategic pricing for select customer\nplatform wins and demonstration programs, and improving customer experience.\nIn 2023, given challenging and dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, given\nnotable delays in hydrogen and fuel cell policy implementation and market adoption, and\ngiven changes in investor sentiment towards pre-profitability clean energy companies with\nlong-duration investment horizons, we initiated certain actions to protect our balance sheet\nand long-term sustainability. For example, we implemented a modest headcount reduction,\nrationalized our product portfolio, reduced the number of active product development\nprograms, dropped new corporate development investments, and discontinued certain legacy\nproducts and non-core activities, including Ballard Motive Solutions in the U.K. We also\nsuspended a proposed $130 million investment for the localization of a new MEA production\nfacility in China in early 2024.\nIn 2024, we observed further indicators of slowing hydrogen and fuel cell policy\nimplementation and market adoption. In the context of an uncertain macroeconomic and\ngeopolitical outlook and amid protracted policy uncertainty, we noted a multi-year push-out\nof hydrogen project development and the availability of low-cost, low carbon hydrogen and\nhydrogen refueling infrastructure. We also noted a material weakening of the financial position\nof certain customers, increasing the risk on the ability of certain customers to continue with\ntheir product development programs and commercialization plans, and placing more risk on\nour sales order book and sales pipeline, as well as on certain of our development programs,\ntrade receivables and inventory investments. We also observed a continued deterioration in\nthe financing environment for certain customers and partners, including reduced access to\ncapital and a continued compression in industry valuations.\nAs this context represents a significant headwind to our corporate growth plan, we initiated a\nglobal corporate restructuring to moderate our investment intensity and pacing to better align\nwith delayed market adoption. We expect our restructuring to reduce total annualized\noperating costs by more than 30%, with a substantial part of the anticipated reduction in\nannualized operating costs expected to be realized in 2025. Our restructuring includes a\nsizeable workforce reduction, further rationalization and consolidation of global operations\nand facilities, and a reduction in planned capital expenditures. With continued policy and other\nchallenges in the China fuel cell market and underperformance of the Weichai Ballard JV, and\nas part of our global restructuring, we have reduced our corporate cost structure in China and\ninitiated a strategic review of the Weichai Ballard JV.\nGiven continued uncertainties in hydrogen and fuel cell policies, and the uncertainties relating\nto the adoption rate and timing for PEM fuel cells in heavy mobility applications, we do not\nsee a business case for production capacity expansion investments in the foreseeable future.\nAccordingly, we have also repositioned our previously planned Texas gigafactory expansion\nprogram to an optionality plan, where we expect to defer our final investment decision to\n2026 pending clear market adoption and demand indicators, while still preserving over $94\nPage 7 of 43\nmillion of awarded government funding. With no material capital investments made during\nthis optionality period, we will reassess the underlying business case in 2026.\nAs we look to our long-term strategic plan and cascading capital allocation, we continue to\nhave high conviction on hydrogen and PEM fuel cells playing an important role in\ndecarbonizing select heavy mobility and stationary power applications. We see compelling use\ncases where customers are attracted to the differentiated PEM fuel cell value proposition of\nlong range, fast refueling, heavy payload, and zero emissions. At Ballard, we remain focused\non our customers and our controllables, including the development of next-generation, low-\ncost fuel cell products, while maintaining disciplined spending and balance sheet strength for\nlong-term competitiveness and sustainability.\n3. 2024 BUSINESS OUTLOOK\n3.1 2024 Business Outlook\nConsistent with the Company’s past practice, and in view of the early stage of hydrogen fuel\ncell market development and adoption, we are not providing specific revenue or net income\n(loss) guidance for 2024. We continue to expect revenue in 2024 to be back-half weighted\nand particularly indexed to our fourth quarter. Our 2024 outlook continues to include:\n• Total Operating Expenses: 2024 outlook range of $145 million to $165 million – We\ncontinue to expect total Operating Expenses (excluding discontinued operations) for fiscal\n2024 to be between $145 million and $165 million. We expect to be at the lower end of\nthe guidance range excluding restructuring charges of $16.3 million incurred in the first\nthree quarters of 2024. Including restructuring charges, we expect to be at the high end\nof the guidance range (including $122.2 million expensed in the first three quarters of\n2024 (including the noted restructuring charges of $16.3 million to date); compared to\n$141.1 million in fiscal 2023) as we continue to invest in research and product\ndevelopment across our markets, including rationalization of our product portfolio,\naccelerating product cost reduction initiatives, and increased investment to accelerate\ndevelopment of our next-generation core products including MEAs, plates, stacks, and\nmodules.\n• Capital Expenditures: 2024 outlook range of $25 million to $40 million – We continue to\nexpect total Capital Expenditures (being additions to property, plant and equipment and\ninvestment in other intangible assets) for fiscal 2024 to be between $25 million and $40\nmillion but now at the lower end of the guidance range (including $21.7 million expended\nin the first three quarters of 2024).\nOur expectations for the remainder of 2024 are in part supported by our 12-month Order\nBook of approximately $58.2 million which is derived from our Order Backlog of approximately\n$122.7 million as of September 30, 2024. Our Order Backlog represents the estimated\naggregate value of orders at a given time for which customers have made contractual\ncommitments and our 12-month Order Book represents the aggregate expected value of that\nportion of the Order Backlog that the Company expects to deliver in the subsequent 12-month\nperiod.\nOur expectations are based on our internal forecast which reflects an assessment of overall\nbusiness conditions and takes into account actual sales, operating expenses, capital\nexpenditures, and financial results in the first ten months of 2024; sales orders received for\nPage 8 of 43\nunits and services expected to be delivered in the remainder of 2024; risk adjustments to our\nsales orderbook and sales pipeline related to certain customers experiencing weakened or\ndelayed end-market conditions and opportunities or weakened financial positions, purchase\nand cost commitments currently in existence for fiscal 2024; an estimate with respect to the\ngeneration of new sales and the timing of deliveries in each of our markets for the balance of\n2024; an estimate of purchase and cost commitments to be generated in each of our locations\nfor the balance of 2024; and assumes an average U.S. dollar exchange rate in the mid $0.70’s\nin relation to the Canadian dollar for 2024.\nThe primary risk factors to our business expectations for 2024 are customer, production, or\nprogram delays or cancellations in delivering against existing power products and technology\nsolutions orders and delays from forecast in terms of closing and delivering expected sales;\nadverse macro-economic and political conditions including trade and other geopolitical risks;\nchanges in government subsidy and incentive programs; inadequate investment in hydrogen\ninfrastructure and / or excessive hydrogen fuel costs, all of which could negatively impact our\ncustomers’ access to capital and the success of their program plans which could adversely\nimpact our business including potential changes, delays or accelerations in our expected\noperating and capital equipment requirements; disruptions due to delays of supply of key\nmaterials and components from third party suppliers; disruptions as a result of our reliance\non a limited number of technology service customers including Weichai Ballard JV, which are\nreliant on their internal commercialization plans and budget requirements; disruptions as a\nresult of delays in achieving technology solutions program milestones; disruptions as a result\nof our reliance on a limited number of customers and certain of those customer’s internal\ndevelopment and commercialization plans and financial liquidity; and fluctuations in the\nCanadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, as a significant portion of our operating expense\ncommitments and capital expenditure commitments are priced in Canadian dollars.\nIn addition to hydrogen and fuel cell commercialization and market adoption risks, certain\ncustomers, partners and suppliers are in their early stage of business development, and are\nsubject to significant corporate, product development, and financial risks, including risks on\ntheir development programs, commercialization plans, financing plans and liquidity. If\ncustomers, partners or suppliers experience any failures or delays in their plans or experience\nany liquidity or solvency challenges, our business may be materially adversely impacted.\nOur Order Backlog and our 12-month Order Book are currently comprised of a relatively\nlimited number of contracts and a relatively limited number of customers. Given the relative\nimmaturity of our industry and customer deployment programs, our Order Backlog and 12-\nmonth Order Book are potentially vulnerable to risk of cancellation, deferral or non-\nperformance by our customers for a variety of reasons, including: risks related to continued\ncustomer commitment to a fuel cell program; risks related to customer liquidity; credit risks;\nrisks related to changes, reductions or eliminations in government policies, subsidies and\nincentives; risks related to macro-economic and political conditions including trade, public\nhealth, and other geopolitical risks; risks related to slower market adoption; risks related to\nvehicle integration challenges; risks related to the development of effective hydrogen\nrefueling infrastructure; risks related to the ability of our products to meet evolving market\nrequirements; and supplier-related risks. Certain of our customer supply agreements are also\nsubject to certain conditions or risks, including achievement of certain product performance\nmilestones, completion of product development programs, or customer cancellation\nPage 9 of 43\nprovisions, and it is likely that some future supply agreements will also be subject to similar\nconditions and risks. There can be no assurance that we will achieve or satisfy such conditions\nor that customers will not cancel their orders. In addition, our supply agreements may include\nvarious pricing structures or reduced pricing tiers based on various factors, including volumes\nand the timing of deliveries. In setting these reduced pricing tiers, we may assume certain\nfuture product cost reductions which are subject to execution risk, including future commodity\ncosts, supply chain costs, and production costs, and we may not be successful in achieving\nthe planned cost reductions. In such circumstances, these agreements may become future\nonerous contracts if our gross margins become negative and the value of carried inventory to\nsupport product delivery under such contracts may also be adversely impacted.\nFurthermore, potential fluctuations in our financial results make financial forecasting difficult.\nIn addition, due to the early stage of development of the market for hydrogen fuel cell\nproducts, it is difficult to accurately predict future revenues, operating expenses, cash flows,\nor results of operations on a quarterly basis. The Company’s revenues, operating expenses,\ncash flows, and other operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. As a\nresult, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of revenues, operating expenses, cash flows, and\nother operating results may not be meaningful; instead, we believe our operating performance\nshould be assessed over a number of quarters and years. It is likely that in one or more future\nquarters, financial results will fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors\nand the trading price of the Company's shares may be materially and adversely affected.\n4. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS (Including Contractual Updates)\n4.1 Corporate\nBallard announces restructuring to lower total operating expenses by more than 30% to\nalign with delayed market adoption, while maintaining long-term competitiveness and\nbalance sheet strength\nOn September 12, 2024, we announced a global corporate restructuring to reduce corporate\nspending and to maintain balance sheet strength amid a slowdown in hydrogen infrastructure\ndevelopment and delayed fuel cell adoption. We expect our restructuring measures to impact\nour global operations, yielding anticipated annualized total operating expense savings in\nexcess of 30%, with a substantial part of the annualized savings being realized in 2025.\nThe scope of reduction measures include a reduction in workforce, a rationalization in product\ndevelopment programs, operational consolidation, and reduction in capital expenditures. Cost\nreduction measures are not expected to impact product delivery and program execution\nrequired to fulfill customer commitments.\nAs part of the restructuring, we made certain changes to our executive team. Kate Igbalode\nsucceeded Paul Dobson as our Chief Financial Officer effective September 12, 2024. Mark\nBiznek will be succeeded by Lee Sweetland as our new Chief Operating Officer at the end of\n2024.\nIn connection with the global restructuring, we recognized restructuring and related costs of\n$16.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily accrued in provisions and other current\nliabilities as of September 30, 2024, consisting of personnel severance costs, inventory\nimpairment charges related to product rationalization, contract exit and modification costs,\ngrant adjustment charges, and legal and advisory costs, net of expected\nPage 10 of 43\nrecoveries. Additional restructuring charges are expected in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nIn addition to the above noted restructuring charges, we recognized impairment charges on\nproperty, plant and equipment impairment charges of ($1.8) million in the third quarter of\n2024 consisting of the write-down of certain assets located primarily in Denmark and China\nthat are to be discontinued pursuant to the global corporate restructuring initiative.\n4.2 North America\nBallard announces purchase order to supply 200 fuel cell engines to New Flyer\nOn November 4, 2024, we announced a purchase order to supply 200 fuel cell engines to New\nFlyer, a subsidiary of NFI Group Inc., a leading independent bus and coach manufacturer and\na leader in electric mass mobility solutions in North America and Europe.\nThe order of 200 fuel cell engines, representing a total of approximately 20 MW of power, is\nthe second purchase order under the long-term supply agreement announced in January\n2024, and double the first purchase order of 100 engines under this agreement. Delivery of\nthe 200 engines is planned for 2025 and are expected to power New Flyer’s next generation\nXcelsior CHARGE FC™ hydrogen fuel cell buses for deployment across the U.S., including\nCalifornia, Washington, Arizona, Nevada, and New York.\n4.3 China\nWeichai Power Co., Ltd. and Weichai Ballard Hy-Energy Technologies Co., Ltd.\nOn November 13, 2018, we announced the closing of a strategic collaboration transaction\nwith Weichai. Ballard’s strategic collaboration with Weichai included:\n• Equity Investment – an equity investment in Ballard made by Weichai representing a\n19.9% interest in the Company at that time. Weichai currently holds an approximate\n15.4% interest in Ballard.\nBallard entered into an investor rights agreement with Weichai under which: (a) so long\nas Weichai directly or indirectly holds at least 10% of Ballard’s outstanding shares, it has\nan anti-dilution right entitling it to maintain its percentage ownership in Ballard by\nsubscribing for Common Shares from treasury at the same price as Ballard distributes\nCommon Shares to other investors (to date, Weichai’s anti-dilution rights with respect to\nall previous offerings of the Company have expired unexercised); (b) for so long as\nWeichai directly or indirectly holds at least 15% of Ballard’s outstanding Common Shares,\nit has the right to nominate two directors to Ballard’s board of directors; and (c) if there\nis a third-party offer to buy Ballard, Weichai has the right to make a superior proposal or\notherwise it must vote its Common Shares in accordance with the recommendation of\nBallard’s board of directors.\n• China Joint Venture and Technology Transfer Agreement – Weichai and Ballard established\na joint venture company in Shandong Province in 2018 to support China’s Fuel Cell Electric\nVehicle market, with Weichai holding a controlling ownership interest of 51% and Ballard\nholding a 49% ownership position. During fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022, Weichai made\nits committed capital contributions totaling RMB 561.0 million and Ballard made its\ncommitted capital contributions totaling RMB 539.0 million (equivalent to $79.4 million).\nWeichai holds three of five Weichai Ballard JV board seats and Ballard holds two, with\nBallard having certain shareholder protection provisions.\nPage 11 of 43\nWeichai Ballard JV develops and manufactures fuel cell modules and components including\nBallard’s LCS bi-polar plates, fuel cell stacks and FCgen®-LCS-based power modules for\nbus, commercial truck, and forklift applications with exclusive rights (subject to certain\nconditions) in China and is to pay Ballard a total of $90 million under a program to develop\nand transfer technology to Weichai Ballard JV in order to enable these manufacturing\nactivities. Revenue earned from the $90 million Weichai Ballard JV technology transfer\nagreement (nil million in the first three quarters of 2024; $1.1 million in the third quarter\nof 2023; $2.5 million in the first three quarters of 2023; $4.9 million in fiscal 2023; $6.0\nmillion in fiscal 2022; $18.2 million in fiscal 2021; $6.0 million in fiscal 2022; $18.2 million\nin fiscal 2021; $21.2 million in fiscal 2020; $22.5 million in fiscal 2019; $1.2 million in\nfiscal 2018) is recorded primarily as technology solutions revenues in our Heavy-Duty\nMobility Truck market. During 2018, we received an initial $9.0 million program\nprepayment from Weichai Ballard JV with additional amounts to be paid as program\nmilestones are successfully completed. We retain an exclusive right to the developed\ntechnologies outside China, subject to certain restrictions on sublicensing outside China.\nThe Weichai Ballard JV will also purchase MEAs for FCgen®-LCS fuel cell stacks exclusively\nfrom Ballard under a long-term supply agreement.\n• Fuel Cell Sales – In 2019, we announced the receipt of a purchase order from Weichai\nBallard JV for the delivery of MEAs valued at approximately $19 million under a long-term\nMEA supply agreement. Revenue earned from this agreement (nil million in the third\nquarter of 2024; $0.1 million in the first three quarters of 2024; $0.2 million in the third\nquarter of 2023; $0.6 million in the first three quarters of 2023; $2.1 million in fiscal\n2023) is recorded as product revenue in our Heavy-Duty Mobility Truck market. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, an additional $5.0 million of revenue associated with shipments on\nthis order to Weichai Ballard JV remain unrecognized until these products are ultimately\nsold by Weichai Ballard JV.\nThe Weichai Ballard JV operation, located in Weifang, Shandong Province, China, has\ncommenced production activities of LCS bi-polar plates, LCS fuel cell stacks and LCS-based\nmodules to power bus and truck FCEVs for the China market. The Weichai Ballard JV is\nexpected to have annual production capacity of 40,000 fuel cell stacks and 20,000 engines.\nAs a result of continued policy and other challenges in the China fuel cell market and\nunderperformance of the Weichai Ballard JV to date, we have initiated a strategic review of\nour China strategy with consideration of all strategic options, including related to the Weichai\nBallard JV and our relationship with it.\n5. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n5.1 Operating Segments\nWe report our results in the single operating segment of Fuel Cell Products and Services. For\n2023, we have made certain changes in the presentation of revenues by application\ncomprising our Fuel Cell Products and Services operating segment. Our Fuel Cell Products and\nServices segment consists of the sale of PEM fuel cell products and services for a variety of\napplications, including Heavy-Duty Mobility (consisting of bus, truck, rail, and marine\napplications), Stationary Power, and Emerging and Other Markets (consisting of material\nhandling, off-road, and other applications). Revenues from the delivery of Services, including\ntechnology solutions, after sales services and training, are included in each of the respective\nmarkets.\nPage 12 of 43\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed a restructuring of operations at Ballard\nMotive Solutions in the U.K. and effectively closed the operation. As such, the historic\noperating results (including revenue and operating expenses) of the Ballard Motive Solutions\nbusiness have been removed from continuing operating results and are instead presented\nseparately in the statement of loss and comprehensive income (loss) as loss from discontinued\noperations.\n5.2 Summary of Key Financial Metrics – Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nRevenue and Gross Margin\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Three months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nHeavy-Duty Mobility $ 12,821 $ 20,545 $ (7,724) (38%)\nBus 11,174 8,377 2,797 33%\nTruck 286 1,620 (1,334) (82%)\nRail 1,212 9,266 (8,054) (87%)\nMarine 149 1,282 (1,133) (88%)\nStationary 509 2,908 (2,399) (82%)\nEmerging and Other 1,426 3,607 (2,181) (60%)\nRevenues $ 14,756 $ 27,060 $ (12,304) (45%)\nEurope $ 9,344 $ 9,132 $ 212 2%\nNorth America 4,775 12,889 (8,114) (63%)\nChina 203 3,122 (2,919) (93%)\nRest of World 434 1,917 (1,483) (77%)\nRevenues 14,756 27,060 (12,304) (45%)\nCost of goods sold 22,972 29,922 (6,950) (23%)\nGross Margin $ (8,216) $ (2,862) $ (5,354) (187%)\nGross Margin % (56%) (11%) n/a (45 pts)\nFuel Cell Products and Services Revenues of $14.8 million for the third quarter of 2024\ndecreased (45%), or ($12.3) million, compared to the third quarter of 2023. The (45%)\ndecrease was driven by lower Heavy-Duty Mobility market, Stationary, and Emerging and\nOther revenues. Revenue increases in Europe were more than offset by lower revenues in\nNorth America, China and Rest of World.\nHeavy-Duty Mobility revenues of $12.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 decreased ($7.7)\nmillion, or (38%), due to lower sales of rail, truck and marine fuel cell products, partially\noffset by higher sales in the bus sub-market. Heavy-Duty Mobility revenues on a quarter-to-\nquarter basis are impacted by product mix due to varying customer requirements and various\nfuel cell products, including numerous power configurations required by our customers (and\nthe resulting impact on selling price) of our fuel cell modules, fuel cell stacks, MEAs, and\nrelated component and parts kits. Heavy-Duty Mobility revenues of $12.8 million in the third\nquarter of 2024 includes service revenues of nil million earned on the Weichai Ballard JV\ntechnology transfer program; $0.2 million from Weichai Ballard JV for the supply of a mix of\ncertain fuel cell products and components that will be used in the assembly of modules to\npower zero-emission FCEVs in China; and $12.6 million from a variety of customers in Europe,\nNorth America, China, and the rest of the world, primarily for shipments of FCwave™,\nFCmove™-HD+, FCmove™-HD, FCmove™-XD, and FCveloCity®-HD7 fuel cell modules and\nrelated components for their respective bus, truck, rail and marine programs.\nPage 13 of 43\nHeavy-Duty Mobility revenues of $20.5 million in the third quarter of 2023 includes service\nrevenues of $1.1 million earned on the Weichai Ballard JV technology transfer program; $0.4\nmillion from Weichai Ballard JV for the supply of a mix of certain fuel cell products and\ncomponents that will be used in the assembly of modules to power zero-emission FCEVs in\nChina; $0.9 million of product and service revenues from Synergy Ballard JVCo; and $18.1\nmillion from a variety of customers in North America, Europe, China and the rest of the world.\nStationary revenues of $0.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 decreased ($2.4) million, or\n(82%), due to lower sales of stationary power generation fuel cell modules, stacks, products\nand services primarily in Europe and North America. Stationary revenues also include\ntechnology solutions program revenues from a variety of customer programs for stationary\napplications.\nEmerging and Other market revenues of $1.4 million decreased ($2.2) million, or (60%), due\nprimarily to lower sales of fuel cell modules for mining and off-road applications and lower\nfuel cell stack shipments for material handling applications.\nFuel Cell Products and Services gross margins were ($8.2) million, or (56%) of revenues, for\nthe third quarter of 2024, compared to ($2.9) million, or (11%) of revenues, for the third\nquarter of 2023. The negative gross margin in the third quarter of 2024 was driven primarily\nby the impacts of revenue scaling and manufacturing cost absorption and by a shift to lower\noverall product margin and service revenue mix including the impacts of pricing strategy,\ndeclines of higher margin engineering services revenues, higher fixed overhead costs due\nprimarily to the expansion of manufacturing capacity, and increases in supply costs.\nGross margin in the third quarter of 2024 was also negatively impacted by inventory\nimpairment adjustments and net increases in onerous contract provisions of ($2.2) million;\nand nominally offset by positive net warranty adjustments. Gross margin in the third quarter\nof 2023 was negatively impacted by net increases in inventory impairment and onerous\ncontract provisions of ($1.4) million.\nOperating Expenses and Cash Operating Costs\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Three months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nResearch and Product\nDevelopment $ 23,742 $ 23,866 $ (124) (1%)\nGeneral and Administrative 4,281 6,970 (2,689) (39%)\nSales and Marketing 2,834 3,569 (735) (21%)\nOperating Expenses $ 30,857 $ 34,405 $ (3,548) (10%)\nResearch and Product\nDevelopment (cash operating cost) $ 20,833 $ 20,899 $ (66) (-%)\nGeneral and Administrative\n(cash operating cost) 4,464 4,832 (368) (8%)\nSales and Marketing (cash operating\ncost) 2,687 3,123 (436) (14%)\nCash Operating Costs $ 27,984 $ 28,854 $ (870) (3%)\nCash Operating Costs and its components of Research and Product Development (cash operating cost), General and Administrative (cash operating cost),\nand Sales and Marketing (cash operating cost) are non-GAAP measures. We use certain Non-GAAP measures to assist in assessing our financial performance.\nNon-GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented\nby other companies. See the reconciliation of Cash Operating Costs to GAAP in the Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations section and the\nreconciliation of Research and Product Development (cash operating cost), General and Administrative (cash operating cost), and Sales and Marketing (cash\noperating cost) to GAAP in the Operating Expense section. Cash Operating Costs adjusts operating expenses for stock-based compensation expense,\ndepreciation and amortization, impairment losses on trade receivables, restructuring charges, the impact of unrealized gains or losses on foreign exchange\ncontracts, acquisition related costs, and financing charges.\nPage 14 of 43\nTotal Operating Expenses (excluding Other operating expenses) for the third quarter of 2024\nwere $30.9 million, a decrease of ($3.5) million, or (10%), compared to the third quarter of\n2023. The (10%) decrease was driven by lower general and administrative expenses of ($2.7)\nmillion, lower sales and marketing expenses of ($0.7) million, and lower research and product\ndevelopment expenses of ($0.1) million.\nCash Operating Costs (see Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations) for the\nthird quarter of 2024 were $28.0 million, a decrease of ($0.9) million, compared to the third\nquarter of 2023. The (3%) decrease was driven by lower sales and marketing cash operating\ncosts of ($0.4) million, lower general and administrative cash operating costs of ($0.4) million,\nand lower research and product development cash operating costs of ($0.1) million.\nThe (3%) decrease in cash operating costs in the third quarter of 2024 was driven by lower\nsales and marketing and general and administrative costs due primarily to lower consulting\nand contractor services, recruiting, and public company costs, as research and product\ndevelopment cash operating costs were relatively flat in the period.\nThese cost impacts were also impacted by inflationary wage pressures across the business\nand continue to include significant expenditures on technology and product development\nactivities including the design and development of next generation fuel cell stacks and engines\nfor bus, truck, rail, marine and stationary applications, and continuation engineering\ninvestment in our existing fuel cell products, including activities related to product cost\nreduction. Program investment includes expenditures related to our FCmove™-HD+ and\nFCmove XD fuel cell modules (our recently released 9th generation fuel cell engine) designed\nfor buses and medium and heavy-duty trucks, our FCgen®-HPS High-Power Density Fuel Cell\nStack for light-medium-and heavy-duty vehicles, our FCwave™ Fuel Cell Module for high\npower applications, and on the ongoing improvement of all of our fuel cell products including\nour high performance fuel cell module, the FCmove™-HD, and our high performance liquid-\ncooled fuel cell stack, the FCgen®-LCS.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Three months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (60,111) $ (34,936) $ (25,175) (72%)\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. We use certain Non-GAAP measures to assist in assessing our financial performance. Non-GAAP\nmeasures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by\nother companies. See reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP in the Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations section. Adjusted EBITDA\nadjusts EBITDA for stock-based compensation expense, transactional gains and losses, acquisition related costs, finance and other income, recovery on\nsettlement of contingent consideration, asset impairment charges, and the impact of unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts.\nAdjusted EBITDA (see Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations) for the third\nquarter of 2024 was ($60.1) million, compared to ($34.9) million for the third quarter of 2023.\nThe increase in Adjusted EBITDA loss of ($25.2) million was driven primarily by higher\nrestructuring and related costs of ($15.9) million, the increase in gross margin loss of ($5.4)\nmillion, and higher impairment losses on trade receivables of ($7.8) million. These declines\nwere partially offset by lower Cash Operating Costs of $0.9 million and lower equity in loss of\ninvestment in joint venture and associates of $2.9 million attributed to the operations of\nWeichai Ballard JV.\nRestructuring and related charges in the third quarter of 2024 of $16.1 million (included in\nAdjusted EBITDA loss) relate to a global corporate restructuring initiated in the third quarter\nof 2024 consisting primarily of cost reduction measures including a reduction in workforce, a\nPage 15 of 43\nrationalization of products and product development activities, and a reduction or cancellation\nof certain capital projects. Restructuring and related charges, primarily accrued in provisions\nand other current liabilities as of September 30, 2024, include personnel severance costs,\ninventory impairment charges related to product rationalization, contract exit and\nmodification costs, grant adjustment charges, and legal and advisory costs, net of expected\nrecoveries.\nNet Loss from Continuing Operations\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Three months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nNet loss from Continuing Operations $ (204,531) $ (34,721) $ (169,810) (489%)\nNet loss from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2024 was ($204.5) million, or\n($0.68) per share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of ($34.7) million, or\n($0.12) per share, in the third quarter of 2023. The ($169.8) million increase in net loss in\nthe third quarter of 2024 was driven primarily by the increase in Adjusted EBITDA loss of\n($25.2) million, impairment charges on goodwill of ($40.3) million, impairment charges on\nproperty, plant and equipment of ($106.8) million, partially offset by lower stock-based\ncompensation expense of $1.9 million.\nGoodwill impairment charges of ($40.3) million in the third quarter of 2024 consist of a write-\ndown of the remaining corporate goodwill balance to nil as a result of the decline in the\nCompany’s market capitalization. Property, plant and equipment impairment charges of\n($106.8) million in the third quarter of 2024 consist of an impairment allowance against\nconsolidated assets of ($105.0) million to impair these operating assets to their estimated\nresidual value, and a write-down of certain specific assets of ($1.8) million located primarily\nin Denmark and China that are to be discontinued pursuant to the global corporate\nrestructuring initiative.\nIn addition, operating margins, and costs in the third quarter of 2024 were impacted by the\npositive impact of a weaker Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar, as compared to the\nthird quarter of 2023. As a significant amount of our net operating costs (primarily labour)\nare denominated in Canadian dollars, gross margin, operating expenses, Adjusted EBITDA,\nand net loss are impacted by changes in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. As the\nCanadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar was approximately (2%), or (150) basis points,\nlower in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, positive foreign\nexchange impacts on our Canadian operating margins and cost base were approximately $0.5\nmillion. A $0.01 decrease in the Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar, positively impacts\nannual operating margins and costs by approximately $1.3 million.\nPage 16 of 43\nNet Loss from Discontinued Operations\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Three months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nRevenues $ - $ 515 $ (515) (100%)\nCost of goods sold - 466 (466) (100%)\nGross margin - 49 (49) (100%)\nOperating expenses (484) (1,587) 1,103 70%\nFinance and other (income) loss (3) 62 (65) (105%)\nImpairment charges on\n- (2,266) 2,266 100%\nintangible assets\nImpairment charges on goodwill - (23,991) 23,991 100%\nNet loss from discontinued\n$ (487) $ (27,733) $ 27,246 98%\noperations\nNet loss from discontinued operations for the third quarter of 2024 was ($0.5) million, or\n($0.00) per share, compared to ($27.7) million, or ($0.09) per share, for the third quarter of\n2024. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed a restructuring of operations at Ballard\nMotive Solutions in the U.K. and effectively closed the operation. As such, the historic\noperating results of the Ballard Motive Solutions business have been removed from continuing\noperating results and are instead presented separately in the statement of comprehensive\nincome (loss) as loss from discontinued operations.\n5.3 Summary of Key Financial Metrics – Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nRevenue and Gross Margin\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nHeavy-Duty Mobility $ 36,572 $ 37,653 $ (1,081) (3%)\nBus 31,078 17,287 13,791 80%\nTruck 3,116 4,970 (1,854) (37%)\nRail 1,558 12,061 (10,503) (87%)\nMarine 820 3,335 (2,515) (75%)\nStationary 5,823 8,902 (3,079) (35%)\nEmerging and Other 2,816 9,062 (6,246) (69%)\nRevenues $ 45,211 $ 55,617 $ (10,406) (19%)\nEurope $ 30,484 $ 24,051 $ 6,433 27%\nNorth America 10,874 22,630 (11,756) (52%)\nChina 2,562 6,484 (3,922) (60%)\nRest of World 1,291 2,452 (1,161) (47%)\nRevenues 45,211 55,617 (10,406) (19%)\nCost of goods sold 63,966 67,281 (3,315) (5%)\nGross Margin $ (18,755) $ (11,664) $ (7,091) (61%)\nGross Margin % (41%) (21%) n/a (20 pts)\nFuel Cell Products and Services Revenues of $45.2 million for the first three quarters of 2024\ndecreased (19%), or ($10.4) million, compared to the first three quarters of 2023. The (19%)\ndecrease was driven by lower Emerging and Other, Stationary, and Heavy-Duty Mobility\nmarket revenues. Revenue increases in Europe were more than offset by lower revenues in\nNorth America, China and Rest of World.\nHeavy-Duty Mobility revenues of $36.6 million in the three quarters of 2024 decreased ($1.1)\nmillion, or (3%), due to lower sales of rail, marine and truck fuel cell products, partially offset\nPage 17 of 43\nby higher sales in the bus sub-market. Heavy-Duty Mobility revenues on a quarter-to-quarter\nbasis are impacted by product mix due to varying customer requirements and various fuel\ncell products, including numerous power configurations required by our customers (and the\nresulting impact on selling price) of our fuel cell modules, fuel cell stacks, MEAs, and related\ncomponent and parts kits. Heavy-Duty Mobility revenues of $36.6 million in the first three\nquarters of 2024 includes service revenues of nil million earned on the Weichai Ballard JV\ntechnology transfer program; $2.4 million from Weichai Ballard JV for the supply of a mix of\ncertain fuel cell products and components that will be used in the assembly of modules to\npower zero-emission FCEVs in China; and $34.2 million from a variety of customers in Europe,\nNorth America, China, and the rest of the world, primarily for shipments of FCwave™,\nFCmove™-HD+, FCmove™-HD, and FCmove™-XD fuel cell modules and related components\nfor their respective bus, truck, rail and marine programs.\nHeavy-Duty Mobility revenues of $37.7 million in the first three quarters of 2023 includes\nservice revenues of $2.5 million earned on the Weichai Ballard JV technology transfer\nprogram; $0.9 million from Weichai Ballard JV for the supply of a mix of certain fuel cell\nproducts and components that will be used in the assembly of modules to power zero-emission\nFCEVs in China; $1.7 million of product and service revenues from Synergy Ballard JVCo; and\n$32.6 million from a variety of customers in North America, Europe, China, and the rest of\nthe world.\nStationary revenues of $5.8 million in the first three quarters of 2024 decreased ($3.1)\nmillion, or (35%), due to lower sales of stationary power generation fuel cell modules, stacks,\nproducts and services primarily in Europe and North America.

See reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP in the Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations section. Adjusted EBITDA\nadjusts EBITDA for stock-based compensation expense, transactional gains and losses, acquisition related costs, finance and other income, recovery on\nsettlement of contingent consideration, asset impairment charges, and the impact of unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts.\nAdjusted EBITDA (see Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations) for the first\nthree quarters of 2024 was ($132.1) million, compared to ($106.0) million for the first three\nquarters of 2023. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA loss of ($26.1) million was driven primarily\nby higher restructuring and related costs of ($15.1) million, the increase in gross margin loss\nof ($7.1) million, and higher impairment losses on trade receivables of ($9.5) million. These\ndeclines were partially offset by lower Cash Operating Costs of $1.6 million and lower equity\nin loss of investment in joint venture and associates of $3.4 million attributed to the operations\nof Weichai Ballard JV.\nRestructuring and related charges in 2024 of $16.3 million (included in Adjusted EBITDA loss)\nrelate primarily to a global corporate restructuring initiated in the third quarter of 2024\nconsisting primarily of cost reduction measures including a reduction in workforce, a\nrationalization of products and product development activities, and a reduction or cancellation\nof certain capital projects. Restructuring and related charges, primarily accrued in provisions\nand other current liabilities as of September 30, 2024, include personnel severance costs,\ninventory impairment charges related to product rationalization, contract exit and\nmodification costs, grant adjustment charges, and legal and advisory costs, net of expected\nrecoveries.\nNet Loss from Continuing Operations\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nNet loss from Continuing Operations $ (277,059) $ (95,322) $ (181,737) (191%)\nNet loss from continuing operations for the first three quarters of 2024 was ($277.1) million,\nor ($0.93) per share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of ($95.3) million,\nor ($0.32) per share, in the first three quarters of 2023. The ($181.7) million increase in net\nloss in 2024 was driven primarily by the increase in Adjusted EBITDA loss of ($26.1) million,\nimpairment charges on goodwill of ($40.3) million, impairment charges on property, plant\nand equipment of ($106.8) million, lower finance and other income of ($8.2) million, higher\nfinance expense of ($0.8) million, higher depreciation and amortization expense of ($1.3)\nmillion, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense of $1.8 million.\nGoodwill impairment charges of ($40.3) million in 2024 consist of a write-down of the\nremaining corporate goodwill balance to nil as a result of the decline in the Company’s market\ncapitalization. Property, plant and equipment impairment charges of ($106.8) million in 2024\nconsist of an impairment allowance against consolidated assets of ($105.0) million to impair\nthese operating assets to their estimated residual value, and a write-down of certain specific\nassets of ($1.8) million located primarily in Denmark and China that are to be discontinued\npursuant to the global corporate restructuring initiative.\nPage 20 of 43\nThe ($8.2) million decrease in finance and other income in 2024, as compared to 2023, was\ndue to lower investment income of ($3.2) million, higher negative mark to market and foreign\nexchange impacts of ($4.8) million on our long-term investments including Forsee Power,\nWisdom, Quantron, HyCap, Clean H2 and Templewater, and by higher foreign exchange losses\non net monetary assets of ($0.3) million.\nIn addition, operating margins, and costs in the first three quarters of 2024 were impacted\nby the positive impact of a weaker Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar, as compared\nto the first three quarters of 2023. As a significant amount of our net operating costs (primarily\nlabour) are denominated in Canadian dollars, gross margin, operating expenses, Adjusted\nEBITDA, and net loss are impacted by changes in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S.\ndollar. As the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar was approximately (1%), or (100)\nbasis points, lower in the first three quarters of 2024 as compared to the first three quarters\nof 2023, positive foreign exchange impacts on our Canadian operating margins and cost base\nwere approximately $1.0 million.

Mark to market gain (loss)\nconsist primarily of changes in the fair value of our long-term financial investments including\nForsee Power, Wisdom, Quantron, Templewater, HyCap and Clean H2. Mark to market gains\nand losses are also impacted by the conversion of these long-term financial assets from their\nrespective European Euro or Great British pound denominated investment to the U.S. dollar.\nForeign exchange gains (losses) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nwere $0.9 million and ($0.8) million, respectively, compared to ($1.4) million and ($0.5)\nmillion, respectively, for the corresponding periods of 2023. Foreign exchange gains and\nlosses are attributable primarily to the effect of changes in the value of the Canadian dollar,\nrelative to the U.S. dollar, on our Canadian dollar-denominated net monetary position. Foreign\nexchange gains and losses are also impacted by the conversion of Ballard Power Systems\nEurope A/S’ assets and liabilities from the Danish Kroner to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates\nin effect at each reporting date which are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).\nGovernment levies for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were nominal, compared\nto ($0.1) million for the corresponding period of 2023.

Equity in loss of investment in joint venture and associates\nrelates to the pickup of 49% of the net income (loss) of Weichai Ballard JV in China due to\nour 49% ownership position which is accounted for using the equity method of accounting.\nThe loss of investment in joint venture and associates in the operations of Weichai Ballard JV\nincludes research and product development expenses in the periods consisting primarily of\namounts expended on the ongoing $90 million technology transfer agreement with Ballard as\nWeichai Ballard JV continues to establish operations. Weichai Ballard JV manufactures\nBallard’s next-generation LCS bi-polar plates, fuel cell stacks and LCS-based power modules\nfor bus, commercial truck, and forklift applications with certain exclusive rights in China.\nImpairment charges on goodwill for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2024 was ($40.3) million for each of the periods and consists of a write-down of the\nPage 27 of 43\nremaining corporate goodwill balance to nil as a result of the decline in the Company’s market\ncapitalization.\nImpairment charges on property, plant and equipment for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 was ($106.8) million for each of the periods and\nconsists of an impairment allowance against consolidated capital assets of ($105.0) million to\nimpair these operating assets to their estimated residual value, and a write-down of certain\nspecific assets of ($1.8) million located primarily in Denmark and China that are to be\ndiscontinued pursuant to the global corporate restructuring initiative.\n5.5 Summary of Quarterly Results\nThe following table provides summary financial data for our last eight quarters:\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts Quarter ended,\nand weighted average shares outstanding which are expressed in\nthousands)\nSep 30, Jun 30, Mar 31, Dec 31,\n2024 2024 2024 2023\nRevenues $ 14,756 $ 16,003 $ 14,452 $ 46,751\nNet loss from continuing operations $ (204,531) $ (31,463) $ (41,066) $ (48,889)\nNet loss from continuing operations per share, $ (0.68) $ (0.11) $ (0.14) $ (0.16)\nbasic and diluted\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 299,412 299,392 299,011 298,826\nSep 30, Jun 30, Mar 31, Dec 31,\n2023 2023 2023 2022\nRevenues $ 27,060 $ 15,314 $ 13,243 $ 20,183\nNet loss from continuing operations $ (34,721) $ (28,213) $ (32,388) $ (27,572)\nNet loss from continuing operations per share, $ (0.12) $ (0.09) $ (0.11) $ (0.09)\nbasic and diluted\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 298,705 298,679 298,429 298,324\nSummary of Quarterly Results: There were no significant seasonal variations in our\nquarterly results. Variations in our net loss for the above periods were affected primarily by\nthe following factors:\n• Revenues: Variations in fuel cell product and service revenues reflect the demand and\ntiming of our customers’ fuel cell vehicle, bus, and fuel cell product deployments as well\nas the demand and timing of their engineering services projects. Variations in fuel cell\nproduct and service revenues also reflect the timing of work performed and the\nachievements of milestones under long-term fixed price contracts.\n• Operating expenses: Operating expenses were negatively impacted in the third quarter\nof 2024 by restructuring and related charges of ($16.1) million related to a global\ncorporate restructuring initiative, and negatively impacted by impairment losses on trade\nreceivables of ($7.9) million. Operating expenses also include the impact of changes in\nthe value of the Canadian dollar, versus the U.S. dollar, on our Canadian dollar\ndenominated expenditures.\n• Net loss from continuing operations: Net loss from continuing operations is impacted\nby the above noted impacts on Revenues and Operating expenses. Net loss in the third\nquarter of 2024 was negatively impacted by impairment charges on goodwill of ($40.3)\nmillion consisting of a write-down of the remaining corporate goodwill to nil; and\nPage 28 of 43\nnegatively impacted by impairment charges on property, plant and equipment of ($106.8)\nmillion consisting of an impairment allowance against consolidated assets of ($105.0)\nmillion to impair these operating assets to their estimated residual value, and a write-\ndown of certain specific assets of ($1.8) million located primarily in Denmark and China\nthat are to be discontinued. Net loss in the third quarter of 2024, the second quarter of\n2024, the first quarter of 2024, the fourth quarter of 2023, the third quarter of 2023, the\nsecond quarter of 2023, the first quarter of 2023, and the fourth quarter of 2022, was\nalso impacted by mark to market gains (losses) on financial assets of ($2.7) million, $1.7\nmillion, ($6.3) million, ($10.3) million, ($2.5) million, $0.3 million, ($0.5) million, and\n$2.9 million, respectively, related primarily to our investments in Forsee Power, Wisdom,\nQuantron, HyCap, Clean H2 and Templewater.\n6. CASH FLOWS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n6.1 Summary of Cash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents were $635.1 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to\n$751.1 million as of December 31, 2023. The ($116.0) million decrease in cash and cash\nequivalents in the first three quarters of 2024 was driven primarily by net cash operating\nlosses (excluding non-cash items) of ($89.8) million, purchases of property, plant and\nequipment and intangible assets of ($21.7) million, long-term financial investments of ($8.6)\nmillion consisting of new investments in HyCap, Clean H2 and Templewater, and by finance\nlease repayments of ($2.7) million, partially offset by net working capital inflows of $6.1\nmillion.\n6.2 Cash Provided by (Used by) Operating Activities\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Three months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change\nCash Operating Loss $ (39,480) $ (21,347) $ (18,133)\nChange in Working Capital:\nTrade and other receivables 287 (6,584) 6,871\nInventory (6,547) 2,368 (8,915)\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 69 (400) 469\nTrade and other payables 16,778 2,307 14,471\nDeferred revenue 262 1,062 (800)\nWarranty provision 32 610 (578)\n10,881 (637) 11,518\nCash Used by Operating Activities $ (28,599) $ (21,984) $ (6,615)\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, cash used by operating activities was\n($28.6) million, compared to ($22.0) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe ($6.6) million increase in cash used by operating activities in the third quarter of 2024,\nas compared to the third quarter of 2023, was driven by the relative increase in cash operating\nlosses of ($18.1) million, partially offset by the relative decrease in working capital\nrequirements of $11.5 million.\nThe relative ($18.1) million increase in cash operating losses in the third quarter of 2024 was\ndriven primarily by the increase in Adjusted EBITDA loss of ($25.2) million and by several\nPage 29 of 43\nitems included in cash operating losses but excluded from Adjusted EBITDA loss or vice-versa\ntotaling $7.1 million.\nThe total change in working capital of $10.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 was driven\nby higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $16.8 million primarily as a result of the\ntiming of restructuring payments, supplier payments and annual compensation awards, by\nlower accounts and contract receivables of $0.3 million primarily due to the timing of revenues\nand the related customer collections, and by higher deferred revenue of $0.3 million as we\ncollected pre-payments on certain product and service contracts in advance of work\nperformed. These third quarter of 2024 inflows were partially offset by higher inventory of\n($6.5) million primarily to support expected product shipments in the fourth quarter of 2024\nand into 2025.\nThe total change in working capital of ($0.6) million in the third quarter of 2023 was driven\nby higher accounts and contract receivables of ($6.6) million primarily due to the timing of\nrevenues and the related customer collections. This third quarter of 2023 outflow was partially\noffset by higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $2.3 million due primarily to the\ntiming of supplier payments and annual compensation awards, by lower inventory of $2.4\nmillion due primarily to higher shipments in the period, and by higher deferred revenue of\n$1.1 million due primarily to the timing of customer prepayments in advance of work\nperformed.\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change\nCash Operating Loss $ (89,396) $ (69,892) $ (19,504)\nChange in Working Capital:\nTrade and other receivables 18,036 3,358 14,678\nInventory (23,461) (15,884) (7,577)\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets (287) (3,446) 3,159\nTrade and other payables 8,118 (2,731) 10,849\nDeferred revenue 4,755 588 4,167\nWarranty provision (1,459) 1,778 (3,237)\n5,702 (16,337) 22,039\nCash Used by Operating Activities $ (83,694) $ (86,229) $ 2,535\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used by operating activities was ($83.7)\nmillion compared to ($86.2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The $2.5\nmillion decrease in cash used by operating activities in the first three quarters of 2024, as\ncompared to the first three quarters of 2023, was driven by the relative decrease in working\ncapital requirements of $22.0 million, partially offset by the relative increase in cash operating\nlosses of ($19.5) million.\nThe relative ($19.5) million increase in cash operating losses in the first three quarters of\n2024 was driven primarily by the increase in Adjusted EBITDA loss of ($26.1) million and by\nseveral items included in cash operating losses but excluded from Adjusted EBITDA loss or\nvice-versa totaling $6.6 million.\nThe total change in working capital of $5.7 million in the first three quarters of 2024 was\ndriven by lower accounts and contract receivables of $18.0 million primarily due to the timing\nPage 30 of 43\nof revenues and the related customer collections, by higher accounts payable and accrued\nliabilities of $8.1 million primarily as a result of the timing of restructuring payments, supplier\npayments and annual compensation awards, and by higher deferred revenue of $4.8 million\nas we collected pre-payments on certain product and service contracts in advance of work\nperformed. These first three quarters of 2024 inflows were partially offset by higher inventory\nof ($23.5) million primarily to support expected product shipments in the fourth quarter of\n2024 and into 2025, and by lower warranty provisions of ($1.5) million.\nThe total change in working capital of ($16.3) million in the first three quarters of 2023 was\ndriven by higher inventory of ($15.9) million primarily to support expected future product\nshipments and to help mitigate ongoing supply chain disruptions, by higher prepaid expenses\nof ($3.4) million primarily due to the timing of insurance renewals and program requirements,\nand lower accounts payable and accrued liabilities of ($2.7) million primarily as a result of the\ntiming of supplier payments and annual compensation awards. These first three quarter of\n2023 outflows were partially offset by lower accounts and contract receivables of $3.4 million\nprimarily due to the timing of revenues and the related customer collections, and by higher\nwarranty provisions of $1.8 million.\n6.3 Cash Provided by (Used by) Investing Activities\nInvesting activities resulted in net cash outflows of ($14.3) million and ($30.4) million,\nrespectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash\noutflows of ($11.2) million and ($43.4) million, respectively, for the corresponding periods of\n2023.\nInvesting activities in the third quarter of 2024 of ($14.3) million consist of capital\nexpenditures of ($11.6) million incurred primarily for production and test equipment and\ncertain intangible assets, and long-term investments in HyCap of ($2.6) million.\nInvesting activities in the third quarter of 2023 of ($11.2) million consist of capital\nexpenditures of ($7.0) million incurred primarily for production and test equipment and\ncertain intangible assets, additional long-term investments in the HyCap and Clean H2\nhydrogen infrastructure and growth equity funds of ($3.3) million, and subsequent milestone\nattainment cash acquisition investment in Ballard Motive Solutions of ($0.9) million.\nInvesting activities in the first three quarters of 2024 of ($30.4) million consist of capital\nexpenditures of ($21.7) million incurred primarily for production and test equipment and\ncertain intangible assets, and additional long-term investments in HyCap, Clean H2 and\nTemplewater of ($8.6) million.\nInvesting activities in the first three quarters of 2023 of ($43.4) million consist of capital\nexpenditures of ($34.0) million incurred primarily for production and test equipment and\ncertain intangible assets, additional long-term investments in Quantron of ($3.3) million,\nadditional investment in the HyCap and Clean H2 hydrogen infrastructure and growth equity\nfunds of ($5.1) million, and subsequent Milestone attainment cash acquisition investment in\nBallard Motive Solutions of ($2.0) million.

We measure liquidity as\nour net cash and short-term investment position, consisting of the sum of our cash, cash\nequivalents and short-term investments of $637.2 million, as we have no bank debt.\nWe have a Letter of Guarantee Facility (the “LG Facility”) enabling our bank to issue letters\nof guarantees, standby letters of credit, performance bonds, counter guarantees, counter\nstandby letter of credit or similar credits on our behalf to from time to time up to a maximum\nof $2.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, issued letters of credit of euro 1.0 million were\noutstanding under the LG Facility. We also have a $25 million Foreign Exchange Facility (the\n“FX Facility”) enabling us to enter into foreign exchange currency contracts (at face value\namounts in excess of the FX Facility) secured by a guarantee from Export Development\nCanada. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding foreign exchange currency contracts\nto purchase a total of Canadian $33.0 million under the FX Facility.\nOur liquidity objective is to maintain cash balances sufficient to fund at least six quarters of\nforecasted cash used by operating activities and contractual commitments. Our strategy to\nattain this objective is to continue our drive to attain profitable operations that are sustainable\nby executing a business plan that continues to focus on Fuel Cell Products and Services\nrevenue growth, improving overall gross margins, maintaining discipline over Cash Operating\nCosts, managing working capital and capital expenditure requirements, and securing\nadditional financing to fund our operations as needed until we do achieve profitable operations\nthat are sustainable. We believe that we have adequate liquidity in cash and working capital\nto achieve our liquidity objective.\nFailure to achieve or maintain this liquidity objective could have a material adverse effect on\nour financial condition and results of operations including our ability to continue as a going\nconcern. There are also various risks and uncertainties affecting our ability to achieve this\nliquidity objective including, but not limited to, the market acceptance and rate of\nPage 32 of 43\ncommercialization of our products, the ability to successfully execute our business plan, and\ngeneral global economic conditions, certain of which are beyond our control. While we\ncontinue to make significant investments in product development and market development\nactivities necessary to commercialize our products, make increased investments in working\ncapital and capital expenditures as we grow our business, and make ongoing capital\ncontributions in support of our investment in certain hydrogen infrastructure and growth\nequity funds, our actual liquidity requirements will also vary and will be impacted by future\nacquisitions and strategic partnerships and investments, our relationships with our lead\ncustomers and strategic partners including their ability to successfully finance and fund their\noperations and programs and agreements with us, our success in developing new channels\nto market and relationships with customers, our success in generating revenue growth from\nnear-term product, service and licensing opportunities, our success in managing our operating\nexpense and working capital requirements, foreign exchange fluctuations, and the progress\nand results of our research, development and demonstration programs.\nWe may also choose to pursue additional liquidity through the issuance of debt or equity in\nprivate or public market financings. To enable the timely issuance of equity securities in the\npublic market, we renewed our Base Shelf Prospectus on file with the securities regulators in\nCanada on May 9, 2023. The Base Shelf Prospectus, which is effective for 25-months ending\nin June 2025, was filed in each of the provinces and territories of Canada, and a corresponding\nshelf registration statement on Form F-10 was also filed with the United States Securities and\nExchange Commission. These filings will enable offerings of securities at any time during the\n25-month period that the Base Shelf Prospectus remains effective. No offerings of securities\nunder this Base Shelf Prospectus have been issued to date.\nNo assurance can be given that any such additional liquidity will be available or that, if\navailable, it can be obtained on terms favorable to the Company. If any securities are offered\nunder the Base Shelf Prospectus, the terms of any such securities and the intended use of the\nnet proceeds resulting from such offering would be established at the time of any offering and\nwould be described in a supplement to the Base Shelf Prospectus filed with applicable\nCanadian securities regulators and/or the SEC, respectively, at the time of such an offering.\n7. OTHER FINANCIAL MATTERS\n7.1 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nPeriodically, we use forward foreign exchange contracts to manage our exposure to currency\nrate fluctuations. We record these contracts at their fair value as either assets or liabilities on\nour statement of financial position.

Capital expenditures and\nexpenditures on other intangible assets pertain to our regular operations and are expected to\nbe funded through cash on hand.\nIn connection with the acquisition of intellectual property from UTC in 2014, we have a royalty\nobligation in certain circumstances to pay UTC a portion of any future intellectual property\nsale and licensing income generated from certain of our intellectual property portfolio for a\nperiod of 15-years expiring in April 2029. No royalties were paid to UTC for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we retain a previous funding obligation to pay royalties of 2% of\nrevenues (to a maximum of Canadian $5.4 million) on sales of certain fuel cell products for\ncommercial distributed utility applications.

USE OF PROCEEDS\n8.1 Reconciliation of Use of Proceeds from Previous Financings\nDuring 2021 and 2020, we completed the following offerings of our common shares\n(“Common Shares”):\nPage 35 of 43\n• On February 23, 2021, we closed a bought deal offering of 14.87 million Common Shares\nat a price of $37.00 per Common Share for gross proceeds of $550.2 million and net\nproceeds of $527.3 million (the “2021 Offering”).\n• On September 1, 2020, we announced an at-the-market equity program to issue a total\nof 16.45 million Common Shares from treasury (the “$250 million ATM Program”). The\n16.45 million Common Shares issued under the $250 million ATM Program were sold in\nthe third and fourth quarters of 2020 at prevailing market prices at the time of sale for\ntotal gross proceeds of $250 million and total net proceeds of $244.1 million.\n• On March 10, 2020, we announced an at-the-market equity program to allow the issuance\nof up to $75 million of Common Shares from treasury (the “$75 million ATM Program” and\ntogether with the $250 million ATM Program, the “2020 ATM Programs”). The 8.2 million\nCommon Shares issued under the $75 million ATM Program were sold in the first half of\n2020 at prevailing market prices at the time of sale for total gross proceeds of $66.7\nmillion and total net proceeds of $64.7 million.\nThe net proceeds from the 2021 Offering of $527.3 million were intended to be used to further\nstrengthen the Company’s financial position, thereby providing additional flexibility to fund\ngrowth strategies, including through activities such as product innovation, investments in\nproduction capacity expansion and localization, future acquisitions and strategic partnerships\nand investments. The net proceeds from the 2020 ATM Programs of $308.8 million were\nintended to be used for general corporate purposes.

ACCOUNTING MATTERS\n9.1 Overview\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS, which require us\nto make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from\nthose estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.\nRevisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are\nrevised and in any future periods affected.\n9.2 Critical Judgments in Applying Accounting Policies\nCritical judgments that we have made in the process of applying our accounting policies and\nthat have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial\nstatements is limited to our assessment of our ability to continue as a going concern (See\nNote 2 (e) to our annual consolidated financial statements).\nOur material accounting policies are detailed in note 4 to our annual consolidated financial\nstatements for the year ended December 31, 2023. Effective January 1, 2024, we adopted a\nnumber of new standards and interpretations, but they did not have a material impact on our\nfinancial statements.\n9.3 Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in a material\nadjustment to the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses within the next\nfiscal year are detailed in note 5 to our annual consolidated financial statements for the year\nended December 31, 2023 and also discussed in section 9.3 of our annual MD&A for the year\nended December 31, 2023. There have been no changes to the nature of these sources of\nestimation uncertainty in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. However,\ncertain of these estimation uncertainty risks have increased in magnitude as discussed below.\nThe following updates relating to estimation uncertainty covering the three-month and nine-\nmonth period ended September 30, 2024 are as follows:\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, there were no\nsignificant adjustments to revenues relating to revenue recognized in a prior period.\nASSET IMPAIRMENT\nThe carrying amounts of our non-financial assets, other than inventories, are reviewed at\neach reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such\nindicator exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible\nPage 37 of 43\nassets that have indefinite useful lives, the recoverable amount is estimated annually, or\nwhenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nAs a result of the decline in the Company’s market capitalization, the initiation in the third\nquarter of 2024 of a global corporate restructuring, and indicators of slowing hydrogen and\nfuel cell policy implementation and market adoption, we have updated our goodwill and non-\nfinancial asset impairment test as of September 30, 2024 due to these potential indicators of\nimpairment.\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use\nand its fair value less costs to sell. However, individual assets within the cash-generating unit\nare not impaired below their residual value. In assessing value in use, the estimated future\ncash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects\ncurrent market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In\nassessing fair value less costs to sell, the price that would be received on the sale of an asset\nin an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date is estimated.\nFor the purposes of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped\ntogether into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use\nthat are largely independent of the cash inflows of other groups of assets. The allocation of\ngoodwill and other non-financial assets to cash-generating units reflects the lowest level at\nwhich these assets are monitored for internal reporting purposes. Many of the factors used in\nassessing fair value are outside the control of management, and it is reasonably likely that\nassumptions and estimates will change from period to period. These changes may result in\nfuture impairments. For example, our revenue growth rate could be lower than projected due\nto economic, industry or competitive factors, or the discount rate used in our value in use\nmodel could increase due to a change in market interest rates.\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating\nunit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in net loss.\nImpairment losses recognized in respect of the cash-generating units are allocated first to\nreduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the\ncarrying amounts of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.\nAn impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets,\nimpairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any\nindications that the cumulative loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is\nreversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying\namount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no\nimpairment loss had been recognized.\nAs a result of the impairment tests performed as at September 30, 2024, and our assessment\nof current events and circumstances, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of ($40.3)\nmillion in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 to write-down goodwill to\nnil. In addition, we recognized impairment charges on property, plant and equipment of\n($106.8) million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting of an\nimpairment allowance against consolidated capital assets of ($105.0) million to impair these\noperating assets to their estimated residual value, and a write-down of certain specific assets\nof ($1.8) million located primarily in Denmark and China that are to be discontinued pursuant\nto the global corporate restructuring.\nPage 38 of 43\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, impairment charges on\ngoodwill of ($24.0) million and impairment charges on intangible assets of ($2.3) million were\nrecognized in net loss from discontinued operations consisting of the write-down of acquired\ngoodwill and technology intangible assets to their estimated fair value as a result of further\nproposed restructuring of operations at Ballard Motive Solutions in the U.K.\nWARRANTY PROVISION\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded provisions to\naccrued warranty liabilities of $1.3 million and $4.1 million, respectively, for new product\nsales, compared to $1.5 million and $3.4 million, respectively, for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023.\nWe review our warranty assumptions and make adjustments to accrued warranty liabilities\nquarterly based on the latest information available and to reflect the expiry of contractual\nobligations. Adjustments to accrued warranty liabilities are recorded in cost of product and\nservice revenues. As a result of these reviews and the resulting adjustments, our warranty\nprovision and cost of revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nwere adjusted downwards (upwards) by nil million and $1.9 million, respectively, compared\nto adjustments of nil million and ($0.6) million, respectively, for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023.\nINVENTORY AND ONEROUS CONTRACT PROVISIONS\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, negative inventory impairment\nand onerous contract provision adjustments of ($2.2) million and ($4.4) million, respectively,\nwere recorded as a charge to cost of product and service revenues, compared to negative\ninventory impairment and onerous contract provision adjustments of ($1.4) million and ($4.2)\nmillion, respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (INCLUDING INVESTMENTS)\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized mark to market\ngain (loss) on financial assets of ($2.7) million and ($7.4) million, respectively, compared to\n($2.5) million and ($2.6) million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Mark to market gain (loss) in 2024 and 2023 consist primarily of\nchanges in the fair value of our long-term financial investments including Forsee Power,\nWisdom, Quantron, and in our HyCap and Clean H2 hydrogen infrastructure and growth equity\nfunds.\n9.4 Recently Adopted Accounting Policy Changes\nEffective January 1, 2024, we adopted a number of new standards and interpretations, but\nthey did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\n9.5 Future Accounting Policy Changes\nThe following is an overview of accounting standard changes that we will be required to adopt\nin future years. We do not expect to adopt any of these standards before their effective dates\nand we continue to evaluate the impact of these standards on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nPage 39 of 43\nPresentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (IFRS 18)\nOn April 9, 2024, the IASB issued IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements\nto improve reporting of financial performance. IFRS 18 replaces IAS 1 Presentation of\nFinancial Statements. It carries forward many requirements from IAS 1 unchanged.\nThe new Accounting Standard introduces significant changes to the structure of a company’s\nincome statement, more discipline and transparency in presentation of management's own\nperformance measures (commonly referred to as 'non-GAAP measures,') and less aggregation\nof items into large, single numbers. The main impacts of the new Accounting Standard\ninclude:\n• introducing a newly defined ‘operating profit’ subtotal and a requirement for all income\nand expenses to be allocated between three new distinct categories based on a company’s\nmain business activities (i.e. operating, investing and financing);\n• requiring disclosure about management performance measures (MPMs); and\n• adding new principles for aggregation and disaggregation of information.\nIFRS 18 applies for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2027. Early application is\npermitted. The extent of the impact of adoption of IFRS 18 has not yet been determined.\n10. SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS\n10.1 Overview\nIn addition to providing measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, we present certain\nsupplemental non-GAAP measures. These measures are Cash Operating Costs (including its\ncomponents of research and product development (operating cost), general and\nadministrative (operating cost) and sales and marketing (operating cost)), EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning\nprescribed by GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures\npresented by other companies. We believe these measures are useful in evaluating the\noperating performance of the Company’s ongoing business. These measures should be\nconsidered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, operating expenses, net income, cash\nflows and other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with\nGAAP. The calculation of these non-GAAP measures has been made on a consistent basis for\nall periods presented.\n10.2 Cash Operating Costs\nThis supplemental non-GAAP measure is provided to assist readers in determining our\noperating costs on an ongoing cash basis. We believe this measure is useful in assessing\nperformance and highlighting trends on an overall basis.\nWe also believe Cash Operating Costs is frequently used by securities analysts and investors\nwhen comparing our results with those of other companies. Cash Operating Costs differs from\nthe most comparable GAAP measure, total operating expenses, primarily because it does not\ninclude stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment losses\nor recoveries on trade receivables, restructuring and related costs, acquisition related costs,\nthe impact of unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts, and financing\ncharges. The following tables show a reconciliation of total operating expenses to Cash\nOperating Costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nPage 40 of 43\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Three months ended September 30,\nCash Operating Costs 2024 2023 $ Change\nTotal Operating Expenses $ 54,867 $ 34,693 $ 20,174\nStock-based compensation expense (1,020) (2,958) 1,938\nImpairment recovery (losses) on trade\n(7,863) (45) (7,818)\nreceivables\nAcquisition related costs - (33) 33\nRestructuring and related (costs) recovery (16,147) (210) (15,937)\nImpact of unrealized gains (losses) on foreign\n368 (655) 1,023\nexchange contracts\nDepreciation and amortization (2,221) (1,938) (283)\nCash Operating Costs $ 27,984 $ 28,854 $ (870)\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Nine months ended September 30,\nCash Operating Costs 2024 2023 $ Change\nTotal Operating Expenses $ 128,155 $ 106,101 $ 22,054\nStock-based compensation expense (6,388) (8,145) 1,757\nImpairment recovery (losses) on trade\n(9,554) (62) (9,492)\nreceivables\nAcquisition related costs - (776) 776\nRestructuring and related (costs) recovery (16,338) (1,190) (15,148)\nImpact of unrealized gains (losses) on foreign\n(243) 600 (843)\nexchange contracts\nDepreciation and amortization (6,893) (6,149) (744)\nCash Operating Costs $ 88,739 $ 90,379 $ (1,640)\nThe components of Cash Operating Costs of research and product development (cash\noperating cost), general and administrative (cash operating cost), and sales and marketing\n(cash operating cost) differ from their respective most comparable GAAP measure of research\nand product development expense, general and administrative expense, and sales and\nmarketing expense, primarily because they do not include stock-based compensation\nexpense, depreciation and amortization expense, and acquisition related costs. A\nreconciliation of these respective operating expenses to the respective components of Cash\nOperating Costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is\nincluded in Section 5.4 Operating Expenses and Other Items.\nA breakdown of total stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Three months ended September 30,\nStock-based compensation expense 2024 2023 $ Change\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\nrecorded as follows:\nCost of goods sold $ - $ - $ -\nResearch and product development expense 991 1,530 (539)\nGeneral and administrative expense\n(117) 983 (1,100)\n(recovery)\nSales and marketing expense (recovery) 146 445 (299)\nStock-based compensation expense $ 1,020 $ 2,958 $ (1,938)\nPage 41 of 43\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Nine months ended September 30,\nStock-based compensation expense 2024 2023 $ Change\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\nrecorded as follows:\nCost of goods sold $ - $ - $ -\nResearch and product development expense 3,693 4,231 (538)\nGeneral and administrative expense 1,833 2,711 (878)\nSales and marketing expense (recovery) 862 1,203 (341)\nStock-based compensation expense $ 6,388 $ 8,145 $ (1,757)\nA breakdown of total depreciation and amortization expense for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Three months ended September 30,\nDepreciation and amortization expense 2024 2023 $ Change\nTotal depreciation and amortization expense\nrecorded as follows:\nCost of goods sold $ 1,210 $ 1,067 $ 143\nResearch and product development expense 1,918 1,437 481\nGeneral and administrative expense 302 500 (198)\nSales and marketing expense 1 1 -\nDepreciation and amortization expense $ 3,431 $ 3,005 $ 426\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Nine months ended September 30,\nDepreciation and amortization expense 2024 2023 $ Change\nTotal depreciation and amortization expense\nrecorded as follows:\nCost of goods sold $ 3,669 $ 3,075 $ 594\nResearch and product development expense 5,728 4,704 1,024\nGeneral and administrative expense 1,163 1,441 (278)\nSales and marketing expense 2 4 (2)\nDepreciation and amortization expense $ 10,562 $ 9,224 $ 1,338\n10.3 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nThese supplemental non-GAAP measures are provided to assist readers in determining our\noperating performance. We believe this measure is useful in assessing performance and\nhighlighting trends on an overall basis. We also believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are\nfrequently used by securities analysts and investors when comparing our results with those\nof other companies. EBITDA differs from the most comparable GAAP measure, net loss from\ncontinuing operations, primarily because it does not include finance expense, income taxes,\ndepreciation of property, plant and equipment, and amortization of intangible assets. Adjusted\nEBITDA adjusts EBITDA for stock-based compensation expense, transactional gains and\nlosses, acquisition related costs, finance and other income, recovery on settlement of\ncontingent consideration, asset impairment charges, and the impact of unrealized gains and\nlosses on foreign exchange contracts.

CORE BUSINESS AND STRATEGY\n2.1 Core Business\nAt Ballard, our vision is to deliver fuel cell power for a sustainable planet. We are recognized\nas a world leader in proton exchange membrane (“PEM”) fuel cell power system development\nand commercialization.\nOur principal business is the design, development, manufacture, sale and service of PEM fuel\ncell products for a variety of applications, focusi ng on power products for bus, truck, rail,\nmarine, stationary and emerging market (material handling, off-road and other) applications,\nas well as the delivery of services, including tech nology solutions, after sales services and\ntraining.\nA fuel cell is an environmentally clean electrochem ical device that combines hydrogen fuel\nwith oxygen (from the air) to produce electricity. The hydrogen fuel can be obtained from\nnatural gas, kerosene, methanol,ammonia, or other hydrocarbon fuels, or from water through\nelectrolysis. Ballard’s PEM fuel cell products are typically designed to feature high fuel\nefficiency, relatively low operating temperature, high durability, low noise and vibration,\ncompact size, quick response to changes in electriacl demand, and modular design.Embedded\nin each Ballard fuel cell product lies a stack of u nit cells designed with our proprietary PEM\nfuel cell technology. This technology includes membrane electrode assemblies, catalysts,\nplates, and other key components, and drawon intellectual property from our patent portfolio,\ntogether with our extensive experience and know-how, in key areas of PEM fuel cell stack\ndesign, operation, production processes and systems integration.\nWe are based in Canada, with head office, research , technology and product development,\nengineering services, testing, manufacturing and after-sale service facilities in Burnaby,\nBritish Columbia. We also have sales, assembly, research and development , certain\n18\nengineering services and after-sale service facilities in Hobro, Denmark, a module assembly\nfacility in Bend, Oregon, and a sales, quality, supply chain, and after-sales service office in\n•\nGuangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.\nWe also havea non-controlling, 49% interest in Weichai Ballard Hy-Energy Technologies Co.,\n• Ltd. (“Weichai Ballard JV”), located in Weifang, Shandong Province, China. Weichai Ballard\nJV’s business is to manufacture certain fuel cell products utilizing Ballard’s LCS fuel cell stack\nand LCS-based power modules for bus, commercial truck,and forklift applications with certain\n•\nexclusive rights in China.\n• Furthermore, we have certain non-controlling and non-equity accounted investments: (i) a\n3% equity interest in Quantron AG (“Quantron”), a global electric vehicle integrator and an\nemerging specialty OEM, to accelerate fuel cell truck adoption; (ii) a 6.7% equity interest in\n•\nWisdom Group Holdings Ltd. (“Wisdom”), a Cayman Island holding company with operating\nsubsidiaries whose business includes the design and manufacture of vehicles, including zero\n•\nemission fuel cell electric buses, trucks, and battery-electric vehicles; and (iii) a 7.3% equity\ninterest in Forsee Power SA (“Forsee Power”), a Fre nch company specializing in the design,\ndevelopment, manufacture, commercialization, and financing of smart battery systems for\n•\nsustainable electric transport. We have also invested in two hydrogen infrastructure and\ngrowth equity funds: (i) a 10.4% interest in the HyCap Fund I SCSP (“HyCap”), a sp ecial\n• limited partnership registered in Luxembourg; and (ii) a 1.5% interest in Clean H2 Infra Fund\n(“Clean H2”), a special limited partnership registe red in France. During the first quarter of\n2024, we invested in a decarbonization and climate technolog y and growth equity fund by\nacquiring a 2% interest in Templewater Decarbonization I, L.P., a limited partnership\nregistered in Cayman Islands, for an initial investment of $0.5 million on a total commitment\nof $1.0 million.\n2.2 Strategic Imperatives\nWe strive to build value for our shareholders by developing, manufacturing, selling, and\nservicing zero-emission, industry-leading PEM fuel cell technology products and servi ces to\nmeet the needs of our customers in target markets. More specifically, our business plan is to\nleverage our core competencies of PEM fuel cell sta ck technology and engine development\nand manufacturing, our investments in advanced manufacturing and production capacity, and\nour product portfolio by marketing our products and services across select large and attracitve\naddressable market applications and select geographic regions.\nWe typically select our target market applications based on use cases where the comparative\nuser value proposition for PEM fuel cells powered by hydrogen are strongest – such as where\noperators value low emission vehicles that require high utilization, long driving range, heavy\npayload, fast refueling, and similar user experiences to legacy diesel vehicles – and where the\nbarriers to entry for hydrogen refueling infrastructure are lowest – such as use cases where\nfuel cell vehicles typically return to a depot or hydrogen hub for centralized refueling and dno’t\nrequire a distributed hydrogen refueling network. Our current target markets include certain\nmedium- and heavy-duty mobility applications for bus, truck, rail, and marine, along with\ncertain off-road mobility and stationary power applications.\nWe select our target geographic markets based on a variety of factors, including addressable\nmarket sizes of the target market applications in t he geographic markets, historic\ndeployments and expected market adoption rates for hydrogen and fuel cells, supp ortive\n19\ngovernment policies, existing and potential partner , customer, and end user relationships,\nand competitive dynamics. Our current target markets are the geographic regions of Europe,\nNorth America, and China.\nWhile we recognize addressing multiple market appli cations and geographic markets in\nparallel increases our near-term cost structure and investments, we believe offering the same\ncore PEM fuel cell technologies and substantially s imilar derivative PEM fuel cell products\nacross multiple mobility and power market applicati ons and select geographic regions will\nsignificantly expand and strengthen our long-term business prospects by increasing volume\nscaling in our operations, enabling lower product a nd production costs for the benefit of all\nmarkets, improving our competitive positioning and market share, enabling richly diversified\nrevenue streams and profit pools, and improving our return on investment in our technology\nand product development programs and our investments in manufacturing.\nOur strategy is built on four key themes:\n• Double down in the fuel cell stack & module: invest in leading PEM fuel cell technology\nand products to provide leading value to our custom ers and end users on a total cost of\nownership basis;\n• Accelerate market development : deepen and create new partnerships to accelerate\nhydrogen and fuel cell market adoption and grow volumes for product sales;\n• Win in key regions: prioritize investmentsin North America and Europe, and monitor China\nbefore materially deepening our investment in China; and\n• Here for Life : deliver a compelling environmental, social and go vernance (“ESG”)\nproposition for our stakeholders.\nIn 2020 and 2021, we materially strengthened our fi nancial position through equity\nfinancings, thereby providing additional flexibility to fund our growth strategy. Following these\nfinancings, given strong indicators of long -term market adoption of hydrogen and zero -\nemission mobility, given growing customer interest in our fuel cell products, given a growing\nopportunity set, and given an increasingly competitive environment, we strategically decided\nto significantly increase and accelerate our invest ments ahead of the adoption curv e. As a\nresult, over the past three years, we increased and accelerated our investments in technology •\nand product innovation, product cost reduction, production capacity expansion and\nlocalization, strategic pricing for select customer demonstration programs, and customer\nexperience. Our increased investments include : next generation products and technology,\nincluding our proprietary membrane electrode assemb lies (“MEAs”), bipolar plates, stacks,\nand modules; advanced manufacturing processes, technologies, equipment, and production\ncapacity expansion activities primarily in Canada, Europe and the United States; and\ntechnology and product cost reduction.\nGiven challenging and dynamic macroeconomic and geo political conditions, given continued •\ndelays in hydrogen and fuel cell market adoption, a nd given changes in investor sentiment\ntowards pre-profitability clean energy companies with long-duration investment horizons, we\nsharpened our focus in 2023 to protect our balances heet. While we continue to invest against\nour long-term strategy, we rationalized our product portfoli o, reduced the number of active\nproduct development programs, dropped new corporate dev elopment investments, and\ndiscontinued certain legacy products and non -core activities, including Ballard Motive\n20\nSolutions in the U .K. We also suspended our proposed $130 million investment for the\nlocalization of a new MEA production facility in China.\n3.

We use certain Non-GAAP measures to assist in assessing our financial\nperformance. Non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar\n• measures presented by other companies. See reconciliation to GAAP in the Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures section.\n3.2 2023 Performance compared to 2023 Business Outlook\nConsistent with the Company’s past practice, and in view of the early stage of hydrogen fuel\ncell market development and adoption, we did not pr ovide specific revenue or net income\n(loss) guidance for 2023. We did however provide certain quantitative and qualitative outlook\nexpectations for 2023 as we continued our plan to i ncrease investments in the business,\nincluding extensive research and product development, expanding our product offerings, and\ninvestments in manufacturing capabilities. In particular:\n• Total Operating Expenses: 2023 outlook range of $135 million to $155 million – Total\nOperating Expenses in fiscal 2023 of $149.0 million (including $7.9 million of operating\nexpenses from discontinued operations) were at the higher end of our outlook range of\nbetween $135 million and $155 million (compared to $145.8 million in fiscal 2022including\n$13.8 million of operating expenses from discontinued ope rations) as we continue d to\ninvest in research and product development by advancing new technology, product cost\nreduction, product innovation, and development acro ss bus, truck, rail, marine, and\nstationary power markets, including next-generation MEAs, plates, stacks, and modules.\n• Capital Expenditures: 2023 outlook range of $40 million to $60 million – T otal Capital\nExpenditures (being additions to property, plant and equipment and investment in other\nintangible assets) in fiscal 2023 of $41. 4 million were at the lower end of our outlook\nrange of between $40 million and $60 million (compared to $34.5 million in fiscal 2022)\nas we continued to invest in testing, advanced manufacturing, and p roduction. Capital\nallocation in 2023 included increasing testing and prototyping capabilities, including new\nadvanced test station equipment and refurbishments of existing testing equipment,\n21\nadvanced manufacturing equipment in Canada for next -generation bipolar plates, and\npositioning our manufacturing capabilities in Canada, Denmark, and the United States to\nsupport anticipated scale in key markets. We also c ontinued to look at opportunities to\nexpand our presence in growing markets.\n3.3 2024 Business Outlook\nConsistent with the Company’s past practice, and in view of the early stage of hydrogen fuel\ncell market development and adoption, we are not providing specific revenue or net income\n(loss) guidance for 202 4. In 2024, we plan to continue investments in next generation\nproducts, advanced manufacturing, and production capacity expansion . We also expect\nrevenue in 2024 will be back-half weighted, with roughly 30% in the first half and 70% in the\nsecond half, similar to 2023. Our 2024 outlook includes:\n• Total Operating Expenses: 2024 outlook range of $145 million to $165 million – We expect\ntotal Operating Expenses (excluding discontinued op erations) for fiscal 2024 to be\nbetween $145 million and $165 million (compared to $141.1 million in fiscal 2023) as we\ncontinue to invest in research and product developm ent across our markets, including\nrationalization of our product portfolio, accelerating product cost reduction initiatives, and\nincreased investment to accelerate development of our next-generation core products\nincluding MEAs, plates, stacks, and modules.\n• Capital Expenditures: 2024 outlook range of $50 million to $70 million – We expect total\nCapital Expenditures (being additions to property, plant and equipment and investment in\nother intangible assets) for fiscal 2024 to be betw een $50 million and $70 million\n(compared to $41.4 million in fiscal 2023) as we continue to expand our production\nmanufacturing capacity in support of our ‘local for local’ strategy , including planned\ninvestments in testing, advanced manufacturing and production.\nOur expectations for 2024 are in part supported by our 12-month Order Book of approximately\n$66.6 million which is derived from our Order Backlog of approximately $130.5 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023 (during the fourth quarter of 2024, we removed appr oximately $22\nmillion from the Order Backlog for a specific customer experiencing liquidity issues and\nresulting program delays). Our Order Backlog represents the estimated aggregat e value of\norders at a given time for whichcustomers have made contractual commitments and our 12-\nmonth Order Book represents the aggregate expected value of that portion of the Order\nBacklog that the Company expects to deliver in the subsequent 12-month period.\nOur expectations are based on our internal forecast which reflects an as sessment of overall\nbusiness conditions and takes into account actual s ales, operating expenses, capital\nexpenditures, and financial results in the first two months of 2024; sales orders received for\nunits and services expected to be delivered in the remainder of 202 4; purchase and cost\ncommitments currently in existence for fiscal 2024; an estimate with respect to the generation\nof new sales and the timing of deliveries in each o f our markets for the balance of 2024; an\nestimate of purchase and cost commitments to be generated in each of our locations for the\nbalance of 2024; and assumes an average U.S. dollar exchange rate in the mid $0.70’s in\nrelation to the Canadian dollar for 2024.\nThe primary risk factors to our business expectations for 2024 are customer, production, or\nprogram delays or cancellations in delivering against existing power products and technology\n22\nsolutions orders and delays from forecast in terms of closing and delivering expected sales;\nadverse macro-economic and political conditions including trade and other geopolitical risks;\nchanges in government subsidy and incentive programs; inadequate investment in hydrogen\ninfrastructure and / or excessive hydrogen fuel costs, all of which could negatively impactour\ncustomers’ access to capital and the success of their program plans which could adversely\nimpact our business including potential changes, delays or acceleration s in our expected\noperating and capital equipment requirements ; disruptions due to delays of supply of key\nmaterials and components from third party suppliers; disruptions as a result of our reliance\non a limited number of technology service customers including Weichai Ballard JV, which are\nreliant on their internal commercialization plans and budget require ments; disruptions as a\nresult of delays in achieving technology solutions program milestones; disruptions as a result\nof our reliance on a limited number of customers and certain of those customer’s internal\n• stack development and commercialization plans ; and fluctuations in the Canadian dollar\nrelative to the U.S. dollar, as a significant portoi n of our operating expense commitmentsand\ncapital expenditure commitments are priced in Canadian dollars.\nOur Order Backlog and our 12 -month Order Book are currently comprised of a relat ively\nlimited number of contracts and a relatively limited number of customers. Given the relative\nimmaturity of our industry and customer deployment programs, our Order Backlog and 12-\nmonth Order Book are potentially vulnerable to risk of cancellation, deferral or non -\n• performance by our customers for a variety of reasons, including: risks related to continued\ncustomer commitment to a fuel cell program; risks related to customer liquidity; credit risks;\nrisks related to changes, reductions or elimination s in government policies, subsidies and\nincentives; risks related to macro -economic and political conditions including trade, public\nhealth, and other geopolitical risks; risks related to slower market adoption; risks related to\nvehicle integration challenges; risks related to th e development of effective hydrogen\nrefueling infrastructure; risks related to the ability of our products to meet evolving market\nrequirements; and supplier-related risks. Certain of our customer supply agreements arealso\nsubject to certain conditions or risks, including achievement of certain product performance\nmilestones, completion of product development progr ams, or customer cancellation\nprovisions, and it is likely that some future supply agreements will also be subject to similar\nconditions and risks. There can be no assurance that we will achieve or satisfy suchconditions\nor that customers will not cancel their orders. Ina ddition, our supply agreements may include\nvarious pricing structures or reduced pricing tiers based on various factors, including volumes\nand the timing of deliveries. In setting these reduced pricing tiers, we may assu me certain\nfuture product cost reductions which are subject to execution risk, including future commodity\ncosts, supply chain costs, and production costs, an d we may not be successful in achieving\nthe planned cost reductions. In such circumstances, thes e agreements may become future\nonerous contracts if our gross margins become negative and the value of carried inventory to\nsupport product delivery under such contracts may also be adversely impacted.\nFurthermore, potential fluctuations in our financial results make financial forecasting difficult.\nIn addition, due to the early stage of development of the market for hydrogen fuel cell\nproducts, it is difficult to accurately predict future revenues, operating expenses, cash flows,\nor results of operations on a quarterly basis. The Company’s revenues, operating expenses,\ncash flows, and other operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. As a\nresult, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of re venues, operating expenses, cash flows, and\n23\nother operating results may not be meaningful; insetad, we believe our operating performance\nshould be assessed over a number of quarters and years. It is likely that in one or more future\nquarters, financial results will fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors\nand the trading price of the Company's shares may be materially and adversely affected.\n4. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS (Including Contractual Updates)\n4.1 Corporate\nUpdate on global manufacturing strategy\nOn September 30, 2022, we announced our strategy ‘l ocal for local’ where we summarized\nour plan to deepen our global manufacturing footprnit in Europe, the United States, and China\nto support expected global market demand growth through 2030. As part of this strategy, we\nentered into an investment agreement with the Government of Anting in Shanghai’s Jiading\nDistrict to establish our new China headquarters, M EA manufacturing facility, and an R&D\ncenter, at a site strategically located at the Jiading Hydrogen Port, located in one of China’s\nleading automotive industry clusters, with the plan to invest approximately $130 million over\nthe next three years.\nHowever, as a result of the increasingly constructvie hydrogen policy landscape and increased\nmarket activity in the U.S. and Europe; and given the continued hydrogen and fuel cell policy\nuncertainties and market delays in China, as well as geopolitical risks, we decided to suspend\nour MEA localization plan in China while we continue with a comparative analysis on\nmanufacturing capacity expansion options and possible sequencing prioritization in the U.S.\nand/or European markets. We expect to conclude this review in 2024.\n4.2 Europe\n15 MW order for stationary power products in Europe\nOn March 5, 2024, we announced an order for 15 megawatts (MW) of fuel cell systems from\na UK-based company specializing in renewable of-fgrid power generation. Weexpect to deliver\n150 FCmove®-HD+ 100 kW systems beginning in late 2024 and continuing through 2025.\nThe current order of 15 MW of fuel cell systems follows prior cumulative orders for roughly 5\nMW of fuel cell systems from this customer. The purchase order is the first order under a new\nmulti-year supply agreement. The agreement also provides the customer an option to\npurchase up to an additional 296 systems by March 2 026, which, if fully exercised, would\nbring the total number of systems ordered to 446.\nOrders from Solaris for over 62 hydrogen fuel cell engines to power buses in Europe\nOn November 6, 2023, weannounced multiple purchase orders totaling 62 hydrogen fuel cell\nengines from long-standing customer Solaris Bus & Coach sp. z o.o. (“ Solaris”), a leading\nEuropean bus manufacturer deploying hydrogen -powered city buses across the continent.\nBallard expects delivery of the majority of the fuel cell engines to occur in 2024.\nThe hydrogen fuel cell engines will power buses in Germany and Poland. The number of\nengines ordered by Solaris in 2024 approximate 350, representing substantial growth over\nthe more than 140 fuel cell city buses that Solaris has deployed with customers in Europe to\ndate.\n24\nOrders from Solaris for over 170 hydrogen fuel cell engines to power buses in Europe\nOn October 10, 2023, we announced multiple purchase orders totaling 177 hydrogen fuel cell\nengines from long-standing customer Solaris. Ballard commenced deliveries of these orders\nin late 2023 and expect the remainder to ship in 2024 and 2025.\nThe orders include the supply of fuel cell engines to support the largest announced\ndeployment of a fleet of fuel cell city buses in Eu rope, with 127 Solaris fuel cell buses to be\ndeployed in Bologna, Italy. Ballard also received o rders for a further 50 modules to power\nSolaris fuel cell buses in Germany and Italy.\n4.3 North America and Rest of World\nLong-Term Supply Agreement with NFI Group and purchase o rder for 100 fuel cell engines\nfor bus deployments in North America\nOn January 3, 2024, we announced the signing of a ne w Long-Term Supply Agreement\n(“LTSA”) with NFI Group Inc. (“NFI”), a leading independent bus and coach manufacturer and\na leader in electric mass mobility solutions in Nor th America and Europe. The agreement\nmarks a new phase in the established partnership between Ballard and NFI, focused on\ndeployment-level volumes of fuel cell powered buses across a lolf NFI’s major brands including\nNew Flyer, Alexander Dennis, and MCI.\nAs part of the LTSA, NFI has placed its first purch ase order under the agreement for a\nminimum of 100 FCmove® -HD+ modules for planned delivery in 2024. The modul es will\nprimarily be produced in Ballard’s Bend, Oregon fac ility with Buy America compliance, a nd\nwill power New Flyer’s next generation Xcelsior CHA RGE FC™ hydrogen fuel cell buses for\ndeployment across the US and Canada, including Cali fornia, Manitoba, Nevada, New York,\nOhio, and Pennsylvania.\nCanadian Pacific Kansas City places follow-on order for 2.4 MW of Ballard fuel cell engines for\nactive service locomotives\nOn November 6, 2023, we announced an order for 2.4 MW of additional fuel cell engines from\nCanadian PacificKansas City (“CPKC”). These twelve, 200 kW fuel cell engines were delivered\nin 2023 as expected and will support the development of CPKC’s additional hydrogen-powered\nlocomotives planned for regular switching and local freight service applications in Alberta.\nThe additional locomotives will be partially funded through the Emissions Reduction Alberta\n(“ERA”) program that helps the province deliver oni ts environmental and economic goals and\nwill in turn support the decarbonization of rail transport by funding hydrogen production and\nrefueling infrastructure along with hydrogen-powered locomotives.\nOver the past two years, Ballard has supplied CPKC with 38 fuel cell engines for use in its\nhydrogen locomotives, with combined fuel cell power of 7.6 MW. The additional locomotives\nare expected to enter service in late 2024.\n4.4 China\nWeichai Power Co., Ltd. and Weichai Ballard Hy-Energy Technologies Co., Ltd.\nOn November 13, 2018, we announced the closing of a strategic collaboration transaction\nwith Weichai. Ballard’s strategic collaboration with Weichai included:\n25\n• Equity Investment – an equity investment in Ballard made by Weichai rep resenting a\n19.9% interest in the Company at that time. Weichai currently holds an approximate\n15.4% interest in Ballard.\nBallard entered into an investor rights agreement with Weichai under which: (a) so long\nas Weichai directly or indirectly holds at least 10% of Ballard’s outstanding shares, it has\nan anti-dilution right entitling it to maintain its percent age ownership in Ballard by\nsubscribing for Common Shares from treasury at the same price as Ballard distributes\nCommon Shares to other investors (to date, Weichai’s anti-dilution rights with respect to\nall previous offerings of the Company have expired unexercised); (b) for so long as\nWeichai directly or indirectly holds at least 15% of Ballard’s outstanding Common Shares,\nit has the right to nominate two directors to Ballard’s board of directors; and (c) if there\nis a third-party offer to buy Ballard, Weichai has the right to make a superior proposal or\notherwise it must vote its Common Shares in accordance w ith the recommendation of\nBallard’s board of directors.\n• China Joint Venture and Technology Transfer Agreeme nt – Weichai and Ballard have\nestablished a joint venture company in Shandong Pro vince to support China’s Fuel Cell\nElectric Vehicle market, with Weichai holding a controlling ownership interest of 51% and\nBallard holding a 49% ownership position. Weichai Ballard JV was established in the fourth\nquarter of 2018. During fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022, Weichai made its committed\ncapital contributions totaling RMB 561.0 million an d Ballard made its committed capital\ncontributions totaling RMB 539.0 million (equivalent to $79.4 million). Weichai holds three\nof five Weichai Ballard JV board seats and Ballard holds two, with Ballard having certain\nshareholder protection provisions.\nThe Weichai Ballard JV develops and manufactures fu el cell modules and components\nincluding Ballard’s LCS bi -polar plates, fuel cell stacks and FCgen ®-LCS-based power\nmodules for bus, commercial truck, and forklift applications with exclusive rights (subject\nto certain conditions) in China and is to pay Ballard a total of $90 million under a program\nto develop and transfer technology to Weichai Ballard JV in order to enable these\nmanufacturing activities.

We retain an exclusive right to the developed\ntechnologies outside China, subject to certain restrictions on sublicensing outside China.\nThe Weichai Ballard JV will also purchase MEAs for FCgen®-LCS fuel cell stacks exclusively\nfrom Ballard under a long-term supply agreement.\n• Fuel Cell Sales – On December 16, 2019, we announced the receipt of a purchase order\nfrom Weichai Ballard JV for the delivery of MEAs vlaued at approximately $19 million under\na long-term MEA supply agreement. Revenue earned from this agreement ($1.5 million in\nthe fourth quarter of 2023; $0.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022;$ 2.1 million in fiscal\n2023; $1.0 million in fiscal 2022) is recorded primarily as product revenue in our Heavy-\nDuty Mobility Truck market. As of December 31, 2023, an additional $ 5.1 million of\n26\n• revenue associated with shipments on this order to Weichai Ballard JV remain\nunrecognized until these products are ultimately sold by Weichai Ballard JV.\nThe Weichai Ballard JV operation, located in Weifan g, Shandong Province, China, has\ncommenced production activities of LCS bi-polar plates, LCS fuel cell stacks and LCS-based\nmodules to power bus and truck FCEVs for the China market. The Weichai Ballard JV is\nexpected to have annual production capacity of 40,000 fuel cell stacks and 20,000 engines.\n5. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n5.1 Operating Segments\nWe report our results in the single operating segment of Fuel Cell Products and Services. For\n2023, we have made certain changes in the presentat ion of revenues by application\ncomprising our Fuel Cell Products and Services operating segment. Our Fuel Cell Products and\nServices segment consists of the sale of PEM fuel c ell products and services for a variety of\napplications, including Heavy-Duty Mobility ( consisting of bus, truck, rail , and marine\n• applications), Stationary Power, and Emerging and Other Markets (consisting of material\nhandling, off-road, and other applications). Revenues from the delivery of Services, including\ntechnology solutions, after sales services and training, are included in each of the respective\nmarkets.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed a r estructuring of operations at Ballard\nMotive Solutions in the U.K. and effectively closed the operation. As such, the historic\noperating results (including revenue and operating expenses) of the Ballard Motive Solutions\nbusiness for both 2023 and 2022 have been removed from continuing operating results and\nare instead presented separately in the statement o f comprehensive income (loss) as loss\nfrom discontinued operations.\n5.2 Summary of Key Financial Metrics – Three Months Ended December 31, 2023\nRevenue and Gross Margin\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Three months ended December 31,\n2023 2022 $ Change % Change\nHeavy-Duty Mobility $ 29,004 $ 9,079 $ 19,925 219%\nBus 11,978 2,718 9,260 341%\nTruck 5,991 2,544 3,447 135%\nRail 7,039 2,676 4,363 163%\nMarine 3,996 1,141 2,855 250%\nStationary 12,805 6,234 6,571 105%\nEmerging and Other 4,942 4,870 72 1%\nRevenues $ 46,751 $ 20,1 83 $ 26,568 132%\nChina $ 5,496 $ 2,009 $ 3,487 174%\nEurope 24,907 9,080 15,827 174%\nNorth America 15,106 8,168 6,938 85%\n• Rest of World 1,242 926 316 34%\nRevenues 46,751 20,183 26,568 132%\nCost of goods sold 56,918 26,276 30,642 117%\nGross Margin $ (10,167) $ ( 6,093) $ (4,074) 67%\nGross Margin % ( 22%) ( 30%) n/a 8 pts\n27\nFuel Cell Product s and Services Revenues of $ 46.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2023\nincreased 132%, or $26.6 million, compared to the fourthquarterof 2022. The 132% increase\nwas driven by higher Heavy-Duty Mobility and Stationary market revenues as Emerging and\nOther and Stationary market revenueswere effectively flat. Revenue increased in each region\nwith the largest increases in Europe and North America followed by China and Rest of World.\nHeavy-Duty Mobility revenues of $29.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased $20.0\nmillion, or 219%, due to higher sales of fuel cell products in each of our sub-markets of bus,\nrail, truck and marine. Heavy-Duty Mobility revenues on a quarter-to-quarter basis are\nimpacted by product mix due to varying customer requirements and various fuel cell products,\nincluding numerous power configurations required by our customers (and the resulting impact\non selling price) of our fuel cell modules, fuel cell stacks, MEAs, and related component and\nparts kits. Heavy -Duty Mobility revenues of $ 29.0 million in the fourth quarter of 202 3\nincludes service revenues of $2.3 million earned on the Weichai Ballard JV technology transfer\nprogram; $2.3 million from Weichai Ballard JV for the supply of a mix of certa in fuel cell\nproducts and components that will be used in the assembly of modules to power zero-emission\nFCEVs in China; and $24.4 million from a variety of customers in Europe, North America,\nChina, and the rest of the world , primarily for shipments of FCwave™, FCmove™-HD+,\nFCmove™-HD FCmove™-XD, and FCveloCity®-HD7 fuel cell modules and related components\nfor their respective bus, truck, rail and marine programs.\nHeavy-Duty Mobility revenues of $9.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 includes service\nrevenues of $0.9 million earned on the Weichai Ballard JV technology transfer program; $0.3\nmillion to Weichai Ballard JV for the supply of a m ix of certain fuel cell products and\ncomponents that will be used in the assembly of mod ules to power zero-emission FCEVs in\nChina; and $7.8 million to a variety of customers in North America, Europe, and Other areas,\nprimarily for shipments of FCveloCity®-HD7 and FCveloCity ®-HDv8 fuel cell modules and\nrelated components for their respective bus and train programs.\nStationary revenues of $12.8 million increased $6.6 million, or 105%, due to higher sales of\nstationary power generation fuel cell modules, stac ks, products and services primarily in\nEurope and North America. Stationary revenues also include technology solutions program\nrevenues from a variety of customer programs for stationary applications.\nEmerging and Other market revenues of $ 4.9 million increased $0.1 million, or 1%, due\nprimarily to higher sales of fuel cell modules primarily for mining applications, partially offset\nby lower fuel cell stack shipments and lower service revenues. Emerging and Other market\nrevenues include technology solutions program revenues on the completed Audi program of\nnil in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nFuel Cell Products and Service s gross margins were ($10.2) million, or (22%) of revenues,\nfor the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to ($6.1) million, or (30%) of revenues, for the\nfourth quarter of 2022. The negative gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2023 was driven\nprimarily by significantly higher inventory impairment and onero us contract provisions, and\nby a shift to lower overall product margin and service revenue mix including the impacts of\npricing strategy, higher fixed overhead costsdue primarily to the expansion of manufacturing\ncapacity, and increases in supply costs.\nGross margin in the fourth quarter of 202 3 was negatively impacted by net increases in\n28\ninventory impairment and onerous contract provision adjustments of ($10.7) million, and\npositively impacted by net warranty adjustments of $0.3 million. Negative inventory and\nrelated impairment adjustments of ($10.7) million in the fourth quarter of 2023 wreeprimarily\ndue to (i) customer specific heavy-duty mobility inventory no longer expected to be ut ilized\ndue to a certain customer’s liquidity issues and resulting program delays; (ii) excess and slow\nmoving small stationary inventory located primarily in Europe due to product rationalization\nand potential divestiture activities ; and (iii) excess and slow moving legacy and customer\nservice inventory no longer expected to be utilized . Gross margin in the fourth quarter of\n2022 was negatively impacted by net inventory and onerous contract provision adjustments\nof ($4.1) million due primarily to excess and impaired service inventory; and positively\nimpacted by net warranty adjustments of $0.5 million.\nOperating Expenses and Cash Operating Costs\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Three months ended December 31,\n2023 2022 $ Change % Change\nResearch and Product\nDevelopment $ 24,459 $ 21,506 $ 2,953 14%\nGeneral and Administrative 5,042 4,982 60 1%\nSales and Marketing 3,716 3,295 421 13%\nOperating Expenses $ 33,217 $ 29,783 $ 3,434 12%\nResearch and Product\nDevelopment (cash operating cost) $ 21,337 $ 20,586 $ 751 4%\nGeneral and Administrative\n(cash operating cost) 4,233 5,361 (1,128) (21%)\nSales and Marketing (cash operating\ncost) 3,380 3,091 289 9%\nCash Operating Costs $ 28,950 $ 29,038 $ (88) (0%)\nCash Operating Costs and its components of Research and Product Development (cash operating cost), General and Administrative(cash operating cost),\nand Sales and Marketing (cash operating cost) are non-GAAP measures.

The increase was driven by higher research and product development expenses of $3.0\nmillion and higher sales and marketing expenses of $0.4 million.\nCash Operating Costs (see Supplemental Non -GAAP Measures and Reconciliations) for the\nfourth quarter of 2023 were $29.0 million, a decrease of ($0.1) million, or (0%), compared\nto the fourth quarter of 2022. The minor decrease was driven by lower general and\nadministrative cash operating costs of ($1.1) million, partially offset by higher research and\nproduct development cash operating costs of $ 0.8 million, and higher sales and marketing\ncash operating costs of $0.3 million.\nThe minor decrease in cash operating costs in the fourth quarter of 2023 was driven primarily\nby lower general and administrative costs due to lower contractor services, recruiting, and\ninsurance costs. These cost reductions were partially offset by increased expenditure on\ntechnology and product development activities, including the design and development of next\ngeneration fuel cell stacks and engines for bus, turck, rail, marine and stationary applications,\nand continuation engineering investment in our existing fuel cell products, including activities\n29\nrelated to product cost reduction. Program investme nt includes expenditures related to our\nFCmove™-HD+ and FCmove XDfuel cell modules designed for buses and medium and heavy-\nduty trucks, our FCgen® -HPS High-Power Density Fuel Cell Stack for light -medium-and\nheavy-duty vehicles, our FCwave ™ Fuel Cell Module for marine applications, and on th e\nongoing improvement of all of our fuel cell products including our high performance fuel cell\nmodule, the FCmove ™-HD, and our high performance liquid -cooled fuel cell stack, the\nFCgen®-LCS.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Three months ended December 31,\n2023 2022 $ Change % Change\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (44,083) $ ( 40,148) $ ( 3,935) ( 10%)\nEBITDA andAdjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures.

See reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP in the Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations section. Adjusted EBITDA\nadjusts EBITDA for stock-based compensation expense, transactional gains and losses, acquisition related costs, finance and other income, recovery on\nsettlement of contingent consideration, asset impairment charges, and the impact of unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts.\nAdjusted EBITDA (see Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations) for 2023 was\n($151.1) million, compared to ($132.6) million for 2022. The ($1 7.5) million increase in\nAdjusted EBITDA loss was driven primarily by the de crease in gross margin of ($ 8.5), the\nincrease in Cash Operating Costs of ($ 7.3) million, higher impairment loss on trade\nreceivables of ($1.4) million, and higher restructu ring expenses of ($1.0) million, partially\noffset and lower equity in loss of investment in joint venture and a ssociates of $1.5 million\nattributed to the operations of Weichai Ballard JV.\nNet Loss from Continuing Operations\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Yearended December 31,\n2023 2022 $ Change % Change\nNet lossfrom Continuing Operations $ (144,210) $ (160, 371) $ 16, 161 10%\nNet loss from continuing operations for 2023 was ( $144.2) million, or ($0. 48) per share,\ncompared to a net loss from continuing operations of ($160.4) million, or ($0.54) per share,\nin 2022. The $16.2 million decrease in net loss in 2023 was drivenp rimarily by higher finance\nand other income of $33.2 million due to primarily to increased investment income of $23.7\nmillion, improved mark to market and foreign exchange impacts of $4.0 million on our long-\nterm investments including Forsee Power , Wisdom, Quantron, and hydrogen infrastructure\nand growth equity funds, and by higher foreign exchange gains on net monetary assets of\n$5.4 million. These net loss improvements were partially offset b y the increase in Adjusted\nEBITDA loss of ($17.5) million.\nIn addition, operating margins, and costs in 2023 were also impacted by the positive impact\nof a weaker Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar, as compared to 2022. As a significant\namount of our net operating costs (primarily labour ) are denominated in Canadian dollars,\ngross margin, operating expenses, Adjusted EBITDA, and net loss are impacted by changes\nin the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. As the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S.\ndollar was approximately (4%), or (300) basis points, lower in 2023 as compared to 2022 ,\npositive foreign exchange impacts on our Canadian o perating margins and cost base were\napproximately $3.9 million. A $0.01 decrease in the Canadian dollar, r elative to the U.S.\ndollar, positively impacts annual operating margins and costs by approximately $1.3 million.\n34\nNet Loss from Discontinued Operations\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Yearended December 31,\n2023 2022 $ Change % Change\nRevenues $ 934 $ 1,926 $ (992) (52%)\nCost of goods sold 607 1,713 (1,106) (65%)\nGross margin 327 213 114 54%\nOperating expenses (7,913) (13,784) 5,871 43%\nFinance and other (income) loss 337 (4) 341 8525%\nImpairment charges on\n(2,266) (13,017) 10,751 83%\nintangible assets\nImpairment charges on goodwill (23,991) - (23,991) (100%)\nRecovery on settlement of\n- 9, 891 (9,891) ( 100%)\ncontingent consideration\nIncome tax recovery (expense) - 3,578 (3,578) (100%)\nNet loss from discontinued\n$ (33,506) $ ( 13,123) $ (20,383) ( 155%)\noperations\nNet loss from discontinued operations for 2023 was ($33.5) million, or ($0.11) per share,\ncompared to ($13.1) million, or ($0.04) per share, in 2022.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed a r estructuring of operations at Ballard\nMotive Solutions in the U.K. and effectively closed the operation.

Net loss in the fourth\nquarter of 2023, third quarter of 2023, second quarter of 2023, first quarter of 2023, the\nfourth quarter of 2022, the third quarter of 2022, the second quarter of 2022, and the\nfirst quarter of 2022 , was also impacted by mark to market gains (losses) on financial\nassets of ($10.3) million, ($2.5) million, $0.3 million, ($0.5) million, $2.9 million, $1.7\nmillion, ($12.9) million, and ($8.6) million , respectively, related primarily to our\ninvestments in Forsee Power, Wisdom, Quantron,and hydrogen infrastructure and growth\nequity funds.\n6. CASH FLOWS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n6.1 Summary of Cash Flows\nCash andcash equivalents were $751.1 million as ofDecember 31, 2023, compared to $913.7\nmillion as of December 31, 2022. The ($162.6) million decrease in cash andcash equivalents\nin 2023 was driven primarily by net cash operating losses (excluding non-cash items) of\n($87.5) million, net working capital outflows of ($17.1) million, purchases of property, plant\n42\nand equipment and intangible assets of ($41.4) million, subsequent milestone cash acquisition\ninvestment payments for Ballard Motive Solutions of ($2.0) mil lion, long-term net financial\ninvestments of ($ 10.9) million consisting of new investments in Quantron and hydrogen\ninfrastructure and growth equity funds, and by finance lease repayments of ($4.0) million.\n6.2 Cash Provided by (Used by) Operating Activities\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Three months ended December 31,\n2023 2022 $ Change\nCash Operating Loss $ ( 17,485) $ (22,956) $ 5, 472\nChange in Working Capital:\nTrade and other receivables ( 16,271) 654 (1 6,925)\nInventory 14, 986 (744) 15,730\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 3,522 (142) 3,664\nTrade and other payables (954) 4,9 82 (5,936)\nDeferred revenue (4,030) (2,677) (1,353)\nWarranty provision 1,893 (300) 2, 193\n(854) 1, 773 (2,627)\nCash Used by Operating Activities $ ( 18,339) $ (21,183) $ 2, 844\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2023, cash used by operating activities was\n($18.3) million, compared to ($21.2) million for the three months ended December 31, 2022.\n• The $2.8 million decrease in cash used by operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2023,\nas compared to the fourth quarter of 202 2, was driven by the relative decrease in cash\noperating losses of $5.5 million, partially offset by the increase in working capital\nrequirements of ($2.6) million.\nThe relative $5.5 million decrease in cash operating losses in the fourth quarter of 2023 was\n• driven primarily by the increase in Adjusted EBITDA loss of ($3.9) millionandby several items\nincluded in cash operating losses but excluded from Adjusted EBITDA loss or vice -versa\nincluding: lower loss from discontinued operations (excluding the impact of impairment\nrelated charges) of $3.5 million, higher impairment loss on trade receivables of $1.4 million,\n•\nhigher inventory impairment and onerous contracts p rovisions adjustment of $6.6 million,\nhigher restructuringexpenses of $0.2 million,l owerfinance and other income (excluding mark\nto market fair value changes on investments) of( $0.6) million, lowerequity investment losses\nin joint venture and associates of ($2.4) million.\nThe total change in working capital of ($0.9) million in the fourth quarter of 2023 was driven\nby lower inventory of $15.0 million due primarily to higher product shipments in the period,\nlower prepaid expenses of $3.5 million primarily du e to the timing of annual insurance\nrenewals, and by higher warranty provisions of $1.9 million. These fourth quarter of 2023\ninflows were partially offset by higher accounts and contract receivables of ($16.3) millio n\nprimarily due to the timing of revenues and the rel ated customer collections , and lower\ndeferred revenue of ($4.0) million as pre-payments on certain product and service contracts\nwere recognized.\nThe total change in working capital of $1.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 was driven\nby higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $5.0 million primarily due to the timing\n43\nof supplier payments, by lower accounts and contrac t receivables of $0.7 million primarily\ndue to the timing of revenues and the related custo mer collections. These fourth quarter of\n2022 inflows were partially offset by lower deferred revenue of ($2.7) mlilion as pre-payments\non certain product and service contracts were recog nized, and higher inventory of ($0.7)\nmillion.\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Yearended December 31,\n2023 2022 $ Change\nCash Operating Loss $ ( 87,484) $ (114,230) $ 26,747\nChange in Working Capital:\nTrade and other receivables ( 12,913) (2,945) (9,968)\nInventory (898) ( 11,145) 10, 247\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 76 (1,668) 1,744\nTrade and other payables ( 3,580) (718) ( 2,862)\nDeferred revenue (3,442) (4,079) 637\nWarranty provision 3,671 2,614 1,057\n( 17,086) (17,941) 855\nCash Used by Operating Activities $ ( 104,570) $ (132,171) $ 27, 602\nFor the yearended December 31, 2023, cash used by operating activities was ($104.6) million\ncompared to ($132.2) million for 2022. The $27.6 million decrease in cash used by operating\nactivities in 2023, as compared to 2022, was driven by the relative decrease in cash operating\nlosses of $26.7 million, and by the relative decrease in working capital requirements of $0.9\nmillion.\nThe relative $26.7 million decrease in cash operating losses in 2023 was driven primarily by\nthe increase in Adjusted EBITDA loss of ($17.5) millionwhich was more than offset by several\nitems included in cash operating losses but excluded from Adjusted EBITDA loss or vice-versa\nincluding: lower loss from discontinued operations (excluding the impact of impairment\nrelated charges) of $3.3 million higher finance and other income (excluding mark to market\nfair value changes on investments) of $ 29.1 million, lower equity investment losses in joint\nventure and associates of ($1.5) million, higher impairment of trade receivables of $1. 5\nmillion, higher inventory impairment and onerous contracts provisions adjustment of $7.5\nmillion, higher restructuring expenses of $1.0 million, and lower acquisition related costs of\n$2.1 million.\nThe total change in working capital of ($17.1) million in 2023 was driven by higher accounts\nand contract receivables of ($12.9) million primari ly due to the timing of revenues and the\nrelated customer collections, lower accounts payable and accrued liabilities of ( $3.6) million\nprimarily as a result of the timing of supplier pay ments and annual compensation awards,\nlower deferred revenue of ($3.4) million as pre-payments on certain product and service\ncontracts were recognized, and higher inventory of ($0.9) million. These 2023 outflows were\npartially offset by higher warranty provisions of $3.7 million.\nThe total change in working capital of ($17.9) million in 2022was driven by higher inventory\nof ($11.1) million primarily to support expected product shipments in 2023 and to help\nmitigate ongoing supply chain disruptions, by lower deferred revenue of ($4.1) million as pre-\npayments on certain product and service contracts were recognized, by higher accounts and\n44\ncontract receivables of ($2.9) million primarily as a result of the timing of revenues and the\nrelated customer collections, and by higher prepaid expenses of ($1.7) million primarily due\nto the timing of annual insurance renewals. These 2 022 outflows were partially offset by\nhigher warranty provisions of $2.6 million.\n6.3 Cash Provided by (Used by) Investing Activities\nInvesting activities resulted in net cash outflows of ($10.8) million and ($ 54.3) million,\nrespectively, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, compared to net cash\noutflows of ($20.1) million and ($75.6) million, respectively, for the corresponding periods of\n2022.\nInvesting activities in the fourth quarter of 202 3 of ($ 10.8) million consist of capital\nexpenditures of ($ 7.4) million incurred primarily for production and tes t equipment and\ncertain intangible assets, and additional long-term investments in the HyCap and Clean H2\nhydrogen infrastructure and growth equity funds of ($3.5) million.\nInvesting activities in the fourth quarter of 2022 of ($20.1) million consist of additional long-\nterm investments in Quantron of ($5.2) million and in certain hydrogen infrastructure and\ngrowth equity funds of ($0.1) million, and by capital expenditures of ($14.8) million incurred\nprimarily for production and test equipment and certain intangible assets.\nInvesting activities in 2023 of ($54.3) million consist of capital expenditures of ($41.4) million\nincurred primarily for production and test equipment and certain intangible assets, additional\nlong-term investments in Quantron of ($3.3) million, additional investment in the HyCap and\nClean H2 hydrogen infrastructure and growth equity funds of ($8.6) million, and subsequent\nmilestone attainment cash acquisition investment inB allard Motive Solutionsof ($2.0) million.\nThese 2023 cash outflows were partially offset by a recovery of contributions in our long-term\ninvestment in Wisdom of $1.0 million.\nInvesting activities in 2022 of ($75.6) million con sist of additional long-term investments in\nQuantron, Wisdom, and in certain hydrogen infrastructure and growth equity funds of ($17.9)\nmillion, subsequent Milestone cash acquisition inve stment payments for Ballard Motive\nSolutions of ($14.9) million, investments in associ ated companies of ($9.3) million for the\ntwelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth and final contra cted equity contributions in our 49%\ninvestment in Weichai Ballard JV, and by capital ex penditures of ($34.5) million incurred\nprimarily for production and test equipment and certain intangible assets, partially offset by\nproceeds received on the sale of short-term investments of $1.0 million.\n6.4 Cash Provided by (Used by) Financing Activities\nFinancing activities resulted in net cash outflows of ($1.1) million and ($ 3.7) million,\nrespectively, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, compared to net cash\noutflows of ($0.8) million and ($2.4) million, respectively, for the corresponding period s of\n2022.\nFinancing activities in the fourth quarter of 2023 of ($1.1) million consist of finance lease\npayments of ($1.2) million, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of share purchase\noptions of $0.1 million.

Financing activities in 2022 of ($2.4) million cons ist of finance lease payments of\n($3.3) million, partially offset by proceeds from hte exercise of share purchase options of $0.9\nmillion.\n6.5 Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had total liquidity of $753.2 million. We measure liquidity as\nour net cash and short -term investment position, consisting of the sum of our cash, cash\nequivalents and short-term investments of $753.2 million, as we have no bank debt.\nWe have a Letter of Guarantee Facility (the “LG Facility”) enabling our bank to issue letters\nof guarantees, standby letters of credit, performan ce bonds, counter guarantees, counter\nstandby letter of credit or similar credits on our behalf to from time to time up to a maximum\nof $2.0 million. As of December 31, 2023, issued letters of credit of euro 1.0 million were\noutstanding under the LG Facility. We also have a $25 million Foreign Exchange Facility (the\n“FX Facility”) enabling us to enter into foreign ex change currency contracts (at face value\namounts in excess of the FX Facility) secured by a guarantee from Export Development\nCanada. As of December 31, 2023, we had outstanding foreign exchange currency contracts\nto purchase a total of Canadian $31.5 million under the FX Facility.\nOur liquidity objective is to maintain cash balances sufficient to fund at least six quarters of\nforecasted cash used by operating activities and contractual commitments. Our strategy to\nattain this objective is to continue our drive to attain profitable operations that are sustainable\nby executing a business plan that continues to focu s on Fuel Cell Products and Services\nrevenue growth, improving overall gross margins, maintaining discipline over Cash Operating\nCosts, managing working capital and capital expend iture requirements, and securing\nadditional financing to fund our operations as needed until we do achieve profitable operations\nthat are sustainable. We believe that we have adequate liquidity in cash and working capital\nto achieve our liquidity objective.\nFailure to achieve or maintain this liquidity objective could have a material adverse effect on\nour financial condition and results of operations i ncluding our ability to continue as a going\nconcern. There are also various risks and uncertain ties affecting our ability to achieve this\nliquidity objective including, but not limited to, t he market acceptance and rate of\ncommercialization of our products, the ability to successfully execute our business plan, and\ngeneral global economic conditions, certain of w hich are beyond our control. While we\ncontinue to make significant investments in product development and market development\nactivities necessary to commercialize our products, make increased investments in working\ncapital and capital expenditures as we grow our business, and make ongoing capital\ncontributions in support of our investment in cert ain hydrogen infrastructure and growth\nequity funds, our actual liquidity requirements will also vary an d will be impacted by future\nacquisitions and strategic partnerships and investm ents, our relationships with our lead\ncustomers and strategic partners including their ability to successfully finance and fund their\noperations and programs and agreements with us, our success in developing new channels\nto market and relationships with customers, our success in generating revenue growth from\nnear-term product, serviceand licensingopportunities, our success in managing our operating\nexpense and working capital requirements, foreign e xchange fluctuations, and the progress\n46\nand results of our research, development and demonstration programs.\nWe may also choose to pursue additional liquidity thro ugh the issuance of debt or equity in\nprivate or public market financings. To enable the timely issuance of equity securities in the\npublic market, we renewed our Base Shelf Prospectus on file with the securities regulators in\nCanada on May 9, 2023. The Base Shelf Prospectus, which is effective for 25-months ending\nin June 2025, was filed in each of the provinces and territorieso f Canada, and a corresponding\nshelf registration statement on Form F-10 wasalso filed with the United States Securities and\nExchange Commission. These filings will enable offerings of securities at any time during the\n25-month period that the Base Shelf Prospectus remains effective. No offerings of securities\nunder this Base Shelf Prospectus have been issued to date.\nNo assurance can be given that any such additional liquidity will be availabl e or that, if\navailable, it can be obtained onterms favorable to the Company. If any securities are offered\nunder theBase Shelf Prospectus, the terms of any such securities and the intended use of the\nnet proceeds resulting from such offering would bee stablished at the time of any offering and\nwould be described in a supplement to the Base Shelf Prospectus filed with applicable\nCanadian securities regulators and/or the SEC, respectively, at the time of such an offering.\n7.

ACCOUNTING MATTERS\n9.1 Overview\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS, which require us\nto make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from\nthose estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptio ns are reviewed on an ongoing basis .\nRevisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the perio d in which the estimates are\nrevised and in any future periods affected.\n9.2 Critical Judgments in Applying Accounting Policies\nCritical judgments that we have made in the process of applying our accounting policies and\nthat have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial\nstatements is limited to our assessment of our ability to continue as a going concern (See\nNote 2 (e) to our annual consolidated financial statements).\nOur material accounting policies are detailed in note 4 to our a nnual consolidated financial\nstatements for the year ended December 31, 2023. Effective January 1, 2023, we adopted a\nnumber of new standards and interpretations, but they did not have a material impact on our\nfinancial statements.\n9.3 Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty\nThe following are key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation\nuncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the reported\n51\namount of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses within the next financial year.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nRevenues are generat ed primarily from product sales , the license and sale of intellectual\nproperty and fundamental knowledge , and the provision of engineering services and •\ntechnology transfer services. Product revenues are derived primarily from standard product\nsales contrac ts and from long -term fixed price contracts. Intellectual property and\nfundamental knowledge license revenues are derived primarily from standard licensing and\n•\ntechnology transfer agreements. Engineering s ervice and technology transfer service\nrevenues are derived primarily from cost -plus reimbursable con tracts and from long -term\nfixed price contracts.\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of the goods or services. Determining\nthe timing of the transfer of control, at a point in time or over time, requires judgment.\nOn standard product sales contracts, revenues are recognized when customers obtain control\nof the product, which is when transfer of title and risks and rewards of own ership of goods\nhave passed, and when obligation to pay is considered certain. Invoices are generated and\nrevenue is recognized at that point in time. Provisions for warranties are made at the time of\nsale. Revenue recognition for standard product sales cont racts does not usually involve\nsignificant estimates.\nOn standard licensing and technology transfer agree ments, revenues are recognized on the\ntransfer of rights to a licensee, when it is determin ed to be distinct from other performance\nobligations, and if the customer can direct the use of, and obtain s ubstantially all of the\nremaining benefits from the license as it exists at the time of transfer. In other cases, the\nproceeds are considered to relate to the right to use the asset over the license period and the\nrevenue is recognized over that period. If it is determined that the license is not distinct from\nother performance obligations, revenue is recognize d over time as the customer\nsimultaneously receives and consumes the benefit. Revenue recognition for standard license\nand sale agreements does not usually involve significant estimates.\nOn cost-plus reimbursable contracts, revenues are recognize d as costs are incurred, and\ninclude applicable fees earned as services are prov ided. Revenue recognition for cost -plus\nreimbursable contracts does not usually involve significant estimates.\nOn long-term fixed price contracts, the customer controls a ll of the work in progress as the\nservices are being provided. This is because under these contracts, the deliverables are made\nto a customer’s specification , and if a contract is terminated by the customer, th en the\nCompany is entitled to reimbursement of the costs incurred to date plus the applicable gross\nmargin. Therefore, revenue from these contracts and the associated costs are recognized as\nthe costs are incurred over time. On long-term fixed price contracts, revenues are recognized\nover time using cumulative costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at\ncompletion to measure progress towards satisfying p erformance obligations. Generally,\nrevenue is recognized by multiplying the expected c onsideration by the ratio of cumulative\ncosts incurred to date to the sum of incurred and est imated costs for completing the\nperformance obligation. The cumulative effect of changes to estimated revenues and\nestimated costs for completing a contract are recognized in the period in which the revisions\nare identified. If the estimated costs for completing the contract exc eed the expected\n52\nrevenues on a contract, such loss is recognized in its entirety in the period it becomes known.\nDeferred revenue (i.e., contract liabilities) represents cash received from customers in excess\nof revenue recognized on uncompleted contracts.\n• The determination of expected costs for completing a contract is based on estimates that\ncan be affected by a variety of factors such as variances in the timeline to completion, the\ncost of materials, the availability and cost of labour, as well as productivity.\n• The determination of potential revenues includes th e contractually agreed amount and\nmay be adjusted based on the estimate of our attain ment on achieving certain defined\ncontractual milestones. Management’s estimation is required in determining the amount\nof consideration for which the Company expects to be entitled and in determining when a\nperformance obligation has been met.\nEstimates used to determine revenues and costs of l ong-term fixed price contracts involve\nuncertainties that ultimately depend on the outcome of future events and are periodically\nrevised as projects progress. There is a risk that a customer may ultimately disagree with\nmanagement’sassessment of the progress achieved against milestones, or that our estimates\nof the work required to complete a contract may change.\nDuring the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, and 202 2, there were no\nsignificant adjustments to revenues relating to revenue recognized in a prior period.\nASSET IMPAIRMENT\nThe carrying amounts of our non-financial assets other than inventories are reviewed at each\nreporting date to determine whether there is any in dication of impairment. If any such\nindication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amo unt is estimated. For goodwill and\nintangible assets that have indefinite useful lives , the recoverable amount is estimated\nannually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be\nrecoverable.\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use\nand its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows\nare discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market\nassessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In assessing fair\nvalue less costs to sell, the price that would be received on the sale of an asset in an orderly\ntransaction between market parti cipants at the measurement date is estimated. For t he\npurposes of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped\ntogether into the smallest group of assets that gen erates cash inflows from continuing use\nthat are largely independent of the cash inflows of other groups of assets. The allocation of\ngoodwill to cash-generating units reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for\ninternal reporting purposes. Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the\ncontrol of management and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change\nfrom period to period. These changes may result in future impairments. For example, our\nrevenue growth rate could be lower than projected due to economic, industry or competitive\nfactors, or the discount rate used in our value in use model could increase due to achange in\nmarket interest rates. In addition, future goodwill impairment charges may be necessary if\nour market capitalization declinesdue to a decreasein the trading price of our common stock,\nwhich could negatively impact the fair value of our business.\n53\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying am ount of an asset or its cash -generating\nunit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in net loss.\nImpairment losses recognized in respect of the cash -generating units are allocated first to\nreduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocate d to the units, and then to reduce the\ncarrying amounts of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.\nAn impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not re versed. In respect of other assets,\nimpairment losses recognized in prior periods are a ssessed at each reporting date for any\nindications that the cumulative loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is\nreversed only to the extent that the asset’s carryi ng amount does not exceed the carrying\namount that would have been determined, net of depr eciation or amortization, if no\nimpairment loss had been recognized.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our consolidated goodwill balance of $40.3 million relates solely to\nour Fuel Cell Products and Services segment. We perform the annual review of goodwill as at\nDecember 31 of each year, more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it\nmight be impaired. Under IFRS, the annual r eview of goodwill requires a comparison of the\ncarrying value of the asset to the higher of (i) va lue in use; and (ii) fair value less costs to\nsell. Value in use is defined as the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived\nfrom the asset in its current state. Our fair value less costs to sell test is in effect a modified\nmarket capitalization assessment, whereby we calcualte the fair value of the Fuel Cell Products\nand Services segment by first calculating the value of the Company at December 31, 202 3\nbased on the average closing share price in the mon th of December, add a reasonable\nestimated control premium to determine the Company’ s enterprise value on a controlling\nbasis after adjusting for excess cash balances, deducting the fair value of long-term financial\ninvestments, and then deducting the estimated costs to sell from this enterprise value to\narrive at the fair value of the Fuel Cell Products and Services segment. As a r esult of this\nassessment, we have determined that the fair value of the Fuel Cell Products and Services\nsegment exceeds its carrying value as of December 3 1, 2023, indicating that no goodwill\nimpairment charge is required for 2023.\nIn addition to the above goodwill impairment test, we perform a quarterly assessment of the\ncarrying amounts of our non-financial assets (other than inventories) to determ ine whether\nthere is any indication of impairment. During the three months and year ended December 31,\n2023, impairment charges of ($1.0) million were recognzied on our non-financial assets (other\nthan inventories) related to impaired property, plant and equipment in China as we have\ndecided to suspend our previously announced MEA localization plan in China.\nWARRANTY PROVISION\nA provision for warranty costs is recorded on produ ct sales at the time of shipment. In\nestablishing the accrued warranty liabilities, we estimate the likelihood that products sold will\nexperience warranty claims and the cost to resolve claims received.\nIn making such determinations, we use estimates bas ed on the nature of the contract and\npast and projected experience with the products. Sh ould these estimates prove to be\nincorrect, we may incur costs different from those provided for in our warranty prov isions.\nDuring the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded provisions to\naccrued warranty liabilities of $2.5 million and $6.0 million, respectively, for new product\n54\nsales, compared to $0.9 million and $4.6 million, respectively, for the three months and year\nended December 31, 2022.\nWe review our warranty assumptions and make adjustm ents to accrued warranty liabilities\nquarterly based on the latest information available and to reflect the expiry of contractual\nobligations. Adjustments to accrued warranty liabil ities are recorded in co st of product and\nservice revenues. As a result of these reviews and the resulting adju stments, our warranty\nprovision and cost of revenues for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023,\nwere adjusted downwards ( upwards) by $0.3 million and ($0.4) million, respectively,\ncompared to adjustments of$0.5 millionand ($0.4) million, respectively, for the three months\nand year ended December 31, 2022.\nINVENTORY AND ONEROUS CONTRACT PROVISIONS\nIn determining the lower of cost and net realizable value of our inventory and establishing\nthe appropriate provision for inventory obsolescenc e, we estimate the likelihood that\ninventory carrying values will be affected by chang es in market pricing or demand for our\nproducts and by changes in technology or design whi ch could make inventory on hand\nobsolete or recoverable at less than cost. We perform regular reviews to assess the impact of\nchanges in technology and design, sales trends, and other changes on the carrying value of\ninventory. Where we determine that such changes hav e occurred and will have a negative\nimpact on the value of inventory on hand, appropria te provisions are made. If there is a\nsubsequent increase in the value of inventory on hand, reversals of previous write-downs to\nnet realizable value are made. Unforeseen changes in these factors could result in additional\ninventory provisions, or reversals of previous provisions, being required.\nA provision for onerous contracts is also assessed and measured at the present value of the\nlower of the expected cost of terminating the contarct and the expected net cost of continuing\nwith the contract, which is determined based on the incremental costs of fulfilling the\nobligation under the contract and an allocation of other costs directly related to fulfilling the\ncontract. Before an onerous contract provision is e stablished, we recognize any impairment\nloss on the assets (including through an inventory provision) associated with that contract.\nDuring the threemonths and year ended December 31, 2023, negative inventory impairment\nand onerous contract provision adjustments of ($ 10.7) million and ($ 15.0) million,\nrespectively, were recorded as a charge to cost of product and se rvice revenues, compared\nto negative inventory impairment and onerous contract provision adjustments of ($4.1)\nmillion and ($7.5) million, respectively, in the three months and year ended December 31,\n2022.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (INCLUDING INVESTMENTS)\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in\nan orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal\nor, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Company has access at that\ndate.The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.A number of the Company’s\naccounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial\nand non-financial assets and liabilities.\nWhen one is available, the Company measures the fair value of an instrument using the\nquoted price in an active market for that instrumen t. A market is regarded as “active” if\n55\ntransactions for the asset or liability take placew ith sufficient frequency and volume to provide\npricing information on an ongoing basis. If there is no quoted price in an active market, then\nthe Company uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of relevant observable inputs\nand minimize the use of unobservable inputs. This involves developing estimates and\nassumptions consistent with how market participants would price the instrument.\nManagement bases its assumptions on observable data as far as possible, but this is not\nalways available. In that case, management uses the best information available. Where they\nare available, the fair value of investments is bas ed on observable market\n•\ntransactions. Estimated fair values may vary from the actual prices that would be achieved in\nan arm’s length transaction at the reporting date.\n•\nThe best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument (including investments) on initial\nrecognition is usually the transaction price – i.e., the fair value of the consideration given or\nreceived. If the Company determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the\ntransaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market\nfor an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique for which any\nunobservable inputs are judged to be insignificant in relation to the measurement, then the\nfinancial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference\nbetween the fair value on initial recognition and t he transaction price. Subsequently, that\ndifference is recognized in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over thel ife of the instrument\nbut no later than when the valuation is wholly supp orted by observable data, or the\ntransaction is closed out. During the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, we\nrecognized mark to market gain (loss) on financial assets of ($10.3) million and ($12.9)\nmillion, respectively, compared to $2.9 million and ($16.9) million, respectively, for the three\nmonths and year ended December 31, 2022. Mark to market gain (loss) in 2023 and 2022\nconsist primarily of changes in the fair value of our long-term financial investments including\nForsee Power, Wisdom, Quantron, and in our HyCap and Clean H2 hydrogen infrastructure\nand growth equity funds.\n9.4 Recently Adopted Accounting Policy Changes\nEffective January 1, 2023, we adopted a number of new standards and interpretations, but\nthey did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\n9.5 Future Accounting Policy Changes\nThe following is an overview of accounting standard changes that we will be required to adopt\nin future years. We do not expect to adopt any of these standards before their effective dates\nand we continue to evaluate the impact of these sta ndards on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nClassification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1)\nOn January 23, 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial\nStatements (the “2020 Amendments”), to clarify the classification of liabilities as cur rent or\nnon-current. On October 31, 2022, the IASB issued Non-current Liabilities with Covenants\n(Amendments to IAS 1) (the “2022 Amendments”), to improve the information a company\nprovides about long-term debt with covenants.\nFor the purposes of non -current classification, the 2020 Amendments and the 2022\nAmendments (collectively “the Amendments”) removed the requirement for a right to defer\n56\nsettlement or roll over of a liability for at least twelve months to be unconditional. Instead,\nsuch a right must exist at the end of the reporting period and have substance.\nThe Amendments reconfirmed that only covenants with which a company must comply on or\nbefore the reporting date affect the classification of a liability as current or non -current.\nCovenants with which a company must comply after th e reporting date do not affect a\nliability’s classification at that date. The Amendments also clarify how a company classifies a\nliability that includes a counterparty conversion option. The Amendments state that:\n• settlement of a liability includes transferring a company’s own equity instruments to the\ncounterparty, and\n• when classifying liabilities as current or non -current a company can ignore only those\nconversion options that are recognized as equity.\nThe Amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. The\nadoption of the amendments to IAS 1 are not expected to have a material impact on the\nCompany’s financial statements.\n10. SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS\n10.1 Overview\nIn addition to providing measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, we present certain\nsupplemental non-GAAP measures. These measures are Cash Operating Co sts (including its\ncomponents of research and p roduct development (operating cost), g eneral and\nadministrative (operating cost) and s ales and marketing (operating cost)) , EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA. These non -GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning\nprescribed by GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures\npresented by other companies. We believe these meas ures are useful in evaluating t he\noperating performance of the Company’s ongoing busi ness. These measures should be\nconsidered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, operating expenses, net income, cash\nflows and other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with\nGAAP. The calculation of these non-GAAP measures has been made on a consistent basis for\nall periods presented.\n10.2 Cash Operating Costs\nThis supplemental non -GAAP measure is provided to assist readers in deter mining our\noperating costs on a n ongoing cash basis. We believe this measure is useful in as sessing\nperformance and highlighting trends on an overall basis.\nWe also believe Cash Operating Costs is frequently used by securities analysts and investors\nwhen comparing our results with those of other companies. Cash Operating Costs differs from\nthe most comparable GAAP measure, total operating expenses, primarily because it does not\ninclude stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortziation, impairment losses\nor recoveries on trade receivables, restructuring and related costs, acquisition related costs,\nthe impact of unrealized gains and losses on forei gn exchange contracts, and financing\ncharges. The following tables show a reconciliation of total operating expenses to Cash\nOperating Costs for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, and 2022:\n57\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Three months ended December 31,\nCash Operating Costs 2023 2022 $ Change\nTotal Operating Expenses $ 34,972 $ 30,099 $ 4,873\nStock-based compensation expense ( 2,575) (1,367) ( 1,208)\nImpairment recovery (losses) on trade\n( 1,436) (73) ( 1,363)\nreceivables\nAcquisition related costs 3 (106) 109\nRestructuring and related (costs) recovery (322) (137) (1 85)\nImpact of unrealized gains (losses) on foreign\n696 1,057 (361)\nexchange contracts\nDepreciation and amortization (2,388) (435) ( 1,953)\nCash Operating Costs $ 28,950 $ 29,038 $ (88)\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Yearended December 31,\nCash Operating Costs 2023 2022 $ Change\nTotal Operating Expenses $ 14 1,073 $ 132,022 $ 9, 053\nStock-based compensation expense ( 10,720) ( 8,939) ( 1,781)\nImpairment recovery (losses) on trade\n( 1,498) (73) ( 1,425)\nreceivables\nAcquisition related costs (773) (2,857) 2,084\nRestructuring and related (costs) recovery (1,512) (482) ( 1,030)\nImpact of unrealized gains (losses) on foreign\n1,296 (862) 2,158\nexchange contracts\nDepreciation and amortization ( 8,539) ( 6,815) (1,724)\nCash Operating Costs $ 119,327 $ 111,992 $ 7,335\nThe components of Cash Operating Costs of research and product development (cash\noperating cost), general and administrative (cash o perating cost), and sales and marketing\n(cash operating cost) differ from their respective most comparable GAAP measure of research\nand product development expense, g eneral and administrative expense, and sales and\nmarketing expense, primarily because they do not in clude stock -based compensation\nexpense, depreciation and amortization expense, and acquisit ion related costs . A\nreconciliation of these respective operating expenses to the respective components of Cash\nOperating Costs for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 is\nincluded in Section 5.4 Operating Expenses and Other Items.\nA breakdown of total stock-based compensation expense for the three monthsa nd year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, and 2022 are as follows:\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Three months ended December 31,\nStock-based compensation expense 2023 2022 $ Change\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\nrecorded as follows:\nCost of goods sold $ - $ - $ -\nResearch and product development expense 1,290 938 352\nGeneral and administrative expense 949 229 7 20\nSales and marketing expense (recovery) 336 200 136\nStock-based compensation expense $ 2,575 $ 1,367 $ 1,208\n58\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Yearended December 31,\nStock-based compensation expense 2023 2022 $ Change\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\nrecorded as follows:\nCost of goods sold $ - $ - $ -\nResearch and product development expense 5,520 5,015 505\nGeneral and administrative expense 3,660 2,736 924\nSales and marketing expense (recovery) 1,540 1,188 352\nStock-based compensation expense $ 10,720 $ 8,939 $ 1,781\nA breakdown of total depreciation and amortization expense for the three months and year\nended December 31, 2023, and 2022 are as follows:\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Three months ended December 31,\nDepreciation and amortization expense 2023 2022 $ Change\nTotal depreciation and amortization expense\nrecorded as follows:\nCost of goods sold $ 1,136 $ 1,966 $ (830)\nResearch and product development expense 1,832 (18) 1 ,850\nGeneral and administrative expense 556 449 107\nSales and marketing expense - 4 (4)\nDepreciation and amortization expense $ 3,524 $ 2,401 $ 1,123\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Yearended December 31,\nDepreciation and amortization expense 2023 2022 $ Change\nTotal depreciation and amortization expense\nrecorded as follows:\nCost of goods sold $ 4,211 $ 4,837 $ ( 626)\nResearch and product development expense 6,538 4,894 1,644\nGeneral and administrative expense 1,997 1,915 82\nSales and marketing expense 4 6 (2)\nDepreciation and amortization expense $ 12,750 $ 11,652 $ ( 1,098)\n10.3 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nThese supplemental non-GAAP measures are provided to assist readers in det ermining our\noperating performance.

We also be lieve EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are\nfrequently used by securities analysts and investor s when comparing our results with those\nof other companies. EBITDA differs from the most comparable GAAP measure, net loss from\ncontinuing operations, primarily because it does not include finance expense, income taxes,\ndepreciationof property, plant and equipment,a nd amortization of intangible assets. Adjusted\nEBITDA adjusts EBITDA for stock -based compensation expense, transactional gains and\nlosses, acquisition related costs, finance and other income , recovery on settlement of\ncontingent consideration, asset impairment charges, and the impact of unrealized gains and\nlosses on foreign exchange contracts.

Revisions to accounting\nestimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.\nSignificant areas having estimation uncertainty include revenue recognition, asset impairment, goodwill,\nwarranty provision, inventory and onerous contract provision, and fair value measurement (including long-\nterm financial investments and goodwill). These assumptions are unchanged in these condensed\nconsolidated interim financial statements and are the same as those applied in the Corporation’s\nconsolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2023. However, in the current\nenvironment, certain of these estimation uncertainty risks have increased in magnitude, primarily fair value\nmeasurement of goodwill.\n(e) Future operations:\nThe Corporation is required to assess its ability to continue as a going concern or whether substantial doubt\nexists as to the Corporation’s ability to continue as a going concern into the foreseeable future. The\nCorporation has forecast its cash flows for the foreseeable future and despite the ongoing volatility and\nuncertainties inherent in the business, the Corporation believes it has adequate liquidity in cash and\nworking capital to achieve its liquidity objective. The Corporation’s ability to continue as a going concern and\nrealize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business is\ndependent upon the Corporation having adequate liquidity and achieving profitable operations that are\nsustainable.\nThe Corporation’s strategy to mitigate this uncertainty is to continue its drive to attain profitable operations\nthat are sustainable by executing a business plan that continues to focus on revenue growth, improving\noverall gross margins, maintaining discipline over cash operating expenses, managing working capital and\ncapital expenditure requirements, and securing additional financing to fund operations as needed until the\nCorporation does achieve profitable operations that are sustainable. Failure to implement this plan could\nhave a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s financial condition and or results of operations.\n3. Material accounting policies:\nEffective January 1, 2024, the Corporation adopted a number of new standards and interpretation, but they\ndid not have a material impact on the Corporation's condensed consolidated interim financial statements.\nThe accounting policies in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are the same as\nthose applied in the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\n4. Critical judgments in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty:\nCritical judgments in applying accounting policies:\nCritical judgments that management has made in the process of applying the Corporation’s accounting\npolicies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements are limited to management’s assessment of the Corporation’s ability to continue as a\ngoing concern (note 2(e)).\n7\nBALLARD POWER SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nUnaudited\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except number of shares)\n4. Critical judgments in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n(cont'd):\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty:\nKey assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty that have significant\nrisk of resulting in a material adjustment to the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses\nwithin the next fiscal year include the following: revenue recognition, asset impairment, goodwill, inventory\nand onerous contracts provision, and fair value measurement (including long-term financial investments and\ngoodwill). These assumptions are unchanged in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements\nand are the same as those applied in the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements as at and for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023. However, in the current environment, certain of these estimation\nuncertainty risks have increased in magnitude, primarily fair value measurement of goodwill.\n5.

The order supports Caltrans’ purchase of 10 FLIRT H2 trains, with an option for an additional 19 trains, to strengthen the state’s zero-emission passenger rail capabilities.\n\n‘We are thrilled to deepen our partnership with Stadler and support their work with Caltrans to decarbonize commuter rail transportation in California,” said Randy MacEwen, Ballard CEO. “This order grows our footprint in the rail market and validates the value proposition for Ballard fuel cell engines to power passenger rail in regions lacking catenary wire infrastructure. Fuel cells offer a zero-emission replacement for diesel engines, with comparable payload, range, reliability, and refueling times,” Mr. MacEwen concluded.\n\nMartin Ritter, CEO of Stadler US commented, “Stadler is looking forward to working with Ballard and Caltrans to provide leading zero-emission trains to California and support the advancement of their zero-emission goals. The FLIRT H2 train can replace diesel trains on non-electrified or partially electrified lines for emission-free passenger transport avoiding the investment in costly overhead catenary lines electrification would otherwise require.”\n\n**About Ballard Power Systems**\n\nBallard Power Systems’ (NASDAQ: BLDP; TSX: BLDP) vision is to deliver fuel cell power for a sustainable planet. Ballard zero-emission PEM fuel cells are enabling electrification of mobility, including buses, commercial trucks, trains, marine vessels, and stationary power.

All amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted and have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\n\n“We had a tough quarter, marked by weak revenue, strained gross margin, soft new order intake, adverse order book adjustments, a restructuring charge of $16.1 million, and non-cash impairments totaling approximately $147.0 million,” stated Randy MacEwen, Ballard’s President & CEO. “We have taken difficult but important actions to better align our spending with a multi-year push-out in market adoption of hydrogen and PEM fuel cells.”\n\nMr. MacEwen continued, “In Q3, we initiated a global corporate restructuring to reduce total annualized operating costs by more than 30%. We expect a substantial part of the annualized cost savings to be realized in 2025. Our restructuring includes a sizeable workforce reduction, rationalization of product development programs, consolidation of global operations and facilities, and a reduction in planned capital expenditures. As part of our global restructuring, we also reduced our corporate cost structure in China and initiated a strategic review of our China joint venture.”\n\nMr. MacEwen further commented, “We have successfully repositioned our Texas gigafactory expansion program to an optionality plan, where we will defer our final investment decision to 2026 pending clear market adoption and demand indicators, while still preserving over $94 million of awarded government funding. With no material capital investments planned during this optionality period, we will reassess the underlying business case in 2026.”\n\n“With the backdrop of a challenging industry context, we had soft revenue and new order intake performance in Q3. We also\n\nremoved previously booked orders valued at $39.2 million from our Order Backlog relating to certain high-risk markets and customers, including in China. Notwithstanding these challenges, Bus continues to be a notable bright spot, with Q3 revenue up 33% year-over-year. We remain encouraged with our continued customer progress in the Bus, Rail and Stationary markets in Europe and North America. Indeed, given current customer engagement in these markets, we expect a pick-up in new order intake in Q4, including from our recently announced supply agreement with New Flyer for 20 MW of fuel cell engines for the North American bus market.”\n\n“As we look to our long-term strategic plan and cascading capital allocation, we continue to have high conviction on hydrogen and PEM fuel cells playing an important role in decarbonizing select heavy mobility and stationary power applications. We see compelling use cases where customers are attracted to the differentiated PEM fuel cell value proposition of long range, fast refueling, heavy payload, and zero emissions. Our focus is on our customers and our controllables, including the development of next-generation, low-cost fuel cell products, while maintaining disciplined spending and balance sheet strength for long-term competitiveness and sustainability,” concluded Mr. MacEwen.\n\n**Q3 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n_(all comparisons are to Q3 2023 unless otherwise noted)_\n\n  * Total revenue of $14.8 million in the quarter was down 45% year-over-year due to slowing customer demand, reflective of a push-out in the adoption curve for hydrogen and PEM fuel cells.\n  * Heavy Duty Mobility revenue of $12.8 million was down 38%, driven by lower revenues from Rail, Truck, and Marine verticals and partially offset by Bus revenues of $11.2 million, which were up 33% year-over-year.\n  * Stationary revenue of $0.5 million decreased 82%.\n  * Emerging and Other Markets revenue of $1.4 million was down 60%\n  * Gross margin was (56%) in the quarter 45 points lower year-over-year as a result of lower revenue, revenue mix, and onerous contracts and inventory provisions.\n\n\n  * Total Operating Expenses were $54.9 million in the quarter, an increase of $20.2 million or 58% year-over-year, primarily driven by a restructuring charge of $16.1 million and a $7.9 million impairment of certain trade receivables. Cash Operating Costs1 were $28.0 million, a decrease of (3%).\n  * Net loss from continuing operations was ($204.5) million, or ($0.68) per share, which includes $40.3 million of non-cash impairment charges on goodwill and $106.8 million of property, plant, and equipment impairment. Excluding goodwill and other impairments, a Net Loss of ($57.5) million, or ($0.19) per share was recorded in the quarter compared to ($34.7) million, or ($0.12) per share, in the prior year period.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA1 was approximately ($60.1) million, compared to ($34.9) million, a change of (72%), largely driven by lower revenue, weaker gross margin, and a $16.1 million restructuring charge.\n  * Cash and cash equivalents were $635.1 million, a ($42.9) million decrease compared to $678.0 million at the end of Q2 2024.\n  * Ballard received approximately $7.1 million in new order intake during Q3, while removing previously booked orders valued at $39.2 million from our Order Backlog relating to certain high-risk markets and customers, including in China, resulting in net new orders of ($32.1) million in the quarter. Ballard delivered orders valued at $14.8 million, resulting in an Order Backlog of approximately $122.7 million at end-Q3, a 28% decrease from the end of Q2 2024.\n  * The 12-month Order Book, which was also impacted by delivery of orders in Q3, low new order intake, and the removal of previously booked orders, was $58.2 million at end-Q3, a decrease of $17.3 million, or (23%), from the end of Q2 2024.\n\n**Order Backlog** ($M) | **Order Backlogat End-Q2 2024**| **Orders Received****in Q3 2024**| **Orders Removedin Q3 2024**| **Orders Deliveredin Q3 2024** | **Order Backlogat End-Q3 2024**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nTotal Fuel CellProducts & Services|  $169.5|  $7.1|  $39.2|  $14.8|  $122.7  \n  \n**2024 Outlook**\n\nConsistent with the Company’s past practice, and in view of the early stage of hydrogen fuel cell market development, specific revenue or net income (loss) guidance for 2024 is not provided.

Non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Ballard believes that Cash Operating Costs, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA assist investors in assessing Ballard’s operating performance. These measures should be used in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income (loss), cash flows and other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of Cash Operating Costs, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA to the Consolidated Financial Statements, please refer to the tables below.\n\nCash Operating Costs measures total operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment losses or recoveries on trade receivables, restructuring charges, acquisition related costs, the impact of unrealized gains or losses on foreign exchange contracts, and financing charges. EBITDA measures net loss excluding finance expense, income taxes, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, and amortization of intangible assets. Adjusted EBITDA adjusts EBITDA for stock-based compensation expense, transactional gains and losses, acquisition related costs, finance and other income, recovery on settlement of contingent consideration, asset impairment charges, and the impact of unrealized gains or losses on foreign exchange contracts.\n\n2 Total Operating Expenses refer to the measure reported in accordance with IFRS.\n\n3 Capital Expenditure is defined as Additions to property, plant and equipment and Investment in other intangible assets as disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n\n4 We report our results in the single operating segment of Fuel Cell Products and Services. Our Fuel Cell Products and Services segment consists of the sale of PEM fuel cell products and services for a variety of applications including Heavy-Duty Mobility (consisting of bus, truck, rail, and marine applications), Stationary Power, and Emerging and Other Markets (consisting of material handling, off-road, and other applications). Revenues from the delivery of Services, including technology solutions, after sales services and training, are included in each of the respective markets.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed a restructuring of operations at Ballard Motive Solutions in the U.K. and effectively closed the operation. As such, the historic operating results (including revenue and operating expenses) of the Ballard Motive Solutions business have been removed from continuing operating results and are instead presented separately in the statement of comprehensive income (loss) as loss from discontinued operations.\n\n![](https://www.ballard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bld-q3-2024-cash-operating-costs-and-ebitda.jpg)\n\n![](https://pixel.wp.com/g.gif?v=ext&blog=239558119&post=3124&tz=0&srv=www.ballard.com&j=1%3A14.0&host=www.ballard.com&ref=&fcp=6066&rand=0.40647864580258886)\n"
