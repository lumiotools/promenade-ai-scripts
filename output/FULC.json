Sapir, Fulcrum’s president and chief executive officer. “The need for effective therapeutic options for patients with sickle cell disease has become even more urgent due to the recent withdrawal of OXBRYTA® globally. Based on the initial data generated in the Phase 1b trial, we believe that pociredir has the potential to increase fetal hemoglobin to levels that could ameliorate symptoms of sickle cell disease. While we were disappointed with the results of the Phase 3 REACH trial announced in September, we remain committed to improving the lives of patients with genetically defined diseases in areas of high unmet medical need like sickle cell disease. We are focused on progressing the development of pociredir as expeditiously as possible and remain on track to provide data from the PIONEER trial in 2025.”\n\n**_Recent Business Highlights_**\n\n  * Patient enrollment and site activations continue to progress in the Phase 1b PIONEER trial evaluating pociredir in patients with SCD. Cohort 3 of the Phase 1b trial is evaluating pociredir at the 12 mg once daily dose, which will be followed by Cohort 4 at the 20 mg once daily dose. Each cohort is expected to enroll up to 10 patients. Fulcrum plans to share clinical data from the PIONEER trial in 2025.\n  * Following recent interactions with the FDA, Fulcrum plans to initiate Phase 1 clinical studies in healthy volunteers in support of the overall pociredir development program.\n  * Following the REACH trial results disclosed in September 2024, Fulcrum suspended development of losmapimod and has focused its research and development activities on advancing pociredir for the treatment of SCD, as well as advancing novel therapeutic agents for the potential treatment of inherited aplastic anemias, such as Diamond-Blackfan anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and Fanconi anemia, and its early discovery programs.\n\n\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results_**\n\n  * **Cash Position:** As of September 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $257.2 million, as compared to $236.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase is due to the $80.0 million upfront payment received from Sanofi in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by cash used to fund operating activities in 2024.\n  * **Collaboration Revenue:** Collaboration revenue was zero for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $0.8 million was due to the completion of research services under the collaboration agreement with MyoKardia during the fourth quarter of 2023.\n  * **R &D Expenses:** Research and development expenses were $14.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $18.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $3.6 million was primarily due to the reimbursement from the global development cost sharing under the collaboration with Sanofi for losmapimod, partially offset by increased costs related to the advancement of the Phase 1b PIONEER trial.\n  * **G &A Expenses:** General and administrative expenses were $8.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $10.0 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $1.6 million was primarily due to decreased employee compensation costs as a result of the reduction in workforce implemented in the third quarter of 2024.\n  * **Net Loss:** Net loss was $21.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of $24.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. \n\n\n\n**_Cash Guidance_**\n\nBased on its current operating plans, Fulcrum expects to end 2024 with approximately $240.0 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and expects its cash burn for the full year 2025 will be approximately $55.0 million to $65.0 million. Fulcrum also expects that its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund its current operating requirements into at least 2027.\n\n**_Conference Call and Webcast_**\n\nFulcrum Therapeutics, Inc. will host a conference call and webcast today at 8:00 a.m. ET to review the third quarter 2024 financial results and recent business highlights.

Following the live webcast, an archived replay will also be available.\n\n**About Fulcrum Therapeutics** Fulcrum Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing small molecules to improve the lives of patients with genetically defined rare diseases in areas of high unmet medical need. Fulcrum’s lead program in clinical development is pociredir, a small molecule designed to increase expression of fetal hemoglobin and in development for the treatment of SCD. Fulcrum uses proprietary technology to identify drug targets that can modulate gene expression to treat the known root cause of gene mis-expression. For more information, visit www.fulcrumtx.com and follow us on Twitter/X (@FulcrumTx) and LinkedIn.\n\n**About Pociredir** Pociredir is an investigational oral small-molecule inhibitor of Embryonic Ectoderm Development (EED) that was discovered using Fulcrum’s proprietary discovery technology. Inhibition of EED leads to potent downregulation of key fetal globin repressors, including BCL11A, thereby causing an increase in fetal hemoglobin (HbF). Pociredir is being developed for the treatment of SCD. Initial data in SCD demonstrated proof-of-concept and achieved absolute levels of HbF increases associated with potential overall patient benefit. In clinical trials conducted prior to the clinical hold, which was lifted by the FDA in August 2023, pociredir was generally well-tolerated in people with SCD with up to three months of exposure, with no serious treatment-related adverse events reported. Pociredir has been granted FDA Fast Track designation and Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of SCD. To learn more about these trials please visit  _ClinicalTrials.gov_.\n\n**About Sickle Cell Disease** Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder of the red blood cells caused by a mutation in the HBB gene. This gene encodes a protein that is a key component of hemoglobin, a protein complex whose function is to transport oxygen in the body. The result of the mutation is less efficient oxygen transport and the formation of red blood cells that have a sickle shape. These sickle shaped cells are much less flexible than healthy cells and can block blood vessels or rupture cells. People with SCD typically suffer from serious clinical consequences, which may include anemia, pain, infections, stroke, heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, kidney failure, liver disease, and reduced life expectancy. **Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.
