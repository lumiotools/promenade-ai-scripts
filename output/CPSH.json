See separate press release for further details.\n\n\n\n“While this quarter was negatively impacted by the costs related to staffing and training a third operating shift, we are optimistic about significantly improved performance in the fourth quarter and beyond,” said Brian Mackey, President and CEO. “We recently won another Phase II award from the U.S. government – with the Department of Energy – and just today announced a $12.0 million power module component contract, with a well-known global semiconductor manufacturer. Our third shift began production in the third quarter, though the impact on revenue will not be felt until the fourth quarter. We anticipate higher deliveries going forward. Overall, our book to bill ratio – currently 1.22 – provides confidence that we are weathering the storm of headwinds caused by the end of our HybridTech Armor® contract, supply chain inefficiencies, and a challenging staffing environment. We are now confident that the Company’s long-term strategy of expanding its product portfolio, working with the government to fund innovative R&D initiatives, and growing our core product lines are starting to bear fruit. We appreciate our investors’ continued patience and interest, and we look forward to the quarters to come.”\n\n### _Results of Operations_\n\nCPS reported revenue of $4.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus $6.3 million in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting the previously-announced completion of the Company’s HybridTech Armor® contract with Kinetic Protection, the prime contractor for the U.S. Navy; another major customer has also purchased less, year-over-year, as it works through excess inventory.\n\nGross loss was $0.5 million, or (12) percent of revenue, versus a gross profit of $1.2 million, or 20 percent of revenue, in the fiscal 2023 third quarter, with the negative variance year-over-year due to lower overall revenue and reduced manufacturing efficiencies, along with costs associated with staffing and training a third shift that began operating the last week of August. During the quarter, this new staff worked alongside other workers for training, impacting overall cost of goods sold without a corresponding top line revenue component in the quarter.\n\nThe Company reported an operating loss of $1.5 million in the fiscal 2024 third quarter compared with an operating profit of $0.1 million in the prior-year period. Reported net loss was $1.0 million, or $(0.07) per diluted share, versus net income of $0.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n### _Conference Call_\n\nThe Company will be hosting its third quarter 2024 earnings call at 9:00 am tomorrow, October 31, 2024. Those interested in participating in the conference call should dial the following:\n\nCall in Number: 1-844-943-2942\n\nParticipant Passcode: 475242\n\nThe Company encourages those who wish to participate to call in 10 minutes before the scheduled start time to ensure the operator can connect all participants.\n\n## _About CPS_\n\nCPS is a technology and manufacturing leader in producing high-performance materials solutions for its customers.
