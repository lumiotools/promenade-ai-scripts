The sales and marketing efforts\nthat we have implemented over the past three years have continued to drive awareness in the industry, and we are exploring\nnew potential wholesale markets. We also were pleased to report favorable growth in our China market, where we\ncontinue to roll out a larger brand recognition initiative that will take time to develop. While these enhanced marketing\nefforts have affected our margin in the interim, we believe they will lead to continued strong growth in the quarters to\ncome. We opened additional franchise stores during the period and as we enter the second half of the year are embracing\nnew methods of technology to improve our customers’ overall experience. Our goal remains to be at the forefront of both\nquality and innovation in our design and service, which we feel helps to define our competitive advantage over other multi-\nnational peers in the home furnishing industry.”\nMr. Wong concluded, “We continue to maintain a strong financial position during a period of robust expansion. Our recent\nfinancing simplified our capital structure, and we remain focused on properly utilizing our capital to grow in a sustainable\nmanner, improving our receivables, and maintaining a lean operating infrastructure. We made progress in this regard during\nthe second quarter and expect continued improvements throughout the second half of 2015.”\n1\nOperational Overview\nProduct Category\nNova LifeStyle’s largest selling product categories in the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were sofas, cabinets\nand dining tables, which accounted for approximately 31%, 15% and 16% of sales, respectively, for the three months ended\nJune 30, 2015.\nIn the next several months, the Company intends to enrich its product lines to include a bedroom series, which would\ninclude beds, bed side tables, mattresses (which could be imported or purchased in China) and bedding sets including bed\nsheets, pillowcases, quilt covers, and other items (which can be purchased within China).\nGeographic Breakdown\nNorth America\nSales to North America were $20.3 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of 38% from $14.7 million\nin the same period of 2014, driven by increased marketing efforts in the U.S. markets.
