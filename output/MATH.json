The Company reported the notional amount of derivative products issued of **$382 million** under its wealth management business arm, which generated fiscal-year income of **$5.7 million**. The adjusted loss of the Company in FY 2023 was about $0.7 million.\n\nThe Company recorded strong year-over-year growth driven by its wealth management business, a key pillar of its operations and revenue model.

In the new year, we are confident about the improving market conditions which could lead to stronger demand for our derivative product subscriptions.\n\nAt the company level, we aim to maintain a high growth rate and significantly lower expenses as our business scale expands. We will also continue to innovate and diversify our business offerings in a bid to expand our market share in Asia,\" said **Adrian Wang , President of Metalpha**.\n\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n\n**Notional Amount of Derivative Products Issued**\n\n**FY 2022**| **FY 2023**  \n---|---  \nNotional Amount of Derivative Product Issued| 49 million| 382 million  \n  \n**Income from Wealth Management Business**\n\n**FY 2022**| **FY 2023**  \n---|---  \nIncome from Wealth Management Business| 0.1 million| 5.7 million  \n  \n**Adjusted Loss to the Company**\n\n**FY 2022**| **FY 2023**  \n---|---  \nLoss of the Year| (14,428,033)| (20,167,351)  \nAdd: Equity-settled share-based payments under share award scheme| 1,468,800| 1,045,315  \nAdd: Share purchase warrants expenses| 6,063,086| 10,176,995  \nAdd: Total loss from discontinued operation| 3,193,385| 8,248,013  \nAdjusted Loss| (3,702,762)| (697,028)  \n  \nThe Company filed its annual report on Form 20-F for the FY 2023 (the \"2023 Annual Report\") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 12, 2024.

The 2023 Annual Report is available online at [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov/).\n\n**About Metalpha Technology Holding Limited**\n\nFounded in 2015, Metalpha Technology Holding Limited (NASDAQ: [MATH](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/metalpha-reports-fiscal-year-2023-financial-results-302063042.html?tc=eml_cleartime#financial-modal)) went public on October 20, 2017.

These forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as \"will,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"aims,\" \"future,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"likely to\" and similar statements. Management has based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. While they believe these expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond management's control. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause Metalpha's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.\n\n**Non-IFRS Financial Measure**\n\nThe Company uses adjusted loss for the period, which is a non-IFRS financial measure, in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. Metalpha believes that adjusted loss helps identify underlying trends in the Company's business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain expenses that the Company includes in its loss for the period. Metalpha believes that adjusted loss for the period provides useful information about its results of operations, enhances the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allows for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by its management in its financial and operational decision-making.\n\nAdjusted loss for the period should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to loss for the period or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of its operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review adjusted loss for the period and the reconciliation to its most directly comparable IFRS measure. Adjusted loss for the period presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to the Company's data. Metalpha encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\nAdjusted loss for the period represents profit for the period excluding (i) equity-settled share-based payments under the Company's share award scheme, (ii) share purchase warrants expenses (i.e. expenses in relation to the issuance of warrants to certain consultants, employees and business partners); and (iii) loss from discontinued operation.\n\nThe table captioned \"Reconciliations of Non-IFRS Measure to the Nearest Comparable IFRS Measure\" included at the end of this announcement contains a full reconciliation of adjusted loss for the period to loss for the period.\n\n**Media Contact**\n\nYiwei Wanginfo@metalpha.finance\n\nSOURCE Metalpha Technology Holding Limited\n\n[ Pre：Metalpha Regains Compliance with Nasdaq's Periodic Filing Requirement](/press-releases/metalpha-regains-compliance-with-nasdaq-s-periodic.html)\n\n[Next：Metalpha to Hold 2024 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders ](/press-releases/metalpha-to-hold-2024-annual-general-meeting-of-sh.html)\n\nContact us：\n\n![Tele Logo](/longyun/assets/images/tele.png) [+852-35652921](tel:+852-35652921)\n\n![Email Logo](/longyun/assets/images/email.png)company@metalpha.finance\n\n![Telegram Logo](/longyun/assets/images/Telegram_logo.svg.png)[https://t.me/metalphafinance ](https://t.me/metalphafinance)\n\n[ Home ](/) [ Crypto Business ](/crypto-business.html) [ Licensed Services ](/licensed-services.html) [ Investors Relations ](/investors-relations.html)\n\n[ Home ](#)\n\n[ About Us ](/about-us.html) [ Management Team ](/management-team.html) [ Board of Directors ](/board-of-directors.html) [ Board Committee Composition ](/board-committee-composition.html) [ Latest News ](/press-releases.html)\n\nAbout Us\n\n[ About Us ](/about-us.html) [ Management Team ](/management-team.html) [ Board of Directors ](/board-of-directors.html) [ Board Committee Composition ](/board-committee-composition.html)\n\n[ Latest News ](/press-releases.html)\n"
