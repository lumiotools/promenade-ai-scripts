Often, but not always, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"plans,\" \"is expected,\" \"expects,\" \"scheduled,\" \"intends,\" \"contemplates,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"proposes\" or variations (including negative variations) of such words and phrases, or state that certain actions, events or results \"may,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"might\" or \"will\" be taken, occur or be achieved. Such statements are based on the current expectations and assumptions of the management of XPEL. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors relate to, among others: competition, a prolonged or material contraction in automotive sales and production volumes, disruption in our supply chain, technology that could render our products obsolete, changes in the way vehicles are sold, damage to our brand and reputation, cyber events and other legal and regulatory developments. There are several risks, uncertainties, and other important factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, that could cause its actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this press release, including those described in the “Risk Factors” section of Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although XPEL has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results to differ from those anticipated, estimated or intended. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Except as required by applicable securities laws, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and XPEL undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measure**\n\nTo aid in the understanding of XPEL's ongoing business performance, XPEL uses EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) plus interest expense, net, plus income tax expense plus depreciation and amortization expense. EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Often, but not always, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"plans,\" \"is expected,\" \"expects,\" \"scheduled,\" \"intends,\" \"contemplates,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"proposes\" or variations (including negative variations) of such words and phrases, or state that certain actions, events or results \"may,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"might\" or \"will\" be taken, occur or be achieved. Such statements are based on the current expectations and assumptions of the management of XPEL. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors relate to, among others: competition, a prolonged or material contraction in automotive sales and production volumes, disruption in our supply chain, technology that could render our products obsolete, changes in the way vehicles are sold, our brand and reputation, cyber events and other legal and regulatory developments. There are several risks, uncertainties, and other important factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, that could cause its actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this press release, including those described in the “Risk Factors” section of Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although XPEL has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results to differ from those anticipated, estimated or intended. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Except as required by applicable securities laws, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and XPEL undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measure**\n\nTo aid in the understanding of XPEL's ongoing business performance, XPEL uses EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) plus interest expense, net, plus income tax expense plus depreciation and amortization expense. EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. It is not a measurement of XPEL's financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to revenue or net income, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly title measures. For a full reconciliation of EBITDA to comparable GAAP measure, refer to the reconciliation titled \" **Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure.\"**\n\n**XPEL, Inc.**  \n---  \n**Consolidated Statements of Income (Unaudited)**  \n**(In thousands except per share data)**  \n**Three Months Ended** **June 30,** |  **Six Months Ended** **June 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Revenue**  \nProduct revenue  |  $  |  83,200  |  $  |  80,906  |  $  |  150,052  |  $  |  148,214   \nService revenue  |  26,717  |  21,331  |  49,969  |  39,864   \n**Total revenue** |  109,917  |  102,237  |  200,021  |  188,078   \n**Cost of Sales**  \nCost of product sales  |  51,274  |  49,557  |  93,409  |  91,737   \nCost of service  |  10,778  |  8,686  |  20,871  |  16,388   \n**Total cost of sales** |  62,052  |  58,243  |  114,280  |  108,125   \n**Gross Margin** |  47,865  |  43,994  |  85,741  |  79,953   \n**Operating Expenses**  \nSales and marketing  |  10,280  |  8,147  |  20,671  |  14,824   \nGeneral and administrative  |  18,399  |  15,656  |  36,655  |  30,010   \n**Total operating expenses** |  28,679  |  23,803  |  57,326  |  44,834   \n**Operating Income** |  19,186  |  20,191  |  28,415  |  35,119   \nInterest expense  |  392  |  338  |  865  |  860   \nForeign currency exchange loss  |  275  |  32  |  548  |  21   \n**Income before income taxes** |  18,519  |  19,821  |  27,002  |  34,238   \nIncome tax expense  |  3,486  |  4,080  |  5,303  |  7,064   \n**Net income** |  $  |  15,033  |  $  |  15,741  |  $  |  21,699  |  $  |  27,174   \n**Earnings per share**  \n**Basic** |  $  |  0.54  |  $  |  0.57  |  $  |  0.79  |  $  |  0.98   \n**Diluted** |  $  |  0.54  |  $  |  0.57  |  $  |  0.79  |  $  |  0.98   \n**Weighted Average Number of Common Shares**  \n**Basic** |  27,635  |  27,619  |  27,633  |  27,617   \n**Diluted** |  27,637  |  27,631  |  27,637  |  27,629   \n  \n**XPEL, Inc.**  \n---  \n**Consolidated Balance Sheets**  \n**(In thousands except share and per share data)**  \n**(Unaudited)** |  **(Audited)**  \n**June 30, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n**Assets**  \n**Current**  \nCash and cash equivalents  |  $  |  14,984  |  $  |  11,609   \nAccounts receivable, net  |  29,466  |  24,111   \nInventory, net  |  97,591  |  106,509   \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets  |  4,641  |  3,529   \nIncome tax receivable  |  1,224  |  696   \n**Total current assets** |  147,906  |  146,454   \nProperty and equipment, net  |  17,998  |  16,980   \nRight-of-use lease assets  |  18,464  |  15,459   \nIntangible assets, net  |  33,241  |  34,905   \nOther non-current assets  |  1,127  |  782   \nGoodwill  |  43,094  |  37,461   \n**Total assets** |  $  |  261,830  |  $  |  252,041   \n**Liabilities**  \n**Current**  \nCurrent portion of notes payable  |  $  |  64  |  $  |  62   \nCurrent portion lease liabilities  |  4,723  |  3,966   \nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities  |  26,244  |  32,444   \n**Total current liabilities** |  31,031  |  36,472   \nDeferred tax liability, net  |  1,742  |  2,658   \nOther long-term liabilities  |  515  |  890   \nBorrowings on line of credit  |  11,000  |  19,000   \nNon-current portion of lease liabilities  |  15,359  |  12,715   \nNon-current portion of notes payable  |  272  |  317   \n**Total liabilities** |  59,919  |  72,052   \n**Commitments and Contingencies (Note 11)**  \n**Stockholders’ equity**  \nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value;

(Nasdaq: XPEL) (the \"Company\"), a global provider of protective films and coatings announced consolidated results1 for the first quarter and year ended March 31, 2024.\n\nFirst Quarter 2024 Overview:\n\n  * Revenue increased 5.0% to $90.1 million compared to the first quarter of 2023.\n  * Gross margin of 42.0% for the quarter.\n  * Net income decreased 41.7% to $6.7 million, or $0.24 per basic and diluted share, versus net income of $11.4 million, or $0.41 per basic and diluted share in the first quarter of 2023. These results include approximately $1.6 million in costs related to the Company’s annual dealer conference. The 2024 dealer conference was held in the first quarter, while the 2023 conference took place in the second quarter. Normalizing for these costs, net income would have decreased 30.7% and EPS would have been $0.29 per share.\n  * EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) decreased 31.5% to $11.7 million, or 13.0% of revenue compared to $17.1 million, or 19.9% of revenue in the first quarter of 2023. Normalizing for the annual dealer conference, EBITDA would have declined 22.1% and EBITDA margin would have been 14.8%.2\n\n\n\nRyan Pape, President and Chief Executive Officer of XPEL, commented, “Clearly, the first quarter was a challenging quarter for the Company, particularly in the US, where we saw a continued trend of a slowing aftermarket especially compared to the strength of the first half of 2023. Additionally, port delays reduced sales of two popular vehicle brands for our products which further impacted our US results. We did see some momentum return in our April numbers and we are optimistic that momentum will continue as we progress throughout the year.”\n\n**Highlights for the First Quarter 2024** :\n\nSummary consolidated financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 (unaudited, dollars in thousands):\n\nThree Months Ended March 31, | % Change  \n---|---  \n2024 | %of Total Revenue | 2023 | %of Total Revenue | 2024 vs. 2023  \nTotal revenue | $ | 90,104  | 100.0  | % | $ | 85,842  | 100.0  | % | 5.0  | %  \nGross margin | 37,876  | 42.0  | % | 35,960  | 41.9  | % | 5.3  | %  \nOperating Expenses | 28,647  | 31.8  | % | 21,029  | 24.5  | % | 36.2  | %  \nOperating income | 9,229  | 10.2  | % | 14,931  | 17.4  | % | (38.2) | %  \nNet income | 6,666  | 7.4  | % | 11,433  | 13.3  | % | (41.7) | %  \nEBITDA2 | 11,700  | 13.0  | % | 17,073  | 19.9  | % | (31.5) | %  \nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities | $ | (4,959) | n/a | $ | 695  | n/a | n/a  \n  \n_Geographical Revenue Summary_\n\nThree Months EndedMarch 31, | % | % of Total Revenue  \n---|---|---  \n2024 | 2023 | Inc (Dec) | 2024 | 2023  \nUnited States | $ | 52,048  | $ | 51,077  | 1.9  | % | 57.8  | % | 59.5  | %  \nChina | 1,450  | 6,647  | (78.2) | % | 1.6  | % | 7.7  | %  \nCanada | 11,080  | 8,592  | 29.0  | % | 12.3  | % | 10.0  | %  \nContinental Europe | 10,216  | 7,960  | 28.3  | % | 11.3  | % | 9.3  | %  \nUnited Kingdom | 3,486  | 3,091  | 12.8  | % | 3.9  | % | 3.6  | %  \nMiddle East/Africa | 5,143  | 3,496  | 47.1  | % | 5.7  | % | 4.1  | %  \nAsia Pacific | 3,750  | 2,645  | 41.8  | % | 4.2  | % | 3.1  | %  \nLatin America | 2,931  | 2,173  | 34.9  | % | 3.2  | % | 2.5  | %  \nOther | —  | 161  | (100.0) | % | 0.0  | % | 0.2  | %  \nTotal | $ | 90,104  | $ | 85,842  | 5.0  | % | 100.0  | % | 100.0  | %  \n  \n_Overall Revenue_\n\n  * Total revenue grew 5.0% year-over-year (\"YoY\").\n  * US revenue grew 1.9% YoY to $52.0 million.\n  * China revenue declined 78.2% YoY to $1.5 million.\n  * Rest of World revenue (excluding US and China) grew 30.2% YoY.\n\n\n\n_Product and Service Revenue_\n\n  * Total product revenue decreased 0.7% YoY. This decrease was due to lower demand in the U.S., primarily in the after-market channel, and lower sales to XPEL's China distributor. China revenue was the highest in our history in the fourth quarter 2023. Consequently, Q1 2024 China sales were negatively impacted as our distributor sold through the inventory purchased in Q4 last year.\n  * Total window film decreased 2.9% YoY and represented 16.1% of total revenue. This decline was due mainly to lower revenues into China. Excluding China, total window film revenue grew 10.3%. Architectural window film revenue increased 33.1% to $1.8 million.\n  * Total service revenue increased 25.5% YoY. The increase was due mainly to increases in the Company's dealership services business resulting from increased car counts, increased content per vehicle and from our OEM business, which increased 57.6% YoY to $4.6 million.\n  * Total installation revenue (labor and product combined) grew 34.7% YoY and represented 22.1% of total revenue.

Often, but not always, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"plans,\" \"is expected,\" \"expects,\" \"scheduled,\" \"intends,\" \"contemplates,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"proposes\" or variations (including negative variations) of such words and phrases, or state that certain actions, events or results \"may,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"might\" or \"will\" be taken, occur or be achieved. Such statements are based on the current expectations and assumptions of the management of XPEL. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors relate to, among others: competition, a prolonged or material contraction in automotive sales and production volumes, disruption in our supply chain, technology that could render our products obsolete, changes in the way vehicles are sold, our brand and reputation, cyber events and other legal and regulatory developments.

Although XPEL has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results to differ from those anticipated, estimated or intended. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Except as required by applicable securities laws, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and XPEL undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measure**\n\nTo aid in the understanding of XPEL's ongoing business performance, XPEL uses EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) plus interest expense, net, plus income tax expense plus depreciation and amortization expense. EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. It is not a measurement of XPEL's financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to revenue or net income, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly title measures. For a full reconciliation of EBITDA to comparable GAAP measure, refer to the reconciliation titled **\"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure.\"**\n\n**For more information contact:** Investor Relations:John Nesbett/Jennifer BelodeauIMS Investor RelationsPhone: [(203) 972-9200](tel:203-972-9200)Email: xpel@imsinvestorrelations.com\n\nXPEL, Inc.Consolidated Statements of Income(In thousands except per share data)\n\nThree Months Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31,  \n---|---  \n(Unaudited) | (Unaudited) | (Unaudited)  \n2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022  \nRevenue  \nProduct revenue | $ | 82,067  | $ | 60,421  | $ | 311,406  | $ | 258,174   \nService revenue | 23,471  | 18,060  | 84,887  | 65,819   \nTotal revenue | 105,538  | 78,481  | 396,293  | 323,993   \nCost of Sales  \nCost of product sales | 54,395  | 40,259  | 198,008  | 169,905   \nCost of service | 10,211  | 7,176  | 35,871  | 26,576   \nTotal cost of sales | 64,606  | 47,435  | 233,879  | 196,481   \nGross Margin | 40,932  | 31,046  | 162,414  | 127,512   \nOperating Expenses  \nSales and marketing | 9,234  | 6,852  | 31,788  | 25,367   \nGeneral and administrative | 17,474  | 13,349  | 63,654  | 48,208   \nTotal operating expenses | 26,708  | 20,201  | 95,442  | 73,575   \nOperating Income | 14,224  | 10,845  | 66,972  | 53,937   \nInterest expense | 301  | 477  | 1,248  | 1,410   \nForeign currency exchange (gain) loss | (726) | (272) | (307) | 562   \nIncome before income taxes | 14,649  | 10,640  | 66,031  | 51,965   \nIncome tax expense | 2,679  | 2,282  | 13,231  | 10,584   \nNet income | $ | 11,970  | $ | 8,358  | $ | 52,800  | $ | 41,381   \nEarnings per share  \nBasic | $ | 0.43  | $ | 0.30  | $ | 1.91  | $ | 1.50   \nDiluted | $ | 0.43  | $ | 0.30  | $ | 1.91  | $ | 1.50   \nWeighted Average Number of Common Shares  \nBasic | 27,629  | 27,616  | 27,622  | 27,614   \nDiluted | 27,633  | 27,618  | 27,634  | 27,616   \n  \nXPEL, Inc.Consolidated Balance Sheets(In thousands except share and per share data)\n\n(Unaudited)12/31/2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \nAssets  \nCurrent  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 11,609  | $ | 8,056   \nAccounts receivable, net | 24,111  | 14,726   \nInventory, net | 106,509  | 80,575   \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets | 3,529  | 3,464   \nIncome tax receivable | 696  | —   \nTotal current assets | 146,454  | 106,821   \nProperty and equipment, net | 16,980  | 14,203   \nRight-of-use lease assets | 15,459  | 15,309   \nIntangible assets, net | 34,905  | 29,294   \nOther non-current assets | 782  | 972   \nGoodwill | 37,461  | 26,763   \nTotal assets | $ | 252,041  | $ | 193,362   \nLiabilities  \nCurrent  \nCurrent portion of notes payable | $ | 62  | $ | 77   \nCurrent portion of lease liabilities | 3,966  | 3,885   \nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities | 32,444  | 22,970   \nIncome tax payable | —  | 470   \nTotal current liabilities | 36,472  | 27,402   \nDeferred tax liability, net | 2,658  | 2,049   \nOther long-term liabilities | 890  | 1,070   \nBorrowings on line of credit | 19,000  | 26,000   \nNon-current portion of lease liabilities | 12,715  | 12,119   \nNon-current portion of notes payable | 317  | —   \nTotal liabilities | 72,052  | 68,640   \nCommitments and Contingencies (Note 15)  \nStockholders’ equity  \nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value;

Owners can choose from PRIME CS, PRIME XR or PRIME XR PLUS in a variety of tints, depending on their personal needs and style. \n\n\n\nThis is not the first collaboration between Rivian and XPEL, as Rivian already offers full-body XPEL PPF installed on select models at its factory. \n\n“With this extended collaboration, we’re encouraging Rivian owners to be as adventurous as their vehicles,” said Anthony Pecaski, XPEL’s Senior Manager of Key Accounts. “This new program allows for the enhanced protection and customization each customer desires to keep their vehicle looking great during their ownership experience.” \n\nFor best results, XPEL recommends Rivian owners have XPEL’s PPF and window film installed on their vehicles as early as possible.

Organic installation revenue grew 11.3% YoY. \n  * Adjusted product revenue (combining cutbank credits revenue and product revenue) increased 6.8% YoY and 3.9% QoQ.

Often, but not always, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"plans,\" \"is expected,\" \"expects,\" \"scheduled,\" \"intends,\" \"contemplates,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"proposes\" or variations (including negative variations) of such words and phrases, or state that certain actions, events or results \"may,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"might\" or \"will\" be taken, occur or be achieved. Such statements are based on the current expectations and assumptions of the management of XPEL. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors relate to, among others: competition, a prolonged or material contraction in automotive sales and production volumes, disruption in our supply chain, technology that could render our products obsolete, changes in the way vehicles are sold, damage to our brand and reputation, cyber events and other legal and regulatory developments. There are several risks, uncertainties, and other important factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, that could cause its actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this press release, including those described in the “Risk Factors” section of Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although XPEL has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results to differ from those anticipated, estimated or intended. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Except as required by applicable securities laws, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and XPEL undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measure**\n\nTo aid in the understanding of XPEL's ongoing business performance, XPEL uses EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) plus interest expense, net, plus income tax expense plus depreciation and amortization expense. EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. It is not a measurement of XPEL's financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to revenue or net income, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly title measures.

EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) plus interest expense, net, plus income tax expense plus depreciation expense and amortization expense. EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. It is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to revenue or net income, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other businesses. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. \n\nEBITDA does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of ongoing operations and other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. \n\n**EBITDA Reconciliation (in thousands)**  \n---  \n**(Unaudited)** |  **(Unaudited)**  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Net Income** |  $  |  14,892  |  $  |  13,656  |  $  |  36,591  |  $  |  40,830   \n**Interest** |  97  |  85  |  962  |  946   \n**Taxes** |  3,730  |  3,490  |  9,033  |  10,553   \n**Depreciation** |  1,504  |  1,199  |  4,308  |  3,229   \n**Amortization** |  1,475  |  1,288  |  4,327  |  3,660   \n**EBITDA** |  $  |  21,698  |  $  |  19,718  |  $  |  55,221  |  $  |  59,218   \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241107387812r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n**For more information:**\n\nInvestor Relations: John Nesbett/Jennifer Belodeau IMS Investor Relations Phone: (203) 972-9200 Email: xpel@imsinvestorrelations.com\n\nSource: XPEL, Inc.\n\nCategories: Press Releases\n\n[ View all news ](/news/default.aspx)\n"

INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe accompanying (a) condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, which has been derived from audited financial\nstatements, and (b) unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023 have been prepared by XPEL, Inc. (“XPEL” or the “Company”) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America for interim financial information, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”). Pursuant to these rules and regulations, certain financial information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements\nhave been condensed or omitted. However, in the opinion of management, the financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal\nrecurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the interim periods presented.\nOperating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or for any other interim\nperiod, due to variability in customer purchasing patterns and seasonal, operating and other factors.\nThese condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes\ncontained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024 (the\n\"Annual Report\") and with the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section appearing\nelsewhere in this Report.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nNature of Business - The Company is based in San Antonio, Texas and sells, distributes, and installs protective films and coatings, including\nautomotive paint protection film, surface protection film, automotive and commercial/architectural window films and ceramic coatings. The\nCompany was incorporated in the state of Nevada, U.S.A. in October 2003.\nBasis of Presentation - The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles (\"U.S. GAAP\") and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and\ntransactions have been eliminated. The functional currency for the Company is the United States (\"U.S.\") Dollar. The assets and liabilities of each of\nits wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at the end of the balance sheet date. Revenues and\nexpenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Gains and losses from translations are recognized in foreign currency\ntranslation included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nSegment Reporting - Management has concluded that our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is our chief executive officer. The\nCompany’s CODM reviews the entire organization’s consolidated results on a monthly basis to evaluate performance and make resource allocation\ndecisions. Management views the Company’s operations and manages its business as one operating segment.\nUse of Estimates - The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management\nto make judgments and estimates and form assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated\nfinancial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and underlying assumptions are\nreviewed on an ongoing basis. Actual outcomes may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nAccounts Receivable - Accounts receivable are shown net of allowances for expected credit losses of $0.2 million and $0.2 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company evaluates the adequacy of its allowances by analyzing the aging of\nreceivables, customer financial condition, historical collection experience, the value of any collateral and other economic and\n6\nXPEL, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nindustry factors. Actual collections may differ from historical experience, and if economic, business or customer conditions deteriorate significantly,\nadjustments to these reserves may be required. When the Company becomes aware of factors that indicate a change in a specific customer’s ability\nto meet its financial obligations, the Company records a specific reserve for credit losses.\nProvisions and Warranties - We provide a warranty on our products. Liability under the warranty policy is based on a review of historical\nwarranty claims. Adjustments are made to the accruals as claims and data experience warrant. Our liability for warranties as of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023 was $0.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively. The following tables present a summary of our accrued warranty liabilities for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\n2024\nWarranty liability, January 1 $ 422\nWarranties assumed in period 1,246\nPayments (990)\nWarranty liability, September 30 $ 678\n2023\nWarranty liability, January 1 $ 234\nWarranties assumed in period 768\nPayments (580)\nWarranty liability, December 31 $ 422\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Issued and Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” which makes certain updates to\nsegment reporting. This standard will become effective for our annual reporting for the year beginning January 1, 2024 and for our interim reporting\nfor interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. We do not anticipate implementation of this standard will have a material impact on our financial\nstatements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”, which makes certain updates to income tax\ndisclosures. This standard becomes effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2025. We do not anticipate implementation of this standard will\nhave a material impact on our financial statements.\n7\nXPEL, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\n3. REVENUE\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised goods and services to a\ncustomer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. This is achieved through\napplying the following five-step model:\n• Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer\n• Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\n• Determination of the transaction price\n• Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n• Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation\nThe Company generates substantially all of its revenue from contracts with customers, whether formal or implied. Sales taxes collected from\ncustomers are remitted to the appropriate taxing jurisdictions and are excluded from sales revenue as the Company considers itself a pass-through\nconduit for collecting and remitting sales taxes, with the exception of taxes assessed during the procurement process of select inventories. Shipping\nand handling costs are included in cost of sales.\nRevenue from product and services sales is recognized when control of the goods, or benefit of the service, is furnished to the customer. This\noccurs at a point in time, typically upon shipment to the customer or completion of the service. This standard applies to all contracts with customers,\nexcept for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments.\nBased upon the nature of the products the Company sells, its customers have limited rights of return and those present are immaterial.\nDiscounts provided by the Company to customers at the time of sale are recognized as a reduction in sales as the products are sold.\nWarranty obligations associated with the sale of our products are assurance-type warranties that are a guarantee of the product’s intended\nfunctionality and, therefore, do not represent a distinct performance obligation within the context of the contract. Warranty expense is included in cost\nof sales.\nWe apply a practical expedient to expense direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred because the amortization period would be one year\nor less.\nUnder its contracts with customers, the Company stands ready to deliver product upon receipt of a purchase order. Accordingly, the Company\nhas no performance obligations under its contracts until its customers submit a purchase order. The Company does not enter into commitments to\nprovide goods or services that have terms greater than one year. In limited cases, the Company does require payment in advance of shipping\nproduct. Typically, product is shipped within a few days after prepayment is received. These prepayments are recorded as contract liabilities on the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheet and are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities (Note 9). As the performance obligation is part of\na contract that has an original expected duration of less than one year, the Company has applied the practical expedient under the Accounting\nStandards Codification Topic 606 (\"ASC 606\") to omit disclosures regarding remaining performance obligations.\nWhen the Company transfers goods or provides services to a customer, payment is due, subject to normal terms, and is not conditional on\nanything other than the passage of time. Typical payment terms range from due upon receipt to due within 30 days, depending on the type of\ncustomer and relationship. At contract inception, the Company expects that the period of time between the transfer of goods to the\n8\nXPEL, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\ncustomer and when the customer pays for those goods will be less than one year, which is consistent with the Company’s standard payment terms.\nAccordingly, the Company has elected the practical expedient under ASC 606 to not adjust for the effects of a significant financing component. As\nsuch, these amounts are recorded as receivables and not contract assets.\nThe following table summarizes transactions within contract liabilities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (in thousands):\nBalance, December 31, 2023 $ 761\nRevenue recognized related to payments included in the December 31, 2023 balance (696)\nPayments received for which performance obligations have not been satisfied 276\nEffect of foreign currency translation (4)\nBalance, March 31, 2024 337\nRevenue recognized related to payments included in the March 31, 2024 balance (284)\nPayments received for which performance obligations have not been satisfied 935\nEffect of foreign currency translation (3)\nBalance, June 30, 2024 985\nRevenue recognized related to payments included in the June 30, 2024 balance (926)\nPayments received for which performance obligations have not been satisfied 643\nEffect of foreign currency translation 22\nBalance, September 30, 2024 $ 724\nThe table below sets forth the disaggregation of revenue by product category for the periods indicated below (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nProduct Revenue\nPaint protection film $ 60,545 $ 58,977 $ 166,870 $ 165,016\nWindow film 22,627 18,762 59,195 54,055\nOther 3,778 3,386 10,937 10,268\nTotal $ 86,950 $ 81,125 $ 237,002 $ 229,339\nService Revenue\nSoftware $ 2,041 $ 1,652 $ 5,959 $ 4,656\nCutbank credits 4,500 4,524 13,300 13,253\nInstallation labor 18,925 14,852 55,090 41,781\nTraining and other 436 524 1,522 1,726\nTotal $ 25,902 $ 21,552 $ 75,871 $ 61,416\nTotal $ 112,852 $ 102,677 $ 312,873 $ 290,755\nBecause many of our international customers require us to ship their orders to freight forwarders located in the United States, we cannot be\ncertain about the ultimate destination of the product.

DEBT\nREVOLVING FACILITIES\nThe Company has a revolving credit facility providing for secured revolving loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $125\nmillion, which is subject to the terms of a credit agreement dated April 6, 2023 (the \"Credit Agreement\"). As of September 30, 2024, no balance was\noutstanding under the Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2023, the Company had an outstanding balance of $19 million under the Credit\nAgreement.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at XPEL’s option, at a rate equal to either (a) Base Rate or (b) Adjusted Term SOFR.\nIn addition to the applicable interest rate, the Credit Agreement includes a commitment fee ranging from 0.20% to 0.25% per annum for the unused\nportion of the aggregate commitment and an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.50% for Base Rate Loans and 1.00% to 1.50% for Adjusted\nTerm SOFR Loans. At September 30, 2024, these rates were 8.0% and 6.3%, respectively. Both the margin applicable to the interest rate and the\ncommitment fee are dependent on XPEL’s Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio. The Credit Agreement's maturity date is April 6, 2026. All capitalized\nterms in this description of the Credit Agreement that are not otherwise defined in this report have the meaning assigned to them in the Credit\nAgreement.\nObligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority perfected security interest, subject to certain permitted encumbrances, in\nall of XPEL’s material property and assets.\nThe terms of the Credit Agreement include certain affirmative and negative covenants that require, among other things, XPEL to maintain legal\nexistence and remain in good standing, comply with applicable laws, maintain accounting records, deliver financial statements and certifications on a\ntimely basis, pay taxes as required by law, and maintain insurance coverage, as well as to forgo certain specified future activities that might\notherwise encumber XPEL. The Credit Agreement provides for two financial covenants, as follows:\nAs of the last day of each fiscal quarter:\n1. XPEL shall not allow its Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio to exceed 3.50 to 1.00, and\n2. XPEL shall not allow its Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio to be less than 3.00 to 1.00\nThe Company also has a CAD $4.5 million revolving credit facility through HSBC Bank Canada, and is maintained by XPEL Canada Corp., a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of XPEL. This Canadian facility is utilized to fund the Company's working capital needs in Canada. This facility bears\ninterest at HSBC Canada Bank’s prime rate plus 0.25% per annum and is guaranteed by the parent company. As of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, no balance was outstanding on this line of credit.\n12\nXPEL, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.\n9. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES\nThe following table presents significant accounts payable and accrued liability balances as of the periods ending (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nTrade payables $ 21,878 $ 24,233\nPayroll liabilities 4,589 4,296\nContract liabilities 724 761\nAcquisition holdback payments 628 868\nOther liabilities 3,815 2,286\n$ 31,634 $ 32,444\n10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nASC 820 prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1 – Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 – Inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly, including: quoted prices for similar\nassets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are\nobservable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data and require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nFinancial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, our line of credit, and long-term debt. The\ncarrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, our line of credit, and short-term borrowings approximate\nfair value because of the near-term maturities of these financial instruments. The carrying value of the Company’s notes payable approximates fair\nvalue due to the relatively short-term nature and interest rates of the notes. The carrying value of the Company's long-term debt approximates fair\nvalue due to the interest rates being market rates.\nThe estimated fair value of debt is based on market quotes for instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities.\nThe Company has contingent liabilities related to future internal performance milestones. The fair value of these liabilities was determined using\na Monte Carlo Simulation based on the probability and timing of certain future payments under these arrangements. These liabilities are accounted\nfor as Level 3 liabilities within the fair value hierarchy.\n13\nXPEL, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nLiabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the dates noted below are as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLevel 3:\nContingent Liabilities $ 1,091 $ 815\nDecreases in the fair value of level 3 contingent liabilities are reflected in general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nIn the ordinary course of business activities, the Company may be contingently liable for litigation and claims including those pertaining to\ncustomers, suppliers and former employees. Management believes that adequate provisions have been recorded in the accounts where required.\nManagement also has determined that the likelihood of any class action or other litigation and claims having a material impact on our results of\noperations, cash flows or financial position is remote.\n12. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nWe compute basic earnings per share by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.\nDiluted earnings per common share includes effect of granted incremental restricted stock units.\nThe following table reconciles basic and diluted weighted average shares used in the computation of earnings per share (in thousands except\nper share values):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\nNumerator 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income $ 14,892 $ 13,656 $ 36,591 $ 40,830\nDenominator\nWeighted average basic shares 27,642 27,623 27,636 27,620\nDilutive effect of restricted stock units 2 21 3 14\nWeighted average diluted shares 27,644 27,644 27,639 27,634\nEarnings per share\nBasic $ 0.54 $ 0.49 $ 1.32 $ 1.48\nDiluted $ 0.54 $ 0.49 $ 1.32 $ 1.48\n13. ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES\nDuring 2024, we have acquired certain companies for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 million. These acquisitions were primarily completed\nto increase the geographical footprint of our installation service businesses and to expand our product offerings into new applications.\nOur valuation models related to the contingent liabilities, identified intangible assets, and goodwill included in these acquisitions are not yet\nfinalized and these figures are presented on a preliminary basis. Accounting for these items will be finalized within 12 months of each acquisition\ndate. Purchase price\n14\nXPEL, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nallocations for other acquired items is finalized. Accordingly, the total preliminary purchase price for acquisitions completed during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 is as follows (in thousands):\nAggregate Purchase Price\nCash1 $ 7,276\nContingent consideration 700\n$ 7,976\nAggregate Allocation\nCash $ 231\nOther Working Capital 445\nProperty, equipment, and operating lease assets 2,927\nTrade name2 288\nAcquired patterns2 222\nCustomer Relationships2 1,099\nGoodwill3 5,595\nOperating lease liabilities (2,831)\n$ 7,976\n1Total cash consideration is comprised of amounts paid on closing dates plus holdback amounts to be paid in the future net of working capital deficiencies to\nbe reclaimed from seller.\n2The weighted average useful life of acquired amortizable intangible assets is 9 years.\n3The full value of this acquired goodwill is expected to be tax deductible.\nAcquisitions completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 have not yet contributed substantially to our consolidated operating\nresults. The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents our results, including expenses relating to the amortization of intangibles\npurchased, as if the acquisitions completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 had occurred on January 1, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nRevenue $ 316,671 $ 297,444\nNet income $ 36,848 $ 41,134\nThe unaudited consolidated pro forma combined financial information does not purport to be indicative of the results which would have been\nobtained had the acquisitions been completed as of the beginning of the earliest period presented or of results that may be obtained in the future. In\naddition, this financial information does not include any benefits that may result from the acquisition due to synergies that may be derived from the\nelimination of any duplicative costs.\nValuations and purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed in the latter half of 2023 have been finalized with minor changes to goodwill\nand other acquired intangible assets.\n15\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis provides material historical and prospective disclosures intended to enable investors and other\nusers to assess the financial condition and results of operations of XPEL, Inc. (“XPEL” or the “Company”). Statements that are not historical are\nforward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties discussed under the heading “Forward-Looking Statements” in this Report and under “Business,\"\n\"Risk Factors,” \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and \"Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data\" in the Annual Report which is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains not only historical information, but also forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section\n27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking\nstatements are subject to the safe harbor created by those sections. In addition, the Company or others on the Company’s behalf may make\nforward-looking statements from time to time in oral presentations, including telephone conferences and/or web casts open to the public, in press\nreleases or reports, on the Company’s internet web site, or otherwise. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this report\nor expressed by the Company orally from time to time that address activities, events, or developments that the Company expects, believes, or\nanticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements, including, in particular, the statements about the Company’s plans,\nobjectives, strategies, and prospects regarding, among other things, the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and business, and the\noutcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. The Company has identified some of these forward-looking statements in this report with\nwords like “believe,” “can,” “may,” “could,” “would,” “might,” “forecast,” “possible,” “potential,” “project,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,”\n“predict,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “approximate,” “outlook,” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other words and terms of similar meaning.\nThe use of future dates is also an indication of a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements may be contained in the notes to the\nCompany’s condensed consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report, including under the heading “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nForward-looking statements are based on current expectations about future events affecting the Company and are subject to uncertainties and\nfactors that affect all businesses operating in a global market as well as matters specific to the Company. These uncertainties and factors are difficult\nto predict, and many of them are beyond the Company’s control. Factors to consider when evaluating these forward-looking statements include, but\nare not limited to:\n• We are highly dependent on the automotive industry. A prolonged or material contraction in automotive sales and production volumes could\nadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n• We currently rely on one distributor for our products in China.\n• A significant percentage of our revenue is generated from our business in China, a market that is associated with certain risks.\n• The loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our\nbusiness.\n• A material disruption from our contract manufacturers or suppliers or our inability to obtain a sufficient supply from alternate suppliers could\ncause us to be unable to meet customer demands or increase our costs.\n• Our asset-light business model exposes us to product quality and variable cost risks.\n• Our accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on assumptions or models that may prove inaccurate.\n16\n• Fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials, equipment, labor and transportation could cause manufacturing delays, increase\nour costs and/or impact our ability to meet customer demand.\n• Our industry is highly competitive.\n• Harm to our reputation or the reputation of one or more of our products could have an adverse effect on our business.\n• Our revenue and operating results may fluctuate, which may make our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of\nexpectations.\n• Technology could render the need for some of our products obsolete.\n• Infringement of our intellectual property could impact our ability to compete effectively.\n• If changes to our existing products or introduction of new products or services do not meet our customers’ expectations or fail to generate\nrevenue, we could lose our customers or fail to generate any revenue from such products or services and our business may be harmed.\n• We depend on our relationships with independent installers and new car dealerships and their ability to sell and service our products. Any\ndisruption in these relationships could harm our sales.\n• We may not be able to identify, finance and complete suitable acquisitions and investments, and any completed acquisitions and\ninvestments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources.\n• We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims.\n• Our failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations, and changes in U.S. government sanctions, could have a material adverse\neffect on us.\n• We may seek to incur substantial indebtedness in the future.\n• We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on reasonable terms when required, or at all.\n• Our variable rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate volatility, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\n• General global economic and business conditions affect demand for our products.\n• A public health crisis could impact our business\n• Economic, political and market conditions can adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe the items we have outlined above are important factors that could cause estimates included in our financial statements to differ\nmaterially from actual results and those expressed in a forward-looking statement made in this report or elsewhere by us or on our behalf. We have\ndiscussed these factors in more detail in the Annual Report. These factors are not necessarily all of the factors that could affect us. Unpredictable or\nunanticipated factors that we have not discussed in this Report could also have material adverse effects on actual results. We do not intend to\nupdate our description of important factors each time a potential important factor arises, except as required by applicable securities laws and\nregulations. We advise our shareholders that they should (1) be aware that factors not referred to above could affect the accuracy of our forward-\nlooking statements and (2) use caution when considering our forward-looking statements.\nCompany Overview\nThe Company is a leading provider of protective films and coatings, including automotive paint protection film, surface protection film, automotive\nand commercial/residential window films, and ceramic coatings with a global footprint, a network of trained installers and proprietary DAP software.\nThe Company is dedicated to exceeding customer expectations by providing high-quality products, leading customer service, expert technical\nsupport and world-class training.\nThe Company began as a software company designing vehicle patterns used to produce cut-to-fit protective film for the painted surfaces of\nautomobiles. In 2007, we began selling automotive surface and paint protection film products to complement our software business. In 2011, we\nintroduced our\n17\nULTIMATE protective film product line which, at the time was the industry’s first protective film with self-healing properties. The ULTIMATE\ntechnology allows the protective film to better absorb the impacts from rocks and other road debris, thereby fully protecting the vehicle. The film is\ndescribed as “self-healing” due to its ability to return to its original state after damage from surface scratches. The launch of the ULTIMATE product\ncatapulted the Company into several years of strong revenue growth.\nOur over-arching strategic philosophy stems from our view that being closer to the end customer in terms of our channel strategy affords us a\nbetter opportunity to efficiently introduce new products and deliver tremendous value which, in turn, drives more revenue growth for the Company.\nStrategic Overview\nXPEL continues to pursue several key strategic initiatives to drive continued growth. Our global expansion strategy includes establishing a local\npresence where possible, allowing us to better control the delivery of our products and services. We also add locally based regional sales personnel,\nleveraging local knowledge and relationships to expand the markets in which we operate.\nWe seek to increase global brand awareness in strategically important areas, including pursuing high visibility at premium events such as major\ncar shows and high value placement in advertising media consumed by car enthusiasts, to help further expand the Company’s premium brand.\nXPEL also continues to expand its delivery channels by acquiring select installation facilities in key markets and acquiring international partners\nto enhance our global reach. As we expand globally, we strive to tailor our distribution model to adapt to target markets. We believe this flexibility\nallows us to penetrate and grow market share more efficiently. Our acquisition strategy centers on our belief that the closer the Company is to its end\ncustomers, the greater its ability to drive increased product sales. We believe our channel strategy uniquely positions us to be wherever the demand\ntakes us and is a key part of our ability to drive sustained growth.\nWe also continue to drive expansion of our non-automotive product portfolio. Our architectural window film segment continues to gain traction.\nWe believe there are multiple uses for protective films and we continue to explore those adjacent market opportunities.\nKey Business Metric - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur management regularly monitors certain financial measures to track the progress of our business against internal goals and targets. We\nbelieve that the most important measure to the Company is Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (“EBITDA”).\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe EBITDA provides helpful information with respect to our operating performance as viewed\nby management, including a view of our business that is not dependent on (i) the impact of our capitalization structure and (ii) items that are not part\nof our day-to-day operations. Management uses EBITDA (1) to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis, (2) to calculate incentive\ncompensation for our employees, (3) for planning purposes including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget, (4) to evaluate the\nperformance and effectiveness of our operational strategies, and (5) to assess compliance with various metrics associated with the agreements\ngoverning our indebtedness. Accordingly, we believe that EBITDA provides useful information in understanding and evaluating our operating\nperformance in the same manner as management. We define EBITDA as net income plus (a) total depreciation and amortization, (b) interest\nexpense, net, and (c) income tax expense.\n18\nThe following table is a reconciliation of Net income to EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in\nthousands):\n(Unaudited) (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\nNet Income $ 14,892 $ 13,656 9.1 % $ 36,591 $ 40,830 (10.4)%\nInterest 97 85 14.1 % 962 946 1.7 %\nTaxes 3,730 3,490 6.9 % 9,033 10,553 (14.4)%\nDepreciation 1,504 1,199 25.4 % 4,308 3,229 33.4 %\nAmortization 1,475 1,288 14.5 % 4,327 3,660 18.2 %\nEBITDA $ 21,698 $ 19,718 10.0 % $ 55,221 $ 59,218 (6.7)%\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. It is\nnot a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to revenue or net income, as applicable,\nor any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other\nbusinesses. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating\nresults as reported under GAAP.\nEBITDA does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of ongoing operations; and\nother companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023 (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended % Three Months Ended % $ %\nSeptember 30, 2024 of Total Revenue September 30, 2023 of Total Revenue Change Change\nTotal revenue $ 112,852 100.0 % $ 102,677 100.0 % $ 10,175 9.9 %\nTotal cost of sales 64,936 57.5 % 61,148 59.6 % 3,788 6.2 %\nGross margin 47,916 42.5 % 41,529 40.4 % 6,387 15.4 %\nTotal operating expenses 29,529 26.2 % 23,900 23.3 % 5,629 23.6 %\nOperating income 18,387 16.3 % 17,629 17.2 % 758 4.3 %\nOther (income) expense (235) (0.2)% 483 0.5 % (718) (148.7)%\nIncome tax 3,730 3.3 % 3,490 3.4 % 240 6.9 %\nNet income $ 14,892 13.2 % $ 13,656 13.3 % $ 1,236 9.1 %\n19\nNine Months Ended % Nine Months Ended % $ %\nSeptember 30, 2024 of Total Revenue September 30, 2023 of Total Revenue Change Change\nTotal revenue $ 312,873 100.0 % $ 290,755 100.0 % $ 22,118 7.6 %\nTotal cost of sales 179,216 57.3 % 169,273 58.2 % 9,943 5.9 %\nGross margin 133,657 42.7 % 121,482 41.8 % 12,175 10.0 %\nTotal operating expenses 86,855 27.8 % 68,734 23.6 % 18,121 26.4 %\nOperating income 46,802 15.0 % 52,748 18.1 % (5,946) (11.3)%\nOther expense 1,178 0.4 % 1,365 0.5 % (187) (13.7)%\nIncome tax 9,033 2.9 % 10,553 3.6 % (1,520) (14.4)%\nNet income $ 36,591 11.7 % $ 40,830 14.0 % $ (4,239) (10.4)%\nThe following table summarizes revenue results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, % % of Total Revenue\n2024 2023 Inc (Dec) 2024 2023\nProduct Revenue\nPaint protection film $ 60,545 $ 58,977 2.7 % 53.6 % 57.4 %\nWindow film 22,627 18,762 20.6 % 20.1 % 18.3 %\nOther 3,778 3,386 11.6 % 3.3 % 3.3 %\nTotal $ 86,950 $ 81,125 7.2 % 77.0 % 79.0 %\nService Revenue\nSoftware $ 2,041 $ 1,652 23.5 % 1.8 % 1.6 %\nCutbank credits 4,500 4,524 (0.5)% 4.0 % 4.4 %\nInstallation labor 18,925 14,852 27.4 % 16.8 % 14.5 %\nTraining and other 436 524 (16.8)% 0.4 % 0.5 %\nTotal $ 25,902 $ 21,552 20.2 % 23.0 % 21.0 %\nTotal $ 112,852 $ 102,677 9.9 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\n20\nNine Months Ended September 30, % % of Total Revenue\n2024 2023 Inc (Dec) 2024 2023\nProduct Revenue\nPaint protection film $ 166,870 $ 165,016 1.1 % 53.3 % 56.8 %\nWindow film 59,195 54,055 9.5 % 18.9 % 18.6 %\nOther 10,937 10,268 6.5 % 3.5 % 3.5 %\nTotal $ 237,002 $ 229,339 3.3 % 75.7 % 78.9 %\nService Revenue\nSoftware $ 5,959 $ 4,656 28.0 % 1.9 % 1.6 %\nCutbank credits 13,300 13,253 0.4 % 4.3 % 4.6 %\nInstallation labor 55,090 41,781 31.9 % 17.6 % 14.4 %\nTraining and other 1,522 1,726 (11.8)% 0.5 % 0.6 %\nTotal $ 75,871 $ 61,416 23.5 % 24.3 % 21.1 %\nTotal $ 312,873 $ 290,755 7.6 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nBecause many of our international customers require us to ship their orders to freight forwarders located in the United States, we cannot be\ncertain about the ultimate destination of the product.

Product revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 7.2% over the three months ended September\n30, 2023. Product revenue represented 77.0% of our total revenue compared to 79.0% in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue\nfrom our paint protection film product line increased 2.7% over the three months ended September 30, 2023. Paint protection film sales represented\n53.6% and 57.4% of our total consolidated revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The total increase in\npaint protection film sales was due to increased demand for our film products across multiple regions offset by lower sales into China. Sales into\nChina continue to be negatively impacted as our distributor continues to work through excess inventory levels accumulated in the fourth quarter last\nyear.\nRevenue from our window film product line grew 20.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Window film sales represented 20.1% and 18.3% of our total consolidated revenues for the three months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase was driven by continued demand resulting from increased product adoption in multiple regions.\nArchitectural window film revenue increased 6.2% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, to $2.9 million, and represented 12.6%\nof total window film revenue and 2.5% of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was due mainly to increased\nproduct awareness and adoption in multiple regions.\nOther product revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 11.6% compared to the three months ended September 30,\n2023 due primarily to continued growth in revenue from our FUSION product line. Revenue for our FUSION product line for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was $1.7 million compared to $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nGeographically, we experienced continued growth in most of our regions including 9.4% growth in the US region. These increases were primarily\ndue to increasing product awareness and adoption.\nProduct revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 3.3% over the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Product\nrevenue represented 75.7% of our consolidated revenue compared to 78.9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Window film sales represented 18.9% and\n18.6% of our total consolidated revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase was driven by\ncontinued demand\n22\nresulting from increased product adoption in multiple regions. Architectural window film revenue increased 20.7% compared to the nine months\nended September 30, 2023 to $7.7 million and represented 13.1% of total window film revenue and 2.5% of total revenue.

This represented\n20.0% and 17.2% of our total consolidated revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These increases were\nprimarily due to increased demand across our dealership services and OEM networks. Total installation revenue increased 31.9% over the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. This represented 21.0% and 17.1% of our total consolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively. These increases were primarily due to increased demand across our dealership services and OEM networks. Adjusted\nproduct revenue, which combines the cutbank credit revenue service component with product revenue, increased 6.8% over the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Adjusted product revenue increased 3.2% over the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales consists of product costs and the costs to provide our services. Product costs consist of material costs, personnel costs related to\nwarehouse personnel, shipping costs, warranty costs and other related costs to provide products to our customers. Cost of service includes the labor\ncosts associated with installation of product in our installation facilities, costs of labor associated with pattern design for our cutting software and the\ncosts incurred to provide training for our customers.\nProduct costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 4.0% over the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of\nproduct sales represented 47.8% and 50.5% of total revenue in the\n23\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cost of service revenue grew 18.3% during the three months ended September\n30, 2024. For both product and service, cost of sales increased commensurate with the related growth in revenue. Refer to the Gross Margin section\nbelow for discussion of this cost relative to revenue.\nProduct costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.6% over the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of product\nsales represented 47.1% and 49.4% of total revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

This represented\n57.7% and 57.0% of total service revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These increases in service gross\nmargin and service gross margin percentage were primarily due to operating leverage across our installation networks.\nService gross margin increased approximately $8.3 million, or 23.1%, over the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This represented 58.0%\nand 58.2% of total service revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 37.6% compared to the same period in 2023. This\nincrease was primarily due to increased personnel and marketing costs including additional sponsorships and increased marketing efforts to\ndealerships and end customers. These expenses represented 9.4% and 7.5% of total consolidated revenue for the three months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales and marketing expenses increased 38.8% compared to the same period in 2023.

This increase\nin cost was due primarily to increases in personnel, occupancy costs and professional fees. These costs represented 17.8% and 15.9% of total\nconsolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $0.2 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nOur effective tax rate was 20.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 20.4% for the three months ended September 30,\n2023.\nIncome tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $1.5 million from the same period in 2023, Our effective tax rate\nwas 19.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 20.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNet Income\nNet income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 9.1% to $14.9 million.\nNet income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 10.4% to $36.6 million.\n25\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows provided by operations, and borrowings under our credit\nfacilities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $21.0 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash\nprovided by operations was $41.5 million. We currently have $128.3 million of credit available to us under our U.S. and Canadian credit facilities. We\nexpect available cash, internally generated funds, and borrowings from our committed credit facilities to be sufficient to support working capital\nneeds, capital expenditures (including acquisitions), and other obligations. We are focused on continuing to generate positive operating cash to fund\nour operational and capital investment initiatives. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to operate for at least the next 12 months from the date of\nfiling this report.\nOperating activities. Cash provided by operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $41.5 million compared to $38.5 million\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in cash flows from operating activities was mainly due reductions in inventory\npurchases during the year offset by other changes in working capital.\nInvesting activities. Cash used in investing activities totaled approximately $13.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to $10.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due primarily to higher acquisition-related\npayments during 2024.\nFinancing activities. Cash flows used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $19.2 million compared to\n$26.2 million during the same period in the prior year. This change was due primarily to the timing of repayments on our credit facility, which was fully\nrepaid at September 30, 2024.\nDebt and contingent obligations as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled approximately $1.4 million and $19.9 million,\nrespectively.\nFuture Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements\nWe expect to fund ongoing operating expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, interest payments, tax payments, credit facility maturities,\nfuture lease obligations, and payments for other long-term liabilities with cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility. In the\nshort-term, we are contractually obligated to make lease payments and make payments on contingent liabilities related to certain completed\nacquisitions. In the long-term, we are contractually obligated to make lease payments, for contingent liabilities, and for repayment of borrowings on\nour line of credit. We believe that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents, as well as borrowing capacity, to cover our estimated short-term and\nlong-term funding needs.\nCredit Facilities\nThe Company has a revolving credit facility providing for secured revolving loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $125\nmillion, which is subject to the terms of a credit agreement dated April 6, 2023 (the \"Credit Agreement\"). As of September 30, 2024, no balance was\noutstanding under the Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2023, the Company had an outstanding balance of $19 million under the Credit\nAgreement.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at XPEL’s option, at a rate equal to either (a) Base Rate or (b) Adjusted Term SOFR.\nIn addition to the applicable interest rate, the Credit Agreement includes a commitment fee ranging from 0.20% to 0.25% per annum for the unused\nportion of the aggregate commitment and an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.50% for Base Rate Loans and 1.00% to 1.50% for Adjusted\nTerm SOFR Loans. At September 30, 2024, these rates were 8.0% and 6.3%, respectively. Both the margin applicable to the interest rate and the\ncommitment fee are dependent\n26\non XPEL’s Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio. The Credit Agreement's maturity date is April 6, 2026. All capitalized terms in this description of the\nCredit Agreement that are not otherwise defined in this report have the meaning assigned to them in the Credit Agreement.\nObligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority perfected security interest, subject to certain permitted encumbrances, in\nall of XPEL’s material property and assets.\nThe terms of the Credit Agreement include certain affirmative and negative covenants that require, among other things, XPEL to maintain legal\nexistence and remain in good standing, comply with applicable laws, maintain accounting records, deliver financial statements and certifications on a\ntimely basis, pay taxes as required by law, and maintain insurance coverage, as well as to forgo certain specified future activities that might\notherwise encumber XPEL. The Credit Agreement provides for 2 financial covenants, as follows:\nAs of the last day of each fiscal quarter:\n1. XPEL shall not allow its Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio to exceed 3.50 to 1.00, and\n2. XPEL shall not allow its Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio to be less than 3.00 to 1.00\nThe Company also has a CAD $4.5 million revolving credit facility through HSBC Bank Canada, and is maintained by XPEL Canada Corp., a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of XPEL. This Canadian facility is utilized to fund the Company's working capital needs in Canada. This facility bears\ninterest at HSBC Canada Bank’s prime rate plus 0.25% per annum and is guaranteed by the parent company. As of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, no balance was outstanding on this line of credit.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThere have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates from the information provided in the Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\nRelated Party Relationships\nThere are no family relationships between or among any of our directors or executive officers. There are no arrangements or understandings\nbetween any two or more of our directors or executive officers, and there is no arrangement, plan or understanding as to whether non-management\nstockholders will exercise their voting rights to continue to elect the current Board. There are also no arrangements, agreements or understandings\nbetween non-management stockholders that may directly or indirectly participate in or influence the management of our affairs.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe have operations that expose us to currency risk in the British Pound Sterling, the Canadian Dollar, the Euro, the Mexican Peso, the New\nTaiwanese Dollar, the Australian Dollar, the Indian Rupee and the Chinese Yuan. Amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into\nU.S. Dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss, a component of stockholders’ equity in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. We do not currently hedge our exposure to\npotential foreign currency translation adjustments.\nBorrowings under our revolving lines of credit or our Credit Agreement (see Note 8) are subject to market risk resulting from changes in interest\nrates related to our floating rate bank credit facilities. For such borrowings, a hypothetical 200 basis point increase in variable interest rates may\nresult in a material\n27\nimpact to our financial statements. We do not currently have any derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk. During each of the\nperiods presented, we have not experienced a significant effect on our business due to changes in interest rates.\nIf our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price\nincreases. Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe have established and maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that\ninformation required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\"Exchange\nAct\"), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information\nis accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as\nappropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nManagement, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on\nsuch evaluation, our CEO and CFO have each concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the\nExchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such\ninformation is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosures.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above.\nManagement does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no\nmatter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its\nobjectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or\nthat all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or\nare reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n28\nPart II. Other Information\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we are made parties to actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the ordinary conduct of our\nbusiness, including those pertaining to commercial disputes, product liability, patent infringement and employment matters.\nOn August 8,2024, a securities class action complaint, Greg Adishian v. XPEL, Inc., et. al., case number 5:24-cv-00873, was filed against the\nCompany in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The Complaint names as defendants the Company and certain of its\nofficers for making false and misleading statements regarding the Company's financial outlook. Management intends to vigorously defend against\nthis action.\nWhile we believe that a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows from any such future claims or potential\nclaims is unlikely, given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, it is possible that this action or another unforeseen future adverse ruling or unfavorable\ndevelopment could result in future charges that could have a material adverse impact. We do and will continue to periodically reexamine our\nestimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on\nexperience and developments in litigation. As a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on our financial position, results of operations\nand cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements could change in the future.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThere have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item IA of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nNone.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNot applicable.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Other Information\nOn August 20, 2024 Ryan Pape, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company adopted a 10b5-1 plan which is\ndesigned to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c).
