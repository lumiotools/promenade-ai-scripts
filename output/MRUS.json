(PTx), a private, fully-integrated biotechnology company with a focus in hematology and oncology, today announced they have entered into an agreement in which Merus has exclusively licensed to PTx the right to commercialize zenocutuzumab (Zeno) for the treatment of NRG1 fusion-positive (NRG1+) cancer in the United States (U.S.).\n\n“We are thrilled to work with the seasoned team at PTx to advance our mission to bring Zeno to patients with NRG1+ cancer,” said Shannon Campbell, Chief Commercial Officer of Merus. “We believe PTx is an ideal partner to support Zeno given their oncology commercialization expertise and executive team’s deep understanding and experience with NRG1+ cancer.”\n\n“Zeno has the potential to be the first and only targeted therapy for patients with NRG1+ non-small cell lung and pancreatic cancer, and may offer a substantial improvement over currently available therapies,” said Sarah Kurz, President and Chief Operating Officer of PTx. “ We are grateful to Merus for their development of Zeno, which has the potential to fill an unmet medical need for these patients.”\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, following a specified transition period, PTx will assume full rights to U.S. commercialization of Zeno for the treatment of NRG1+ cancer. In exchange for the rights granted under the license agreement, Merus will receive an upfront payment and is eligible to receive milestones and high single-digit to low double-digit royalty payments based on the annual net sales of Zeno in NRG1+ cancer in the U.S. for any potential future sales.\n\nA Biologics License Application for Zeno is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with previously treated NRG1+ non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer.\n\n**About Zeno** Zeno is a Biclonics® that utilizes the Merus Dock & Block® mechanism to inhibit the neuregulin/HER3 tumor-signaling pathway in solid tumors with NRG1 fusions (NRG1+ cancer). Through its unique mechanism of binding to HER2 and potently blocking the interaction of HER3 with its ligand NRG1 or NRG1-fusion proteins, Zeno has the potential to be particularly effective against NRG1+ cancer. In preclinical studies, Zeno potently inhibits HER2/HER3 heterodimer formation thereby inhibiting oncogenic signaling pathways, leading to inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and blocking tumor cell survival. In clinical studies, Zeno has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in multiple types of NRG1+ cancer, including NRG1+ NSCLC and NRG1+ PDAC.\n\n**About NRG1 Fusions** The NRG1 gene encodes neuregulin (also known as heregulin), the ligand for HER3. Fusions between NRG1 and partner genes are rare, tumorigenic genomic events occurring in patients with certain cancer types including NSCLC and PDAC.\n\n**About Partner Therapeutics** Partner Therapeutics, Inc. (PTx), an integrated biotechnology company, focuses on development and commercialization of therapeutics to improve health outcomes in cancer and other serious diseases. The company believes in delivering products and supporting medical teams with the purpose of achieving superior outcomes for patients and their families.

These cancers begin when healthy cells change and grow in an unchecked manner, ultimately forming tumors. HNSCC is generally associated with tobacco consumption, alcohol use and/or HPV infections, depending on where they develop geographically. HNSCC is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and it is estimated that there were more than 930,000 new cases and over 465,000 deaths from HNSCC globally in 2020.¹ The incidence of HNSCC continues to rise and is anticipated to increase by 30% to more than 1 million new cases annually by 2030.² HNSCC is a serious and life-threatening disease with poor prognosis despite currently available standard of care therapies.\n\n_¹ Sung et al.

The trial is open to adult patients eligible to receive pembrolizumab as 1L monotherapy with tumors expressing PD-L1, CPS ≥1. The primary endpoints are overall response rate as assessed by BICR based on RECIST v1.1 and overall survival. Secondary endpoints are duration of response and progression free survival. Merus plans to enroll approximately 500 patients in the trial. \n\n**About Petosemtamab**[Petosemtamab](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=lwFCVmVnVBkYYEX_i-wnroGqYWhhtyJ2-k0fRDdUfM7LtDf_ZYpi3z-Jv3ckVxOtNDrgd7iVS9OIHQUCrC3hgQ==), or MCLA-158, is a Biclonics® low-fucose human full-length IgG1 antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the leucine-rich repeat containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5). Petosemtamab is designed to exhibit three independent mechanisms of action including inhibition of EGFR-dependent signaling, LGR5 binding leading to EGFR internalization and degradation in cancer cells, and enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) activity.\n\n**About Head and Neck Cancer** Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) describes a group of cancers that develop in the squamous cells that line the mucosal surfaces of the mouth, throat, and larynx. These cancers begin when healthy cells change and grow in an unchecked manner, ultimately forming tumors. HNSCC is generally associated with tobacco consumption, alcohol use and/or HPV infections, depending on where they develop geographically. HNSCC is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and it is estimated that there were more than 930,000 new cases and over 465,000 deaths from HNSCC globally in 2020.1 The incidence of HNSCC continues to rise and is anticipated to increase by 30% to more than 1 million new cases annually by 2030.2 HNSCC is a serious and life-threatening disease with poor prognosis despite currently available standard of care therapies.1  _Sung et al.

The presentation at ESMO® Asia will include updated efficacy, durability and safety data from that initial 2L+ HNSCC cohort along with interim data from the dose optimization cohort evaluating petosemtamab monotherapy 1500 or 1100 mg dose levels in 2L+ HNSCC.\n\nMerus has confirmed through feedback with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that petosemtamab 1500 mg every two weeks is appropriate for further development in HNSCC as monotherapy, and in combination with pembrolizumab.\n\nMerus is currently enrolling LiGeR-HN2, a phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of petosemtamab compared to investigator’s choice of single agent chemotherapy or cetuximab in previously treated (2/3L) patients with r/m HNSCC and plans to initiate LiGeR-HN1, a phase 3 trial evaluating petosemtamab in combination with pembrolizumab in frontline (1L) HNSCC by year end 2024.\n\n**About Petosemtamab**[Petosemtamab](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=pO-X6QzV4E4PteOjKn1mAfCkeCqiN-rmm5jHw0s6gYcq-DXyHqCRKHYXtYky_d7jq-IGR1au1whCxP10oUii5w==), or MCLA-158, is a bispecific Biclonics® low-fucose human full-length IgG1 antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the leucine-rich repeat containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5). Petosemtamab is designed to exhibit three independent mechanisms of action including inhibition of EGFR-dependent signaling, LGR5 binding leading to EGFR internalization and degradation in cancer cells, and enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) activity.\n\n**About LiGeR-HN2** LiGeR-HN2, a phase 3 trial, will evaluate the safety and efficacy of petosemtamab compared to investigator’s choice of methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab in 2/3L r/m HNSCC patients. The trial is open to adult patients that have progressed on or after anti-PD-1 therapy and platinum-containing therapy. The primary endpoints are overall response rate as assessed by BICR based on RECIST v1.1 and overall survival. Secondary endpoints are duration of response and progression free survival. Merus plans to enroll approximately 500 patients in the trial.\n\n**About Merus N.V.**[Merus](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=kv3jXM6hmMTlogV_pPtynvhB8I11UB8zFiXXz4G9id5J646_qFl6CEZezPL4gt6WkVLKHlVJ5CoBJ6pB__dc5g==) is a clinical-stage oncology company developing innovative full-length human bispecific and trispecific antibody therapeutics, referred to as [Multiclonics®.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4HyG50lalypYFGIqMINbxuYTSH3DA7gdg2iXNtqa1wFivKW6unJVJAJ0sthDzDHyOIA1PhQDN_Gz2Dy6JT26gtp9DNGQXiXqlAHer8FWYeZ1ySL1z7puUOup1ARPAXH8) Multiclonics® are manufactured using industry standard processes and have been observed in preclinical and clinical studies to have several of the same features of conventional human monoclonal antibodies, such as long half-life and low immunogenicity.

(Nasdaq: MRUS) (Merus, the Company, we, or our), a clinical-stage oncology company developing innovative, full-length multispecific antibodies (Biclonics® and Triclonics®), today announced the publication of an abstract highlighting the preclinical evaluation of the bispecific antibody zenocutuzumab (Zeno) for poster presentation at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024 taking place in San Diego, CA April 5-10, 2024.\n\nThe abstract describes Zeno’s activity in preclinical models representing different tumor types expressing high neuregulin 1 (NRG1) levels. High NRG1 expression is associated with poorer prognosis in certain cancers and resistance to standard therapies. The anti-tumor efficacy of Zeno in vivo against a panel of 28 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models representing different tumor types was examined. The results show that Zeno significantly inhibited tumor growth in seven high-NRG1-expressing PDX models representing multiple different tumor types.\n\n**Presentation Details:**\n\n**Title:** Zenocutuzumab, a HER2xHER3 bispecific antibody, is effective in cancer models with high NRG1 expression.**Session Category:** Experimental and Molecular Therapeutics**Session:** Antibody-Drug Conjugates and Bispecific Antibodies**Date:** Monday, April 8, 2024**Time:** 9:00 am-12:30 p.m. PT**Location:** Poster Section 23**Poster #:** 14**Abstract #:** 1903\n\nThe full abstract is available on the AACR [website](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=lF84v_Db-nJjOve5M93jPoPNS6tvg4ONhDKrFQd9XCEwhTIc_eLqB7z3kPutrFkHmlV-nPtxs4Z-0_6gi3plTX59Pi4TGS5aLv3z1usUn0uLk06dPvnWgPGLIhBfH4CT).

Based on recent productive and collaborative discussions with the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, we believe we will have sufficient clinical data in the first half of 2024 to support potential Biologics License Application submissions in NRG1+ non-small cell lung cancer and NRG1+ pancreatic cancer.\n\n**About Zeno** Zeno is an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)-enhanced Biclonics® that utilizes the Merus Dock & Block® mechanism to inhibit the neuregulin/HER3 tumor-signaling pathway in solid tumors with NRG1 gene fusions (NRG1+ cancer). Through its unique mechanism of binding to HER2 and potently blocking the interaction of HER3 with its ligand NRG1 or NRG1-fusion proteins, Zeno has the potential to be particularly effective against NRG1+ cancer. In preclinical studies, Zeno also potently inhibits HER2/HER3 heterodimer formation and tumor growth in models harboring NRG1 fusions.\n\n**About Merus N.V.**[Merus](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yiNME5asB-oIyF4NXc5gdAYc_vGwqj-qn5RnEVRyAMwmPYJ8DsWwe7GGckR8sZo6nhN9zMNZc06Ht4HDPB7SLw==) is a clinical-stage oncology company developing innovative full-length human bispecific and trispecific antibody therapeutics, referred to as [Multiclonics®](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3ceUHI9SXnDKG9zsfg01cR_7JwO-9pO-URjF8DLf12d-zM-O_G_QnloIGygHtlENTjSjXhg1T-u48AET_QFbX8mAWn6QPk8psCOiLU5BC1-Dv1A0tdeGogk4QnI6fDlq).

For petosemtamab, we plan to start a phase 3 registration trial in 2L+ HNSCC in mid-2024. In the first-line setting, we plan to provide initial data on the combination with pembrolizumab in the second quarter and are preparing for a potential first-line phase 3 trial. This year, we also plan to evaluate petosemtamab in 2L colorectal cancer,” said Bill Lundberg, M.D., President, Chief Executive Officer of Merus. “Additionally, for Zeno we are preparing our first potential BLA submissions in NRG1+ lung and NRG1+ pancreatic cancer. We are also excited by continued enhancements to our productive Multiclonics® platforms, which serve as our engine to develop innovative antibodies both for our own pipeline and for our collaborators.”\n\n**_Petosemtamab (MCLA-158: EGFR x LGR5 Biclonics®): Solid Tumors_** _Phase 3 registration trial in 2L+ head & neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) on track to initiate mid-2024; dose comparison of petosemtamab monotherapy 1100 vs 1500 mg in previously treated (2L+) HNSCC ongoing; evaluation in combination with pembrolizumab as first-line (1L) therapy ongoing; planned initiation of 2L colorectal cancer (CRC) cohort in 2024_\n\nMerus plans to initiate a phase 3 clinical trial in mid-2024 to evaluate petosemtamab monotherapy in 2L+ HNSCC. In the planned trial, patients will be randomized to petosemtamab monotherapy or investigators’ choice of single agent chemotherapy or cetuximab. Merus believes a randomized registration trial in HNSCC with an overall response rate (ORR) endpoint could potentially support accelerated approval and the overall survival (OS) results from the same study could potentially verify its clinical benefit to support regular approval.\n\nMerus continues to evaluate approximately 40 patients treated with petosemtamab monotherapy at either 1100 or 1500 mg dose levels to confirm a suitable dose for future potential phase 3 trials. Merus plans to share clinical data from this cohort in the second half of 2024. \n\nMerus also continues to evaluate patients with untreated advanced PD-L1+ HNSCC treated with petosemtamab 1500 mg in combination with pembrolizumab. Initial safety data from this single arm cohort may support the initiation of a 1L phase 3 trial with this combination. Among the initial patients dosed in the 1L combination cohort, the safety profile has been observed to be generally favorable. Merus plans to report initial interim efficacy and safety data from this cohort in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nAt the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2023, Merus provided interim data on 49 2L+ HNSCC patients that were treated with petosemtamab at the recommended phase 2 dose of 1500 mg intravenous every two weeks. 43 patients were evaluable for efficacy. As of a February 1, 2023 data cutoff date, the ORR was 37.2% by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 per investigator assessment. Petosemtamab continued to demonstrate a manageable safety profile. Merus plans to provide updated efficacy, durability and safety data of this cohort in the second half of 2024.\n\nThe U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track Designation (FTD) for petosemtamab for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC whose disease has progressed following treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) antibody. FTD is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill unmet medical needs.\n\nIn 2024, Merus is planning to initiate the evaluation of petosemtamab monotherapy in 2L CRC.\n\n**_Zenocutuzumab (Zeno or MCLA-128: HER2 x HER3 Biclonics®): NRG1 fusion-positive (NRG1+) lung, pancreatic and other solid tumors_** _Sufficient clinical data expected in 1H24 to support potential BLA submissions in NRG1+__non-small cell lung cancer_ _(NSCLC) and NRG1+__pancreatic cancer_ _(PDAC)_\n\nZeno is being investigated in the phase 1/2 eNRGy trial and Early Access Program (EAP) which are assessing the safety and anti-tumor activity of Zeno monotherapy in NRG1+ cancer.\n\nIn 2023, Merus met with the FDA and based on these productive and collaborative discussions, the Company believes it will have sufficient clinical data in the first half of 2024 to support potential Biologics License Application (BLA) submissions in NRG1+ NSCLC and NRG1+ PDAC.\n\nMerus believes that obtaining a commercialization partnership agreement will be an essential step in bringing Zeno to patients with NRG1+ cancer, if approved.\n\nIn 2023, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) to Zeno for the treatment of patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic NRG1+ pancreatic cancer following progression with prior systemic therapy or who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. Additionally, the FDA granted BTD to Zeno for the treatment of patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic NRG1+ NSCLC, following progression with prior systemic therapy.\n\nMerus shared updated interim clinical data on our Zeno program (eNRGy trial and EAP) in patients with NRG1+ NSCLC and NRG1+ PDAC at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2023. In 78 evaluable NRG1+ NSCLC patients, as of a July 31, 2023 data cutoff date, a 37% ORR per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment and 14.9 months median duration of response (DOR) was reported. In 33 evaluable NRG1+ PDAC patients, a 42% ORR per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment and 9.1 months median DOR was reported. Zeno continued to demonstrate a well-tolerated safety profile.\n\nMerus also evaluated patients with castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) treated with Zeno in combination with an androgen deprivation therapy (enzalutamide or abiraterone), irrespective of NRG1+ status. Enrollment is complete and Merus plans to continue monitoring these patients. The Company also continues to monitor and evaluate patients treated with Zeno in combination with afatinib but no further enrollment is planned at this time.\n\nThe Company is also conducting ongoing translational work on potential biomarkers outside of NRG1+ cancer which may support development opportunities for Zeno in additional areas of unmet need. \n\n**_MCLA-129 (EGFR x c-MET Biclonics®): Solid Tumors_** _Investigation of MCLA-129 continues in the MET ex14 NSCLC expansion cohort in the phase 1/2 trial; MCLA-129 in combination with chemotherapy in 2L+ EGFR mutant (EGFRm) NSCLC planned to start in 2024_\n\nMCLA-129 is in clinical development in a phase 1/2, open-label clinical trial evaluating MCLA-129 monotherapy in patients with MET ex14 NSCLC and Merus plans to start a cohort of MCLA-129 in combination with chemotherapy in 2L+ EGFRm NSCLC in 2024.\n\nIn December at the ESMO Asia Congress 2023 interim data was presented on MCLA-129 from ongoing expansion cohorts in NSCLC and in previously treated HNSCC. Patients with advanced/metastatic EGFRm NSCLC were treated with MCLA-129 combined with osimertinib as first-line therapy or in the 2L+ setting after progression on osimertinib. In the 1L setting, all 16 evaluable patients experienced tumor shrinkage. In the 2L+ setting, 34 patients were evaluable for response with 11 experiencing confirmed PRs and 1 unconfirmed PR by RECIST v1.1. per investigator assessment. We continue to monitor these patients and evaluate potential for biomarkers to maximize efficacy, while proactively addressing safety signals seen to date.\n\nWe also remain interested in exploring partnering MCLA-129 with other companies to sufficiently resource the development of MCLA-129 and potential benefit it may have for patients.\n\nMCLA-129 is subject to a collaboration and license agreement with Betta Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. (Betta), which permits Betta to develop MCLA-129 and potentially commercialize exclusively in China, while Merus retains global rights outside of China.\n\n**_MCLA-145 (CD137 x PD-L1 Biclonics®): Solid Tumors_** _Investigation continues of the phase 1 trial of MCLA-145 in combination with pembrolizumab_\n\nMCLA-145 is in clinical development in a global, phase 1, open-label, clinical trial evaluating MCLA-145 in patients with solid tumors. The trial is in the dose expansion phase, with the Company monitoring and evaluating patients on treatment with the combination of MCLA-145 with pembrolizumab.\n\n**_Collaborations_**\n\n**_Incyte Corporation_** Since 2017, Merus has been working with Incyte Corporation (Incyte) under a global collaboration and license agreement focused on the research, discovery and development of bispecific antibodies utilizing Merus’ proprietary Biclonics® technology platform. The agreement grants Incyte certain exclusive rights for up to ten bispecific and monospecific antibody programs. The collaboration is progressing, with multiple programs in various stages of preclinical and clinical development. For each program under the collaboration, Merus receives reimbursement for research activities and is eligible to receive potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones and sales royalties for any products, if approved. Further, Incyte announced, in 2023, that INCA33890, a novel TGFBr2xPD-1 bispecific antibody developed through the collaboration is currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Merus achieved a milestone and received a payment of $2.5 million related to the advancement of this program in the third quarter of 2023. Merus also achieved an additional milestone of $1 million for candidate nomination in the fourth quarter of 2023. This is the third program to undergo candidate nomination under the collaboration.\n\n**_Loxo Oncology at Lilly_** In January 2021, Merus and Loxo Oncology at Lilly, a research and development group of Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly), announced a research collaboration and exclusive license agreement to develop up to three CD3-engaging T-cell re-directing bispecific antibody therapies utilizing Merus’ Biclonics® platform and proprietary CD3 panel along with the scientific and rational drug design expertise of Loxo Oncology at Lilly. The collaboration is progressing with multiple active research programs underway.\n\n**_Cash Runway, existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities expected to fund Merus’ operations into 2027_** As of December 31, 2023, Merus had $411.7 million cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Based on the Company’s current operating plan, the existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are expected to fund Merus’ operations into 2027.\n\n**_Full Year 2024 Financial Results_** Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $2.4 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of increases in Incyte revenue of $2.6 million, and Lilly revenue of $1.0 million, offset by decreases in Other revenue of $1.2 million.

(Nasdaq: MRUS), a clinical-stage oncology company developing innovative, full-length multispecific antibodies (Biclonics® and Triclonics®) for cancer, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for petosemtamab for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) whose disease has progressed following treatment with platinum based chemotherapy and an anti-programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) or anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody. This designation follows receipt of Fast Track Designation for petosemtamab for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC whose disease has progressed following treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) antibody announced in August 2023.\n\nBTD is supported by data from the ongoing phase 1/2 open-label, multicenter trial evaluating petosemtamab monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors, including previously treated (recurrent or metastatic) HNSCC (NCT03526835). Merus plans to provide updated efficacy, durability and safety data from this cohort in the second half of 2024.\n\nBTD is intended to expedite the development and review of a medicine to treat a serious or life-threatening condition, where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on clinically significant endpoints over available therapies. BTD allows for more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program, an organizational commitment involving senior managers, and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review, and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. With this BTD, Merus plans to engage in these discussions with the FDA in an expedited manner as we move toward our goal of a potential Biologics License Application (BLA) submission.\n\n“We are excited and encouraged to receive BTD for petosemtamab which further validates its potential to become a new standard of care for patients with previously treated HNSCC,” said Ashley Pereira, Pharm.D. SVP of Regulatory Affairs at Merus. “We look forward to continued constructive conversations with the FDA as we move forward in our plan to initiate a phase 3 trial in previously treated HNSCC mid-2024 and prepare for a potential phase 3 trial evaluating the combination of petosemtamab and pembrolizumab in previously untreated patients.”\n\n**About Head and Neck Cancer** Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) describes a group of cancers that develop in the squamous cells that line the mucosal surfaces of the mouth, throat, and larynx. These cancers begin when healthy cells change and grow in an unchecked manner, ultimately forming tumors. HNSCC is generally associated with tobacco consumption, alcohol use and/or HPV infections, depending on where they develop geographically. HNSCC is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and it is estimated that there were more than 930,000 new cases and over 465,000 deaths from HNSCC globally in 2020.1 The incidence of HNSCC continues to rise and is anticipated to increase by 30% to more than 1 million new cases annually by 2030.2 HNSCC is a serious and life-threatening disease with poor prognosis despite currently available standard of care therapies.\n\n_1_ _Sung et al.

Petosemtamab is designed to exhibit three independent mechanisms of action including inhibition of EGFR-dependent signaling, LGR5 binding leading to EGFR internalization and degradation in cancer cells, and enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) activity.\n\n**About Merus N.V.**[Merus](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=KvqswOnigEEH02l63Ei4dPBj9ONh3UxqFM5s7p_xzYTcnbFTD0AfYC840_RgvpW7zR1qfArUWSf0V1qvOSKipA==) is a clinical-stage oncology company developing innovative full-length human bispecific and trispecific antibody therapeutics, referred to as [Multiclonics®](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=R7_x-iANTDtkpNrp5wYti6F5HyAvbs7qB6hDQMf9b5YdEfC8IvDqtf3W_sjzmaeEPmWL8mN2RGaragcJpj1sR-W-_FSBHW_dQOZNYsSGXIgmripk2ciV3vbK55suJPuq).
