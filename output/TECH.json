reported its financial results for the first quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**First Quarter FY2025 Highlights**\n\n  * First quarter organic revenue increased by 4% (5% reported) to $289.5 million. \n  * GAAP earnings per share (EPS) was $0.21 versus $0.31 one year ago. Delivered adjusted EPS of $0.42 compared to $0.41 one year ago. \n  * Continued adoption and utilization across the Diagnostics & Spatial Biology (\"DSS\"), formerly Diagnostics & Genomics, portfolio led to 14% organic segment growth (14% reported). \n  * Continued uptake of our cell and gene therapy workflow solutions, including strong growth in our GMP reagent offerings.\n\n\n\nThe Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted net earnings, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted tax rate, organic growth, adjusted operating margin, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures that exclude certain items detailed later in this press release under the heading \"Use of non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Measures.\" A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is included in this press release.\n\n\"The start to fiscal 2025 was largely consistent with our expectations, as a high-level of execution by the Bio-Techne team drove continued momentum across our Diagnostics & Spatial Biology segment,\" said Kim Kelderman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Bio-Techne. \"This was augmented by strong results in our cell and gene therapy business, including robust growth in our GMP reagent portfolio. The strength in cell and gene therapy, combined with favorable year-to-date funding dynamics, gives us increased confidence in the forthcoming recovery in our biotech end market.\"\n\nKelderman added, \"Our growth pillars, as well as our core portfolio, continue to outperform in what has proven to be a prolonged period of challenges facing the industry. The high value this novel portfolio brings to our research and clinical diagnostics customers positions the business for an even stronger future. We remain focused on delivering the solutions our customers rely on to catalyze advances in science and medicine while creating value for all our stakeholders.\"\n\nBio-Techne will host an earnings conference call today, October 30, 2024 at 8:00 a.m. CDT. To listen, please dial 1-877-407-9208 or 1-201-493-6784 for international callers, and reference conference ID 13749405. The earnings call can also be accessed via webcast through the following link <https://investors.bio-techne.com/ir-calendar>.\n\nA recorded rebroadcast will be available for interested parties unable to participate in the live conference call by dialing 1-844-512- 2921 or 1-412-317-6671 (for international callers) and referencing Conference ID 13749405. The replay will be available from 11:00 a.m. CDT on Wednesday, October 30, 2024, until 11:00 p.m. CST on Saturday, November 30, 2024.\n\n**First Quarter Fiscal 2025**\n\n_Revenue_\n\nNet sales for the first quarter increased 5% to $289.5 million. Organic growth was 4% compared to the prior year, with foreign currency exchange impacting sales by approximately 1%. A business held-for-sale did not have a material impact.\n\n_GAAP Earnings Results_\n\nGAAP EPS was $0.21 per diluted share, versus $0.31 in the same quarter last year. GAAP operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased 28% to $40.0 million, compared to $55.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. GAAP operating margin was 13.8%, compared to 20.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Current year GAAP operating margin was unfavorably impacted by restructuring and restructuring-related charges.\n\n_Non-GAAP Earnings Results_\n\nAdjusted EPS increased to $0.42 per diluted share compared to $0.41 in the same quarter last year. Adjusted operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased 4% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Adjusted operating margin was 29.0%, compared to 31.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Adjusted operating margin was impacted by product mix and re-instatement of incentive compensation accruals.\n\n**Segment Results**\n\nManagement uses adjusted operating results to monitor and evaluate performance of the Company's business segments, as highlighted below.\n\n_Protein Sciences Segment_\n\nThe Company's Protein Sciences segment is one of the world's leading suppliers of specialized proteins such as cytokines and growth factors, immunoassays, antibodies and reagents, to the biotechnology and academic research communities. Additionally, the segment provides an array of platforms useful in various areas of protein analysis. Protein Sciences segment's first quarter fiscal 2025 net sales were $204.5 million, which remained flat from sales of $204.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. As of December 31, 2023, a business within the Protein Sciences Segment met the criteria as held-for-sale; this held-for-sale business has been excluded from the segment's fiscal 2025 operating results. The exclusion of first quarter of fiscal 2025 sales related to this held-for-sale business reduced sales by 1%. Organic growth for the segment was 1%, with foreign currency exchange having an immaterial impact. Protein Sciences segment's operating margin was 39.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 43.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The segment's operating margin decreased primarily due to product mix and re-instatement of incentive compensation accruals.\n\n_Diagnostics and Spatial Biology Segment (formerly Diagnostics and Genomics Segment)_\n\nThe Company's Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment provides blood chemistry and blood gas quality controls, hematology instrument controls, immunoassays and other bulk and custom reagents for the in vitro diagnostic market. The Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment also develops and provides spatial biology products as well as exosome-based diagnostics for various pathologies, including prostate cancer. The Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment's first quarter fiscal 2025 net sales were $83.2 million, an increase of 14% from $72.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Organic revenue growth was 14% for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, with foreign currency exchange having an immaterial impact. The Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment's operating margin was 5.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 0.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The segment's operating margin increased due to volume leverage and productivity initiatives, partially offset by re-instatement of incentive compensation accruals.\n\n**Use of non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Measures:**\n\nThis press release contains financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures include:\n\n  * Organic growth\n  * Adjusted diluted earnings per share\n  * Adjusted net earnings\n  * Adjusted tax rate\n  * Adjusted gross margin\n  * Adjusted operating income\n  * Adjusted operating margin\n  * Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)\n  * Adjusted EBITDA\n\n\n\nWe provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measure of organic revenue represents revenue growth excluding revenue from acquisitions within the preceding 12 months, the impact of foreign currency, the impact of businesses held-for-sale, as well as the impact of partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries. Excluding these measures provides more useful period-to-period comparison of revenue results as it excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, which can vary significantly from period to period, and revenue from acquisitions that would not be included in the comparable prior period. Revenues from businesses held-for-sale are excluded from our organic revenue calculation starting on the date they become held-for-sale as those revenues will not be comparative in future periods. Revenues from partially-owned subsidiaries consolidated in our financial statements are also excluded from our organic revenue calculation, as those revenues are not fully attributable to the Company. There was no revenue from partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries in fiscal year 2024 or fiscal year 2025.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures for adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per share basis, exclude stock-based compensation, which is inclusive of the employer portion of payroll taxes on those stock awards, the costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory, amortization of acquisition intangibles, restructuring and restructuring-related costs. Stock-based compensation is excluded from non-GAAP adjusted net earnings because of the nature of this charge, specifically the varying available valuation methodologies, subjection assumptions, variety of award types, and unpredictability of amount and timing of employer related tax obligations. The Company excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments, including costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory, and other non-recurring items including gains or losses on goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, and one-time assessments from this measure because they occur as a result of specific events, and are not reflective of our internal investments, the costs of developing, producing, supporting and selling our products, and the other ongoing costs to support our operating structure. Costs related to restructuring and restructuring-related activities, including reducing overhead and consolidating facilities, are excluded because we believe they are not indicative of our normal operating costs. Additionally, these amounts can vary significantly from period to period based on current activity. The Company also excludes revenue and expense attributable to partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries as well as revenue and expense attributable to businesses held-for-sale in the calculation of our non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nThe Company's non-GAAP adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per share basis, also excludes acquisition related expenses inclusive of the changes in fair value of contingent consideration, and other non-recurring items including certain costs related to the transition to a new CEO, goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, and gains. We also exclude certain litigation charges which are facts and circumstances specific including costs to resolve litigation and legal settlement (gains and losses). In some cases, these costs may be a result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were not probable, inestimable, or unresolved at the time of acquisition. \n\nThe Company's non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per share basis, also excludes gain and losses from investments, as they are not part of our day-to-day operating decisions (excluding our equity method investment in Wilson Wolf as it is certain to be acquired in the future) and certain adjustments to income tax expense. Additionally, gains and losses from investments that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability are excluded. The Company independently calculates a non-GAAP adjusted tax rate to be applied to the identified non-GAAP adjustments considering the impact of discrete items on these adjustments and the jurisdictional mix of the adjustments. In addition, the tax impact of other discrete and non-recurring charges which impact our reported GAAP tax rate are adjusted from net earnings. We believe these tax items can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results.\n\nInvestors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of adjusted financial measures used in this press release to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided with the financial statements attached to this press release.\n\n**Forward Looking Statements:**\n\nOur press releases may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties that may affect the actual results of operations. The following important factors, among others, have affected and, in the future, could affect the Company's actual results: the effect of new branding and marketing initiatives, the integration of new businesses and leadership, the introduction and acceptance of new products, the funding and focus of the types of research by the Company's customers, the impact of the growing number of producers of biotechnology research products and related price competition, general economic conditions, the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations, and the costs and results of research and product development efforts of the Company and of companies in which the Company has invested or with which it has formed strategic relationships.\n\nFor additional information concerning such factors, see the section titled \"Risk Factors\" in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements we make in our press releases due to new information or future events.

The Company follows these policies in preparation of the interim unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements.\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company operated under two operating segments, Protein Sciences and Diagnostics and Spatial Biology\n(formerly Diagnostics and Genomics). The name change is intended to better reflect the focus and scope of our offerings. The manner in which we operate\nour business and review discrete financial information did not change. Segment information presented herein reflects the updated name of the operating\nsegment. The operating segments the Company operated under were consistent with the Company's operating segments disclosed in the Company's Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for fiscal 2024.\nInvestments: In July 2024, the Company paid $15 million to enter into an investment in Spear Bio. This investment is accounted for under the cost-method\nas we own less than 20% of the outstanding stock and we concluded that we do not have significant influence. Under the cost-method, the fair value is not\nestimated if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. No\nsuch events or changes in circumstances were identified in the period ended September 30, 2024. The Company’s total investment of $15 million is\nincluded within Other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nIn December 2021, the Company paid $25 million to enter into a two-part forward contract which requires the Company to make an initial ownership\ninvestment followed by purchase of full equity interest in Wilson Wolf Corporation (Wilson Wolf) if certain annual revenue or annual earnings before\ninterest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) thresholds are met. Wilson Wolf is a leading manufacturer of cell culture devices, including the\nG-Rex product line. The first part of the forward contract is triggered upon Wilson Wolf achieving approximately $92 million in annual revenue or $55\nmillion in EBITDA at any point prior to December 31, 2027. During the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the Company determined that Wilson Wolf had met\nthe EBITDA target. On March 31, 2023, the Company paid an additional $232 million to acquire 19.9% of Wilson Wolf.\nSince the first part of the forward contract has been triggered, the second part of the forward contract will automatically trigger, and requires the Company\nto acquire the remaining equity interest in Wilson Wolf on December 31, 2027 based on a revenue multiple of approximately 4.4 times trailing twelve\nmonth revenue. The second part of the contract would be accelerated in advance of December 31, 2027, if Wilson Wolf meets its second milestone of\napproximately $226 million in annual revenue or $136 million in annual EBITDA. If the second milestone is achieved, the forward contract requires the\nCompany to pay approximately $1 billion plus potential consideration for revenue in excess of the revenue milestone.\nThe investment in Wilson Wolf is accounted for as an equity method investment under ASC 323. The Company initially records its equity method\ninvestments at the amount of the Company’s investment and adjusts each period for the Company’s share of the investee’s income or loss and dividends\npaid. Distributions from the equity method investee are accounted for using the cumulative earnings approach on the Consolidated Statement of Cash\nFlows. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there was $0.3 million of gain recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings and\nComprehensive Income related to the investment. The Company’s total investment of $241 million is included within Other assets on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet.\n4\nTable of Contents\nRestructuring actions: Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs,\nand impairments and disposals of assets associated with such actions. Employee-related severance charges are based upon distributed employment policies\nand substantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is\nwhen management approves the associated actions. Asset impairment and disposal charges include right of use assets, leasehold improvements, and other\nasset write-downs associated with combining operations and disposal of assets. Other charges include consulting fees and expenses for changes to\nsupporting IT systems that are enabling the Company to complete the restructuring activities.\nFiscal Year 2025 Restructuring Actions:\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company announced enterprise-wide restructuring focused on recovering operating margins and optimizing our\nmanufacturing footprint. The Company is expecting to incur costs related to these actions through fiscal 2026, which will be recorded when specified\ncriteria are met. The restructuring and restructuring-related charges for periods presented were recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as\nfollows (in thousands):\nQuarter Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024\nCost of sales $ 4,898\nSelling, general and administrative(1) 5,371\nTotal $ 10,269\n(1) Restructuring actions impacting research and development are not material to separately disclose and have been included within Selling, general and\nadministrative costs.\nRestructuring and restructuring-related costs by segment are as follows (in thousands):\nThree months ended September 30, 2024\nEmployee Asset-related\nseverance and other Total\nProtein Sciences $ 2,274 $ 7,417 $ 9,691\nDiagnostics and Spatial Biology 444 — 444\nCorporate 134 — 134\nTotal $ 2,852 $ 7,417 $ 10,269\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the Company’s accrued restructuring balance, which is included within Other current liabilities in the\naccompanying balance sheet.

These actions impacted approximately 4% of our global workforce. These actions\ncontinued through the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as we incurred charges relating to our business held-for-sale and consulting fees related to optimizing\nefficiency. The Company is expecting to incur costs related to these actions through the second quarter of fiscal 2025, which will be recorded when\nspecified criteria are met.\nAs part of these actions, certain assets and liabilities associated with a disposal group in our Protein Sciences segment were classified as held-for-sale as of\nDecember 31, 2023, including $1.4 million of goodwill allocated to the disposal group on a relative fair value basis. As a result of impairment tests\nperformed over the disposal group during fiscal 2024, a cumulative impairment charge of $22.0 million which includes the allocated goodwill, was\nrecorded in the Selling, general and administrative line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the year ended June 30, 2024. There were no\nimpairment charges related to the disposal group during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the assets remaining within the disposal\ngroup primarily include inventory and property and equipment of $9.5 million, which is net of expected selling costs. These assets are actively marketed,\nand we believe their sale will be completed within 12 months of the held-for-sale classification date. The held-for-sale assets are recorded in Current assets\nheld-for-sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024.\nThe restructuring and restructuring-related charges, including the impairment of assets held-for-sale, for periods presented were recorded in the\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings as follows (in thousands):\nQuarter Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024\nCost of sales $ —\nSelling, general and administrative(1) 753\nTotal $ 753\n(1) Restructuring actions impacting research and development are not material to separately disclose and have been included within Selling, general and\nadministrative costs.\nRestructuring and restructuring-related costs by segment are as follows (in thousands):\nThree months ended September 30, 2024\nEmployee Asset-related\nseverance and other Total\nProtein Sciences $ 14 $ 40 $ 54\nDiagnostics and Spatial Biology — — —\nCorporate (3) 702 699\nTotal $ 11 $ 742 $ 753\n6\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the Company’s accrued restructuring balance, which is included within Other current liabilities in the\naccompanying balance sheet.

Additional actions were taken in June 2023 primarily related to the sales organization. The actions impacted a limited number of\nemployees and were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. As a result of the realignment, a pre-tax charge of $1.7 million related to employee\nseverance was recorded in the Selling, general and administrative line of operating income within our Protein Sciences segment during the year ended June\n30, 2023. Adjustments in fiscal year 2024 relate to the refinement of employee severance payouts. Additional pre-tax charges for the year ended June 30,\n2024 were $0.2 million. Restructuring actions, including cash and non-cash impacts, are as follows (in thousands):\nEmployee\nseverance\nAccrued restructuring actions balance as of June 30, 2023 $ 897\nFiscal year 2024 cash payments (1,118)\nFirst quarter fiscal year 2024 adjustments(1) 89\nSecond quarter fiscal year 2024 adjustments(1) 132\nAccrued restructuring actions balance as of June 30, 2024 $ —\n(1) Fiscal year 2024 adjustments relate to the refinement of the accrual recorded in fiscal year 2023.\nLegal Matters: The Company and its affiliates are involved in a number of legal actions from time to time involving product liability, employment,\nintellectual property and commercial disputes, shareholder related matters, environmental proceedings, tax disputes, and governmental proceedings and\ninvestigations. With respect to governmental proceedings and investigations, like other companies in our industry, the Company is subject to extensive\nregulation by national, state, and local governmental agencies in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates\noperate. The Company’s standard practice is to cooperate with regulators and investigators in responding to inquiries. The outcomes of legal actions are not\nwithin the Company’s complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the enforcement agencies or private\nclaimants seek damages, as well as other remedies (including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding), that could\nrequire significant expenditures, result in lost revenues, or limit the Company's ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions.\n7\nTable of Contents\nThe Company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements on an undiscounted basis for loss contingencies related to legal actions when a\nloss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and\nno amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known\nor probable, and may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. When determining the estimated loss or range of loss,\nsignificant judgment is required. Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are\ninherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery, involve\nunsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages, potentially involve penalties, fines or punitive damages, or could result in a change in business\npractice. The Company classifies certain specified litigation charges and gains related to significant legal matters as certain litigation charges in the\nconsolidated statements of income.\nIn August 2024, 804,162 shares of outstanding vested stock options related to former employees expired which have now been excluded from the\nCompany’s dilutive EPS calculation for the period ended September 30, 2024. The expiration date of these options is currently under dispute. The total\nnet pre-tax value of these options on the expiration date was approximately $33 million. As of September 30, the matter is under review and the Company\nis unable to estimate any future exposure related to this matter at this time.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company recognized $0.3 million of certain litigation charges. There was no comparable activity in the first\nquarter of fiscal 2024. As of each of the balance sheet dates presented, there was no accrued litigation. The ultimate cost to the Company with respect to\naccrued litigation could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse impact on the\nCompany’s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. The Company includes accrued litigation in Other current liabilities and Other\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. While it is not possible to predict the outcome for most of the legal matters discussed below, the Company\nbelieves it is possible that the costs associated with these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial\nposition, and/or cash flows.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nThere were no accounting pronouncements adopted in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Refer to the Form 10-K for accounting pronouncements\nadopted prior to June 30, 2024.\nRelevant New Standards Issued Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280), which requires incremental disclosures\non reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures on significant segment expenses. The Company will adopt this guidance beginning in the\nfourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 for our annual report and for interim periods starting in fiscal year 2026. We are currently evaluating the potential effect\nthat the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740), which requires incremental annual disclosures on\nincome taxes, including rate reconciliations, income taxes paid, and other disclosures. The Company will adopt this guidance beginning in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2026 for our annual report. We are currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on our financial\nstatement disclosures.\nOther than the items noted above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective or adopted in the current year that we believe have\na significant impact, or potential significant impact, on our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNote 2. Revenue Recognition:\nConsumables revenues consist of specialized proteins, immunoassays, antibodies, reagents, blood chemistry and blood gas quality controls, and\nhematology instrument controls that are typically single-use products recognized at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the\ncustomer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Instruments revenues typically consist of longer-lived assets that, for the substantial majority of sales, are\nrecognized at a point in time in a manner similar to consumables. Service revenues consist of extended warranty contracts, post contract support, and\ncustom development projects that are recognized over time as either the customers receive and consume the benefits of such services simultaneously or the\nunderlying asset being developed has no alternative use for the Company at contract inception and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for\nthe portion of the performance completed. Service revenues also include laboratory services recognized at point in time.\n8\nTable of Contents\nWe recognize royalty revenues in the period the sales occur using third party evidence. The Company elected the \"right to invoice\" practical expedient\nbased on the Company's right to invoice a customer at an amount that approximates the value to the customer and the performance completed to date.\nThe Company elected the exemption to not disclose the unfulfilled performance obligations for contracts with an original length of one year or less and the\nexemption to exclude future performance obligations that are accounted under the sales-based or usage-based royalty guidance. The Company’s unfulfilled\nperformance obligations for contracts with an original length greater than one year were not material as of September 30, 2024.\nContracts with customers that contain instruments may include multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, the Company allocates the contract’s\ntransaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. Allocation of the transaction price is determined at the\ncontracts’ inception.\nPayment terms for shipments to end-users are generally net 30 days. Payment terms for distributor shipments may range from 30 to 90 days. Service\narrangements commonly call for payments in advance of performing the work (e.g. extended warranty and service contracts), upon completion of the\nservice (e.g. custom development manufacturing) or a mix of both.\nContract assets include revenues recognized in advance of billings. Contract assets are included within Other current assets in the accompanying balance\nsheet as the amount of time expected to lapse until the Company's right to consideration becomes unconditional is less than one year. We elected the\npractical expedient allowing us to expense contract costs that would otherwise be capitalized and amortized over a period of less than one year. Contract\nassets as of September 30, 2024 are not material.\nContract liabilities include billings in excess of revenues recognized, such as those resulting from customer advances and deposits and unearned revenue\non warranty contracts. Contract liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 were approximately $29.2 million and $30.2 million, respectively.\nContract liabilities as of June 30, 2024 subsequently recognized as revenue during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were approximately\n$11.8 million. Contract liabilities as of June 30, 2023 subsequently recognized as revenue during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 were\napproximately $11.8 million. Contract liabilities in excess of one year are included in Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\nAny claims for credit or return of goods must be made within 10 days of receipt. Revenues are reduced to reflect estimated credits and returns. Although\nthe amounts recorded for these revenue deductions are dependent on estimates and assumptions, historically our adjustments to actual results have not been\nmaterial.\nTaxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. Amounts billed to customers\nfor shipping and handling are included in revenue, while the related shipping and handling costs are reflected in cost of products. We elected the practical\nexpedient that allows us to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after the customer has obtained control of a good as a fulfillment cost,\nand we accrue costs of shipping and handling when the related revenue is recognized.\nThe following tables present our disaggregated revenue for the periods presented.\nRevenue by type is as follows (in thousands):\nQuarter Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nConsumables $ 230,845 $ 224,547\nInstruments 26,206 24,860\nServices 27,357 21,454\nTotal product and services revenue, net $ 284,408 $ 270,861\nRoyalty revenues 5,050 6,074\nTotal revenues, net $ 289,458 $ 276,935\n9\nTable of Contents\nRevenue by geography is as follows (in thousands):\nQuarter Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nUnited States $ 165,015 $ 159,105\nEMEA, excluding United Kingdom 59,063 54,798\nUnited Kingdom 13,944 12,449\nAPAC, excluding Greater China 18,122 17,351\nGreater China 24,321 25,485\nRest of World 8,993 7,747\nNet sales $ 289,458 $ 276,935\nNote 3.

No indicators of impairment were identified as part of our assessment.\n11\nTable of Contents\nOther assets:\nOther assets consist of (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, June 30,\n2024 2024\nEquity method investment in Wilson Wolf $ 241,308 $ 242,337\nDerivative instruments 6,669 9,813\nLong-term inventory 5,556 5,718\nInvestment in Spear Bio 15,000 —\nOther 7,168 6,397\nOther assets $ 275,701 $ 264,265\nNote 4. Acquisitions:\nWe periodically complete business combinations that align with our business strategy. Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of\naccounting, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date and that\nthe results of operations of each acquired business be included in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income from their respective dates of\nacquisitions. Acquisition costs are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred.\nThere were no acquisitions in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nFiscal year 2024 Acquisitions\nLunaphore Technologies SA.\nOn July 7, 2023, the Company acquired all of the ownership interests of Lunaphore Technologies SA (“Lunaphore”) for $169.7 million, in a cash-free,\ndebt-free acquisition. Lunaphore is a leading developer of fully automated spatial biology solutions. The Lunaphore acquisition adds spatial biology\ninstruments to Bio-Techne’s portfolio to accelerate our leadership position in translational and clinical research markets. The transaction was accounted for\nin accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. The goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition represents the strategic benefits of growing the\nCompany’s product portfolio and the expected revenue growth from increased market penetration. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe business became part of the Diagnostics and Spatial Biology operating segment in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024.\nThe allocation of purchase price consideration related to Lunaphore was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The fair values of the assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed as of June 30, 2024 are as follows (in thousands):\nFinal allocation at June 30, 2024\nCurrent assets $ 12,155\nEquipment and other long-term assets 1,470\nIntangible assets:\nDeveloped technologies 60,300\nTradenames 4,900\nCustomer relationships 1,200\nGoodwill 104,650\nTotal assets acquired 184,675\nLiabilities 7,096\nDeferred income taxes, net 7,872\nNet assets acquired $ 169,707\nCash paid 169,707\n12\nTable of Contents\nTangible assets and liabilities acquired were recorded at fair value on the date of close based on management's assessment. The purchase price allocated to\ndeveloped technology and customer relationships was based on management’s forecasted cash inflows and outflows and using a multiperiod excess\nearnings method to calculate the fair value of assets purchased. The purchase price allocated to trade names was based on management's forecasted cash\ninflows and outflows and using a relief from royalty method. The amount recorded for developed technology is being amortized with the expense reflected\nin cost of goods sold in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The amortization period for developed technology\nis 14 years. Amortization expense related to customer relationships is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed\nConsolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The amortization period for customer relationships is 8 years. The amount recorded for\ntrade names is being amortized with the expense reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of\nEarnings and Comprehensive Income. The amortization period for trade names ranges from 4 years to 8 years. The net deferred income tax liability\nrepresents the net amount of the estimated future impact of adjustments for costs to be recognized as intangible asset amortization, which is not deductible\nfor income tax purposes, offset by the deferred tax asset for the calculation of acquired net operating losses.\nNote 5. Fair Value Measurements:\nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, available for sale investments, derivative instruments, accounts receivable,\naccounts payable, and long-term debt.\nFair value is defined as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants as of the measurement date. This standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value. This standard maximizes the use\nof observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs\nare inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are\ninputs that reflect our assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability based upon the best information available\nin the circumstances.\nThe categorization of financial assets and liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2\ninputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are\nnot active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable for\nthe asset or liability and their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one\nsignificant model assumption or input is unobservable. Level 3 may also include certain investment securities for which there is limited market activity or a\ndecrease in the observability of market pricing for the investments, such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.\n13\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables provide information by level for financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):\nTotal\ncarrying\nvalue as of Fair Value Measurements Using\nBalance Sheet Location September 30, Inputs Considered as\n2024 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets\nDerivatives designated as hedging\ninstruments - cash flow hedges Other current assets $ 250 $ — $ 250 $ —\nDerivatives designated as hedging\ninstruments - cash flow hedges Other assets 6,669 — 6,669 —\nTotal assets $ 6,919 $ — $ 6,919 $ —\nLiabilities\nDerivatives designated as hedging\ninstruments - cash flow hedges Other long-term liabilities $ 269 $ — $ 269 $ —\nDerivatives designated as hedging\ninstruments - net investment hedge Other long-term liabilities 8,041 — 8,041 —\nTotal liabilities $ 8,310 $ — $ 8,310 $ —\nTotal\ncarrying\nvalue as of Fair Value Measurements Using\nBalance Sheet Location June 30, Inputs Considered as\n2024 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets\nCertificates of deposit(1) Short-term available-for-sale investments $ 1,072 $ 1,072 $ — $ —\nDerivatives designated as hedging\ninstruments - cash flow hedges Other current assets 805 — 805 —\nDerivatives designated as hedging\ninstruments - cash flow hedges Other assets 9,813 — 9,813 —\nTotal assets $ 11,690 $ 1,072 $ 10,618 $ —\nLiabilities\nDerivatives designated as hedging\ninstruments - net investment hedge Other long-term liabilities $ 2,051 $ — $ 2,051 $ —\nTotal liabilities $ 2,051 $ — $ 2,051 $ —\n(1) The certificates of deposit have contractual maturity dates within one year.\nFair value measurements of derivative instruments\nThe Company utilizes forward starting swaps designated as a cash flow hedge on forecasted debt. The forward starting swaps reduce the variability of cash\nflow payments for the Company by converting the variable interest rate on the Company’s forecasted variable\n14\nTable of Contents\ninterest long-term debt to that of a fixed interest rate. Accordingly, as part of the forward starting swaps, the Company exchanges, at specified intervals, the\ndifference between floating and fixed interest amounts based on a notional principal amount. The Company also uses a cross-currency swap contract to\nmanage its exposure to foreign currency risk associated with the Company's net investment in its Swiss subsidiary.\nThe following table presents the contractual amounts of the Company's outstanding instruments (in millions):\nSeptember 30, June 30,\nInstruments Designation 2024 2024\nForward starting swaps(1) Cash flow hedge $ 300 $ 300\nCross-currency swap(2) Net investment hedge 140 150\n(1) In May 2021, the Company entered into a forward starting swap designated as a cash flow hedge on forecasted debt based on $200 million of notional\nprincipal. The effective date of the swap was November 2022 with the full swap maturing in November 2025. In March 2023, the Company entered into a\nforward starting swap designated as a cash flow hedge on forecasted debt based on $100 million of notional principal. The effective date of the swap was\nApril 2023 with the full swap maturing in April 2025. In August 2024, the Company entered into a new forward starting swap designated as a cash flow\nhedge on forecasted debt based on $100 million of notional principal that will go into effect in April 2025 to replace a swap that matures in April 2025. The\neffective date of the new swap is April 2025 with the full swap maturing in April 2026.\n(2) In July 2023, the Company entered into a pay-fixed rate, receive-fixed rate cross-currency swap contract with a total notional amount of $150 million\nthat was designated as a hedge to lock in the Swiss franc (CHF) rate for a portion of the Company's CHF net investment in its Lunaphore subsidiary in\nSwitzerland. The objective of the hedge is to protect the net investment in the Company's CHF-denominated operations against changes in the spot\nexchange rates, on a pre-tax basis. The hedging instrument has three remaining interim settlement dates, which will reduce the notional on the hedging\ninstrument by $10 million at each interim date, and will reduce the notional to $110 million at maturity.\nThe pretax amount of the gains and losses on our hedging instruments and the classification of those gains and losses within our consolidated financial\nstatements for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows (in thousands):\n(Gain) Loss Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nQuarter Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nCash flow hedges\nForward starting swaps $ 5,010 $ (1,587)\nNet investment hedges\nCross-currency swap 5,165 (1,366)\nTotal $ 10,175 $ (2,953)\n(Gain) Loss Reclassified into Income\nQuarter Ended\nSeptember 30, Location of (Gain) Loss\n2024 2023 in Income Statement\nCash flow hedges\nForward starting swaps $ (2,599) $ (2,539) Interest expense\nNet investment hedges\nCross-currency swap (782) (698) Interest expense\nTotal $ (3,381) $ (3,237)\n15\nTable of Contents\nGains or losses related to the net investment hedges are classified as foreign currency translation adjustments in the schedule of changes in Accumulated\nOther Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”) in Note 8, as these items are attributable to the Company’s hedges of its net investment in foreign operations.\nGains or losses related to the cash flow hedges are classified as Unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges in the schedule of changes in AOCI in Note\n8.\nFair value measurements of other financial instruments – The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of\nfinancial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.\nCash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit, accounts receivable, and accounts payable – The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance\nsheets approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items.\nLong-term debt – The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for the amount drawn on our line-of-credit facility and long-term debt\napproximates fair value because our interest rate is variable and reflects current market rates.\nNote 6. Debt and Other Financing Arrangements:\nOn August 31, 2022, the Company entered into a revolving line-of-credit and term loan governed by a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement). The\nCredit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $1 billion, which can be increased by an additional $400 million subject to certain conditions.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and expenditures of the Company and its subsidiaries, including financing\npermitted acquisitions. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable rate. The current outstanding debt is based on the one-month\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is determined from the total leverage ratio of the Company\nand updated on a quarterly basis. The annualized fee for any unused portion of the credit facility is currently 10 basis points.\nThe Credit Agreement matures on August 31, 2027 and contains customary restrictive and financial covenants and customary events of default. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the outstanding balance under the Credit Agreement was $300 million.\nNote 7. Leases:\nAs a lessee, the Company leases offices, labs, and manufacturing facilities, as well as vehicles, copiers, and other equipment. The Company recognizes\noperating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date\nbased on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to calculate present value is Bio-Techne’s incremental borrowing\nrate or, if available, the rate implicit in the lease. Bio-Techne determines the incremental borrowing rate for each lease based primarily on its lease term and\nthe economic environment of the applicable country or region. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized $1.3 million\nin variable lease expense and $4.4 million relating to fixed lease expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive\nIncome.\n16\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the balance sheet classification of the Company’s operating leases and amounts of right-of-use assets and lease\nliabilities and the weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate for the Company’s operating leases (asset and liability\namounts are in thousands):\nAs of\nSeptember 30,\nBalance Sheet Classification 2024\nOperating leases:\nOperating lease right-of-use assets Right-of-use asset $ 89,221\nCurrent operating lease liabilities Operating lease liabilities - current $ 13,485\nNoncurrent operating lease liabilities Operating lease liabilities 85,433\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 98,918\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years): 8.30\nWeighted average discount rate (%): 4.24\nThe following table summarizes the cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities and right of use assets obtained in\nexchange for new operating lease liabilities for the three months ended (in thousands):\nQuarter ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024\nCash amounts paid on operating lease liabilities $ 3,885\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities $ 799\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the lease liability by payment date for the Company’s operating leases by fiscal year (in thousands):\nSeptember 30,\n2024\nRemainder 2025 $ 12,668\n2026 16,647\n2027 13,767\n2028 13,593\n2029 13,125\nThereafter 48,790\nTotal $ 118,590\nLess: Amounts representing interest 19,672\nTotal lease obligations $ 98,918\nCertain leases include one or more options to renew, with terms that extend the lease term up to five years. Bio-Techne includes the option to renew the\nlease as part of the right of use lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. In addition, certain leases\ncontain fair value purchase and termination options with an associated penalty. In general, Bio-Techne is not reasonably certain to exercise such options.\n17\nTable of Contents\nNote 8.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL\nCONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following management discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash\nflows and financial condition. We provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the effect of acquisitions and changes in\nforeign currency at the corporate and segment level. We also provide quantitative information about discrete tax items and other significant factors we\nbelieve are useful for understanding our results. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with both the unaudited condensed consolidated financial\ninformation and related notes included in this Form 10-Q, and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nincluded in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024. This discussion contains various “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and\nalso contains various “Forward-Looking Statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We refer readers to the\nstatements entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Forward-Looking Information and Cautionary Statements” located at the end of Item 2 of this\nreport.\nOVERVIEW\nBio-Techne and its subsidiaries, collectively doing business as Bio-Techne Corporation (Bio-Techne, we, our, us or the Company) develop, manufacture\nand sell biotechnology reagents, instruments and services for the research and clinical diagnostic markets worldwide. With our deep product portfolio and\napplication expertise, we sell integral components of scientific investigations into biological processes and molecular diagnostics, revealing the nature,\ndiagnosis, etiology and progression of specific diseases. Our products aid in drug discovery efforts and provide the means for accurate clinical tests and\ndiagnoses.\nWe are committed to providing the life sciences community with innovative, high-quality scientific tools that allow our customers to make extraordinary\ndiscoveries and treat and diagnose diseases. We intend to build on Bio-Techne’s past accomplishments, high product quality reputation and sound financial\nposition by executing strategies that position us to serve as the standard for biological content in the research market, and to leverage that leadership\nposition to enter the diagnostics and other adjacent markets. The Company’s strategic pillars for long-term growth and profitability are grow and leverage\nthe core, capitalize on high potential markets, market expansion through innovation and acquisition, deliver best-in-class customer experience, and develop\npeople through a transformative culture.\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company operated under two operating segments, Protein Sciences and Diagnostics and Spatial Biology\n(formerly Diagnostics and Genomics). The name change is intended to better reflect the focus and scope of our offerings. The manner in which we operate\nour business and review discrete financial information did not change. Segment information presented herein reflects the updated name of the operating\nsegment. The operating segments the Company operated under were consistent with the Company's operating segments disclosed in the Company's Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for fiscal 2024.\nOur Protein Sciences segment is a leading developer and manufacturer of high-quality purified proteins and reagent solutions, most notably cytokines and\ngrowth factors, antibodies, immunoassays, biologically active small molecule compounds, tissue culture reagents and T-Cell activation technologies. This\nsegment also includes protein analysis solutions that offer researchers efficient and streamlined options for automated western blot and multiplexed ELISA\nworkflow. Our Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment develops and manufactures diagnostic products, including FDA-regulated controls, calibrators,\nblood gas and clinical chemistry controls and other reagents for OEM and clinical customers, as well as a portfolio of clinical molecular diagnostic\noncology assays, including the ExoDx®Prostate (IntelliScore) test (EPI) for prostate cancer diagnosis. This segment also manufactures and sells advanced\ntissue-based in-situ hybridization assays (ISH) for research and clinical use.\nRECENT ACQUISITIONS\nA key component of the Company's strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. The Company did not\nmake any acquisitions during the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOperational Update\nConsolidated net sales increased 5% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year period. Organic growth for the\nquarter ended September 30, 2024 was 4% compared to the prior year, with foreign currency exchange impacting sales by approximately 1%. A business\nheld-for-sale did not have a material impact.\n23\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated net earnings decreased to $33.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $51.0 million in the same prior year\nperiod.\nNet Sales\nConsolidated net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $289.5 million, an increase of 5% compared to the same prior year period. Organic\ngrowth for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 4% compared to the prior year, with foreign currency exchange impacting sales by approximately\n1%. A business held-for-sale did not have a material impact. Organic growth for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by broad\nbased performance of our Diagnostics and Spatial Biology portfolio as well as strong growth in our GMP reagent offerings within our Protein Sciences\nsegment.\nGross Margins\nConsolidated gross margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 63.2% compared to 66.9% for the same prior year period. Under purchase\naccounting, inventory is valued at fair value less expected selling and marketing costs, resulting in reduced margins in future periods as the inventory is\nsold. Excluding the impact of costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory, amortization of intangibles, stock compensation expense, restructuring\nand restructuring-related costs, and the impact of a business held-for-sale, adjusted gross margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 69.5%\ncompared to 71.3% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Fluctuations in consolidated gross margin and adjusted gross margin, as a percentage of\nsales, have primarily resulted from changes in product mix. We expect that, in the future, gross margins will continue to be impacted by the mix of our\nportfolio growing at different rates as well as future acquisitions.\nA reconciliation of the reported consolidated gross margin percentages, adjusted for acquired inventory sold, intangible amortization, stock compensation\nexpense, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, and the impact of a business held-for-sale included in cost of sales, is as follows (in thousands):\nQUARTER\nENDED\n9/30/2024 9/30/2023\nTotal consolidated net sales $ 289,458 $ 276,935\nBusiness held-for-sale1) 2,303 —\nRevenue from recurring operations $ 287,155 $ 276,935\nGross margin - GAAP $ 183,017 $ 185,191\nGross margin percentage - GAAP 63.2 % 66.9 %\nIdentified adjustments:\nCosts recognized upon sale of acquired inventory $ 188 $ 181\nAmortization of intangibles 11,779 11,866\nStock-based compensation, inclusive of employer taxes 272 214\nRestructuring and restructuring-related costs 4,898 —\nImpact of business held-for-sale1) (558) —\nAdjusted gross margin $ 199,596 $ 197,452\nAdjusted gross margin percentage2) 69.5% 71.3 %\n1) Includes the quarterly results of a business that has met the held-for-sale criteria since December 31, 2023.\n2) Adjusted gross margin percentage excludes both $2,303 of revenue and $558 of gross margin for a business that has met the held-for-sale criteria since\nDecember 31, 2023.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 13% to $119.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from the same prior year period.\nThe increase in expense was due to restructuring and restructuring-related charges.\n24\nTable of Contents\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses decreased 1% to $23.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from the same prior year period. The\ndecrease in expense was due to cost management initiatives.\nSegment Results\nProtein Sciences\nQuarter Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nNet sales (in thousands) $ 204,535 $ 204,655\nOperating margin percentage 39.4% 43.2%\nProtein Sciences’ net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $204.5 million, which remained flat compared to the same respective prior year\nperiod. As of December 31, 2023, a business within the Protein Sciences segment met the criteria as held-for-sale; this held-for-sale business has been\nexcluded from the segment’s fiscal 2025 operating results. The exclusion of first quarter fiscal 2025 sales related to this held-for-sale business reduced\nsales by 1%. Organic growth for the segment was 1%, with foreign currency exchange having an immaterial impact.\nThe operating margin was 39.4% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 43.2% in the comparative prior year period. The segment’s\noperating margin was unfavorably impacted by product mix and re-instatement of incentive compensation accruals.\nDiagnostics and Spatial Biology (formerly Diagnostics and Genomics)\nQuarter Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nNet sales (in thousands) $ 83,192 $ 72,797\nOperating margin percentage 5.1% 0.7%\nDiagnostics and Spatial Biology's net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $83.2 million, with reported growth of 14% compared to the\nsame respective prior year period. Organic revenue growth was 14% for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, with foreign currency exchange having an\nimmaterial impact.\nThe operating margin for the segment was 5.1% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.7% in the comparative prior year period. The\nsegment’s operating margin was favorably impacted due to volume leverage and productivity initiatives, partially offset by re-instatement of incentive\ncompensation accruals.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes were at an effective rate of 16.4% of consolidated earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to (2.9)% for the same\nrespective prior year period. The change in the Company’s tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was driven by a mix of net income and timing\nof discrete items.\nThe forecasted tax rate as of the first fiscal quarter of 2025 before discrete items is 23.6% compared to the prior year forecasted tax rate before discrete\nitems of 24.5%. Excluding the impact of discrete items, the Company expects the consolidated income tax rate for the remainder of fiscal 2025 to range\nfrom 23% to 27%.\n25\nTable of Contents\nNet Earnings\nNon-GAAP adjusted consolidated net earnings are as follows (in thousands):\nQUARTER\nENDED\n9/30/2024 9/30/2023\nNet earnings before taxes - GAAP $ 40,171 $ 49,558\nIdentified adjustments:\nCosts recognized upon sale of acquired inventory 188 181\nAmortization of intangibles 19,741 19,851\nAmortization of Wilson Wolf intangible assets and acquired inventory 2,490 4,208\nAcquisition related expenses and other 1,674 (442)\nCertain litigation charges 292 —\nStock-based compensation, inclusive of employer taxes 10,637 11,494\nRestructuring and restructuring-related costs 11,022 89\nInvestment (gain) loss and other non-operating — (283)\nImpact of business held-for-sale1) (148) —\nNet earnings before taxes - Adjusted $ 86,067 $ 84,656\nNon-GAAP tax rate 21.5% 22.0%\nNon-GAAP tax expense $ 18,536 $ 18,615\nNon-GAAP adjusted net earnings $ 67,531 $ 66,041\nEarnings per share - diluted - Adjusted $ 0.42 $ 0.41\n(1) Since December 31, 2023, the Company has a business that has met the held-for-sale criteria.\nDepending on the nature of discrete tax items, our reported tax rate may not be consistent on a period-to-period basis. The Company independently\ncalculates a non-GAAP adjusted tax rate considering the impact of discrete items and jurisdictional mix of the identified non-GAAP adjustments. The\nfollowing table summarizes the reported GAAP tax rate and the effective non-GAAP adjusted tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nQUARTER\nENDED\n9/30/2024 9/30/2023\nGAAP effective tax rate 16.4% (2.9)%\nDiscrete items 7.2 27.4\nLong-term GAAP tax rate 23.6% 24.5%\nRate impact items\nStock based compensation (2.8)% (2.7)%\nOther 0.7 0.2\nTotal rate impact items (2.1)% (2.5)%\nNon-GAAP adjusted tax rate 21.5% 22.0%\nThe difference between the reported GAAP tax rate and non-GAAP tax rate applied to the identified non-GAAP adjustments for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 is primarily a result of discrete tax items, including the tax benefit of stock option exercises.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments were $187.5 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $152.9 million as of June 30,\n2024. Included in the available-for-sale-investments as of June 30, 2024 were certificates of deposit that have maturity dates within one year of $1.1\nmillion. During the first fiscal quarter of 2025, the certificates of deposit reached maturity. The Company had no available-for-sale investments as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n26\nTable of Contents\nThe Company has a line-of-credit governed by a Credit Agreement dated August 31, 2022 that will mature on August 31, 2027. As of September 30, 2024,\nthere is $700 million available on the line-of-credit. See Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Credit\nAgreement.\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company paid $25 million to enter into a two-part forward contract which requires the Company to purchase the full equity\ninterest in Wilson Wolf if certain annual revenue or EBITDA thresholds are met. During fiscal year 2023, Wilson Wolf met the EBITDA target and the\nCompany paid an additional $232 million to acquire 19.9% of Wilson Wolf. Since the first part of the forward contract has been triggered, the second part\nof the forward contract will automatically trigger, which requires the Company to acquire the remaining 80.1% of Wilson Wolf on December 31, 2027. The\nsecond part of the contract would be accelerated in advance of December 31, 2027 if Wilson Wolf meets certain financial milestones. As of September 30,\n2024, the second milestones have not been met. The second option payment of approximately $1 billion plus potential contingent consideration is\nforecasted to occur between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2028.\nManagement of the Company expects to be able to meet its cash and working capital requirements for operations, facility expansion, capital additions, and\ncash dividends for the foreseeable future, and at least the next 12 months, through currently available cash, cash generated from operations, and remaining\ncredit available on its existing revolving line of credit.\nCash Flows From Operating Activities\nThe Company generated cash of $63.9 million from operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to $59.4 million in the first quarter of\nfiscal 2024. The increase from the prior year was primarily due to changes in the timing of cash payments on certain operating assets and liabilities.\nCash Flows From Investing Activities\nWe continue to make investments in our business, including capital expenditures.\nCapital expenditures for fixed assets for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024 were $9.2 million and $13.6 million, respectively. Capital expenditures for\nthe remainder of fiscal 2025 are expected to be approximately $32 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be financed through currently available\nfunds and cash generated from operating activities. Expected additions in fiscal 2025 are related to increasing capacity to meet expected sales growth\nacross the Company.\nDuring the fiscal quarter of 2025, the Company invested $15.0 million into Spear Bio. There was no comparable activity in the first quarter of 2024.\nDuring the first fiscal quarter of 2025, certificates of deposit reached maturity for $1.1 million. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company sold its exchange\ntraded investment grade bond funds $23.8 million.\nThe Company received tax distributions of $1.4 million and $2.1 million from its equity method investee during the first quarter of 2025 and 2024,\nrespectively.\nDuring the first fiscal quarter of 2024, the Company paid $166.4 million to acquire Lunaphore. In the second fiscal quarter of 2024, an additional payment\nof $3.3 million was paid to the Lunaphore shareholders upon the finalization of the net working capital, which resulted in a total purchase price of $169.7\nmillion during fiscal 2024. There was no comparable activity in the first fiscal quarter of 2025.\nCash Flows From Financing Activities\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Company paid cash dividends of $12.7 million and $12.7 million, respectively, to all common\nshareholders. On October 30, 2024, the Company announced the payment of a $0.08 per share cash dividend, or approximately $12.7 million, will be\npayable November 22, 2024 to all common shareholders of record on November 11, 2024.\nCash of $25.1 million and $14.4 million was received during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, from the exercise of stock options.\n27\nTable of Contents\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Company made repayments of $19.0 million and $70.0 million, respectively, on its long-term debt\nbalance. The Company drew $160.0 million under its revolving line-of-credit facility during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. There was no comparable\nactivity in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Company received $5.0 million and $20.2 million related to taxes paid on restricted stock, restricted\nstock units and stock options exercised through a net share settlement classified as financing activities.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are discussed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2024 and are incorporated herein by\nreference. The application of certain of these policies requires judgments and estimates that can affect the results of operations and financial position of the\nCompany. Judgments and estimates are used for, but not limited to, valuation of available-for-sale investments, inventory valuation and allowances,\nvaluation of intangible assets and goodwill and valuation of investments in unconsolidated entities. There have been no significant changes in estimates in\nthe quarter ended September 30, 2024 that would require disclosure nor have there been any changes to the Company's policies.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” in Item 2,\ncontains financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). These non-\nGAAP measures include:\n●Organic revenue\n●Adjusted gross margin\n●Adjusted operating margin\n●Adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share\n●Adjusted effective tax rate\nWe provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our\nperformance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe that our presentation of these\nmeasures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period\ncomparison of results.\nOur non-GAAP financial measure of organic revenue represents revenue growth excluding revenue from acquisitions within the preceding 12 months, the\nimpact of foreign currency, the impact of businesses held-for-sale, as well as the impact of partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries. Excluding these\nmeasures provides more useful period-to-period comparison of revenue results as it excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, which can\nvary significantly from period to period, and revenue from acquisitions that would not be included in the comparable prior period. Revenues from\nbusinesses held-for-sale are excluded from our organic revenue calculation starting on the date they become held-for-sale as those revenues will not be\ncomparative in future periods. Revenues from partially-owned subsidiaries consolidated in our financial statements are also excluded from our organic\nrevenue calculation, as those revenues are not fully attributable to the Company. There was no revenue from partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries in\nfiscal year 2024 or fiscal year 2025.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures for adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per share basis,\nexclude stock-based compensation, which is inclusive of the employer portion of payroll taxes on those stock awards, the costs recognized upon the sale of\nacquired inventory, amortization of acquisition intangibles, restructuring and restructuring-related costs. Stock-based compensation is excluded from non-\nGAAP adjusted net earnings because of the nature of this charge, specifically the varying available valuation methodologies, subjection assumptions,\nvariety of award types, and unpredictability of amount and timing of employer related tax obligations. The Company excludes amortization of purchased\nintangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments, including costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory, and other non-recurring items including\ngains or losses on goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, and one-time assessments from this measure because they occur as a result of specific\nevents, and are not reflective of our internal investments, the costs of developing, producing, supporting and selling our products, and the other ongoing\ncosts to support our operating structure. Costs related to restructuring and restructuring-related activities, including reducing overhead and consolidating\nfacilities, are excluded because we believe they are not indicative of our normal operating\n28\nTable of Contents\ncosts. Additionally, these amounts can vary significantly from period to period based on current activity. The Company also excludes revenue and expense\nattributable to partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries as well as revenue and expense attributable to businesses held-for-sale in the calculation of our\nnon-GAAP financial measures.\nThe Company’s non-GAAP adjusted operating margin and adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per share basis, also excludes acquisition related\nexpenses inclusive of the changes in fair value of contingent consideration, and other non-recurring items including certain costs related to the transition to\na new CEO, goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, and gains. We also exclude certain litigation charges which are facts and circumstances specific\nincluding costs to resolve litigation and legal settlement (gains and losses). In some cases, these costs may be a result of litigation matters at acquired\ncompanies that were not probable, inestimable, or unresolved at the time of acquisition.\nThe Company’s non-GAAP adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per share basis, also excludes gain and losses from investments, as they are not part of\nour day-to-day operating decisions (excluding our equity method investment in Wilson Wolf as it is certain to be acquired in the future) and certain\nadjustments to income tax expense. Additionally, gains and losses from investments that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any\npredictability are excluded. The Company independently calculates a non-GAAP adjusted tax rate to be applied to the identified non-GAAP adjustments\nconsidering the impact of discrete items on these adjustments and the jurisdictional mix of the adjustments. In addition, the tax impact of other discrete and\nnon-recurring charges which impact our reported GAAP tax rate are adjusted from net earnings. We believe these tax items can significantly affect the\nperiod-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results.\nThe Company periodically reassesses the components of our non-GAAP adjustments for changes in how we evaluate our performance, changes in how we\nmake financial and operational decisions, and considers the use of these measures by our competitors and peers to ensure the adjustments are still relevant\nand meaningful.\nReaders are encouraged to review the reconciliations of the adjusted financial measures used in management's discussion and analysis of the financial\ncondition of the Company to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures provided within the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nFORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\nThis quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking\nstatements include those regarding the Company's expectations as to the effect of changes to accounting policies, the amount of capital expenditures for the\nremainder of the fiscal year, the source of funding for capital expenditure requirements, the sufficiency of currently available funds for meeting the\nCompany's needs, the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and expectations regarding gross margin fluctuations, increasing research\nand development expenses, increasing selling, general and administrative expenses and income tax rates.

If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual\nproperty, or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant\nresources enforcing our rights.\n● We may be involved in disputes to determine the scope, coverage and validity of others’ proprietary rights, or to defend\nagainst third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, any of which could be time-intensive and costly and may\nadversely impact our business.\nFinancial and Tax Risks\n● We have entered into and drawn on a revolving credit facility, and we may incur additional debt in the future. The burden of\nthis additional debt could adversely affect us, make us more vulnerable to adverse economic or industry conditions, and\nprevent us from funding our expansion strategy.\n● Our business and financial results can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our tax rates, and\ntax liabilities and assessments (including as a result of changes in tax laws).\n● Dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future.\nLegal, Regulatory, Compliance and Reputational Risks\n● Our business is subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business\nand financial results.\n● Significant developments or changes in U.S. laws or policies, including changes in U.S. trade policies and tariffs and the\nreaction of other countries thereto, can have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\n● Our business and financial results can be impaired by improper conduct of any of our employees, agents, or business partners.\n● Certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. FDA and the USDA and by comparable agencies of\nother countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health\ninformation. Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n● Failure to comply with privacy and security laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties and damage to the Company’s\nreputation and have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, a risk that has been elevated with recent\nacquisitions that use protected health information and utilize healthcare providers for laboratory testing services.\n5\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOVERVIEW\nBio-Techne and its subsidiaries, collectively doing business as Bio-Techne Corporation (Bio-Techne, we, our, us or the Company), develop,\nmanufacture and sell life science reagents, instruments and services for the research, diagnostics and bioprocessing markets worldwide.\nWith our broad product portfolio and application expertise, we sell integral components of scientific investigations into biological\nprocesses and molecular diagnostics, revealing the nature, diagnosis, etiology and progression of specific diseases. Our products aid in drug\ndiscovery efforts and provide the means for accurate clinical tests and diagnoses.\nWe manage the business in two operating segments – our Protein Sciences segment and our Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Our\nProtein Sciences segment is a leading developer and manufacturer of high-quality biological reagents used in all aspects of life science\nresearch, diagnostics and cell and gene therapy. This segment also includes proteomic analytical tools, both manual and automated, that\noffer researchers and pharmaceutical manufacturers efficient and streamlined options for protein analysis, automated western blot, and\nmultiplexed ELISA workflows. Our Diagnostics and Genomics segment develops and manufactures diagnostic products, including\ncontrols, calibrators, and diagnostic assays for the regulated diagnostics market, exosome-based molecular diagnostic assays, advanced\ntissue-based in-situ hybridization assays for spatial genomic and tissue biopsy analysis, and genetic and oncology kits for research and\nclinical applications.\nWe are a Minnesota corporation with our global headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota. We were founded in 1976 as Research and\nDiagnostic Systems, Inc. We became a publicly traded company in 1985 through a merger with Techne Corporation, now Bio-Techne\nCorporation. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol “TECH.” We operate globally, with offices in many locations\nthroughout North America, Europe and Asia. Today, our product lines include hundreds of thousands of diverse products, most of which we\nmanufacture ourselves in multiple locations in North America, as well as a location each in the U.K. and China.\nOur historical focus was on providing high quality proteins, antibodies and immunoassays to the life science research market and\nhematology controls to the diagnostics market. Since 2013, we have been implementing a disciplined strategy to accelerate growth in part\nby acquiring businesses and product portfolios that leveraged and diversified our existing product lines, filled portfolio gaps with\ndifferentiated high growth businesses, and expanded our geographic scope. From fiscal years 2013 through 2024 we have acquired, agreed\nto acquire, or made investments in twenty companies that have expanded the product offerings and geographic footprint of both\noperating segments, including the acquisition of Lunaphore SA (“Lunaphore”) at the beginning of fiscal year 2024. We also completed a\n19.9% investment in Wilson Wolf Corporation (“Wilson Wolf”) in fiscal year 2023, and will acquire the remaining ownership in Wilson\nWolf by the end of calendar year 2027, if not earlier due to its achievement of revenue or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and\namortization (“EBITDA”) targets. Additionally, subsequent to fiscal 2024, we made an investment in Spear Bio, which is a leader in the\ndevelopment and manufacturing of ultra-sensitive immunoassays capable of measuring protein biomarkers at attomolar level from sub-\nmicroliter sample volume. Recognizing the importance of an integrated, global approach to meeting our mission and accomplishing our\nstrategies, we have maintained many of the brands of the companies we have acquired, but unified under a single global brand -- Bio-\nTechne.\nWe are committed to providing the life sciences community with innovative, high-quality scientific tools that allow our customers to make\nextraordinary discoveries and treat and diagnose diseases. We intend to build on Bio-Techne’s past accomplishments, high product quality\nreputation and sound financial position by executing strategies that position us to serve as the standard for biological content in the research\nmarket, and to leverage that leadership position to enter the diagnostics and other adjacent markets. Our strategic pillars include:\nGrow & Leverage the Core. Through collaborations with key opinion leaders, participation in scientific discussions and\nsocieties, and leveraging our internal talent we expect to be able to convert our continued significant investment in our\nresearch and development activities to be first-to-market with quality products that are at the leading edge of life science\nresearchers’ needs.\n6\nTable of Contents\nCapitalize on High Potential Markets. We will continue to leverage our strong balance sheet to gain access to new and\ndifferentiated technologies and products that improve our competitiveness in the current market, meet customers’ expanding\nworkflow needs and allow us to enter adjacent markets.\nMarket Expansion Through Innovation & Acquisition. We will leverage our existing portfolio to expand our product\nofferings into novel research fields and further penetrate diagnostics and therapeutics markets. Acquisitions have, and will\nlikely continue to play, an important role in our efforts to expand our portfolio of innovative tools and bioactive reagents, and\nsupport our initiatives to enter adjacent markets.\nDeliver Best-in-Class Customer Experience. We will continue to expand our sales staff and distribution channels globally in\norder to increase our global presence and make it easier for customers to transact with us. We strive for every interaction to\nbe seamless, personalized, and exceeding expectations. We aim to deeply understand customers wants and needs while\nsimultaneously offering high-quality service at every touchpoint.\nDevelop People Through a Transofrmative Culture. As we continue to grow both organically and through acquisition, we are\nintentionally fostering an “EPIC” culture based on the ideals of Empowerment, Passion, Innovation and Collaboration. We\nstrive to recruit, train and retain the most talented staff, who share these EPIC ideals to effectively implement our global\nstrategies.\nPROTEIN SCIENCES SEGMENT\nProtein Sciences Segment Products and Markets\nThe Protein Sciences segment is the larger of our two segments, representing approximately 72% of our net sales in fiscal 2024. It is\ncomprised of two divisions with complementary product offerings serving many of the same customers – the Reagent Solutions division\nand the Analytical Solutions division.\nThe Reagent Solutions division consists of specialized proteins, such as cytokines and growth factors, antibodies, small molecules, tissue\nculture sera and cell selection technologies traditionally used by researchers to further their life science experimental activities and by\ncompanies developing next generation diagnostics and therapeutics, including companies developing cell- and gene-based therapeutics. We\nbelieve we are the world leader in providing high quality proteins, both for research use and under current Good Manufacturing Practices,\nor cGMP. Key product brands include R&D Systems, Tocris Biosciences and Novus Biologicals. Our combined chemical and biological\nreagents portfolio provides high quality tools that customers can use in solving complex biological pathways and glean knowledge that may\nlead to a more complete understanding of biological processes, and, ultimately, to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to\naddress different pathologies. In recent years, we have made several acquisitions and investments that have expanded our product offerings\nfor the cell and gene therapy market. These include a significant investment in state-of-the art facilities for production of both proteins and\nsmall molecules in large quantities manufactured in accordance with cGMP, as well as a 19.9% investment in – and eventual acquisition of\n– Wilson Wolf, which is a leading provider of cell culture devices for cell-based therapies. Through a collaborative marketing venture with\nWilson Wolf and another company, we have leveraged the products we have or are developing to provide a more complete offering for the\ncell and gene therapy market.\nThe Analytical Solutions division includes manual and automated protein analysis instruments and immunoassays that are used in\nquantifying proteins in a variety of biological fluids. Products in this division include traditional manual plate-based immunoassays, fully\nautomated multiplex immunoassays on various instrument platforms, and automated western blotting and isoelectric focusing analysis of\ncomplex protein samples. Key product brands include R&D Systems and ProteinSimple. A number of our products have been demonstrated\nto have the potential to serve as predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a variety of human diseases and conditions including\ncancer, autoimmunity, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, inflammation, neurological disorders, and kidney failure. Immunoassays can also be\nuseful in clinical diagnostics. In fact, we have received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) marketing clearance for a few of our\nimmunoassays for use as in vitro diagnostic devices.\n7\nTable of Contents\nProtein Sciences Segment Customers and Distribution Methods\nOur customers for this segment include researchers in academia and industry (chiefly pharmaceutical and biotech companies as well as\ncontract research organizations). This segment also sells to diagnostic/companion diagnostic and therapeutic customers, especially\ncustomers engaged in the development of cell- and gene-based therapies. Our biologics line of products in the Analytical Solutions division\nis used chiefly by production and quality control departments at biotech and pharmaceutical companies. We sell our products directly to\ncustomers who are primarily located in North America, Europe and China, as well as through a distribution agreement with Thermo Fisher\nScientific. We also sell through third party distributors in China, Japan, certain eastern European countries and the rest of the world. Our\nsales are widely distributed, and no single end-user customer accounted for more than 10% of the Protein Sciences segment’s net sales\nduring fiscal 2024, 2023, or 2022.\nDIAGNOSTICS AND GENOMICS SEGMENT\nThe Diagnostics and Genomics segment, representing approximately 28% of our net revenues in fiscal 2024, includes three divisions and is\nfocused primarily on the diagnostic and research markets and includes spatial biology, liquid biopsy, molecular diagnostics kits and\nproducts, and diagnostics reagents.\nDiagnostics and Genomics Segment Products\nThe Spatial Biology division products sold under the Advanced Cell Diagnostics, or ACD, brand, are novel in-situ hybridization (ISH)\nassays for transcriptome, DNA copy, and structural variation analysis within intact cells, providing highly sensitive and specific spatial\ninformation at single cell resolution. Since these products preserve spatial context, they are particularly useful for complex tissue profiling.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we closed on the acquisition of Lunaphore, a leading developer of fully automated spatial biology\nsolutions using precision microfluidic technology capable of revealing hyperplex proteomic and transcriptomic biomarkers in tumors and\nother tissues at single-cell and subcellular resolution. Lunaphore’s COMET instrument automates ACD’s RNAscope assays and utilizies\nantibodies to enable simultaneous hyperplex detection of protein and RNA biomarkers on the same slide at single-cell resolution.\nThe Molecular Diagnostics division markets and sells products and services under the Exosome Diagnostics and Asuragen brands. The\nExosome Diagnostics brand is based on exosome-based liquid biopsy techniques that analyze genes or their transcripts. It includes the\nExoDx Prostate test, which is a urine-based assay for early detection of high-grade prostate cancer used as an aid in deciding the need for\nbiopsy in men with grey-zone prostate specific antigen (PSA) scores. ExoDX Prostate is offered by Exosome Diagnostics as a lab-\ndeveloped test. We have also licensed exclusively the ExoTRU kidney transplant rejection test to Thermo Fisher Scientific. We also sell\nproducts for genetic carrier screening, oncology diagnostics, molecular controls, and research under the Asuragen brand.\nThe Diagnostic Reagents division consists of regulated products traditionally used as calibrators and controls in the clinical setting. Also\nincluded are instrument and process control products for hematology, blood chemistry, blood gases, coagulation controls and reagents used\nin various diagnostic applications. We often manufacture these reagents on a custom basis, tailored to a customer’s specific diagnostic\nassay technology. We supply these reagents in various formats including liquid, frozen, or in lyophilized form. Most of these products are\nsold on an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) basis to instrument manufacturers, with most products being FDA-cleared.\nDiagnostics and Genomics Segment Customers and Distribution Methods\nThe customers for the Spatial Biology division include researchers in academia as well as investigators in pharmaceutical and biotech\ncompanies. We sell our products directly to those customers who are primarily located in North America, Europe, and China, and through\ndistributors elsewhere. In addition to being useful research tools, our DNA and RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) assays have diagnostics\napplications as well, and several are cleared or currently under review by the FDA in partnership with diagnostics instrument manufacturers\nand pharmaceutical companies.\nIn the United States, we offer the ExosomeDx Prostate test to physicians using our lab-developed non-invasive urine-based assay for\nprostate cancer detection. Our diagnostic laboratory is certified under and regulated by the State of Massachusetts pursuant to the Clinical\nLaboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA. We reach our customers through physicians prescribing such tests for their patients. This\ntest is also available in Europe as a CE-marked product. The Asuragen-\n8\nTable of Contents\nbranded products are sold primarily to laboratories for use in lab-developed tests or in kit form as regulated diagnostic tests.\nThe majority of Diagnostic Reagents Division’s sales are through OEM agreements, but we sell some of our diagnostic reagent products\ndirectly to customers and, in Europe and Asia, also through distributors.\nNo customer accounted for 10% or more of the reporting segment’s consolidated net sales during fiscal years 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nMANUFACTURING AND MATERIALS\nOur manufacturing operations use a wide variety of raw materials and components, including electronic components, chemicals and\nbiological materials. No single supplier is material, although for some components that require particular specifications or regulatory or\nother qualifications there may be a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components. We utilize a\nnumber of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to our supply chain, which in certain cases includes the use\nof safety stock, alternative materials, and qualification of multiple supply sources.\nThe majority of our products are shipped within one day of receipt of the customers’ orders, other than our instruments and related\ncartridges, which are typically shipped within one to two weeks of receipt of an order. There was no significant backlog of orders for our\nproducts as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or as of a comparable date. For additional discussion of risks relating to supply\nchain and manufacturing, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nCOMPETITION\nAlthough our segments both generally operate in highly competitive markets, it is difficult to determine our competitive position, either in\nthe aggregate or by segment, since none of our competitors offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets\nas the Company, or any of its segments, does. Because of the range of the products and services we sell, we encounter a wide variety of\ncompetitors, including a number of large, global companies or divisions of such companies with substantial capabilities and resources, as\nwell a number of smaller, niche competitors with specialized product offerings. We have seen increased competition in a number of our\nmarkets as a result of the entry of new companies into certain markets, the entry of competitors based in low-cost manufacturing locations,\nand increasing consolidation in particular markets. The number of competitors varies by product line. Key competitive factors vary among\nthe Company’s businesses, but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business and typically also include\nprice, quality and safety, performance, delivery speed, application expertise, service and support, technology and innovation, distribution\nnetwork, breadth of product, service and software offerings, and brand name recognition. We believe our competitive position is strong due\nto the unique aspects of many of our products and our product quality. For a discussion of risks related to competition, refer to “Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.”\nSEASONALITY OF BUSINESS\nBio-Techne believes there is some seasonality as a result of vacation and academic schedules of its worldwide customer base, particularly\nfor the Protein Sciences segment.\nThere is also some seasonality for the ExosomeDx Prostate test, as patients tend to avoid scheduling medical appointments during the\nsummer and other holidays. A majority of Diagnostics Reagents division products are manufactured in large bulk lots and sold on a\nschedule set by the customer. Consequently, sales for that division can be unpredictable, and not necessarily based on seasonality. As a\nresult, we can experience material and sometimes unpredictable fluctuations in our revenue from the Diagnostics and Genomics segment.\nGOVERNMENT CONTRACTS\nAlthough the Company transacts business with various government entities, no government contract is of such magnitude that renegotiation\nof profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government entity would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nfinancial results. As a party to these contracts, Bio-Techne does have to comply with\n9\nTable of Contents\ncertain regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments. For a discussion of risks related to government contracting\nrequirements, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nNEW PRODUCTS AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nWe believe that our future success depends, to a large extent, on our ability to keep pace with changing technologies and market needs.\nBio-Techne is engaged in continuous research and development in all of our major product lines. We also carry out research to develop\nnew products that build upon and expand the technologies we acquire through our acquisition strategy. In fiscal 2024, we introduced over\n800 new products. While this is an area of focus for the Company, there is no assurance that any of the products in the research and\ndevelopment phases can be successfully completed or, if completed, can be successfully introduced into the marketplace.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nThrough its subsidiaries, Bio-Techne employed approximately 3,100 full-time and part-time employees as of June 30, 2024, of whom\napproximately 2,300 were employed in the United States and approximately 800 outside the United States. None of the United States\nemployees are unionized. Outside the United States, the Company has government-mandated collective bargaining arrangements or work\ncouncils in certain countries.\nBio-Techne is committed to attracting, developing, engaging, and retaining the best people possible from around the world to sustain and\ngrow our leadership position in life sciences tools and diagnostics. We strive to create an employee experience that allows each to achieve\ntheir life’s best work. This is demonstrated by leading with our EPIC values of Empowerment, Passion, Innovation and Collaboration. We\ncontinuously build on our people-first culture, led by uncompromising integrity, hosting a place of belonging, granting access to innovation\nand respecting human rights around the globe.\nOur talent management strategy spans multiple key dimensions, including the following:\nCulture and Governance\nOur four EPIC values of Empowerment, Passion, Innovation and Collaboration are the backbone for the way we approach the leadership\nand direction of our work force. Employees are empowered to realize their potential. Our culture supports and encourages a collaborative\napproach to working with each other and with our customers. We encourage innovation to continually improve our products, services and\nprocesses, and our passions for science and the missions of our customers are our guiding lights.\nOur EPIC values are embedded in our culture and practices. To further amplify our desired behaviors, we have an annual employee\nrecognition program in which we ask for nominations and recognize winning individuals and teams across our business who have best\ndemonstrated our EPIC values.\nBio-Techne’s Board of Directors reviews management succession planning at least annually, and its Compensation Committee reviews the\nCompany’s talent management strategy periodically in connection with significant initiatives and acquisitions, as well as part of its\noversight of our executive and equity compensation programs. At the management level, our Chief Human Resources Officer, who reports\ndirectly to our President and CEO, is responsible for the development and execution of the Company’s talent management strategy.\nEngagement and Belonging\nOur engagement strategy focuses on developing the best workplace and best people leaders to meet our employees’ needs. We believe that\nstrong employee engagement helps enable higher retention and better business performance. We assess our engagement performance\nthrough regular consultation with our managers. We also engage more formally via an annual engagement survey that assesses our\nemployees’ overall experience. In 2024, 74% of our global workforce participated, and 77% of those who responded provided favorable\nfeedback. While these responses were quite positive, our management used the responses to inform and shape our future employee-\nfocused initiatives. These initiatives in the past have resulted in changes in programs and policies, including expansion of our management\nand leadership development programs, addition of a parental leave program, expansion of our incentive programs to include annual cash\n10\nTable of Contents\nbonuses to all employees, introduction of flexible working, addition of an internal communications function, leadership engagement\nfocused on transparency and stronger feedback follow-up, and expansion of the breadth and resources of our Employee Resource Groups\n(ERGs). In fiscal year 2024, we empowered work/life integration through hybrid work models wherever feasible, continued to cultivate\nbelonging and inclusion through deepened investment of resources to our ERGs, and paved the path for career growth through the\npersonalized development and implementation of individual action plans.\nWe believe a diverse workforce and culture of belonging is central to drive innovation, fuel growth and help ensure our technologies and\nproducts effectively serve a global customer base. The Company’s executive-sponsored Belonging initiative is focused on providing a\nwelcoming working environment for all employees, continued education, broadening our candidate pools, and implementing and sustaining\nprograms. One of the centerpieces of our talent development strategy is our ERGs, coordinated under the guidance of our executive-\nsponsored Employee Resource Group Council; they offer mentorship, support and engagement to help our employees, including those from\nunderrepresented groups, succeed and thrive. As of June 30, 2024, we had 10 ERGs operating globally.\nAs of June 30, 2024, 49% of our total employee population was female, and 43% of our managerial employees were female. 39% of our\ntotal employee population identified as nonwhite and 26% of our managerial employees identified as nonwhite.\nRecruitment and Retention\nBio-Techne believes that sustaining its profitable growth will require a continued focus on recruiting and retaining top, diverse talent. We\nengage in a variety of recruiting strategies intended to locate and identify qualified candidates and create a talent pipeline. The Company\noffers competitive pay and benefits, from flexible work to financial planning resources to an employee stock purchase plan. In recent\nyears, we bolstered our recruitment and retention efforts by expanding eligibility to receive stock options deeper into the organization and\nexpanded our Long-Term Incentive program strategy to include a combination of stock options and restricted stock units, instead of\nexclusively stock options. Bio-Techne continues to offer a referral bonus with the understanding that this is one of our most successful\nsourcing methods.\nIn addition to pay and benefits, Bio-Techne believes that the ability to retain employees requires an environment where they can work\nproductively and where there are opportunities to grow and advance. The Company therefore seeks to cultivate a culture of empowerment\nand collaboration, where employees can observe the impact of their efforts, and where they see opportunities both laterally and vertically.\nThe last fiscal year continued to see considerable employee mobility across all industries, including the biotechnology industry, but we\nnonetheless significantly reduced our attrition rate to maintain durable stability across our enterprise. We believe that Bio-Techne’s\nsustained efforts on recruitment and retention will fortify our resilience in the face of increased employee mobility and economic\nchallenges.\nTalent Development and Learning and Development\nBio-Techne invests in people development in the belief that growing and promoting employees from within the Company creates a more\nsustainable organization. High potential employees are identified through our annual talent review strategy, as well as through leadership\ndevelopment programs designed to cultivate future leaders. Employees identified as high potential are elevated to the attention of senior\nmanagement for consideration for additional development, growth opportunities, and career advancement.\nOur global Learning and Development program delivers a wide range of initiatives including a validated suite of compliance training, and\nsoft, technical, business, interpersonal and career skills. Bio-Techne also encourages and supports employees who wish to supplement their\ngrowth through external training and education. As a company that regularly acquires other businesses, we believe it is important for\nemployees to be trained in the skills and mindsets that enable them to respond positively to change. This initiative allows individuals to\ndeal with change easily and reduces the need to run large scale change management programs.\n11\nTable of Contents\nWell-Being and Safety\nThe Company is committed to protecting the physical health, safety, and psychological well-being of our employees by providing a safe\nwork environment and permitting hybrid work schedules wherever feasible. We actively monitor and adjust our crisis management plan\nand response protocol to protect our employees. Bio-Techne trains all employees on foundational safety principles and requires more\nrigorous safety and hazard awareness training where appropriate based on function, role, or team. At Bio-Techne, all employees are\nempowered and encouraged to maintain and create a safe workplace. In addition, we offer internal and external resources to provide for the\npsychological and emotional security of employees, including employee resource programs, mental health benefit coverage, and flexible\nwork for many roles.\nCommunity\nThe Company believes in giving back and in supporting the local communities in which we live and work. The Company and its\nemployees donate financially and by giving their time and energy. Most sites or departments engage in local charitable causes and\nactivities. In some of our sites, employees are encouraged to give through regular payroll deductions and through the annual campaign\nweek where employee contributions are matched by the Company. Some charitable causes are identified and promoted by our ERGs. In\naddition, United States employees receive a paid day off to participate in local opportunities to give back to the community as part of our\nvolunteer time off benefit.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technologies and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a\ncombination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections in\nour terms and conditions and other sales-related documentation.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had rights to approximately 710 granted patents and approximately 330 pending patent applications. Products in\nthe Analytical Solutions and the Spatial Biology divisions are protected primarily through pending patent applications and issued patents.\nIn addition, certain of our products are covered by licenses from third parties to supplement our own patent portfolio. Patent protection, if\ngranted, generally has a life of 20 years from the date of the patent application or patent grant. We cannot provide assurance that any of our\npending patent applications will result in the grant of a patent, whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims, and\nwhether our claims will provide adequate coverage of our competitors’ products or services.\nIn addition to pursuing patents on our products, we also preserve much of our innovation as trade secrets, particularly in the Reagent\nSolutions division of our Protein Sciences segment. Where appropriate, we use trademarks or registered trademarks in connection with our\nproducts. We have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, in part by entering into confidentiality\nagreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, corporate partners and, when needed, our\nadvisors. See the description of risks associated with the Company’s intellectual property in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nWe can give no assurance that Bio-Techne’s products do not infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others. Bio-\nTechne has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products. Where we have been contacted by patent holders with\ncertain intellectual property rights, Bio-Techne typically has entered into licensing agreements with patent holders under which it has the\nexclusive and/or non-exclusive right to use patented technology as well as the right to manufacture and sell certain patented products to the\nresearch and/or diagnostics markets.\nAll trademarks, trade names, product names, graphics, and logos of Bio-Techne contained herein are trademarks and registered trademarks\nof Bio-Techne or its subsidiaries, as applicable, in the United States and/or other countries. Solely for convenience, we may refer to\ntrademarks in this Annual Report on Form 10-K without the ™ or ® symbols. Such references are not intended to indicate that we will not\nassert our full rights to our trademarks.\nLAWS AND REGULATIONS\nOur operations, and some of the products we offer, are subject to a number of complex laws and regulations governing the production,\nmarketing, handling, transportation, and distribution of our products and services. The following sections describe certain significant\nregulations pertinent to the Company. These are not the only laws and regulations applicable\n12\nTable of Contents\nto the Company’s business. For a description of risks related to laws and regulations to which we are subject, refer to “Item 1A. Risk\nFactors.”\nMedical Device Regulations\nA number of our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to restrictions under domestic and foreign laws, rules,\nregulations, self-regulatory codes and orders, including but not limited to the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”). The FDCA\nrequires these products, when sold in the United States, to be safe and effective for their intended uses and to comply with the regulations\nadministered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The FDA regulates the design, development, testing, manufacture,\nadvertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution, import and export and record keeping for such products. Many medical device\nproducts are also regulated by comparable agencies in non-U.S. countries in which they are produced or sold.\nAny medical devices we manufacture and distribute are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state and\nnon-U.S. agencies. As a medical device manufacturer, our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the FDA.\nWe are required to adhere to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) requirements, as set forth in the Quality Systems\nRegulation (“QSR”), which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control,\ndocumentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process.\nWe must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting (“MDR”), requirements which require\nthat we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. We\nmust also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or\nserious injury it if were to recur.\nLabeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission.\nMedical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as “off-label”\npromotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.\nIn the European Union (“EU”), our products are subject to the medical device laws of the various member states, which are currently based\non a Directive of the European Commission. Additionally, the EU has adopted the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the “EU IVDR”), which\nimposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostic medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation\nrequirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. Manufacturers of in vitro diagnostics medical devices that have been marketed\nand sold under the prior regulatory regime now have to comply with some of the new EU IVDR requirements, while the effective date of\nother requirements have been delayed. Complying with EU IVDR may require material modifications to our quality management systems,\nadditional resources in certain functions, updates to technical files and additional clinical data in some cases, among other changes.\nOne of our products under our Exosome Diagnostics brand is offered as a test by a certified laboratory under CLIA. Our Asuragen business\nalso maintains a CLIA certification. Consequently, we must comply with state licensing regulations applicable to laboratories regulated\nunder CLIA, governing laboratory practices and procedures.\nOther Healthcare Laws\nSeveral of the products sold in our Diagnostics and Genomics segment are subject to various health care related laws regulating fraud and\nabuse, research and development, pricing and sales and marketing practices, and the privacy and security of health information, including,\namong others:\n● U.S. federal regulations regarding quality and cost by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”),\nincluding the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), as well as comparable state and non-U.S. agencies\nresponsible for reimbursement and regulation of healthcare goods and services, including laws and regulations related to\nkickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and healthcare fraud.\n13\nTable of Contents\n● U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing\nremuneration (including any kickback or bribe), directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an\nindividual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a\nfederal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid.\n● Comparable laws and regulations similar to, and in some cases more stringent than, the U.S. federal regulations discussed\nabove and below, including the UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws.\n● The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which prohibits knowingly and willfully (1)\nexecuting, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors, or (2)\nfalsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in\nconnection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the\nHealth Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, also restricts the use and disclosure of patient\nidentifiable health information, mandates the adoption of standards relating to the privacy and security of patient identifiable\nhealth information and requires the reporting of certain security breaches with respect to such information.\n● The False Claims Act, which imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes\nto be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program, knowingly makes, uses or causes to\nbe made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or knowingly makes a false statement to\navoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government.\n● The Open Payments Act requires manufacturers of medical devices covered under Medicare to, in certain circumstances,\nrecord payments and other transfers of value to a broad range of healthcare providers and teaching hospitals and to report this\ndata as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family\nmembers to HHS for subsequent public disclosure, as well as similar reporting requirements in some states and in other\ncountries.\nFor a discussion of risks related to regulation by the FDA and comparable agencies of other countries, and the other regulatory regimes\nreferenced above, please refer to section entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nData Privacy and Security Laws\nAs a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous\njurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. In\naddition to the U.S. HIPAA privacy and security rules mentioned above, which impact some parts of our business, individual states also\nregulate data breach and security requirements, and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of\npersonal privacy. In particular, a broad privacy law in California, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), came into effect in\nJanuary 2020. The CCPA has some of the same features as the GDPR (discussed below) and has already prompted several other states to\nfollow with similar laws. The EU General Data Protection Regulation that became effective in May 2018 (“GDPR”) has imposed\nsignificantly stricter requirements in how we collect, transmit, process, and retain personal data, including, among other things, in certain\ncircumstances a requirement for almost immediate notice of data breaches to supervisory authorities and prompt notice to data subjects\nwith significant fines for non-compliance. Several other countries in which we do business have passed, and other countries are considering\npassing, laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer\nrestrictions. For a discussion of risks related to improper disclosure of private information particularly as a result of cyber security\nincidents, please refer to section entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nEnvironmental Health and Safety Laws\nWe are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations both within and outside the U.S. Like other companies\nin our industry, our manufacturing and research activities involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental\nhealth and safety laws including those relating to the transportation of hazardous materials.\n14\nTable of Contents\nOther Laws and Regulations Governing Our Sales, Marketing and Shipping Activities\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and various other similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery acts, which are\nparticularly relevant to our operations in countries where the customers are government entities or are controlled by government officials.\nBoth directly and indirectly through our distributors, we must comply with such laws when interacting with those entities.\nAs Bio-Techne’s businesses also include export and import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the U.S. Departments of\nCommerce, State and Treasury. Other nations’ governments have implemented similar export/import control and economic sanction\nregulations, which may affect the Company’s operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions.\nIn addition, under U.S. laws and regulations, U.S. companies and their subsidiaries and affiliates outside the United States are prohibited\nfrom participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities, including the\nsale, purchase, transfer, shipping or financing of goods or services within the United States or between the United States and countries\noutside of the United States. If we, or certain third parties through which we sell or provide goods or services, violate anti-boycott laws and\nregulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with\ngovernment contracts could harm our business by a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to\nthe sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies\ndoing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government\ncontracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative\npenalties or debarment.\nFor a discussion of risks related to the above-referenced regulations, particularly with respect to our international operations, please refer to\nsection entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nINVESTOR INFORMATION\nWe are subject to the information requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Therefore, we file periodic\nreports, proxy statements, and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC maintains an internet site\n(http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file\nelectronically.\nFinancial and other information about us is available on our web site (https://investors.bio-techne.com/). We make available on our web site\ncopies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those\nreports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material\nelectronically or otherwise furnishing it to the SEC.\nEXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, the names, ages, positions and periods of service of each executive officer of the Company are as\nfollows:\nName Age Position Officer Since\nKim Kelderman 57 President, Chief Executive Officer and Director 2018\nJames Hippel 53 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 2014\nWilliam Geist 55 President, Protein Sciences 2022\nMatthew McManus 55 President, Diagnostics and Genomics 2024\nShane Bohnen 49 Senior Vice President, General Counsel & Corp.

RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below are risks and uncertainties we believe are material to our investors. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications\nand limitations on forward-looking statements in the section titled Information Relating to Forward-Looking Statements at the beginning of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEconomic and Industry Risks\nConditions in the global economy, the particular markets we serve and the financial markets, whether brought about by material\nglobal crises or other factors, may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur business is sensitive to global economic conditions. Slower economic growth in the domestic or international markets, inflation,\nrecession, volatility in the credit and currency markets, high levels of unemployment or underemployment, labor availability constraints,\npublic health crises, changes or anticipation of potential changes in government trade, fiscal, tax or monetary policies, government budget\ndynamics (particularly in the healthcare and scientific research areas), and other challenges in the global economy have in the past\nadversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, the Company and its distributors, customers, and suppliers.\nWithout limiting the foregoing, we have experienced and/or may in the future experience:\n● adverse impacts on customer orders and purchases and unpredictable reductions in demand for many of our products;\n● constraints on the movement of our products through the supply chain, which can disrupt our ability to produce or deliver our\nproducts;\n● adverse impacts on our collections of accounts receivable, including delays in collections and increases in uncollectible\nreceivables, as well as the risk of excess or obsolete inventory;\n● price increases in our raw materials and capital equipment, as well as increasing price competition in our markets;\n● adverse impacts on our workforce and/or key employees;\n● increased risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their\ncontractual obligations which, in addition to increasing the risks identified above, could result in preference actions against\nus; and\n● adverse impact to the sizes and growth rates of the markets we serve.\nIf growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period, if there is significant deterioration in the\nglobal economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve, our business and financial\nresults can be adversely affected.\nInternational political, compliance and business factors, including the military conflict in Ukraine, Israel’s conflict in Gaza, and\ntrade tensions between the U.S. and China, can negatively impact our operations and financial results.\nWe engage in business globally, with approximately 43% of our sales revenue in fiscal 2024 coming from outside the U.S. Changes,\npotential changes or uncertainties in social, political, regulatory, and economic conditions or laws and policies governing foreign trade,\nmanufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate, or governing the health\ncare system, can adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, Congress and the U.S. administration have sought to\nimpose changes to healthcare in the United States, including government negotiation/regulation of drug prices paid by government\nprograms. Such impacts could negatively impact certain markets we serve, resulting in an adverse impact on our sales revenue.\n17\nTable of Contents\nPolitical and military conflicts may disrupt our business or negatively impact global economic or business conditions. For example,\nRussia’s military invasion of Ukraine, and the response by the US and European countries to that invasion, have caused severe political,\nhumanitarian and economic crises, not only in Europe but globally. Restrictions on trade, particularly involving certain foods and energy\nsupplies, have increased prices, led to widespread inflation and otherwise aggravated economic challenges. While we have not historically\nhad significant business in either Russia, Ukraine, or Israel, the broader impact of the conflict could negatively impact our operations and\nfinancial results.\nOne of our strategies is to expand geographically, particularly in China, India and in developing countries, both through distribution and\nthrough direct operations. This subjects us to a number of risks, including international economic, political, and labor conditions; currency\nfluctuations; tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries); increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\nunexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements; failure of laws to protect intellectual property rights\nadequately; inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; delays resulting from\ndifficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology; tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions; transportation delays;\noperating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and other factors beyond our control,\nincluding terrorism, war, natural disasters, climate change and diseases. In addition, geopolitical tensions with these countries could\nexacerbate these risks.\nThe application of laws and regulations impacting global transactions is often unclear and may at times conflict. Compliance with these\nlaws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and\nprofitability. Non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions, prohibited business conduct, and damage to our\nreputation. We incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our global operations and could become subject to legal penalties in\nforeign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations, which may be substantially different from those in the U.S.\nWe continue to expand our operations in countries with developing economies, where it may be common to engage in business practices\nthat are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to the Company, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we implement\npolicies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors,\nand agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain aspects of our business operations, including those based in foreign\ncountries where practices which violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will comply with our internal policies. Any such non-\ncompliance, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could have an adverse effect on our business and result in significant fines or\npenalties.\nThe healthcare and life sciences industries that we serve face constant pressures and changes in an effort to reduce healthcare costs\nor increase their predictability, all of which may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur Protein Sciences segment products are sold primarily to research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at\nuniversity and government research institutions. Research and development spending by our customers and the availability of government\nresearch funding can fluctuate due to changes in available resources, mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, spending\npriorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies.\n18\nTable of Contents\nOur Diagnostics and Genomics segment products include applications in the medical diagnostics market, which relies largely on\ngovernment healthcare-related policies and funding. Changes in government reimbursement for certain diagnostic tests or reductions in\noverall healthcare spending could negatively impact us directly or our customers and, correspondingly, our sales to them. For example, our\nExosome Diagnostics business develops and sells novel exosome-based diagnostic tests. While we received public payer coverage for\ncertain uses, we are currently seeking expanded coverage from public payors as well as coverage decisions regarding reimbursement from\nadditional private payers. However, the process and timeline for obtaining coverage decisions is uncertain and difficult to predict. Further,\nreimbursement reductions due to changes in policy regarding coverage of tests or other requirements for payment (such as prior\nauthorization, diagnosis code and other claims edits, or a physician or qualified practitioner’s signature on test requisitions) may be\nimplemented from time to time. Additionally, the U.S. government’s plans to manage prescription drug prices, as well as its recently\nannounced intention to regulate lab developed tests, may impact the customers and industries we serve by increasing the cost of\ncommercializing and/or limiting the profitability of commercialized products. All of these payor actions and changes may have a material\nadverse effect on revenue and earnings associated with our diagnostics products.\nAcquisition and Investment Risks\nOur inability to complete acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices, and to make appropriate investments that\nsupport our long-term strategy, could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price.\nOne of our key strategies is growth through acquisition of other businesses and assets. Our ability to grow revenues, earnings and cash flow\nat or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate\nprices and realize anticipated synergies, and to make appropriate investments that support our long-term strategy. We may not be able to\nconsummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price. Promising\nacquisitions and investments are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including high valuations, competition among\nprospective buyers or investors, the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing\nconditions and obtain applicable antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms. Changes in accounting or regulatory\nrequirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions and investments.\nOur acquisition of businesses, investments, joint ventures and other strategic relationships, if not properly implemented or\nintegrated, could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nAs part of our business strategy, we acquire businesses, make investments and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in\nthe ordinary course of business, and we also from time to time complete more significant transactions. At the beginning of this fiscal year,\nwe completed the acquisition of Lunaphore SA, a leading developer of fully automated spatial biology solutions. Bio-Techne also obtained\na 19.9% ownership stake in Wilson Wolf and will acquire the remaining ownership no later than the end of calendar year 2027. We have\nalso continued participating in our collaborative marketing venture, ScaleReady LLC, with Wilson Wolf and another partner, which\naddresses the needs of the rapidly expanding cell and gene therapy market. While we believe these business ventures will advance our\nbusiness strategies and support our growth plans, we may not be successful in managing or integrating them into our company.\nAcquisitions, investments, joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of additional financial, accounting, managerial,\noperational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges, including but not limited to the following, any of which could adversely\naffect our business and our financial results:\n● businesses, technologies, services and products that we acquire or invest in sometimes under-perform relative to our expectations\nand the price that we paid, fail to perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable or fail to achieve and/or sustain\nprofitability;\n● we from time to time incur or assume debt in connection with our acquisitions and investments, which can result in increased\nborrowing costs and interest expense and diminish our future access to the capital markets;\n● acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships can cause our financial results to differ from our own or the\ninvestment community’s expectations in any given period, or over the long-term;\n19\nTable of Contents\n● acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships can create demands on our management, operational resources\nand financial and internal control systems that we may be unable to effectively address;\n● we can experience difficulty in integrating cultures, personnel, operations and financial and other controls and systems and\nretaining key employees and customers;\n● we may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition, investment, joint\nventure or strategic relationship;\n● we have assumed and may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that\nprove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired\ncompany’s or investee’s activities and the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies can increase our expenses,\nadversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations;\n● in connection with acquisitions and joint ventures, we often enter into post-closing financial arrangements such as purchase price\nadjustments, earn-out obligations and indemnification obligations, which can have unpredictable financial results; and\n● investing in or making loans to early-stage companies often entails a high degree of risk, and we may not always achieve the\nstrategic, technological, financial or commercial benefits we anticipate; we may lose our investment or fail to recoup our loan; or\nour investment may be illiquid for a greater-than-expected period of time.\nWe may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill and other amortizable intangible assets or other\ninvestments become impaired, which could negatively impact our financial results or stock price.\nWe are required under generally accepted accounting principles to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and to review our\ngoodwill, amortizable intangible assets, and other assets acquired through merger and acquisition activity for impairment when events or\nchanges in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill, amortizable\nintangible assets, and other assets acquired via acquisitions include significant adverse changes in the business climate and actual or\nprojected operating results (affecting our company as a whole or affecting any particular segment) and declines in the financial condition of\nour business. We may be required in the future to record additional charges to earnings if our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets or\nother investments become impaired. Any such charge would adversely impact our financial results.\nIn addition, the Company’s expansion strategies include collaborations and investments in joint ventures and companies developing new\nproducts related to the Company’s business. These strategies carry risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be\nadversely affected.\nStrategic and Operational Risks\nOur success will be dependent on recruiting and retaining highly qualified and diverse personnel and creating and maintaining a\nculture that successfully integrates the employees joining through acquisitions.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, production, sales and marketing, and management personnel representing diverse\nbackgrounds, experiences and skill sets are critical to our success. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our businesses,\nparticularly in the areas of science and technology, is extremely competitive. While retention improved in fiscal 2024, a number of our\nbusinesses and departments continued to face recruitment and retention challenges, and faced labor availability constraints and inflationary\ncosts. Our growth by acquisition also creates challenges in retaining employees. As we integrate past and future acquisitions and evolve our\ncorporate culture to incorporate new workforces, some employees may not find such integration or cultural changes appealing. The failure\nto attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business.\n20\nTable of Contents\nOur growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization of new and enhanced products and services that\nmeet our customers’ needs. Our growth can also be negatively impacted if our customers do not grow as anticipated.\nWe generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product\nintroductions and new market entrants and competitors. If we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a\ntimely basis, our offerings will become obsolete over time and our business and financial results will suffer. Our success will depend on\nseveral factors, including our ability to:\n● correctly identify and/or predict customer needs and preferences;\n● allocate our research funding to products with higher growth prospects;\n● anticipate and respond to our competitors’ development of new products and technological innovations;\n● differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings and avoid our products from becoming commodities;\n● innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have\nvaluable applications in the markets we serve;\n● obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies;\n● successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and cost-effectively manufacture and\ndeliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time;\n● obtain necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope (including with respect to certain diagnostic medical device products\nby demonstrating satisfactory clinical results where applicable, as well as achieving third-party reimbursement); and\n● stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies.\nIf we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in\nresearch and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our business and financial\nresults. Even when we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products, we often incur substantial costs in doing so, and our\nprofitability may suffer.\nWe face intense competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased\nmarket share or need to reduce prices to remain competitive.\nWe face intense competition across most of our product lines. Competitors include companies ranging from start-up companies, which may\nbe able to more quickly respond to customers’ needs, to large multinational companies, which may have greater financial, marketing,\noperational, and research and development resources than us. In addition, consolidation trends in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and\ndiagnostics industries have served to create fewer customer accounts and to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, resulting\nin increased pricing pressure on us. Moreover, customers may believe that consolidated businesses are better able to compete as sole source\nvendors, and therefore prefer to purchase from such businesses. The entry into the market by manufacturers in countries in Asia and other\nlow-cost manufacturing locations is also creating increased pricing and competitive pressures, particularly in developing markets. In order\nto compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing\nrelationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and\nleadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets, including high-growth markets. Our ability to\ncompete can also be impacted by changing customer preferences and requirements (for example increased demand for more\nenvironmentally-friendly products and supplier practices). Our failure to compete effectively and/or pricing pressures resulting from\ncompetition may adversely impact our business and financial results, and our expansion into new markets may result in greater-than-\nexpected risks, liabilities and expenses.\n21\nTable of Contents\nA significant disruption in, or breach of security of, our information technology systems or data, or violation of data privacy laws,\ncould result in damage to our reputation, data integrity and/or subject us to costs, fines, or lawsuits under data privacy or other\nlaws or contractual requirements.\nThe integrity and protection of our own data, and that of our customers and employees, is critical to our business. We rely on information\ntechnology systems, some of which are provided and/or managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information\n(including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers, other\nbusiness partners and patients), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as receiving and\nfulfilling orders, billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers and fulfilling\ncontractual obligations). These systems, products and services (including those we acquire through business acquisitions) can be damaged,\ndisrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, human error or malfeasance, power outages,\nhardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system\nredundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Attacks can also target hardware, software and\ninformation installed, stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into third-party\nproducts, facilities or infrastructure. Security breaches of systems provided or enabled by us, regardless of whether the breach is\nattributable to a vulnerability in our products or services, or security breaches of third party systems we rely on to process, store or transmit\nelectronic information, can result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal\ndata belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers, patients or suppliers. These attacks, breaches, misappropriations and other\ndisruptions and damage can interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners, delay production and shipments, result\nin theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, result in disclosure of personally identifiable information, damage\ncustomer, patient, business partner and employee relationships and our reputation and result in defective products or services, legal claims\nand proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, in each case resulting in an\nadverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIn addition, our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing\nsystems and develop or integrate new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving legal\nand regulatory standards, evolving customer expectations, changes in the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data and\ninformation systems, and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services. There can be no assurance\nthat we will be able to successfully maintain, enhance and upgrade our systems as necessary to effectively address these requirements.\nIf we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems or appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and\nsecurity requirements and prevent data breaches, we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences. As a global\norganization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a\nresult of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. For example, in the\nUnited States, a small number of our businesses are subject to HIPAA. Entities that violate HIPAA due to a breach of unsecured patient\nhealth information, or that arise from a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by the HHS, may be subject to significant civil,\ncriminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution\nagreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Individual states regulate data breach and\nsecurity requirements, and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy. Most notably,\nin the last several years, some states, including California, Virginia, Utah, Colorado and Connecticut, have passed broad privacy legislation\nthat could result in more material impacts as implementing regulations are issued. European laws require us to have an approved legal\nmechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data\nprotection laws of the EU member states may result in fines of up to €20 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the\npreceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties. Several other countries such as China and Russia have\npassed, and other countries are considering passing, laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local\nservers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation\nof our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of\nwhich may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial results.\n22\nTable of Contents\nIf we suffer loss to our supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events,\nour operations could be seriously harmed.\nOur supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems may be subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood,\nearthquake, hurricane, power shortage or outage, public health crisis (including epidemics and pandemics) and the reaction thereto, war,\nterrorism, riot or other man-made or natural disasters. If any of these supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it\ncould disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, diminish demand, damage customer\nrelationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and significant repair or replacement expenses. The third-party insurance\ncoverage that we maintain varies from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding\nrisk retention, and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against such losses.\nThe manufacture of many of our products is a complex process, and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing\nproducts, our business and financial results could suffer.\nThe manufacture of many of our products is a complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements for some of our products.\nProblems can arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and\nprocedures, problems with reliable sourcing of raw materials or components, natural disasters and environmental factors, and, if not\ndiscovered before the product is released to market, can result in recalls and product liability exposure. Because of the quality requirements\nof some of our customers as well as stringent regulations of the FDA and similar agencies regarding the manufacture of certain of our\nproducts, alternative manufacturing or sourcing is not always available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity. Any of these\nmanufacturing problems could result in significant adverse impacts to our business and financial results.\nIf we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in\nmarket conditions or customer demand, our business and financial results may suffer. In addition, our reliance upon sole or limited\nsources of supply for certain materials, components and services can cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies.\nWe purchase materials, components and equipment from third parties for use in many of our manufacturing operations. Our profitability\ncould be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations,\nincluding those caused by seasonality or cyclicality. During a market upturn, suppliers from time to time extend lead times, limit supplies\nor increase prices. If we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet\nincreasing demand, we may not be able to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed, our costs may increase, or we may\nbreach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities. Conversely, in order to secure supplies for the production of products, we\nsometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors, which can impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect\ndeclining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete\ninventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our business and financial results may suffer.\nIn addition, some of our businesses purchase certain materials from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance,\nregulatory requirements, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. If these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or\nother difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of\nsupply. The supply chains for our businesses can also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, bankruptcy or exiting of the business\nfor other reasons, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health\nissues, war, terrorist actions, governmental actions (such as trade protectionism) and legislative or regulatory changes. Any of these factors\ncan result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies. Because we cannot always immediately adapt our\nproduction capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, at times our manufacturing capacity may exceed or fall short\nof our production requirements. Any or all of these problems can result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing\nproducts to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.\n23\nTable of Contents\nThe Company relies heavily on internal manufacturing and related operations to produce, package and distribute its products\nwhich, if disrupted, could materially impair our business operations. Our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our\nsites.\nThe Company’s internal quality control, packaging and distribution operations support the majority of the Company’s sales. Since certain\nCompany products must comply with FDA regulations and because in all instances, the Company creates value for its customers through\nthe development of high-quality products, any significant decline in quality or disruption of operations for any reason could adversely\naffect sales and customer relationships, and therefore adversely affect the business. While we have taken certain steps to manage these\noperational risks, the Company’s future sales growth and earnings may be adversely affected by perceived disruption risks or actual\ndisruptions.\nWe rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products, pending\nsale. Any significant disruption of those operations for any reason, such as strikes or other labor unrest, power interruptions, fire, hurricanes\nor other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business.\nWe have significant operations in California, near major earthquake faults, which make us susceptible to earthquake risk. Although most of\nour raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers, our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at\nreasonable prices. If we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price, we may not be able to produce certain of our\nproducts or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price, which could have an adverse effect on our results\nof operations.\nClimate change and/or related environmental risks, or legal or regulatory measures to address climate change and/or related\nenvironmental risks, may negatively affect us.\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks\nto our operations. For example, we have significant operations in California, where serious drought has made water less available and\nmore costly and has increased the risk of wildfires. Changes in climate patterns leading to extreme heat waves or unusual cold weather at\nsome of our locations can lead to increased energy usage and costs, or otherwise adversely impact our facilities and operations and disrupt\nour supply chains and distribution systems. Concern over climate change can also result in new or additional legal or regulatory\nrequirements designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. Any such new or\nadditional legal or regulatory requirements may increase the costs associated with, or disrupt, sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of\nour products, which may adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, any failure to adequately address stakeholder\nexpectations with respect to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters may result in the loss of business, adverse reputational\nimpacts, diluted market valuations and challenges in attracting and retaining customers and talented employees. In addition, our adoption of\ncertain standards or mandated compliance to certain requirements could necessitate additional investments that could impact our\nprofitability.\nDefects, unanticipated use of, or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products, or allegations thereof, can adversely affect our\nbusiness and financial results.\nCertain of our products and services are sold for use in diagnostics. For those products and services in particular, manufacturing or design\ndefects in, unanticipated use of, safety or quality issues (or the perception of such issues) with respect to, “off label” use of, or inadequate\ndisclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell (including items that we source from third-parties) can\nlead to personal injury, death, and/or property damage and adversely affect our business and financial results. These events can lead to\nrecalls or safety alerts, result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being\nbrought against us. Recalls, removals and product liability and similar claims (regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome) result in\nsignificant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. Our\nbusiness can also be affected by studies of the utilization, safety and efficacy of medical device products and components that are\nconducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. Any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of\nsuch products in one or more countries and give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of\nproduct issues, including claims by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class.\n24\nTable of Contents\nBecause we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases\nin prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability.\nMost of our reagent products need to be stored and shipped at certain cold temperatures. Consequently, we ship a significant portion of our\nproducts to our customers by express mail or air delivery through package delivery companies, such as FedEx in the U.S. and DHL in\nEurope. If one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage, preventing our products\nfrom being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs\ncould increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected. In addition, if one or more of these third-\nparty package-delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our\ndelivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nWe are dependent on maintaining our intellectual property rights. If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property,\nor if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources\nenforcing our rights.\nMany of the markets we serve are technology-driven, and as a result intellectual property rights play a significant role in product\ndevelopment and differentiation. We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and\nlicenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our business. The intellectual property rights that we\nobtain, however, are not always sufficiently broad and do not always provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not\nbe issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. In addition, the steps that we and our licensors have taken to\nmaintain and protect our intellectual property do not always prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented, designed around\nor becoming subject to compulsory licensing. In some circumstances, enforcement is not available to us because an infringer has a\ndominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with\nemployees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these\nagreements adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies\nfor any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not\notherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights.\nThese risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of corporate proprietary\ninformation, intellectual property, technology and other assets comparable to the United States. We operate globally, with manufacturing\noperations in China and the UK, and approximately 43% of our revenue in fiscal 2024 was from outside the United States. The laws,\nregulations and enforcement mechanisms in other countries may in some cases be less protective of our intellectual property rights. Our\nfailure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or\ndetect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights can\nadversely impact our business and financial results.\nWe may be involved in disputes to determine the scope, coverage and validity of others’ proprietary rights, or to defend against\nthird-party claims of intellectual property infringement, any of which could be time-intensive and costly and may adversely impact\nour business.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to obtain licenses where\nnecessary or appropriate. We have obtained and continue to negotiate licenses to produce a number of products claimed to be owned by\nothers. Since we have not conducted a patent infringement study for each of our products, it is possible that some of our products may\nunintentionally infringe patents of third parties.\nWe have been and may in the future be sued by third parties alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. These lawsuits\nare expensive, take significant time, and divert management’s focus from other business concerns. If we are found to be infringing the\nintellectual property of others, we could be required to cease certain activities, alter\n25\nTable of Contents\nour products or processes or pay licensing fees. This could cause unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse effect on\nus. If we are unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms, or unable to design around any third party patent, we may be unable to\nsell some of our products and services, which could result in reduced revenue. In addition, if we do not prevail, a court may find damages\nor award other remedies in favor of the opposing party in any of these suits, which may adversely affect our earnings.\nFinancial and Tax Risks\nWe have entered into and drawn on a revolving credit facility, and we may incur additional debt in the future. The burden of this\nadditional debt could adversely affect us, make us more vulnerable to adverse economic or industry conditions, and prevent us\nfrom funding our expansion strategy.\nWe currently have a Credit Agreement that provides for a revolving credit facility of $1 billion, which can be increased by an additional\n$400 million subject to certain conditions. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable rate. As of August 16, 2024,\nthe Company had drawn $313 million under the Credit Agreement.\nThe terms of the Credit Agreement and the burden of the indebtedness incurred thereunder could have negative consequences for us, such\nas:\n● limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements,\nexpansion strategy, or other needs;\n● increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility in planning for, adverse changes in economic, industry and\ncompetitive conditions; and\n● increasing our vulnerability to increases in interest rates.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants\nlimit our ability to, among other things, sell, lease or transfer any properties or assets, with certain exceptions; and enter into certain merger,\nconsolidation or other reorganization transactions, with certain exceptions.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default,\nthe lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all\ncommitments to extend further credit. In addition, the Company would be subject to additional restrictions if an event of default exists\nunder the Credit Agreement, such as a prohibition on the payment of cash dividends.\nOur business and financial results can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our tax rates and tax\nliabilities and assessments (including as a result of changes in tax laws).\nInternational markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions.\nThe exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. International revenues and costs are subject to the risk\nthat fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into U.S. dollars for\nfinancial reporting purposes. These fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us. As a\nmultinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they\nprimarily do business (the \"functional currency\"). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely\nimpact our cash flows and our results of operations. As our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates\ncould have a larger effect on our financial results. In fiscal 2024, currency translation had a favorable effect of approximately $6 million on\nrevenues due to the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services.\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. In particular, we are affected by the\nimpact of changes to tax laws or related authoritative interpretations in the United States, including tax reform under the Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct which became effective in late 2017, which included broad and complex changes\n26\nTable of Contents\nto the United States tax code. Interpretations, assumptions and guidance regarding the Tax Act that have been issued subsequently have had\na material impact on our effective tax rate, and we anticipate that there may be additional changes to the U.S. tax code under a new\nAdministration.\nIn preparing our financial results, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors,\nincluding a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and\nfuture changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate\nsignificantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and cash flows.\nDividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future.\nFor many years, our Board has declared quarterly dividends. In the future, our Board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common\nstock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.\nLegal, Regulatory, Compliance and Reputational Risks\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nAs referenced in more detail above, we and our customers must comply with a wide array of federal, state, local and international\nregulations, in such areas as medical device, healthcare, import and export, anticorruption, and privacy. We develop, configure and market\nour products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our\nproducts or increase our expenses. For example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in\ndiscovering and developing drugs and diagnostic products. Changes in the U.S. FDA’s regulation of drug or medical device products, such\nas managing the price of certain prescription drugs or potentially increasing regulatory scrutiny of lab developed tests, could have an\nadverse effect on the demand for these products.\nWe have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities in the U.S. and elsewhere and, as a result, we are subject to\nvarious statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government (less than 3% of our fiscal 2024 sales were\nmade to the U.S. federal government). The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and\ngovernment contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to\ninvestigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result\nin suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.\nWe are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security\nstandards of the U.S. FDA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (the DEA), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the\nDHHS), and other comparable agencies and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us. In particular,\nwe are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices. Our subsidiaries may be required to register for\npermits and/or licenses with, and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of, the DEA, the FDA, the DHHS, foreign\nagencies and/or comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of\nproduct distribution, manufacturing and sale. The manufacture, distribution and marketing of many of our products and services, including\nmedical devices and pharma services, are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA, the DEA, and other equivalent local, state,\nfederal and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities. For example, the EU\nhas adopted the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the “EU IVDR”), which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in\nvitro diagnostic medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance.\nManufacturers of in vitro diagnostics medical devices that have been marketed and sold under the prior regulatory regime now have to\ncomply with some of the new EU IVDR requirements, while the effective date of other requirements have been delayed. Complying\nwith EU IVDR, the regulation applicable to the Company, may require material modifications to our quality management systems,\nadditional resources in certain functions, updates to technical files and additional clinical data in some cases, among other\n27\nTable of Contents\nchanges. Failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of the EU IVDR, or other requirements imposed by these or\nsimilar regulatory authorities, including without limitation, remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory\nauthorities, could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution,\nrestrictions on our operations, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, including those relating\nto products or facilities. In addition, such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims, contractual claims from our\ncustomers, including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, as well as ongoing remediation and\nincreased compliance costs, any or all of which could be significant. We are the sole manufacturer of a number of products for many of our\ncustomers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers’ ability to provide products to their customers.\nWe are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the\nimportation and exportation of products, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous,\nand our business practices in the U.S. and abroad such as anti-competition laws. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and\nregulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal, civil and administrative\npenalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSignificant developments or changes in U.S. laws or policies, including changes in U.S. trade policies and tariffs and the reaction of\nother countries thereto, can have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nSignificant developments or changes in U.S. laws and policies (including as a result of changes in party control of Congress or decisions\nfrom the U.S. Supreme Court), such as laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the\nterritories and countries where we or our customers operate, or governing the health care system and drug prices, can adversely affect our\nbusiness and financial results. For example, the previous U.S. administration increased tariffs on certain goods imported into the United\nStates and trade tensions between the United States and China escalated, with each country imposing significant additional tariffs on a wide\nrange of goods imported from the other country. That trade tension has not diminished under the current U.S. administration. The U.S. and\nChina could impose other types of restrictions such as limitations on government procurement or technology export restrictions, which\ncould affect our access to markets. In addition, changes to laws or regulations pertraining to laboratory developed tests may adversely\naffect our business and financial results. These factors have adversely affected, and in the future could further adversely affect, our business\nand financial results.\nOur business and financial results can be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.\nWe cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems, including our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct,\nprotect us from unauthorized acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner\nwith) that violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and\nfalse claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior,\nexport and import compliance, economic and trade sanctions, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act, the UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries\nfrom making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts\nof the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could\ndamage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related\nshareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur\nsignificant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies in\nwhich we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier code of conduct, and material violations of such\ncode of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business and financial results.\n28\nTable of Contents\nCertain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. FDA and by comparable agencies of other countries, as\nwell as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information. Failure to\ncomply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nCertain of our products are medical devices, diagnostics tests and other products that are subject to regulation by the U.S. FDA or state\nCLIA regulations, by other federal and state governmental agencies, by comparable agencies of other countries and regions and by\nregulations governing hazardous materials and drugs-of abuse, or the manufacture and sale of products containing any such materials. The\nglobal regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent and unpredictable. Several countries that did not have regulatory\nrequirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years, and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand,\ntheir existing regulations, including implementation of IVDR regulations in Europe. Failure to meet these requirements may adversely\nimpact our business and financial results in the applicable geographies.\nGovernment authorities may conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency\nguidance or case law. Failure to obtain required regulatory clearances before marketing our products (or before implementing modifications\nto or promoting additional indications or uses of our products), other violations of laws or regulations, failure to remediate inspectional\nobservations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with\nrespect to our products (even after obtaining clearance for distribution) and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future\nclinical trials can lead to FDA Form 483 Inspectional Observations, warning letters, notices to customers, declining sales, loss of\ncustomers, loss of market share, remediation and increased compliance costs, recalls, seizures of adulterated or misbranded products, fines,\nexpenses, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal penalties, consent decrees, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial\nor total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, narrowing of permitted uses for a product, refusal\nof the government to grant 510(k) clearance, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, pre-market notification rescissions and other adverse\neffects. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly and time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources.\nTherefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions brought against us, our business may be impaired. Ensuring that\nour internal operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations also involves substantial\ncosts.\nMore specifically, as a healthcare provider, the Company’s Exosome Diagnostics’ ExoDx Prostate business is subject to extensive\nregulation at the federal, state, and local levels in the U.S. and other countries where it operates. The Company’s failure to meet\ngovernmental requirements under these regulations, including those relating to billing practices and financial relationships with physicians,\nhospitals, and health systems, could lead to civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid, and\npossibly prohibitions or restrictions on the use of its laboratories. While the Company believes that it is in material compliance with all\nstatutory and regulatory requirements, there is a risk that government authorities might take a contrary position. Such occurrences,\nregardless of their outcome, could damage the Company’s reputation and adversely affect important business relationships it has with third\nparties.\nFailure to comply with privacy and security laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties and damage to the Company’s\nreputation and have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, a risk that has been elevated with recent acquisitions\nthat use protected health information and utilize healthcare providers for laboratory resting services.\nIf the Company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of personal or\nhealth information, it could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. In the U.S., the Health Insurance Portability\nand Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under U.S. Health\nInformation Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), establish comprehensive standards with respect to the use and\ndisclosure of protected health information (PHI) by covered entities, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity\nand security of PHI. HIPAA restricts the Company’s ability to use or disclose PHI, without patient authorization, for purposes other than\npayment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by HIPAA), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other\npermitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. If the laboratory operations use or disclose PHI improperly under these privacy\nregulations, they may incur significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of PHI in violation of the privacy and\nsecurity regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties.\n29\nTable of Contents\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nThere are no unresolved staff comments as of the date of this report.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nCybersecurity Governance and Oversight\nBio-Techne’s cybersecurity program is led by the Company’s Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”), with day-to-day management\nand administration of our cybersecurity program performed by the IT Security Operations team. The CISO reports to the Chief Information\nOfficer (“CIO”), and the CIO reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The CISO is supported by the Incident Response Team (“IRT”), a\nmulti-disciplinary management committee comprising senior members from the Security Operations Team, legal, finance, internal audit\nand other functions. The IRT supports the CISO and CIO in supporting and reviewing information security risks and in the event of a\ncybersecurity incident provides leadership with respect to incident response, investigation, mitigation and remediation.\nIn addition to leadership and support within management, we also work with security service providers to monitor for vulnerabilities and\nthreats, and which are reported to the Security Operations team. All employees are trained and tested annually on cybersecurity risks, and\nwe continually perform simulated phishing exercises with a focus on roles and functions with access to sensitive company and financial\ninformation. We also conduct periodic tabletop exercises for key personnel involved in cybersecurity risk management, including the IRT.\nOur Board of Directors (“Board”) holds overall oversight responsibility for the Company’s strategy and risk management, including in\nrelation to cybersecurity risks. The Board exercises its oversight function through the Audit Committee, which oversees the management of\nrisk exposure across various areas, including data security risks, in accordance with its charter. In addition, the Audit Committee is\nspecifically responsible for the review and approval of any cybersecurity incident disclosure, as set forth in the Committee’s charter. In the\nevent of a potentially significant cybersecurity incident, the Audit Committee’s charter requires that management promptly communicate\nand consult with the Audit Committee.\nBio-Techne’s General Counsel updates the Audit Committee multiple times per year regarding Bio-Techne’s cybersecurity programs,\nincluding regularly-tracked metrics on incident response, internal security testing, and measures implemented to monitor and address\ncybersecurity risks and threats, as appropriate. The Audit Committee regularly updates the full Board on these matters. In addition, the\nCISO and/or CIO provides the full Board with a thorough review of the Company’s cybersecurity program, including current status,\nindustry risks and exposure, and future strategy.\nBased on the information we have as of the date of this Annual Report, we do not believe any risks from cybersecurity threats have\nmaterially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect Bio-Techne, including our business strategy, results of operations or\nfinancial condition. However, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors – “A significant disruption in, or breach of security of, our information\ntechnology systems or data, or violation of data privacy laws, could result in damage to our reputation, data integrity and/or subject us to\ncosts, fines, or lawsuits under data privacy or other laws or contractual requirements.”\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nBio-Techne’s cybersecurity strategy is to maintain and fortify a secure, actively-monitored environment for our and our customers’ data that\ncomplies with legal requirements [and industry best practice] while supporting our and our customers’ business needs. Our cybersecurity\nprogram follows industry standards and best practice for preventing, detecting, remediating, and mitigating potential cybersecurity threats,\nincluding regular processes to identify, evaluate and manage potential risks.\n30\nTable of Contents\nOur IT Security Operations team administers and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of potential cybersecurity\nrisks.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL\nCONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following management discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our\noperating results, cash flows and financial condition. We provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the\neffect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and segment level. We also provide quantitative information about\ndiscrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. The MD&A should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial information and related notes included in this Form 10-K. This discussion contains various\n“Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and also contains various “Forward-Looking Statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995. We refer readers to the statements entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” located at the end of this\nMD&A and “Forward-Looking Information and Cautionary Statements” and “Risk Factors” within Items 1 and 1A of this Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nBio-Techne develops, manufactures and sells life science reagents, instruments and services for the research and clinical diagnostic markets\nworldwide. With our deep product portfolio and application expertise, we sell integral components of scientific investigations into\nbiological processes and molecular diagnostics, revealing the nature, diagnosis, etiology and progression of specific diseases. Our products\naid in drug discovery efforts and provide the means for accurate clinical tests and diagnoses.\nWe manage the business in two operating segments – our Protein Sciences segment and our Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Our\nProtein Sciences segment is a leading developer and manufacturer of high-quality biological reagents used in all aspects of life science\nresearch, diagnostics and cell and gene therapy. This segment also includes proteomic analytical tools, both manual and automated, that\noffer researchers and pharmaceutical manufacturers efficient and streamlined options for automated western blot and multiplexed ELISA\nworkflow. Our Diagnostics and Genomics segment develops and manufactures diagnostic products, including controls, calibrators, and\ndiagnostic assays for the regulated diagnostics market, exosome-based molecular diagnostic assays, advanced tissue-based in-situ\nhybridization assays for spatial genomic and tissue biopsy analysis, and genetic and oncology kits for research and clinical applications.\nRECENT ACQUISITIONS\nA key component of the Company's strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. As\ndisclosed in Note 4, the Company completed the acquisition of Lunaphore for $169.7 million, in a cash-free, debt-free acquisition. We also\npurchased a 19.9% investment in Wilson Wolf in fiscal 2023 and, as disclosed in Note 1, will acquire the remaining shares in Wilson Wolf\nby the end of calendar year 2027, or earlier depending on the achievement of certain future milestones.\nOVERALL RESULTS\nOperational Update\nFor fiscal 2024, consolidated net sales increased 2% to $1.2 billion as compared to fiscal 2023. Organic growth was 1%, with acquisitions\nhaving a favorable impact of 1%. Foreign currency translation and a business held-for sale did not have a material impact. Organic revenue\ngrowth was primarily driven by strong commercial execution in our Diagnostics and Genomics segment.\nConsolidated net earnings, including non-controlling interest, decreased 41% compared to fiscal 2023. The decrease in earnings was driven\nby a non-recurring gain on the sale of our ChemoCentryx investment, a non-recurring gain on the sale of our investment in Changzhou\nEminence Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Eminence), and a non-recurring benefit related to the fair value of contingent consideration during\nfiscal 2023. The decrease in fiscal 2024 was also impacted by impairment of assets held-for-sale, restructuring charges, and CEO transition\nrelated charges. After adjusting for cost recognized upon\n35\nTable of Contents\nsale of acquired inventory, intangibles amortization, acquisition-related costs, certain litigation charges, gain on sale of investments, stock-\nbased compensation, restructuring and restructuring-related costs, impairment of assets held-for-sale, impact of business held-for-sale, and\nimpact from partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries, adjusted net earnings attributable to Bio-Techne decreased 11% in fiscal 2024 as\ncompared to fiscal 2023. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Bio-Techne was primarily impacted by the acquisition of Lunaphore and\nunfavorable volume leverage within Protein Sciences.\nFor fiscal 2023, consolidated net sales increased 3% as compared to fiscal 2022. Organic growth was 5%, with foreign currency translation\nhaving an unfavorable impact of 2% and acquisitions having an immaterial impact. Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by\nconsumable growth in both our Diagnostics and Genomics and Protein Sciences segments.\nConsolidated earnings, including non-controlling interest, increased 8% compared to fiscal 2022. The increase in earnings was driven by a\ngain on the sale of our ChemoCentryx investment and a gain on the sale of our investment in Eminence. After adjusting for acquisition\nrelated costs, intangibles amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs, gain on investments, and impact from partially-\nowned consolidated subsidiaries, adjusted net earnings attributable to Bio-Techne decreased 1% in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022.\nAdjusted net earnings attributable to Bio-Techne was primarily impacted by foreign currency exchange and strategic growth investments\nincluding the Namocell acquisition.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\nConsolidated organic net sales exclude the impact of companies acquired during the first 12 months post-acquisition and the effect of the\nchange from the prior year in exchange rates used to convert sales in foreign currencies (primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Chinese\nyuan, and Swiss franc) into U.S. dollars.\nConsolidated net sales growth was as follows:\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nOrganic sales growth 1% 5% 17%\nAcquisitions sales growth 1% 0% 3%\nImpact of foreign currency fluctuations 0% (2)% (1)%\nImpact of business held for sale 0% —% —%\nConsolidated net sales growth 2% 3% 19%\nConsolidated net sales by segment were as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nProtein Sciences $ 830,902 $ 845,747 $ 832,311\nDiagnostics and Genomics 326,392 292,602 274,843\nOther revenue(1) 4,153 — —\nIntersegment (2,387) (1,647) (1,555)\nConsolidated net sales $ 1,159,060 $ 1,136,702 $ 1,105,599\n(1) Since December 31, 2023, the Company has a business that has met the held-for-sale criteria.

A business within the Protein Sciences Segment\nmet the criteria as held-for-sale since December 31, 2023. The exclusion of third and fourth quarter of\n36\nTable of Contents\nfiscal 2024 sales related to a held-for-sale business reduced sales by 1%. Organic revenue for the segment declined 2% for the fiscal year,\nwith foreign currency exchange having a favorable 1% impact on revenue. Segment revenue was impacted by broad based headwinds.\nIn fiscal 2024, Diagnostics and Genomics segment net sales increased 12% compared to fiscal 2023. Organic growth for the segment was\n6%, with acquisitions having a 5% impact and foreign currency exchange having a favorable impact of 1% on revenue growth. Segment\ngrowth was driven by broad based molecular diagnostics performance and Lunaphore.\nIn fiscal 2023, Protein Sciences segment net sales increased 2% compared to fiscal 2022. Organic growth for the segment was 4% for the\nfiscal year, with currency translation having an unfavorable impact of 2% on revenue and acquisitions having an immaterial impact on\nrevenue growth. Segment growth was driven by growth in consumable revenue to BioPharma (especially those developing cell and gene\ntherapies) and Academic customers within the Americas and Europe.\nIn fiscal 2023, Diagnostics and Genomics segment net sales increased 6% compared to fiscal 2022. Organic growth for the segment was\n8% with currency translation having an unfavorable impact of 2%. Segment growth was driven by growth in consumable revenue from our\nSpatial Biology platform and an increase in service revenue related to our ExoDx Prostate test.\nGross Margins\nConsolidated gross margins were 66.4%, 67.7%, and 68.4% in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022. Consolidated gross margins were impacted by\nrevenue. Excluding the impact of acquired inventory sold, amortization of intangibles, stock compensation expense, restructuring and\nrestructuring-related costs, impact of business held-for-sale, and the impact of partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries, adjusted gross\nmargins were 71.0%, 71.7%, and 72.5% in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Fiscal 2024 consolidated gross margin was impacted\nby the Lunaphore acquisition when compared to the prior period. Fiscal 2023 consolidated gross margin was unfavorably impacted by\nforeign currency exchange and strategic growth investments including the Namocell acquisition when compared to fiscal 2022.\nConsolidated gross margins for fiscal 2022 were impacted as a result of volume leverage and product mix, partially offset by additional\ninvestments made in the business to support future growth.\nA reconciliation of the reported consolidated gross margin percentages, adjusted for acquired inventory sold, intangible amortization\nincluded in cost of sales, restructuring and restructuring-related expenses, and impact of business held-for-sale is as follows:\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nConsolidated gross margin percentage 66.4% 67.7% 68.4%\nIdentified adjustments:\nCosts recognized upon sale of acquired inventory 0.1% 0.0% 0.1%\nAmortization of intangibles 4.0% 4.0% 3.7%\nStock compensation expense - COGS 0.1% 0.1% 0.1%\nRestructuring and restructuring-related costs 0.3% —% —%\nImpact of partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries(1) —% (0.1)% 0.2%\nImpact of business held-for-sale(2) 0.1% —% —%\nNon-GAAP adjusted gross margin percentage 71.0% 71.7% 72.5%\n(1) Includes the quarterly results of the partially-owned consolidated subsidiary prior to the sale of this partially-owned consolidated\nsubsidiary to a third party in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 and the full fiscal year of 2022.\n(2) Since December 31, 2023, the Company has a business that has met the held-for-sale criteria. Fiscal year 2024 includes the six-month\nresults of this business held-for-sale for the period starting December 31, 2023 through June 30, 2024 while the business has met the held-\nfor-sale criteria.\n37\nTable of Contents\nFluctuations in adjusted gross margins, as a percentage of net sales, have primarily resulted from changes in foreign currency exchange\nrates and changes in product mix. We expect that, in the future, gross margins will continue to be impacted by the mix of our portfolio\ngrowing at different rates as well as future acquisitions.\nManagement uses adjusted operating results to monitor and evaluate performance of the Company’s two segments. Segment gross margins,\nas a percentage of net sales, were as follows:\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nProtein Sciences 75.7% 75.3% 75.5%\nDiagnostics and Genomics 58.7% 61.2% 63.1%\nThe increase in the Protein Sciences segment’s gross margin percentage for fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023 was primarily\nattributable to the exclusion of a business held-for-sale. The change in the Protein Sciences segment’s gross margin percentage for fiscal\n2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily attributable to mix of product sales within the segment.\nThe change in the Diagnostics and Genomics segment’s gross margin percentage for fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023 is due to the\nLunaphore acquisition. The change in the Diagnostics and Genomics segment’s gross margin percentage for fiscal 2023 as compared to\nfiscal 2022 is due to fiscal 2022 revenue related to the ExoTru kidney transplant rejection agreement that did not reoccur in fiscal 2023.\nFiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was also impacted by strategic investments to drive future growth that was partially offset by volume\nleverage.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $88.0 million (23%) in fiscal 2024 when compared to fiscal 2023. Selling, general,\nand administrative expenses increased primarily due to the Lunaphore acquisition, impairment of assets held-for-sale, certain litigation\ncharges, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, and CEO transition charges.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $5.6 million (2%) in fiscal 2023 when compared to fiscal 2022.

Included in the available-for-sale investments was certificates of deposit that have contractual maturity dates within one year of $1.1\nmillion as of June 30, 2024. There were no certificiates of deposit in the prior comparable period. As of June 30, 2023, there was $23.7\nmillion included in the available-for-sale investments related to the fair value of the Company’s investment in exchange traded investment\ngrade bond funds.\nAt June 30, 2024, approximately 28% of the Company’s cash and cash equivalent account balances of $42.2 million were located in the\nU.S., with the remainder located in primarily in Canada, China, the U.K. and other European countries.\nAt June 30, 2024, all of the Company’s available-for-sale investment account balances of $1.1 million were located in Europe.\nAt June 30, 2024, we had $319 million in borrowings under the revolving credit facility, resulting in $681 million of unutilized availability\nunder our revolving credit facility.\nThe Company has either paid U.S. taxes on its undistributed foreign earnings or intends to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings\nin the foreign operations or expects the earnings will be remitted in a tax neutral transaction. Management of the Company expects to be\nable to meet its cash and working capital requirements for operations, facility expansion, capital additions, and cash dividends for the\nforeseeable future, and at least the next 12 months, through currently available funds, including funds available through our line-of-\ncredit and cash generated from operations.\nFuture acquisition strategies may or may not require additional borrowings under the line-of-credit facility or other outside sources of\nfunding.\nCash Flows From Operating Activities\nThe Company generated cash from operations of $299.0 million, $254.4 million, and $325.3 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022\nrespectively. The increase in cash generated from operating activities in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023 was mainly a result of\nchanges in the timing of cash payments on certain operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in cash generated from operating activities\nin fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 was mainly a result of changes in net earnings and changes in the timing of cash payments on\ncertain operating assets and liabilities.\n42\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows From Investing Activities\nWe continue to make investments in our business, including capital expenditures to enable revenue growth.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, the Company acquired Lunaphore for $169.7 million in cash-free, debt-free acquisition. During fiscal year 2023,\nthe Company acquired Namocell for $101.2 million, net of cash acquired. There were no acquisitions in fiscal year 2022.\nDuring the first fiscal quarter of 2023, the Company sold its remaining shares in Eminence, its partially-owned consolidated subsidiary, for\n$17.8 million. There were no sales of businesses in fiscal 2024 or 2022.\nIn the first fiscal quarter of 2023, the Company sold its remaining shares in its investment in CCXI for $73.2 million. There were no\ncomparable activities in fiscal 2024 and 2022.\nThe Company’s net proceeds (outflow) from the purchase, sale and maturity of available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2024, 2023, and\n2022 were $22.6 million, $14.7 million, and $(26.9) million, respectively. During fiscal year 2024, the Company’s proceeds in available-\nfor-sale investments relates to the sale of our exchange traded investment grade bond funds. The proceeds during fiscal year 2023 relates to\nthe sale of excess cash in certificates of deposit that matured. The outflow of cash in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2024 and\nfiscal year 2023 was driven by the purchase of the exchange traded investment grade bond funds in fiscal year 2022, which had a cost basis\nof $25.0 million, that did not reoccur in the comparative periods. The Company’s investment policy is to place excess cash in certificates of\ndeposit with the objective of obtaining the highest possible return while minimizing risk and keeping the funds accessible.\nCapital additions in fiscal year 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $62.9 million, $38.2 million, and $44.9 million. Fiscal 2024 capital expenditures\nrelated to investments in new buildings, machinery, construction in progress, and IT equipment. Fiscal 2023 capital expenditures related to\ninvestments in new buildings, machinery, and IT equipment. Capital additions planned for fiscal 2025 are approximately $48 million and\nare expected to be financed through currently available cash and cash generated from operations.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company paid $25 million to enter into a two-part forward contract which requires the Company\nto purchase the full equity interest in Wilson Wolf if certain annual revenue or EBITDA thresholds are met. During fiscal year 2023, Wilson\nWolf met the EBITDA target and the Company paid an additional $232 million to acquire 19.9% of Wilson Wolf. Since the first part of the\nforward contract has been triggered, the second part of the forward contract will automatically trigger, which requires the Company to\nacquire the remaining 80.1% of Wilson Wolf on December 31, 2027. The second part of the contract would be accelerated in advance of\nDecember 31, 2027 if Wilson Wolf meets certain financial milestones. As of June 30, 2024, the second milestones have not been met. The\nsecond option payment of approximately $1 billion plus potential contingent consideration is forecasted to occur between fiscal 2026 and\nfiscal 2028. During fiscal 2024, the Company received tax distributions from Wilson Wolf of $7.0 million.\nCash Flows From Financing Activities\nIn fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company paid cash dividends of $50.4 million, $50.3 million, $50.2 million, respectively. The Board of\nDirectors periodically considers the payment of cash dividends.\nThe Company received $60.9 million, $29.8 million, $77.2 million, for the exercise of options for 2,240,000, 1,578,000, and 2,450,000\nshares of common stock in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDuring fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company repurchased $80.0 million, $19.6 million, and $161.0 million, respectively, in share\nrepurchases included as a cash outflow within Financing Activities.\nDuring fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company drew $225.0 million, $619.7 million, and $90.0 million, respectively, under its revolving\nline-of-credit facility. Repayments of $256.0 million, $525.7 million, and $175.5 million were made on its line-of-credit in fiscal 2024,\n2023, and 2022, respectively.\nThere were no payments during fiscal 2024 nor fiscal 2023 for contingent consideration. During fiscal 2022, the Company made $4.0\nmillion in cash payments towards the Quad contingent consideration liability. Of the $4.0 million in total\n43\nTable of Contents\npayments, $0.7 million is classified as financing on the statement of cash flows. The remaining $3.3 million was recorded as operating on\nthe statement of cash flows as it represents the consideration liability that exceeds the amount of the contingent consideration liability\nrecognized at the acquisition date.\nDuring fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company paid $21.9 million, $28.9 million and $23.5 million, respectively, for taxes remitted on\nbehalf of participants in net share settlement transactions and restricted stock units.\nThe other financing activity during fiscal 2023 is primarily related to fees for the amended Credit Agreement that occurred in the first fiscal\nquarter. There was no comparable activity in fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2022.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s\nConsolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an\nongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other\nassumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the\ncarrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates\nunder different assumptions or conditions.\nThe Company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its business operations and an understanding of results of operations.\nThe listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies; investors should also refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the\ndate of the acquisition. The calculations used to determine the fair value of the long-lived assets acquired, primarily intangible assets, can\nbe complex and require significant judgment. We weigh many factors when completing these estimates including, but not limited to, the\nnature of the acquired company’s business; its competitive position, strengths, and challenges; its historical financial position and\nperformance; estimated customer retention rates; discount rates; and future plans for the combined entity. We may also engage independent\nvaluation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value calculations for significant acquired long-lived assets.\nThe fair value of acquired technology is generally the primary asset identified and therefore estimated using the multi-period excess\nearnings method. The multi-period excess earnings method model estimates revenues and cash flows derived from the primary asset and\nthen deducts portions of the cash flow that can be attributed to supporting assets, such as Trade Names and in-process research and\ndevelopment, that contributed to the generation of the cash flows. The resulting cash flow, which is attributable solely to the primary asset\nacquired, is then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the asset to calculate a present value. The Trade Name is\ngenerally calculated using the relief from royalty method, which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing\nthe technology. Assumed royalty rates are applied to the projected revenues for the remaining useful life of the technology to estimate the\nroyalty savings. In-process research and development assets are valued using the multi-period excess earnings method when the cash flows\nfrom the in-process research and development assets are separately identifiable from the primary asset. In circumstances that Customer\nRelationship assets are identified that are not the primary asset, they are valued using the distributor model income approach, which isolates\nrevenues and cash flow associated with the sales and distribution function of the entity and attributable to customer-related assets, which\nare then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the asset to calculate a present value.\nWe estimate the fair value of liabilities for contingent consideration by discounting to present value the probability weighted contingent\npayments expected to be made. For potential payments related to financial performance based milestones, projected revenue and/or\nEBITDA amounts, volatility and discount rates assumptions are included in the estimated amounts. For potential payments related to\nproduct development milestones, the fair value is based on the\n44\nTable of Contents\nprobability of achievement of such milestones. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is\nrecorded as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing on at least an annual basis.\nWe are also required to estimate the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets, which determines the amount of acquisition-related\namortization expense we will record in future periods. Each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our amortizable\nintangibles to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.\nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions, our fair value estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result,\nduring the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Any adjustments required after the measurement period are recorded in\nthe consolidated statements of earnings.\nThe judgments required in determining the estimated fair values and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities\nacquired can significantly affect net income. For example, different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ. Consequently, to the\nextent a longer-lived asset is ascribed greater value than a shorter-lived asset, net income in a given period may be higher. Additionally,\nassigning a lower value to amortizable intangibles would result in a higher amount assigned to goodwill. As goodwill is not amortized, this\nwould benefit net income in a given period, although goodwill is subject to annual impairment analysis.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nGoodwill\nGoodwill was $972.7 million as of June 30, 2024, which represented 36% of total assets. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual\nbasis in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that could indicate a possible\nimpairment.\nTo analyze goodwill for impairment, we must assign our goodwill to individual reporting units. Identification of reporting units includes an\nanalysis of the components that comprise each of our operating segments, which considers, among other things, the manner in which we\noperate our business and the availability of discrete financial information. Components of an operating segment are aggregated to form one\nreporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. We periodically review our reporting units to ensure that they\ncontinue to reflect the manner in which we operate our business.\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation\nfor goodwill is an assessment of factors including reporting unit specific operating results as well as industry and market conditions, overall\nfinancial performance, and other relevant events and factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for its\nreporting units and perform a quantitative test.\nThe quantitative impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on the income approach. The income\napproach is a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit’s financial forecast from the\nperspective of an unrelated market participant. Using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques, we project revenue and apply\nour fixed and variable cost experience rate to the projected revenue to arrive at the future cash flows. A terminal value is then applied to the\nprojected cash flow stream. Future estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value. The\ndiscount rate used is the value-weighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market\nmetrics. In determining the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, we are required to estimate a number of factors, including projected\noperating results, terminal growth rates, economic conditions, anticipated future cash flows, the discount rate and the allocation of shared\nor corporate items.\nFor fiscal 2024, we elected to perform a qualitative analysis for all five reporting units. The Company determined, after performing the\nqualitative analysis, there was no evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value was less than the carrying amounts, therefore, it\nwas not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test in fiscal 2024. During the\n45\nTable of Contents\nsecond quarter of fiscal 2024, as part of restructuring actions, certain assets and liabilities associated with a disposal group in our Protein\nSciences segment were classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2023. Given the upcoming divestiture, the Company identified a\ntriggering event and performed impairment testing during the second half of fiscal 2024. The impairment test resulted in a total impairment\ncharge of $22.0 million, which includes the allocated goodwill, which we have further described within Note 1. The Company did not\nidentify any triggering events after our annual goodwill impairment analysis through June 30, 2024, the date of our consolidated balance\nsheet, that would require an additional goodwill impairment assessment to be performed.\nFor fiscal 2023, we elected to perform a qualitative analysis for all five reporting units. The Company determined, after performing the\nqualitative analysis, there was no evidence that it was more likely than not that the fair value was less than the carrying amounts, therefore,\nit was not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test in fiscal 2023. The Company did not identify any triggering events after our\nannual goodwill impairment analysis through June 30, 2023, the date of our consolidated balance sheet, that would require an additional\ngoodwill impairment assessment to be performed.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company combined the management of the Exosome Diagnostics and Asuragen reporting units, both\nof which were included in the Diagnostics and Genomics operating segment. In conjunction with the combination of the reporting units, a\nqualitative goodwill impairment assessment was performed. The qualitative assessment identified no indicators of impairment.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2022 Eminence notified the Company of its need for additional capital to execute its growth plan. The\nCompany first attempted to find outside equity financing support for the Eminence investment but was unable to do so. The Company then\nreviewed the additional financing needs required to successfully ramp Eminence’s business, which ultimately did not meet the Company’s\nreturn on capital requirements. Therefore, the Company did not provide additional funding to Eminence. As a result of not obtaining\nadditional financing, Eminence notified the Company of its plans to cease operations and liquidate its business.\nGiven the upcoming liquidation process to dispose of the Eminence assets, the Company identified a triggering event and performed\nimpairment testing during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The impairment testing resulted in a full impairment of the Eminence goodwill\nand intangible assets, which resulted in charges of $8.3 million and $8.6 million, respectively, for the year ended June 30, 2022. The\nCompany also recognized inventory and fixed asset impairment charges of $0.9 million and $0.9 million, respectively. The Company\nrecorded the impairment charges within the General and Administrative line in the Consolidated Income Statement. The impairment\ncharges recorded within Net Earnings Attributable to Bio-Techne were reduced by approximately $8 million recorded within Net Earnings\nAttributable to Noncontrolling Interests. The remaining net tangible assets of Eminence included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of\nJune 30 2022, were $4.3 million and primarily consisted of fixed assets and related deposits of $3.1 million, inventory of $0.6 million,\nreceivables of $0.4 million, and other current assets of $0.1 million. The Company also had $4.5 million related to current liabilities. The\nCompany held a financial interest of approximately 57.4% in those tangible assets in the liquidation process. As described in Note 1, in the\nfourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Eminence was able to secure cash deposits on future orders to provide funding for their operations. This delay\nin liquidation allowed time for securing of additional investor financing which coincided with the sale of the Company's equity shares of\nEminence in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company combined the management of the Exosome Diagnostics and Asuragen reporting units, both\nof which are included in the Diagnostics and Genomics operating segment. In conjunction with the combination of the reporting units, a\nqualitative goodwill impairment assessment was performed. The qualitative assessment identified no indicators of impairment.\nIn our fiscal 2022 annual goodwill impairment analysis, we elected to perform a quantitative assessment for all five of our reporting units.\nThe result of our quantitative assessment indicated that all of the reporting units had a substantial amount of headroom as of April 1, 2022.\nThe Company did not identify any triggering events after our annual goodwill impairment through June 30, 2022, the date of our\nconsolidated balance sheet, that would require an additional goodwill impairment assessment to be performed.\n46\nTable of Contents\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nInformation regarding the accounting policies adopted during fiscal 2024 and those not yet adopted can be found under caption “Note 1:\nDescription of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements appear in\nItem 8 of this report.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn July 23, 2024, the Company invested $15 million in Spear Bio, an innovative leader in the development and manufacture of ultra-\nsensitive immunoassays capable of measuring protein biomarkers at attomolar level from sub-microliter sample volume.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”\nin Item 7, contains financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.\n(GAAP). These non-GAAP measures include:\n● Organic growth\n● Adjusted gross margin\n● Adjusted operating margin\n● Adjusted net earnings\n● Adjusted effective tax rate\nWe provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to\nevaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe\nthat our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these\nmeasures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results.\n47\nTable of Contents\nOur non-GAAP financial measure of organic revenue represents revenue growth excluding revenue from acquisitions within the preceding\n12 months, the impact of foreign currency, the impact of businesses held-for-sale, as well as the impact of partially-owned consolidated\nsubsidiaries. Excluding these measures provides more useful period-to-period comparison of revenue results as it excludes the impact of\nforeign currency exchange rates, which can vary significantly from period to period, and revenue from acquisitions that would not be\nincluded in the comparable prior period. Revenues from businesses held-for-sale are excluded from our organic revenue calculation starting\non the date they become held-for-sale as those revenues will not be comparative in future periods. Revenues from partially-owned\nsubsidiaries consolidated in our financial statements are also excluded from our organic revenue calculation, as those revenues are not fully\nattributable to the Company. There was no revenue from partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries in fiscal year 2024 due to the sale of\nChangzhou Eminence Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Eminence) in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue from partially-owned consolidated\nsubsidiaries was $2.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2023.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures for adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per\nshare basis, exclude stock-based compensation, which is inclusive of the employer portion of payroll taxes on those stock awards, the costs\nrecognized upon the sale of acquired inventory, amortization of acquisition intangibles, restructuring and restructuring-related costs, and\nother non-recurring items including non-recurring costs, goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, and gains. Stock-based compensation\nis excluded from non-GAAP adjusted net earnings because of the nature of this charge, specifically the varying available valuation\nmethodologies, subjection assumptions, variety of award types, and unpredictability of amount and timing of employer related tax\nobligations. The Company excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments, including costs\nrecognized upon the sale of acquired inventory and acquisition-related expenses inclusive of the changes in fair value contingent\nconsideration, and other non-recurring items including gains or losses on goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, and one-time\nassessments from this measure because they occur as a result of specific events, and are not reflective of our internal investments, the costs\nof developing, producing, supporting and selling our products, and the other ongoing costs to support our operating structure. We also\nexclude certain litigation charges which are facts and circumstances specific including costs to resolve litigation and legal settlement (gains\nand losses). In some cases, these costs may be a result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were not probable, inestimable, or\nunresolved at the time of acquisition. Costs related to restructuring and restructuring-related activities, including reducing overhead and\nconsolidating facilities, are excluded because we believe they are not indicative of our normal operating costs. Additionally, these amounts\ncan vary significantly from period to period based on current activity. The Company also excludes revenue and expense attributable to\npartially-owned consolidated subsidiaries as well as revenue and expense attributable to businesses held-for-sale in the calculation of our\nnon-GAAP financial measures.\nThe Company’s non-GAAP adjusted operating margin and adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per share basis, also excludes acquisition\nrelated expenses inclusive of the changes in fair value of contingent consideration, gain and losses from investments, as they are not part of\nour day-to-day operating decisions (excluding our equity method investment in Wilson Wolf as it is certain to be acquired in the future),\ncertain adjustments to income tax expense, and other non-recurring items including certain costs related to the transition to a new CEO.\nAdditionally, gains and losses from investments that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability are\nexcluded. The Company independently calculates a non-GAAP adjusted tax rate to be applied to the identified non-GAAP adjustments\nconsidering the impact of discrete items on these adjustments and the jurisdictional mix of the adjustments. In addition, the tax impact of\nother discrete and non-recurring charges which impact our reported GAAP tax rate are adjusted from net earnings. We believe these tax\nitems can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income\nassociated with historical trends and future results.\nThe Company periodically reassesses the components of our non-GAAP adjustments for changes in how we evaluate our performance,\nchanges in how we make financial and operational decisions, and considers the use of these measures by our competitors and peers to\nensure the adjustments are still relevant and meaningful.\nReaders are encouraged to review the reconciliations of the adjusted financial measures used in management’s discussion and analysis of\nthe financial condition of the Company to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures provided within the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements.\n48\nTable of Contents\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES\nABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company operates internationally, and thus is subject to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates.\nApproximately 31% of the Company’s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2024 were made in foreign currencies, including 14% in euro, 4% in\nBritish pound sterling, 6% in Chinese yuan, 3% in Canadian dollars, 1% in Swiss francs, and the remaining 3% in other currencies. The\nCompany is exposed to market risk primarily from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the euro, British pound sterling, Chinese yuan,\nCanadian dollar, and Swiss franc as compared to the U.S. dollar as the financial position and operating results of the Company’s foreign\noperations are translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation.\nMonth-end exchange rates between the euro, British pound sterling, Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc and the U.S. dollar, which\nhave not been weighted for actual sales volume in the applicable months in the periods, were as follows:\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nEuro\nHigh $ 1.10 $ 1.10 $ 1.19\nLow 1.06 0.98 1.05\nAverage 1.08 1.05 1.12\nBritish pound sterling\nHigh $ 1.29 $ 1.27 $ 1.39\nLow 1.22 1.11 1.21\nAverage 1.26 1.21 1.32\nChinese yuan\nHigh $ 0.14 $ 0.15 $ 0.16\nLow 0.14 0.14 0.15\nAverage 0.14 0.14 0.15\nCanadian dollar\nHigh $ 0.76 $ 0.78 $ 0.81\nLow 0.72 0.73 0.78\nAverage 0.74 0.74 0.79\nSwiss franc\nHigh $ 1.19 $ 1.12 $ 1.10\nLow 1.09 1.00 1.03\nAverage 1.13 1.07 1.08\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from trade receivables and intercompany payables denominated\nin one currency in the financial statements, but receivable or payable in another currency.\nThe Company does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted\nintercompany sales transactions or on intercompany foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions. Foreign currency transaction\ngains and losses are included in \"Other non-operating expense, net\" in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income.\nThe effect of translating net assets of foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as part of\n\"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\"\nThe effects of a hypothetical simultaneous 10% appreciation in the U.S. dollar from June 30, 2024 levels against the euro, British pound\nsterling, Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar and Swiss francs are as follows (in thousands):\nDecrease in translation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries $ 3,542\nDecrease in translation of net assets of foreign subsidiaries 59,519\nAdditional transaction losses 3,394\n49\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8.

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:\nDescription of business: Bio-Techne and its subsidiaries, collectively doing business as Bio-Techne Corporation (the Company), develop,\nmanufacture and sell life science reagents, instruments and services for the research and clinical diagnostic markets worldwide. With our\ndeep product portfolio and application expertise, we sell integral components of scientific investigations into biological processes and\nmolecular diagnostics, revealing the nature, diagnosis, etiology and progression of specific diseases. Our products aid in drug discovery\nefforts and provide the means for accurate clinical tests and diagnoses.\nAt the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders of the Company held on October 27, 2022, the shareholders approved an amendment and\nrestatement of the Company’s articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of the Company’s common stock from\n100,000,000 to 400,000,000. On November 1, 2022, the Company’s board of directors approved and declared a four-for-one split of the\nCompany’s common stock in the form of a stock dividend. Each stockholder of record on November 14, 2022 received three additional\nshares of common stock for each then-held share, which were distributed after close of trading on November 29, 2022. All share and per\nshare amounts presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the stock split.\nUse of estimates: The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,\ndisclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and\nexpenses during the reporting period. These estimates include the valuation of accounts receivable, available-for-sale investments,\ninventory, intangible assets, contingent consideration, stock-based compensation and income taxes. Actual results could differ from these\nestimates.\nPrinciples of consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nAll intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. As Eminence met the criteria for consolidation, the transaction was\naccounted for in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. In applying ASC 805 to the transaction, the Company has elected to\ninclude Eminence in our consolidated financial statements on a one month lag. As noted below, Eminence was sold during the first fiscal\nquarter of 2023.\nEquity method investments: The company accounts for its equity method investments in accordance with ASC 323, Investments - Equity\nMethod and Joint Ventures. The Company initially records its equity method investments at the amount of the Company’s investment and\nadjusts each period for the Company’s share of the investee’s income or loss and dividends paid. Distributions from the equity method\ninvestee are accounted for using the cumulative earnings approach on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nIn December 2021, the Company paid $25 million to enter into a two-part forward contract which requires the Company to make an initial\nownership investment followed by purchase of full equity interest in Wilson Wolf Corporation (Wilson Wolf) if certain annual revenue or\nannual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) thresholds are met. Wilson Wolf is a leading manufacturer\nof cell culture devices, including the G-Rex product line. The first part of the forward contract was triggered upon Wilson Wolf achieving\napproximately $92 million in annual revenue or $55 million in EBITDA at any point prior to December 31, 2027. During the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2023, the Company determined that Wilson Wolf had met the EBITDA target. On March 31, 2023, the Company paid an\nadditional $232 million to acquire 19.9% of Wilson Wolf, which is accounted for as an equity method investment.\nSince the first part of the forward contract has been triggered, the second part of the forward contract will automatically trigger, and\nrequires the Company to acquire the remaining equity interest in Wilson Wolf on December 31, 2027 based on a revenue multiple of\napproximately 4.4 times trailing twelve month revenue. The second part of the contract would be accelerated in advance of December 31,\n2027, if Wilson Wolf meets its second milestone of approximately $226 million\n54\nTable of Contents\nin annual revenue or $136 million in annual EBITDA. If the second milestone is achieved, the forward contract requires the Company to\npay approximately $1 billion plus potential consideration for revenue in excess of the revenue milestone.\nTranslation of foreign financial statements: Assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operations are translated at year-end rates of\nexchange and the resulting gains and losses arising from the translation of net assets located outside the U.S. are recorded as other\ncomprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income. The cumulative translation adjustment\nis a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Foreign statements of earnings are translated\nat the average rate of exchange for the year. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other non-operating expense in\nthe consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income.\nRevenue recognition: ASC 606 provides revenue recognition guidance for any entity that enters into contracts with customers to transfer\ngoods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of non-financial assets, unless those contracts are within the scope of other\naccounting standards. The core principle of ASC 606 is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or\nservices to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or\nservices. Refer to Note 2 for additional information regarding our revenue recognition policy under ASC 606.\nResearch and development: Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred. Development activities generally relate to\ncreating new products, improving or creating variations of existing products, or modifying existing products to meet new applications.\nAdvertising costs: Advertising expenses were $4.1 million, $4.8 million, and $4.6 million for fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively.\nAdvertising expenditures are expensed as incurred.\nIncome taxes: The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nrecognized to record the income tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and\nliabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which\nthose temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates\nis recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return are\nrecognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax\nauthorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being\nrealized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax\nexpense. Refer to Note 12 for additional information regarding income taxes.\nComprehensive income: Comprehensive income includes charges and credits to shareholders’ equity that are not the result of transactions\nwith shareholders. Our total comprehensive income consists of net income, unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges, and foreign\ncurrency translation adjustments. The items of comprehensive income, with the exception of net income, are included in accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of shareholders’ equity. Any tax effects, if applicable, associated with\nreclassifications of accumulated other comprehensive income to net income are reflected in the provision for income taxes.\nCash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly-liquid investments with original maturities of\nthree months or less.\nAvailable-for-sale investments: Available-for-sale investments consist of debt instruments with original maturities of generally three months\nto less than one-year and equity securities. Available-for-sale investments are recorded based on trade-date. The Company considers all of\nits marketable securities available-for-sale and reports them at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale securities\nare included within other income (expense).\nTrade accounts receivable and allowances: Trade accounts receivable are initially recorded at the invoiced amount upon the sale of goods\nor services to customers, and they do not bear interest. They are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts, which represent estimated\nlosses resulting from the inability of customers to make the required payments. When determining the allowances for doubtful accounts, we\ntake several factors into consideration, including the overall\n55\nTable of Contents\ncomposition of accounts receivable aging, our prior history of accounts receivable write-offs, the type of customer and our day-to-day\nknowledge of specific customers. Changes in the allowances for doubtful accounts are included in selling, general and administrative\n(SG&A) expense in our consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income. The point at which uncollected accounts are\nwritten off varies by type of customer. The Company does not have material long-term customer receivables.\nInventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. The Company regularly reviews\ninventory on hand for slow-moving and obsolete inventory, inventory not meeting quality control standards and inventory subject\nto expiration.\nFor certain proteins, antibodies, and chemically based manufactured products, the Company produces larger batches of established\nproducts than current sales requirements due to economies of scale through a highly controlled manufacturing process. Accordingly, the\nmanufacturing process for these products has and will continue to produce quantities in excess of forecasted usage. The Company forecasts\nusage for its products based on several factors including historical demand, current market dynamics, and technological advances. The\nCompany forecasts product usage on an individual product level for a period that is consistent with our ability to reasonably forecast\ninventory usage for that product. There have been no material changes to the Company’s estimates of the net realizable value for excess and\nobsolete inventory or other types of inventory reserves and inventory cost adjustments in the fiscal years presented. Additionally, current\nand historical reserves recorded to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value become part of the new cost basis for the\ninventory item in accordance with ASC 330 - Inventory.\nProperty and equipment: Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over an\nestimated useful life of 3 to 5 years. Buildings, building improvements and leasehold improvements are depreciated over estimated useful\nlives of 5 to 40 years.\nContingencies: The Company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements on an undiscounted basis for loss contingencies\nrelated to legal actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable\nestimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better restimate than any other, the minimum amount\nof the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and the amount may be reasonably estimated, the\nestimated loss or range of loss is disclosed.\nContingent Consideration: Contingent Consideration relates to the potential payment for an acquisition that is contingent upon the\nachievement of the acquired business meeting certain product development milestones and/or certain financial performance milestones.\nThe Company records contingent consideration at fair value at the date of acquisition based on the consideration expected to be transferred.\nFor potential payments related to financial performance milestones, we use a real option model in calculating the fair value of\nthe contingent consideration liabilities. The assumptions utilized in the calculation based on financial performance milestones include\nprojected revenue and/or EBITDA amounts, volatility and discount rates. For potential payments related to product development\nmilestones, we estimated the fair value based on the probability of achievement of such milestones. The assumptions utilized in the\ncalculation of the acquisition date fair value include probability of success and the discount rates. Contingent consideration involves certain\nassumptions requiring significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. Contingent consideration is\nremeasured each reporting period, and subsequent changes in fair value, including accretion for the passage of time, are recognized within\nselling, general and administrative in the consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income.\nIntangible assets: Intangible assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization expense is generally\ndetermined on the straight-line basis over periods ranging from 1 year to 20 years. Each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining useful\nlives of our amortizable intangibles to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of\namortization. If our estimate of an asset’s remaining useful life is revised, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is amortized\nprospectively over the revised remaining useful life.\nImpairment of long-lived assets and amortizable intangibles: We evaluate the recoverability of property, plant, equipment and amortizable\nintangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. Such\ncircumstances could include, but are not limited to, (1) a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, (2) a significant adverse\nchange in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or in its physical condition,\n56\nTable of Contents\nor (3) an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset. We\ncompare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with it. If the sum of the expected\nfuture net cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset being evaluated, an impairment loss would be recognized. The impairment\nloss would be calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. As quoted market prices\nare not available for the majority of our assets, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted\nvalue of estimated future cash flows.\nThe evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated.\nThese assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. During the second\nquarter of fiscal year 2024 there was a triggering event for the assets and liabilities associated with a disposal group in our Protein Sciences\nsegment that were classified as held-for-sale. See the restructuring section of Note 1 below for additional details. No other triggering events\nwere identified and no other impairments were recorded for property, plant, and equipment or amortizable intangibles during fiscal years\n2024, 2023, and 2022.\nImpairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets: We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible\nassets during the fourth quarter each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate a\npossible impairment. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to, (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in\nbusiness climate, (2) unanticipated competition, (3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, or (4) an adverse change in market\nconditions that are indicative of a decline in the fair value of the assets.\nTo analyze goodwill, we must assign our goodwill to individual reporting units. Identification of reporting units includes an analysis of the\ncomponents that comprise each of our operating segments, which considers, among other things, the manner in which we operate our\nbusiness and the availability of discrete financial information. Components of an operating segment are aggregated to form one reporting\nunit if the components have similar economic characteristics. We periodically review our reporting units to ensure that they continue to\nreflect the manner in which we operate our business. The Company had five reporting units for our 2024, 2023, and 2022 goodwill\nimpairment assessment performed on April 1 of each of the respective fiscal years, the date of our annual goodwill impairment assessment.\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation\nfor goodwill is an assessment of factors including reporting unit specific operating results as well as industry and market conditions, overall\nfinancial performance, and other relevant events and factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for its\nreporting units and perform a quantitative test.\nThe quantitative impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units based the income approach. The income\napproach is a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit’s financial forecast from the\nperspective of an unrelated market participant. Using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques, we project revenue and apply\nour fixed and variable cost experience rate to the projected revenue to arrive at the future cash flows. A terminal value is then applied to the\nprojected cash flow stream. Future estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value. The\ndiscount rate used is the value-weighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market\nmetrics. In determining the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, we are required to estimate a number of factors, including projected\noperating results, terminal growth rates, economic conditions, anticipated future cash flows, the discount rate and the allocation of shared\nor corporate items.\nFor fiscal 2024, we elected to perform a qualitative analysis for all five reporting units. The Company determined, after performing the\nqualitative analysis, there was no evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value was less than the carrying amounts, therefore, it\nwas not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test in fiscal 2024. There was a triggering event related to a business held-for-sale\ndescribed later in this note, leading to an impairment of allocated goodwill during the second half of fiscal 2024. The Company did not\nidentify any triggering events after our annual goodwill impairment analysis through June 30, 2024, the date of our consolidated balance\nsheet, that would require an additional goodwill impairment assessment to be performed.\n57\nTable of Contents\nFor fiscal 2024, the Company also performed a qualitative assessment of the acquired in-process research and development assets to\ndetermine whether changes in events, circumstances, or the probability of successful development and commercialization of the assets\nindicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the acquired assets are less than its carrying amount. Based on the analysis, the\nCompany determined there was no indication of impairment of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. This in-process research and\ndevelopment was placed into service during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and will begin amortization over its expected useful life.\nIn fiscal 2023, we elected to perform a qualitative analysis for all five reporting units. The Company determined, after performing the\nqualitative analysis, there was no evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value was less than the carrying amounts, therefore, it\nwas not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test in fiscal 2023. The Company did not identify any triggering events after our\nannual goodwill impairment analysis through June 30, 2023, the date of our consolidated balance sheet, that would require an additional\ngoodwill impairment assessment to be performed.\nOn September 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its equity shares of Eminence for approximately $17.8 million to a third party.\nEminence was considered a variable-interest entity that was fully consolidated in our financial statements. Prior to the sale, Eminence had\nrevenue of $2.0 million for the first fiscal quarter of 2023 within our Protein Sciences segment. Fiscal 2022 revenues were $4.6 million. As\na result of the sale of the business, the Company recorded a gain of $11.7 million within the Other income (expense) line in the\nConsolidated Statement of Earnings. Prior to the sale of Eminence, a triggering event was identified in the second quarter of fiscal 2022\nand impairment testing was performed as Eminence was forecasted to not have sufficient cash to execute on their growth plan combined\nwith their inability to secure additional financing. Our impairment testing resulted in a full impairment of the Eminence goodwill and\nintangibles assets for charges of $8.3 million and $8.6 million, respectively, for the year ended June 30, 2022. The Company also\nrecognized inventory and fixed asset impairment charges of $0.9 million and $0.9 million, respectively. These impairment charges were\nrecorded within the General and Administrative line in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for fiscal 2022. In the fourth quarter of\nfiscal 2022, Eminence was able to secure cash deposits on future orders to provide funding for their operations. This delay in liquidation\nallowed time for securing of additional investor financing which coincided with the sale of the Company's investment.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company combined the management of the Exosome Diagnostics and Asuragen reporting units, both\nof which are included in the Diagnostics and Genomics operating segment. In conjunction with the combination of the reporting units, a\nqualitative goodwill impairment assessment was performed. The qualitative assessment identified no indicators of impairment.\nIn our fiscal 2022 annual goodwill impairment analysis, we elected to perform a quantitative assessment for all five of our reporting units.\nThe result of our quantitative assessment indicated that all of the reporting units had a substantial amount of headroom as of April 1, 2022.\nThe Company did not identify any triggering events after our annual goodwill impairment through June 30, 2022, the date of our\nconsolidated balance sheet, that would require an additional goodwill impairment assessment to be performed.\nRestructuring actions: Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract\ntermination costs, and impairments and disposals of assets associated with such actions. Employee-related severance charges are based\nupon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in the quarter when the actions are\nprobable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Asset-related and other\ncharges include impairment of right-of-use assets, leasehold improvements, other asset write-downs associated with combining operations,\ndisposal of assets and other exit costs. Other costs also includes restructuring-related charges, which are incremental costs incurred directly\nsupporting business transformation initiatives tied to the restructuring action.\nFiscal Year 2024 Restructuring Actions:\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company announced enterprise-wide restructuring focused on recovering operating margins,\noptimizing our distribution footprint, and enhancing our organization efficiency. These actions impacted approximately 4% of our global\nworkforce. These actions continued through the end of fiscal 2024 as we incurred charges relating to the condensing of certain distribution\ncenters and optimizing efficiency. The Company is expecting to\n58\nTable of Contents\nincur costs related to these actions through the first half of fiscal 2025, which will be recorded when specified criteria are met.\nAs part of these actions, certain assets and liabilities associated with a disposal group in our Protein Sciences segment were classified as\nheld-for-sale as of December 31, 2023, including $1.4 million of goodwill allocated to the disposal group on a relative fair value basis. As a\nresult of impairment tests performed over the disposal group during fiscal 2024, a cumulative impairment charge of $22.0 million which\nincludes the allocated goodwill, was recorded in the Selling, general and administrative line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for\nthe year ended June 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2024, the assets remaining within the disposal group primarily include inventory and property\nand equipment of $9.8 million, which is net of expected selling costs. These assets are actively marketed, and we believe their sale will be\ncompleted within 12 months of the held-for-sale classification date. The held-for-sale assets are recorded in Current assets held-for-sale in\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2024.\nThe restructuring and restructuring-related charges, including the impairment of assets held-for-sale, for periods presented were recorded in\nthe Consolidated Statements of Earnings as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nJune 30,\n2024\nCost of sales $ 3,349\nSelling, general and administrative(1) 30,638\nTotal $ 33,987\n(1) Restructuring actions impacting research and development are not material to separately disclose and have been included within Selling,\ngeneral and administrative costs.\nRestructuring and restructuring-related costs by segment are as follows (in thousands):\nYear ended June 30, 2024\nEmployee Asset-related Impairment of\nseverance and other assets held-for-sale Total\nProtein Sciences $ 3,483 $ 5,130 $ 21,963 $ 30,576\nDiagnostics and Genomics 1,007 224 — 1,231\nCorporate 1,153 1,027 — 2,180\nTotal $ 5,643 $ 6,381 $ 21,963 $ 33,987\n59\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the Company’s accrued restructuring balance, which is included within Other current\nliabilities in the accompanying balance sheet.

The closure of the site was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. As a result of the restructuring\nactivities, an estimated pre-tax charge of $2.2 million was recorded within our Protein Sciences segment for the year ended June 30, 2023.\nThe related restructuring charges for the year ended June 30, 2023 were recorded in the income statement as follows (in thousands):\nEmployee Asset\nseverance impairment and other Total\nSelling, general and administrative $ 1,328 $ 842 $ 2,170\nEmployee Asset\nseverance impairment and other Total\nExpense incurred in the first quarter of 2023 $ 1,328 $ 842 $ 2,170\nCash payments (1,233) (772) (2,005)\nAdjustments (95) (70) (165)\nAccrued restructuring actions balances as of June 30, 2023 $ — $ — $ —\nProtein Sciences realignment\nIn December 2022, the Company informed employees it would undertake certain actions to strategically reallocate operations resources to\nhigh growth areas of the business. Additional actions were taken in June 2023 primarily related to the sales organization. The actions\nimpacted a limited number of employees and were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. As a result of the realignment, a pre-tax\ncharge of $1.7 million related to employee severance was recorded in the Selling, general and administrative line of operating income\nwithin our Protein Sciences segment during the year ended June 30, 2023. Adjustments in fiscal year 2024 relate to the refinement of\nemployee severance payouts. Additional pre-\n60\nTable of Contents\ntax charges for the year ended June 30, 2024 were $0.2 million.

The restructuring\nactivities were complete as of June 30, 2022. As a result of the restructuring activities, a pre-tax charge of $1.4 million was recorded within\nour Diagnostics and Genomics segment during the year ended June 30, 2022. Total restructuring charges for the closure of the Exosome\nDiagnostics Germany facility for the year ended June 30, 2022 were recorded within operating income on the income statement as follows\n(in thousands):\nEmployee Asset\nseverance impairment and other Total\nSelling, general and administrative $ 649 $ 750 $ 1,399\nEmployee Asset\nseverance impairment and other Total\nExpense incurred in the first quarter of 2022 $ 639 $ 546 $ 1,185\nIncremental expense incurred during fiscal 2022 — 242 242\nCash payments (589) (554) (1,143)\nAdjustments (50) (234) (284)\nAccrued restructuring actions balances as of June 30, 2022 $ — $ — $ —\n(1) Adjustments include refinements to our estimated close down costs as well as the impacts from foreign currency exchange.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company also incurred a restructuring charge of $0.2 million related to employee severance\nfor the relocation of a US plant. This was completed during fiscal 2023 and there are no remaining liabilities related to this relocation as of\nJune 30, 2023. This charge was recorded within Other current liabilities as of June 30, 2022. Fiscal 2023 cash payments did not materially\ndiffer from the charge recorded in fiscal 2022.\nLegal Matters: The Company and its affiliates are involved in a number of legal actions from time to time involving product liability,\nemployment, intellectual property and commercial disputes, shareholder related matters, environmental proceedings, tax disputes, and\ngovernmental proceedings and investigations. With respect to governmental proceedings and investigations, like other companies in our\nindustry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation by national, state, and local governmental agencies in the United States and in\nother jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate. The Company’s standard practice is to cooperate with regulators and\ninvestigators in responding to inquiries. The outcomes of legal actions are not within the Company’s complete control and may not be\nknown for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages, as well as other\nremedies (including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding), that could require\n61\nTable of Contents\nsignificant expenditures, result in lost revenues, or limit the Company's ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions.\nThe Company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements on an undiscounted basis for loss contingencies related to legal\nactions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or\nprobable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If\na loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed.\nWhen determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required. Estimates of probable losses resulting from\nlitigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in\nearly procedural stages with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery, involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages,\npotentially involve penalties, fines or punitive damages, or could result in a change in business practice. The Company classifies certain\nspecified litigation charges and gains related to significant legal matters as certain litigation charges in the consolidated statements of\nincome.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, the Company recognized $3.5 million of certain litigation charges. There was no comparable activity in the\ncomparable periods. As of each of the balance sheet dates presented, there was no accrued litigation. The ultimate cost to the Company\nwith respect to accrued litigation could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. The Company includes accrued\nlitigation in other current liabilities and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. While it is not possible to predict the outcome\nfor most of the legal matters discussed below, the Company believes it is possible that the costs associated with these matters could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.\nIntellectual Property Matters: At any given time, the Company is involved in litigation relating to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade\nsecrets, and other intellectual property (IP) rights, and licenses, acquisitions or other agreements related to such rights. This litigation\nincludes, but it not limited to, alleged infringement or misappropriation of IP rights, or breach of obligations related to IP rights, or other\nclaims asserted by competitors, individuals, or entities created specifically to fund IP litigation. While the outcome of these litigation\nmatters is inherently uncertain, it is possible that the results of such litigation could require the Company to pay significant monetary\ndamages.\nOther Significant Accounting Policies\nThe following table includes a reference to additional significant accounting policies that are described in other notes to the financial\nstatements, including the note number:\nPolicy Note\nFair value measurements 5\nLeases 7\nEarnings per share 9\nShare-based compensation 10\nOperating segments 13\nNot Yet Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280), which requires\nincremental disclosures on reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures on significant segment expenses. The Company\nwill adopt this guidance beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 for our annual report and for interim periods starting in fiscal\nyear 2026. We are currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740), which requires incremental\nannual disclosures on income taxes, including rate reconciliations, income taxes paid, and other disclosures.\n62\nTable of Contents\nThe Company will adopt this guidance beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2026 for our annual report. We are currently evaluating\nthe potential effect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nOther than the items noted above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective or adopted in the current year that\nwe believe have a significant impact, or potential significant impact, on our consolidated financial statements.\nNote 2. Revenue Recognition:\nConsumables revenues consist of specialized proteins, immunoassays, antibodies, reagents, blood chemistry and blood gas quality controls,\nand hematology instrument controls that are typically single-use products recognized at a point in time following the transfer of control of\nsuch products to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Instruments revenues typically consist of longer lived assets that, for\nthe substantial majority of sales, are recognized at a point in time in a manner similar to consumables. Service revenues consist of extended\nwarranty contracts, post contract support, and custom development projects that are recognized over time as either the customers receive\nand consume the benefits of such services simultaneously or the underlying asset being developed has no alternative use for the Company\nat contract inception and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for the portion of the performance completed. Service revenues\nalso include laboratory services recognized at point in time.\nWe recognize royalty revenues in the period the sales occur using third party evidence. The Company elected the \"right to invoice\"\npractical expedient based on the Company's right to invoice a customer at an amount that approximates the value to the customer and the\nperformance completed to date.\nThe Company elected the exemption to not disclose the unfulfilled performance obligations for contracts with an original length of one\nyear or less and the exemption to exclude future performance obligations that are accounted under the sales-based or usage-based royalty\nguidance. The Company’s unfulfilled performance obligations for contracts with an original length greater than one year were not material\nas of June 30, 2024.\nContracts with customers that contain instruments may include multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, the Company\nallocates the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. Allocation of the\ntransaction price is determined at the contracts’ inception.\nPayment terms for shipments to end-users are generally net 30 days. Payment terms for distributor shipments may range from 30 to 90\ndays. Service arrangements commonly call for payments in advance of performing the work (e.g. extended warranty and service contracts),\nupon completion of the service (e.g. custom development manufacturing) or a mix of both.\nContract assets include revenues recognized in advance of billings. Contract assets are included within other current assets in the\naccompanying balance sheet as the amount of time expected to lapse until the company's right to consideration becomes unconditional is\nless than one year. We elected the practical expedient allowing us to expense contract costs that would otherwise be capitalized and\namortized over a period of less than one year. Contract assets as of June 30, 2024 are not material. Contract liabilities include billings in\nexcess of revenues recognized, such as those resulting from customer advances and deposits and unearned revenue on warranty contracts.\nContract liabilities as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 were approximately $30.2 million and $24.6 million, respectively. Contract\nliabilities as of June 30, 2023 subsequently recognized as revenue during the year ended June 30, 2024 were approximately $20.9 million.\nContract liabilities as of June 30, 2022 subsequently recognized as revenue during the year ended June 30, 2023 were approximately $21.5\nmillion. Contract liabilities in excess of one year are included in Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\nAny claims for credit or return of goods must be made within 10 days of receipt. Revenues are reduced to reflect estimated credits and\nreturns. Although the amounts recorded for these revenue deductions are dependent on estimates and assumptions, historically our\nadjustments to actual results have not been material.\nTaxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. Amounts\nbilled to customers for shipping and handling are included in revenue, while the related shipping and handling costs are reflected in cost of\nproducts. We elected the practical expedient that allows us to account for shipping\n63\nTable of Contents\nand handling activities that occur after the customer has obtained control of a good as a fulfillment cost, and we accrue costs of shipping\nand handling when the related revenue is recognized. The following tables present our disaggregated revenue for the periods presented.\nRevenue by type is as follows (in thousands):\nYear ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nConsumables $ 928,180 $ 917,733 $ 890,874\nInstruments 108,270 112,085 120,758\nServices 99,265 85,784 71,988\nTotal product and services revenue, net 1,135,715 $ 1,115,602 1,083,620\nRoyalty revenues 23,345 21,100 21,979\nTotal revenues, net $ 1,159,060 $ 1,136,702 $ 1,105,599\nRevenue by geography (in thousands):\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nUnited States $ 657,747 $ 642,465 $ 614,107\nEMEA, excluding United Kingdom 241,432 220,230 219,055\nUnited Kingdom 50,012 49,457 48,637\nAPAC, excluding Greater China 73,904 73,190 76,139\nGreater China 99,467 113,868 112,438\nRest of World 36,498 37,492 35,223\nNet sales $ 1,159,060 $ 1,136,702 $ 1,105,599\nNote 3.

Acquisitions:\nWe periodically complete business combinations that align with our business strategy. Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition\nmethod of accounting, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the\nacquisition date and that the results of operations of each acquired business be included in our consolidated statements of comprehensive\nincome from their respective dates of acquisitions. Acquisition costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as\nincurred.\nFiscal year 2024 Acquisitions\nLunaphore Technologies SA.\nOn July 7, 2023, the Company acquired all of the ownership interests of Lunaphore Technologies SA (“Lunaphore”) for $169.7 million, in\na cash-free, debt-free acquisition. Lunaphore is a leading developer of fully automated spatial biology solutions. The Lunaphore acquisition\nadds spatial biology instruments to Bio-Techne’s portfolio to accelerate our leadership position in translational and clinical research\nmarkets. The transaction was accounted for in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. The goodwill recorded as a result of the\nacquisition represents the strategic benefits of growing the Company’s product portfolio and the expected revenue growth from increased\nmarket penetration. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. The business became part of the Diagnostics and Genomics\noperating segment in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024.\nThe allocation of purchase price consideration related to Lunaphore was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Net sales and\noperating loss of this business included in Bio-Techne's consolidated results of operations for the year ended June 30, 2024 were\napproximately $14.3 million and $24.0 million, respectively. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the\nacquisition date and the updated final amounts as of June 30, 2024 are as follows (in thousands):\nPreliminary allocation at acquisition Adjustments to Final allocation at\ndate fair value June 30, 2024\nCurrent assets $ 12,512 $ (357) $ 12,155\nEquipment and other long-term assets 1,470 1,470\nIntangible assets:\nDeveloped technologies 60,300 60,300\nTradenames 4,900 4,900\nCustomer relationships 1,200 1,200\nGoodwill 102,560 2,090 104,650\nTotal assets acquired 182,942 1,733 184,675\nLiabilities 7,096 7,096\nDeferred income taxes, net 5,768 2,104 7,872\nNet assets acquired $ 170,078 $ (371) $ 169,707\nCash paid 166,426 3,281 169,707\nEstimated Net Working Capital 3,652 (3,652) —\nNet assets acquired $ 170,078 $ (371) $ 169,707\nTangible assets and liabilities acquired were recorded at fair value on the date of close based on management's assessment. The purchase\nprice allocated to developed technology and customer relationships was based on management’s forecasted cash inflows and outflows and\nusing a multiperiod excess earnings method to calculate the fair value of assets purchased. The purchase price allocated to trade names was\nbased on management's forecasted cash inflows and outflows and using a relief from royalty method. The amount recorded for developed\ntechnology is being amortized with the expense reflected in cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and\nComprehensive Income. The amortization period for developed technology is estimated to be 14 years.

The amount recorded for trade names is being amortized with the expense\nreflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The\namortization period for trade names ranges from 4 years to 8 years. The net deferred income tax liability represents the net amount of the\nestimated future impact of adjustments for costs to be recognized as intangible asset amortization, which is not deductible for income tax\npurposes, offset by the deferred tax asset for the preliminary calculation of acquired net operating losses.\nFiscal year 2023 Acquisitions\nNamocell, Inc.\nOn July 1, 2022, the Company acquired all of the ownership interests of Namocell, Inc. (“Namocell”) for $101.2 million, net of cash\nacquired, plus contingent consideration of up to $25 million upon the achievement of certain future revenue thresholds.

Fair Value Measurements:\nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, available for sale investments, accounts receivable, accounts\npayable, contingent consideration obligations, derivative instruments, and long-term debt.\nFair value is defined as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants as of the measurement date. This standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value. This\nstandard maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs\nbe used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability based on market data\nobtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the factors market participants would\nuse in valuing the asset or liability based upon the best information available in the circumstances.\nThe categorization of financial assets and liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant\nto the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for\nidentical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset\nor liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability and their fair values are determined using\npricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is\nunobservable. Level 3 may also include certain investment securities for which there is limited market activity or a decrease in the\nobservability of market pricing for the investments, such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.\n69\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables provide information by level for financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in\nthousands):\nTotal\ncarrying\nvalue as of Fair Value Measurements Using\nBalance Sheet Location June 30, Inputs Considered as\n2024 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets\nCertificates of deposit(1) Short-term available-for-sale investments $ 1,072 $ 1,072 $ — $ —\nDerivatives designated as\nhedging instruments - cash flow\nhedges Other current assets 805 — 805 —\nDerivatives designated as\nhedging instruments - cash flow\nhedges Other assets 9,813 — 9,813 —\nTotal assets $ 11,690 $ 1,072 $ 10,618 $ —\nLiabilities\nDerivatives designated as\nhedging instruments - net\ninvestment hedge Other long-term liabilities $ 2,051 $ — $ 2,051 $ —\nTotal liabilities $ 2,051 $ — $ 2,051 $ —\nTotal\ncarrying\nvalue as of Fair Value Measurements Using\nBalance Sheet Location June 30, Inputs Considered as\n2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets\nExchange traded securities(2) Short-term available-for-sale investments $ 23,739 $ 23,739 $ — $ —\nDerivative instruments - cash\nflow hedges Other assets 16,857 — 16,857 —\nTotal assets $ 40,596 $ 23,739 $ 16,857 $ —\nLiabilities\nContingent consideration Contingent consideration payable $ 3,500 $ — $ — $ 3,500\nTotal liabilities $ 3,500 $ — $ — $ 3,500\n(1) The certificates of deposit have contractual maturity dates within one year.\n(2) During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold all of its exchange traded investment grade bond funds that it held at\nJune 30, 2023. The costs basis and fair value of these exchange traded investment grade bond funds were $25.0 million and $23.7\nmillion at June 30, 2023, respectively.\nFair value measurements of available for sale securities\nAvailable for sale securities are measured at fair value using quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and are therefore\nclassified as Level 1 assets.\n70\nTable of Contents\nFair value measurements of derivative instruments\nThe Company utilizes forward starting swaps designated as a cash flow hedge on forecasted debt. The forward starting swaps reduce the\nvariability of cash flow payments for the Company by converting the variable interest rate on the Company’s forecasted variable interest\nlong-term debt to that of a fixed interest rate. Accordingly, as part of the forward starting swaps, the Company exchanges, at specified\nintervals, the difference between floating and fixed interest amounts based on a notional principal amounts. The Company also uses a\ncross-currency swap contract to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk associated with the Company’s net investment in its Swiss\nsubsidiary.\nThe following table presents the contractual amounts of the Company’s outstanding instruments (in millions):\nJune 30, June 30,\nInstruments Designation 2024 2023\nForward starting swaps(1) Cash flow hedge $ 300 $ 300\nCross-currency swap(2) Net investment hedge 150 —\n(1) In May 2021, the Company entered into a forward starting swap designated as a cash flow hedge on forecasted debt based on $200\nmillion of notional principal. The effective date of the swap was November 2022 with the full swap maturing in November 2025. In\nMarch 2023, the Company entered into a forward starting swap designated as a cash flow hedge on forecasted debt based on $100\nmillion of notional principal. The effective date of the swap was April 2023 with the full swap maturing in April 2025.\n(2) In July 2023, the Company entered into a pay-fixed rate, receive-fixed rate cross-currency swap contract with a total notional amount\nof $150 million that was designated as a hedge to lock in the Swiss franc (CHF) rate for a portion of the Company’s CHF net\ninvestment in its Lunaphore subsidiary in Switzerland. The objective of the hedge is to protect the net investment in the Company’s\nCHF-denominated operations against changes in the spot exchange rates, on a pre-tax basis. The hedging instrument has four interim\nsettlement dates, which will reduce the notional on the hedging instrument by $10 million at each interim date, and will reduce the\nnotional to $110 million at maturity.\nThe pretax amount of the gains and losses on our hedging instruments and the classification of those gains and losses with our\nConsolidated Financial Statements for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in thousands):\n(Gain) Loss Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nYear Ended\nJune 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nCash flow hedges\nForward starting swaps $ 12,632 $ (1,340) $ (19,121)\nNet investment hedges\nCross-currency swap 4,015 — —\nTotal $ 16,647 $ (1,340) $ (19,121)\n71\nTable of Contents\n(Gain) Loss Reclassified into Income\nYear Ended\nJune 30, Location of (Gain) Loss\n2024 2023 2022 in Income Statement\nCash flow hedges\nForward starting swaps $ (10,317) $ (4,526) $ 6,352 Interest expense\nNet investment hedges\nCross-currency swap (3,210) — — Interest expense\nTotal $ (13,527) $ (4,526) $ 6,352\nGains or losses related to the net investment hedges are classified as foreign currency translation adjustments in the schedule of changes in\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”) in Note 8, as these items are attributable to the Company’s hedges of its net\ninvestment in foreign operations. Gains or losses related to the cash flow hedges are classified as Unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow\nhedges in the schedule of changes in AOCI in Note 8.\nThe instruments were valued using observable market inputs in active markets and therefore are classified as Level 2 liabilities.\nFair value measurements of contingent consideration\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company does not have outstanding contingent consideration as the Asuragen and Namocell acquisitions did not\nmeet their respective milestones as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Asuragen contingent agreement required the Company to make contingent consideration payments of up to $105.0 million if certain\nrevenue thresholds were achieved by December 31, 2023. The opening balance sheet fair value of the liabilities was $18.3 million, which\nwas determined using a Monte Carlo simulation-based model discounted to present value. Assumptions used in these calculations are units\nsold, expected revenue, expected expenses, discount rate, and various probability factors. The contingent consideration related to Asuragen\nwas $2.0 million as of June 30, 2023.\nThe Namocell contingent agreement required the Company to make contingent consideration payments of up to $25.0 million if certain\nrevenue thresholds were achieved by December 31, 2023. The opening balance sheet fair value of the liabilities was $10.6 million, which\nwas determined using a Monte Carlo simulation-based model discounted to present value. Assumptions used in these calculations are units\nsold, expected revenue, expected expenses, discount rate, and various probability factors. The contingent consideration related to Namocell\nwas $1.5 million as of June 30, 2023.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company's obligation for potential contingent consideration payments related to the B-Mogen acquisitions was\nrelieved as the likelihood that the revenue thresholds and product milestones would be achieved in the timeframe established within the\npurchase agreement was remote. As a result, the Company reversed an accrual for the fair value of the contingent liabilities at the date of\nsettlement during fiscal 2022.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable\ninputs (Level 3) (in thousands):\nJune 30,\n2024 2023\nFair value at the beginning of period $ 3,500 $ 5,000\nPurchase price contingent consideration (Note 4) — 10,600\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration (3,500) (12,100)\nPayments — —\nFair value at the end of period $ — $ 3,500\n72\nTable of Contents\nThe use of different assumptions, applying different judgment to matters that inherently are subjective and changes in future market\nconditions could result in different estimates of fair value of our securities or contingent consideration, currently and in the future. If market\nconditions deteriorate, we may incur impairment charges for securities in our investment portfolio.\nFair value measurements of other financial instruments – The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of\neach class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.\nCash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit, accounts receivable, and accounts payable – The carrying amounts reported in the\nconsolidated balance sheets approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items.\nLong-term debt – The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for the amount drawn on our line-of-credit facility and\nlong-term debt approximates fair value because our interest rate is variable and reflects current market rates.\nNote 6. Debt and Other Financing Arrangements:\nOn August 31, 2022, the Company entered into a revolving line-of-credit and term loan by a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement). The\nCredit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $1 billion, which can be increased by an additional $400 million subject to\ncertain conditions. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and expenditures of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries, including financing permitted acquisitions. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable rate. The current\noutstanding debt is based on the one-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is\ndetermined from the total leverage ratio of the Company and updated on a quarterly basis. The annualized fee for any unused portion of the\ncredit facility is currently 10 basis points.\nThe Credit Agreement matures on August 31, 2027 and contains customary restrictive and financial covenants and customary events of\ndefault. As of June 30, 2024, the outstanding balance under the Credit Agreement was $319.0 million.\nNote 7. Leases:\nAs a lessee, the company leases offices, labs, and manufacturing facilities, as well as vehicles, copiers, and other equipment. The Company\ndetermines whether a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception date. Upon commencement date, operating lease right-of-use assets\nand liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to calculate present\nvalue is the Company’s incremental borrowing rate or, if available, the rate implicit in the lease. The Company determines the incremental\nborrowing rate for each lease based primarily on its lease term and the economic environment of the applicable country or region. The\nCompany recognizes operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Further, as part of our adoption of ASC 842, the\nCompany also made the accounting policy elections to not capitalize short term leases (defined as a lease with a lease term that is less than\n12 months) and to combine lease and non-lease components for all asset classes in determining the lease payments.\nVariable lease payments primarily include payments for non-lease components, such as maintenance costs and payments for non-\ncomponents such as sales tax. During fiscal year 2024, the Company recognized $5.0 million in variable lease expense in the Consolidated\nStatements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. During fiscal year 2024, the Company also recognized $18.2 million relating to fixed\nlease expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income.\n73\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the balance sheet classification of the Company’s operating leases, amounts of right of use assets and lease\nliabilities, the weighted average remaining lease term, and the weighted average discount rate for the Company’s operating leases (asset\nand liability amounts are in thousands):\nAs of\nJune 30,\nBalance Sheet Classification 2024\nOperating leases:\nOperating lease right-of-use assets Right-of-use asset $ 91,285\nCurrent operating lease liabilities Operating lease liabilities - current $ 12,920\nNoncurrent operating lease liabilities Operating lease liabilities 87,618\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 100,538\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years): 8.45\nWeighted average discount rate (%): 4.23\nThe following table summarizes the cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities and right of use assets\nobtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities for the year ended June 30, 2024 (in thousands):\nYear ended\nJune 30,\n2024\nCash amounts paid on operating lease liabilities(1) $ 17,729\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities $ 11,051\n(1) Total cash paid for the Company’s operating leases during the year ended June 30, 2024 include cash amounts paid on operating lease\nliabilities and variable lease expenses.

The Company includes option to\nrenew the lease as part of the right of use lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. In\naddition, certain leases contain fair value purchase and termination options with an associated penalty. In general, the Company is not\nreasonably certain to exercise such options.\n74\nTable of Contents\nNote 8. Supplemental Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (loss) Information:\nEquity\nThe Company has declared cash dividends per share of $0.32 in each of the full fiscal years ended June 30, 2024, June 30, 2023, and\nJune 30, 2022.

Potentially dilutive common shares of our stock result from dilutive common stock\noptions and restricted stock units. We use the treasury stock method to calculate the weighted-average shares used in the diluted earnings\nper share computation. Under the treasury stock method, the proceeds from exercise of an option, the amount of compensation cost, if any,\nfor future service that we have not yet recognized, and the amount of estimated tax benefits that would be recorded in paid-in capital, if\nany, when the option is exercised are assumed to be used to repurchase shares in the current period.\nThe dilutive effect of stock options in the above table excludes all options for which the aggregate exercise proceeds exceeded the average\nmarket price for the period. The number of potentially dilutive option shares excluded from the calculation was 3.9 million, 4.5 million, and\n2.8 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n77\nTable of Contents\nNote 10. Share-based Compensation and Other Benefit Plans:\nThe cost of employee services received in exchange for the award of equity instruments is based on the fair value of the award at the date\nof grant. Compensation cost is recognized using a straight-line method over the vesting period and is net of estimated forfeitures. Stock\noption exercises and stock awards are satisfied through the issuance of new shares.\nEquity incentive plan: The 2020 Equity Incentive Plan, which replaced the Company’s Second Amended and Restated 2010 Equity\nIncentive Plan, provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance\nshares, performance units and stock appreciation rights. There were 36.2 million shares of common stock authorized for grant under the\nPlan. The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock reserved and available for awards under the Plan is 9,936,808 shares. At\nJune 30, 2024, there were 6.3 million shares of common stock available for grant under the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan. The maximum\nterm of incentive options granted under the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan is ten years. The 2020 Equity Incentive Plan replaced the\nCompany’s second A&R 2010 Plan, which had previously amended and restated the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Equity\nIncentive Plan (the A&R 2010 Plan). The 2020 Equity Incentive Plan and Second A&R 2010 Plan (collectively, the Plans) are administered\nby the Board of Directors and its Executive Compensation Committee, which determine the persons who are to receive awards under the\nPlans, the number of shares subject to each award and the term and exercise price of each award. The number of shares of common stock\nsubject to outstanding awards as of June 30, 2024 under the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan were 11.6 million.\nThe fair values of options granted under the Plans were estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with\nthe following assumptions used:\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nDividend yield 0.41 % 0.34 % 0.27 %\nExpected volatility 30%-37 % 30%-36 % 27%-33 %\nRisk-free interest rates 3.8%-4.8 % 2.8%-4.4 % 0.6%-2.6 %\nExpected lives (years) 4.4 4.7 4.3\nThe dividend yield is based on the Company’s historical annual cash dividend divided by the market value of the Company’s common\nstock. The expected annualized volatility is based on the Company’s historical stock price over a period equivalent to the expected life of\nthe option granted. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rates with a term consistent with the\nexpected life of the options granted.\n78\nTable of Contents\nStock option activity under the Plans for the three years ended June 30, 2024, consists of the following (shares in thousands):\nWeighted Aggregate Weighted\nNumber of Average Intrinsic Average\nShares (in Exercise Value Contractual\nthousands) Price (millions) Life (years)\nOutstanding at June 30, 2021 14,868 $ 43.16\nGranted 1,390 120.15\nForfeited (539) 87.05\nExercised (2,450) 33.61\nOutstanding at June 30, 2022 13,269 $ 51.20\nGranted 2,351 93.81\nForfeited (118) 85.99\nExercised (1,578) 29.48\nOutstanding at June 30, 2023 13,924 $ 60.56\nGranted 1,060 79.69\nForfeited (1,165) 90.86\nExercised (2,240) 33.34\nOutstanding at June 30, 2024 11,579 $ 64.53 $ 747.3 3.0\nExercisable at June 30, 2022: 7,797 36.99\nExercisable at June 30, 2023: 8,641 44.76\nExercisable at June 30, 2024: 8,208 53.57 439.7 2.1\nThe weighted average fair value of options granted during fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $27.27, $29.53, and $29.78, respectively.

The Company believes it is more likely than not that these tax carryovers will not be realized.\n83\nTable of Contents\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company has federal operating loss carryforwards of approximately $34.0 million and state operating loss\ncarryforwards of $146.8 million from its previous acquisitions, which are not limited under IRC Section 382. As of June 30, 2024, the\nCompany has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $77.5 million. Some of the net operating loss carryforwards expire between fiscal\n2025 and 2036. Federal net operating loss carryforwards generated after December 31, 2017 have an indefinite carryforward period but the\nCompany expects to be fully utilize these attributes by June 30, 2032. The Company has a deferred tax asset of $9.8 million, net of the\nvaluation allowance discussed above, related to the net operating loss carryovers.

The federal tax credit carryforwards expire between 2028 and 2040.\nThe majority of the state credit carryforwards have no expiry date. The state credit carryforwards that have expiry dates have a full\nvaluation allowance. The Company has a deferred tax asset of $5.5 million, net of the valuation allowance discussed above, related to the\ntax credit carryovers.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company has approximately $246 million of undistributed earnings in its foreign subsidiaries. Approximately\n$108 million of these earnings are no longer considered permanently reinvested and the Company expects to be able to repatriate earnings\non a tax neutral basis. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on approximately $138 million of undistributed earnings from non-\nU.S. subsidiaries as of June 30, 2024 which are indefinitely reinvested in operations. Because of the multiple entities as well as the\ncomplexities of laws and regulations by which to repatriate the earnings to minimize tax cost, it is not practical to determine the income tax\nliability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely. A deferred tax liability will be recognized if the Company\ncan no longer demonstrate that it plans to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings.\nWe continue to analyze our global working capital requirements and the potential tax liabilities that would be incurred if the non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries distribute cash to the U.S. parent, which include local country withholding tax and potential U.S. state taxation.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nBeginning balance $ 5,291 $ 5,302 $ 7,271\nAdditions due to acquisitions — — 960\nAdditions for tax positions of prior year — — 304\nDecrease in unrecognized tax benefits for prior year positions — — (357)\nSettlements — — (2,860)\nFX impact (13) (11) (16)\nEnding balances $ 5,278 $ 5,291 $ 5,302\nIncluded in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at June 30, 2024 are potential benefits of $5.3 million that, if recognized, would affect\nthe effective tax rate on income from continuing operations. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax\nbenefits in its provision for income taxes. The Company had $0.6 million of accrued interest and penalties as of June 30, 2024. The\namount recorded for the periods ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, was $0.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively, in accrued interest\nand penalties. The Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly\nincrease in the next twelve months. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and certain state tax jurisdictions, and several\njurisdictions outside the U.S. The Company’s federal returns are subject to tax assessment for 2019 and subsequent years. State and foreign\nincome tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of three to five years after filing of the respective return. The state\nimpact of any federal changes remains subject to examination by various states for a period of up to one year after formal notification to the\nstates.\nNote 13.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\nCompany as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year\nperiod ended June 30, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated\nAugust 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthese consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to\nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material\nto the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication\nof a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not,\nby communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures\nto which it relates.\nFair value measurement of the developed technology intangible asset acquired in the Lunaphore acquisition\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired Lunaphore Technologies, SA. in July 2023, for total\nconsideration of $169.7 million. As a result of the acquisition, the Company recognized intangible assets of $66.4 million, including\ndeveloped technology of $60.3 million.\n87\nTable of Contents\nWe identified the assessment of the fair value measurement of the acquired developed technology as a critical audit matter. There was a\nhigh degree of subjectivity in applying and evaluating certain key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the acquired developed\ntechnology. Specifically, the revenue growth rates and the discount rate were challenging to test as they represented subjective\ndeterminations of future market and economic conditions. Changes to those assumptions could have had a significant effect on the\ndetermination of the fair value measurement.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the\noperating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s acquisition-date valuation process, including controls related to\nthe development of the revenue growth rates and discount rate. We performed sensitivity analyses over the revenue growth rates to assess\nthe impact of changes in those assumptions on the Company’s determination of the fair value of the developed technology. We evaluated\nthe reasonableness of the Company’s forecasted revenue growth rates used to determine forecasted revenues by comparing them to\nhistorical results and industry related third-party data. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and\nknowledge, who assisted in:\n● evaluating the discount rate used by the Company by comparing it against a discount rate range that was independently developed\nusing publicly available market data for comparable entities\n● testing the estimate of the fair value of the developed technology using the Company’s cash flow forecasts and discount rates and\ncomparing the results to the Company’s fair value estimates.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nAugust 22, 2024\n88\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors\nBio-Techne Corporation:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Bio-Techne Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial\nreporting as of June 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the\nconsolidated balance sheets of the Company as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings and\ncomprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2024, and the\nrelated notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated August 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion\non those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the\neffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control\nOver Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on\nour audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our\naudit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing\nthe risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the\nassessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that\nour audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance\nof records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations\nof management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of\nany evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nAugust 22, 2024\n89\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\"), management, with the participation of our\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the effectiveness of\nour disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). The evaluation was based upon reports and\ncertifications provided by a number of executives. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nconcluded that, as of June 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\n(b) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting also includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i) Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the\nassets of the company;\n(ii) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance\nwith authorizations of management and directors of the company; and\n(iii)Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a\nreasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or\ndetected on a timely basis.\nUnder the supervision of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and with the participation of our management, including our\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting using the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment and those criteria, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2024.\nThe attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting issued by KPMG LLP appears in Item 8 of this report.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nAs previously announced, we acquired Lunaphore Technologies SA on July 7, 2023.

For a complete description of the terms and provisions of our Common Stock,\nrefer to the full text of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, both of which are exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K to\nwhich this description is also an exhibit, and the Minnesota Business Corporation Act (“MBCA”), which is available at\nhttps://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/302A.\nAuthorized Shares\nThe Company is authorized to issue up to 405,000,000 shares, which consists of 5,000,000 undesignated shares and 400,000,000\nshares of Common Stock. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had 158,216,258 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding.\nThe Common Stock is the only outstanding class of stock of the Company. The Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) is\nauthorized to establish one or more classes or series of shares from the undesignated shares and to fix the relative rights and\npreferences of each such class or series, but the Board has not designated any class or series of shares from the undesignated shares.\nDividend Rights\nSubject to the rights of holders of any preferred stock outstanding, holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends when,\nas, and if declared by the Board out of net earnings or net assets of the Company that are legally available for the declaration of\ndividends.\nVoting Rights\nAll voting rights are vested in the holders of shares of Common Stock. Each holder of Common Stock is entitled to one vote per share,\nand voting rights are noncumulative. Subject to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock outstanding and except as specifically\nrequired otherwise under the MBCA all matters submitted to Company shareholders are decided by a majority vote of the shares\nentitled to vote and represented at the meeting at which there is a quorum, except for election of directors, which is decided by a\nmajority of votes cast in uncontested elections and by a plurality vote in contested elections.\nLiquidation and Dissolution Rights\nPursuant to applicable law, in the event of the Company’s dissolution, the holders of Common Stock will be entitled to share pro rata\nin any of the Company’s assets available for distribution after making adequate provision for the discharge of debts, obligations, and\nliabilities of the Company and after the holders of any series of outstanding preferred stock have received any liquidation preferences.\nOther Shareholder and Board Rights\nHolders of shares of Common Stock are not entitled to preemptive rights. The Board may issue rights to subscribe for, purchase,\nexchange securities for, or convert securities into, shares of the Company or any class or series, and to fix the terms, provisions and\nconditions of such rights, including the exchange or conversion basis or the price at which such shares may be purchased or subscribed\nfor. The Board may effectuate share dividends or splits by issuance of shares of one class or series to holders of that class or series or\nto holders of another class or series.\nNominations Procedures\nShareholders can nominate candidates for election to the Board. However, a shareholder must follow the advance notice procedures\nprovided in Section 2.10 of the Bylaws. In general, for an annual meeting, a shareholder must submit a written notice of such\nnomination to the Company’s corporate secretary at least 60 days but not more than 90 days prior to the anniversary of the prior year’s\nannual meeting. The written notice must contain the consent of the nominee(s) to serve as director and provide certain information\nabout the proposed nominee(s) and the shareholder proposing the nomination, as required by Section 2.10 of the Bylaws.\nProposal Procedures\nShareholders may propose that business (other than nominations to the Board) be considered at a meeting of shareholders only if a\nshareholder follows the advance notice procedures provided in Section 2.10 of the Bylaws. In general, for an annual meeting, a\nshareholder must submit a written notice of the proposed business to the Company’s corporate secretary at least 60 days but not more\nthan 90 days prior to the anniversary of the prior year’s annual meeting. The written notice must provide certain information about the\nproposed business and the shareholder proposing the business, as required by Section 2.10 of the Bylaws.\nLimitations on Change of Control\nCertain provisions of the Articles, the Bylaws, and the MBCA may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change\nof control, including through a change to the members of the Company’s management. These provisions include:\n● Advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations (Section 2.10 of the Bylaws);\n● The ability of the Board to amend the Bylaws (Section 9.1 of the Bylaws);\n● The ability of the Board to issue purchase rights and additional Common Stock and to designate the terms of and issue new\nseries of preferred stock without shareholder approval (Article 3 of the Articles);\n● Limitations, pursuant to Section 302A.671 of the MBCA, with respect to the voting of shares acquired in a “control share\nacquisition”;\n● The prohibition, pursuant to Section 302A.673 of the MBCA, of business combination transactions involving an “interested\nshareholder” and the Company for a period of four years after such individual or entity becomes an interest shareholder,\nunless a proscribed approval is obtained; and\n● The limitation, pursuant to Section 302A.675 of the MBCA, on purchasing additional shares of Common Stock by a party\nwho has made a takeover offer for the Company unless holders of Common Stock are able to sell shares on substantially\nequivalent terms to the prior takeover offer, unless a proscribed approval is obtained.\nAmendment of Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws\nThe holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock have the power to amend the Articles of Incorporation. The\nBoard may amend, adopt, or repeal the Bylaws, subject to the limitations see forth in our Bylaws and the MBCA. The holders of a\nmajority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock also have the power to alter or amend, make or adopt, or repeal the Bylaws.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nAmerican Stock Transfer & Trust Company is the transfer agent and registrar for the Company’s Common Stock.\nListing of Common Stock\nThe Company’s Common Stock is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol “TECH.”\nExhibit 19\nBio-Techne Insider Trading Policy\nEffective February 1, 2023\nPurpose and Scope\nPurpose of the Policy\nInsider Trading Policy (this “Policy”) describes the standards of Bio-Techne Corporation and its affiliated companies\n(together, the “Company”) on trading of Company securities or securities of certain other publicly traded companies while in the\npossession of confidential information. It also addresses additional trading restrictions on all executive officers and members of the\nCompany’s board of directors (collectively referred to as “Section 16s”).\nPersons Subject to the Policy\nThis Policy applies to all Section 16s and all other employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company may also\ndetermine that other persons should be subject to this Policy, such as contractors or consultants who have access to material Company\ninformation. This Policy also applies to family members, other members of a person’s household and entities controlled by a person\ncovered by this Policy, as described below.\nTransactions Subject to the Policy\nThis Policy applies to transactions in Company Securities (collectively referred to in this Policy as “Company Securities”),\nincluding the Company’s common stock, options to purchase common stock, or any other type of securities that the Company may\nissue, including (but not limited to) preferred stock, convertible debentures and warrants, as well as derivative securities that are not\nissued by the Company, such as exchange-traded put or call options or swaps relating to Company Securities. Certain limited\nexceptions are described below.\nThe Policy\nNo Improper Insider Trading\nSection 16s and certain other employees of the Company who may have Material Nonpublic Information from time to time,\nentities controlled by such persons and members of their immediate family or household are considered insiders under this Policy\n(“Insiders”). In certain circumstances, Insiders can also include certain consultants or contractors who might have access to Material\nNonpublic Information.\nInsiders shall not purchase or sell Company Securities, or offer to do so, during any time that he or she possesses Material\nNonpublic Information (defined below) concerning the Company, and for one business day following public disclosure of that\ninformation, or at such time as such nonpublic information is no longer material. If, for example, the Company were to make an\nannouncement on a Monday before opening of the trading market, Insiders should not trade in Company Securities until Tuesday.\nNo “Tipping” Others\nNonpublic information relating to the Company is the property of the Company, and the unauthorized disclosure of such\ninformation for any reason – whether or not related to trading in Company Securities – is barred by obligations of confidentiality to\nthe Company.\nBeyond confidentiality obligations to the Company, federal securities laws specifically bar insiders from disclosing\n(“tipping”) Material Nonpublic Information to any other person (including family members) where such information may be used to\ntrade in Company Securities. Insiders also shall not make recommendations or express opinions on the basis of Material Nonpublic\nInformation as to trading in Company Securities.\nLiability for tipping Material Nonpublic Information to another person who trades in Company Securities can be as severe as\nliability for directly trading in Company Securities. Moreover, any disclosure of Material Nonpublic Information that results in a third\nparty engaging in a transaction in Company Securities, when viewed in\nhindsight, will appear to be tipping, so Insiders should be extremely cautious with disclosure of Company information.\nThe same rules regarding tipping Material Nonpublic Information apply to information regarding other publicly traded\ncompanies.\nPotential Criminal and Civil Liability and/or Company Disciplinary Action\nInsiders may be subject to financial penalties and jail time for engaging in transactions in Company Securities at a time when\nthey have knowledge of Material Nonpublic Information regarding the Company. Insiders may also be liable for improper transactions\nby any person (commonly referred to as a “tippee”) to whom they have disclosed nonpublic information regarding the Company or to\nwhom they have made recommendations or expressed opinions on the basis of such information as to trading in Company Securities.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the stock exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. use\nsophisticated electronic surveillance techniques to uncover insider trading.\nSection 16s and employees of the Company who violate this Policy shall also be subject to disciplinary action by the\nCompany, which may include ineligibility for future participation in the Company’s equity incentive plans or termination of\nemployment.\nBlackout Periods\nTo ensure compliance with this Policy and applicable federal and state securities laws, the Company has established a\nquarterly Blackout Period. Section 16s and certain employees who have been designated by the Company because they have ongoing\naccess to the Company’s internal financial statements or other Material Nonpublic Information, members of the immediate family or\nhousehold of any such person, and any entities controlled by such person (the “Designated Insiders”) may not trade in Company\nSecurities during a Blackout Period.\nThe Blackout Period in any fiscal quarter typically commences on or about the tenth calendar day of the third fiscal month of\nthe fiscal quarter and ends one full trading day following the public disclosure of the financial results for that fiscal quarter, which\ntypically occurs with release of earnings information through a press release and/or filing with the U.S. government. However, the\nCompliance Officer may choose to impose a trading restriction at an earlier or later date if the situation is warranted. Designated\nInsiders may not trade Company Securities during the Blackout Period and may trade Company Securities outside the Blackout Period\nonly if they do not possess Material Nonpublic Information.\nIn addition to quarterly Blackout Periods, the Company may determine that an event has occurred which causes any Insider\nto possess Material Nonpublic Information about the Company (such as a pending major acquisition). The existence of an event-\nspecific blackout will not be announced, although those who are aware of the event giving rise to the blackout may be notified. Even if\nthe Company has not declared an event-specific blackout, no one should trade while aware of Material Nonpublic Information.\nIndividual Responsibility\nSection 16s and employees have the individual responsibility to comply with this Policy against insider trading, regardless of\nwhether the Company has recommended a trading window to that Insider or any other Insiders of the Company. Each person must\nexercise appropriate judgment in connection with any trade in Company Securities.\nThis Policy applies to immediate family members and household members of executive officers, board of director members\nand employees. “Immediate family member” includes a spouse or a minor child, and any other family members whose transactions in\nCompany Securities are directed by the executive officer, director or employee or are subject to that person’s influence or control, such\nas adult children or parents who consult with the executive officer, director or employee before they trade in Company Securities.\nImmediate family members and household members should be made aware of this Policy and its restrictions. This Policy does not,\nhowever, apply to\npersonal securities transactions of family members or household members where the purchase or sale decision is made by a third party\nnot controlled by, influenced by or related to an executive officer, director or employee or his or her immediate family members or\nhousehold members.\nAn Insider may, from time to time, have to forego a proposed transaction in Company Securities even if he or she planned to\nmake the transaction before learning of the Material Nonpublic Information and even though the Insider believes he or she may suffer\nan economic loss or forego anticipated profit by waiting. Transactions that may be necessary or justifiable for independent reasons\n(such as the need to raise money for an emergency expenditure) are no exception. Even the appearance of an improper transaction\nmust be avoided to preserve our reputation for adhering to the highest standards of conduct and to avoid an inquiry regarding civil and\ncriminal liability for trading on inside information.\nApplicability to Insider Information from Other Companies\nThis Policy also applies to Material Nonpublic Information relating to other companies, including the Company’s customers,\nvendors, suppliers or potential acquisition targets (“Business Partners”), when that information is obtained in the course of\nemployment with, or other services performed on behalf of, the Company. Civil and criminal penalties and termination of employment\nmay result from trading on inside information regarding the Company’s Business Partners. All Section 16s and employees must treat\nMaterial Nonpublic Information about the Company’s Business Partners with the same care required with respect to information\nrelated directly to the Company.\nDefinition of Material Nonpublic Information\nIt is not possible to define all categories of Material Nonpublic Information. However, information should be regarded as\nmaterial if there is a reasonable likelihood that it would be considered important to an investor in making an investment decision\nregarding the purchase or sale of Company Securities. Any information that could be expected to affect the Company’s stock price,\nwhether it is positive or negative, should be considered material.\nWhile it may be difficult under this standard to determine whether particular information is material, there are various\ncategories of information that are particularly sensitive and, as a general rule, should always be considered material. Examples of such\ninformation may include:\n• Sales results and trends\n• Financial results\n• Projections of future earnings or losses\n• News of a pending or proposed material merger, acquisition or divestiture\n• News of the disposition of a material subsidiary\n• Gain or loss of a substantial customer or supplier\n• New product announcements of a significant nature\n• A pending or proposed joint venture\n• Significant product defect, recall or modification\n• Significant pricing changes\n• Stock splits\n• New equity or debt offerings\n• Developments regarding significant litigation or government agency investigations, including actual or threatened\nproceedings\n• Cybersecurity risks and incidents, including vulnerabilities and breaches\n• Changes in executive officers or members of the board of directors\n• Changes to dividend or stock repurchase policies\nNonpublic information is information that has not been previously disclosed to the general public and is otherwise not\navailable to the general public. Generally, material information regarding the Company is made public through the Company's filings\nwith the SEC that are made available on the SEC’s website, through press releases or newswire services, or through widely-available\nnews sources, such as television, radio, newspaper, or news websites. By contrast, information would likely not be considered to be\npublicly available if it is available only to the Company’s employees, or if it is only available to a select group of analysts, brokers and\ninstitutional investors.\nCertain Exceptions\nStock Option Exercises. This Policy does not apply to the exercise of an employee stock option acquired pursuant to the\nCompany’s plans, or to a net exercise or tax withholding right pursuant to which a person has elected to have the Company withhold\nshares subject to an option to satisfy the exercise price for the option or tax withholding requirements. This Policy does apply,\nhowever, to any sale of stock as part of a broker-assisted cashless exercise of an option, or any other market sale for the purpose of\ngenerating the cash needed to pay the exercise price of an option.\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Awards. This Policy does not apply to the vesting or lapse of risk of forfeiture of\nrestricted stock or restricted stock units, or the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which a person has elected to have the\nCompany withhold shares of stock to satisfy tax withholding requirements upon such events. The Policy, including, as applicable,\nblackout period and pre-clearance notification provisions, do apply to any market sale of restricted stock.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan. This Policy does not apply to purchases of Company Securities in any employee stock\npurchase plan adopted by the Company resulting from a person’s periodic contribution of money to the plan pursuant to an election\nmade at the time of enrollment in the plan. However, this Policy applies to a person’s election to participate in the plan initially, any\nsubsequent modifications to increase or decrease the percentage of contributions made, and the termination of contributions for any\nenrollment period. It also applies to sales of stock purchased pursuant to the plan.\nOther Similar Transactions. Purchases of Company Securities from the Company or sales of Company Securities to the\nCompany are not subject to this Policy.\nRule 10b5-1 Plans. This Policy does not apply to transactions executed pursuant to a contract, instruction or plan that satisfies\nRule 10b5-1(c) of the Exchange Act, so long as the underlying contract, instruction or plan itself complies with applicable law and\nregulations as well as any other requirements established by the Company from time to time. See below for more details.\nAdministration of the Policy\nThe Company's General Counsel will serve as Compliance Officer for administration of this Policy. In the absence of the\nGeneral Counsel (or if the General Counsel desires to engage in a transaction in Company Securities), the Chief Financial Officer will\nbe responsible for administration of this Policy. The General Counsel and the Chief Financial Officer may delegate their\nresponsibilities as Compliance Officer as they deem necessary or appropriate for administration of this Policy.\nAny person who has a question about this Policy or its application to any proposed transaction is encouraged to obtain\nadditional guidance from the Compliance Officer.\nAll determinations and interpretations by the Compliance Officer shall be final and not subject to further review. Neither the\nCompliance Officer nor the Company will be liable for any determinations made under this Policy.\nAdditional Discouraged and Prohibited Transactions\nIn order to avoid even the appearance of the use of inside information and to discourage short-term or speculative\ntransactions involving Company Securities, this Policy strongly discourages, and in some cases prohibits, Insiders from engaging in\nany of the following activities with respect to Company Securities:\nShort-Term (“Short Swing”) Trading. Pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, officers and\nmembers of the board of directors must hold Company Securities for at least six months after a purchase, and must refrain from\npurchasing Company Securities for at least six months after a sale. All other Insiders are strongly discouraged from engaging in short\nterm trading of Company Securities.\nShort Sales. Insiders are prohibited from engaging in short sales of Company Securities (i.e. the sale of shares that the seller\ndoes not own).\nPublicly Traded Options. Insiders are prohibited from buying and selling “puts” and “calls” or other derivative securities on\nCompany Securities.\nHedging Transactions. Insiders are prohibited from engaging in hedging or monetization transactions, such as through equity swaps,\ncollars, prepaid variable forwards and other similar mechanisms, in connection with Company Securities.\nMargin Accounts and Pledging. Insiders are prohibited from holding company securities in a margin account. Pledging\nCompany Securities as collateral for a loan is also generally prohibited unless the individual is able to clearly demonstrate the\nfinancial capacity to repay the loan without resort to the pledged securities. In that limited situation, the individual requesting the\nexception must provide appropriate documentation to the Compliance Officer at least two weeks in advance of the proposed\ntransaction, and the pledging transaction must be permitted by the Compliance Officer before it may be entered into by the Insider.\nStanding Orders. The Company discourages placing standing or limit orders on Company Securities (except standing or limit\norders under Rule 10b5-1 Plans adopted in accordance with the terms of this Policy), whether those standing or limit orders are placed\nthrough our on-line equity management platform or through a brokerage service. If an Insider determines that they must use a standing\norder or limit order, the order should be used only for a brief period of time and must otherwise comply with the restrictions and\nprocedures in this Policy. Insiders who subsequently obtain Material Nonpublic Information must terminate any open standing orders\nor limit orders unless such orders have been placed through a Rule 10b5-1 Plan adopted in accordance with this Policy and legal\nrequirements.\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nAn Insider who trades in Company stock may have an affirmative defense against a claim of insider trading liability if the\ntrade was made under a binding contract or written plan that complies with Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and the corresponding\nExchange Act Rule 10b5-1(c) (the “Plan”). The Plan must be entered into outside of a Blackout Period (if being adopted by a\nDesignated Insider) and when the person adopting it is not aware of any Material Nonpublic Information concerning the Company. In\naddition, the Plan must be entered into in good faith and otherwise comply with the parameters below. Any Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan\nmust be entered into, and notice provided to the Compliance Officer, at least 30 calendar days prior to the first transaction to be\neffected under the plan (“Cooling Off Period”), which period is longer for Section 16s as discussed below.\nIn addition, Plans must comply with approved parameters established by the Company from time to time, including, at least\none of the following:\na. Specifying the amount of securities to be purchased or sold and the price at which and the date on which the\nsecurities are to be purchased or sold;\nb. Including a written formula or algorithm, or computer program, for determining the amount of securities to be\npurchased or sold and the price at which and the date on which the securities were to be purchased or sold; or\nc. Prohibiting person adopting the Plan from exercising any subsequent influence over how, when, or whether to effect\npurchases or sales, and delegating such discretion to an independent third party.\nIf the Plan calls for all of the specified securities to be sold in a single trade, an Insider may only have one such single-trade\nPlan during any consecutive 12-month period. Persons who adopt a Plan may not deviate from it or engage in any corresponding or\nhedging transaction or positions. Amendments to or terminations of the Plan are permitted, provided that (i) the amendment or\ntermination does not occur during a Blackout Period, (ii) at the time of such amendment or termination, the person undertaking the\namendment or termination does not have any Material Nonpublic Information regarding the Company, (iii) the first transaction under\nthe amended Plan does not occur until at least 30 calendar days after providing notice of the amendment to the Compliance Officer,\nand (iv) if the plan is being terminated, the first transaction outside of the Plan adheres to the Cooling Off Period requirements.\nMaterial modification of a Plan will be treated as adoption of a new Plan for purposes of the Cooling Off Period requirements.\nAn Insider may not have more than one Plan in effect at any given time. If an Insider has a Plan in effect, transactions outside\nthat Plan are discouraged.\nRegulations governing structure and implementation of Plans are complex. Insiders are advised to consult with the\nCompliance Officer or their own attorney prior to adopting a Plan.\nAdditional Plan Requirements and Restrictions for Section 16s\nFor Section 16s, the Cooling Off Period referred to above is the later of: (a) at least 90 calendar days prior to the first\ntransaction or (b) 2 business days following disclosure of financial results in periodic reports filed with the SEC, but in either case not\nto exceed 120 days following Plan adoption. Section 16s must include a certification in their Plan documentation certifying that at the\ntime of adoption of a Plan they are not aware of Material Nonpublic Information and they are adopting the Plan in good faith and not\nas part of a scheme to evade the prohibitions of the law and regulations. The Company will disclose Plans established by Section 16s,\nas well as trades made under such Plans, as required by the SEC.\nAdditional Pre-Clearance Procedures for Section 16s\nTo provide assistance in preventing inadvertent violations and avoiding even the appearance of an improper transaction\n(which could result, for example, where a person engages in a trade while unaware of a pending major development), Section 16s, as\nwell as members of their immediate family and entities controlled by them, that contemplate engaging in any transaction in Company\nSecurities to which this Policy applies, must notify the Compliance Officer at least two business days in advance of the proposed\ntransaction, stating the amount and nature of the proposed trade.\nA person making a pre-clearance request must not be aware of any Material Nonpublic Information about the Company. The\nperson must inform the Company if he or she has effected any non-exempt “opposite-way” transactions within the past six months.\nAfter any transaction, the person must timely inform the Company to assist with the filing of the requisite Form 4, and should also be\nprepared to comply with SEC Rule 144 and file Form 144, if necessary, at the time of any sale. In order to comply with these\nimportant legal requirements, any Section 16s seeking pre-clearance must transact in Company Securities only through a full-service\nbrokerage firm.\nThe Compliance Officer is under no obligation to permit a transaction submitted for pre-clearance and may determine not to\npermit the transaction. If permission to engage in the transaction is denied, the requesting person should not initiate any transaction in\nCompany Securities, nor inform others of the restriction. If permitted, clearance\nis good for five (5) business days unless otherwise notified. Pre-clearance is not required for purchases or sales under an approved\nPlan. Insiders remain personally responsible for any transactions in Company Securities, regardless of whether they are permitted by\nthe Compliance Officer.\nPost-Termination Transactions\nThis Policy continues to apply to transactions in Company Securities even after an Insider has terminated employment or\nother services to the Company. If an Insider is in possession of Material Nonpublic Information when his or her service terminates, the\nInsider may not trade in Company Securities until that information has become public or is no longer material.\nPre-clearance notification procedures discussed above will cease to apply to Company Securities upon the expiration of any\nBlackout Period or any other Company-imposed trading restrictions applicable at the time of the termination of service.\nCertification\nSection 16s and other employees and other Company representatives may be required on a periodic basis to certify their\nunderstanding of and intent to comply with this Policy. Designated Insiders may be required on a periodic basis to provide an\nadditional acknowledgement regarding the Blackout Period and, as applicable, pre-clearance notification provisions of this Policy.\nAny person who has any general questions about this Policy or questions about specific transactions should contact the\nCompliance Officer.\nExhibit 21\n2\nBio-Techne Corporation, a Minnesota corporation, had the material subsidiaries below as of the date of filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal\nyear ended June 30, 2024.

This policy fully replaces and supersedes the Company’s Policy on Recoupment of Certain Executive Incentive\nCompensation adopted July 28, 2022. The Policy sets forth the circumstances under which the Company will recover certain incentive compensation paid\nto the Executive Officers of the Company in connection with certain financial restatements.\nEach Executive Officer shall be required to sign and return to the Company the Acknowledgement Form attached hereto as Exhibit A, pursuant to which\nsuch Executive Officer will agree to be bound by the terms and comply with this Policy; provided, however, that any failure by an Executive Officer to\nreturn a signed Acknowledgement Form does not affect the validity or enforceability of this Policy.\nDefinitions\n(A) “Clawback Period” means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the earlier of (i) the date the Company’s board of directors\nconcludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that such a Covered Accounting Restatement is required to be prepared or (ii) the date a\ncourt, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare a Covered Accounting Restatement (such date, the\n“Clawback Trigger Date”), and any transition period (that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) of less than nine months within\nor immediately following those three completed fiscal years.\n(B) “Committee” means the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company.\n(C) “Covered Accounting Restatement” means an accounting restatement prepared due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any\nfinancial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously\nissued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial restatements (i.e., a “Big R” restatement), or that would result in\na material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (i.e., a “little r” restatement).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, a Covered Accounting Restatement will not include changes to the Company’s financial statements that do not\nrepresent error corrections under accounting standards applicable to the Company at the time of the accounting restatement, including as a\nresult of a (i) retrospective application of a change in accounting principle, (ii) retrospective revision to reportable segment information due to\na change in the structure of the Company’s internal organization, (iii) retrospective reclassification due to a discontinued operation, (iv)\nretrospective application of a change in reporting entity, and (v) retrospective revision for stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends or\nother changes in capital structure.\n(D) “Covered Incentive-Based Compensation” means any Incentive-Based Compensation (i) received by a current or former Executive Officer\nafter beginning service as an Executive\nOfficer, provided that the current or former Executive Officer served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period\napplicable to such Incentive-Based Compensation and (ii) received on or after the Effective Date. For purposes of this Policy, Incentive-\nBased Compensation is deemed to be “received” in the fiscal year in which the financial reporting measure included in the Incentive-Based\nCompensation award is attained or satisfied, regardless of whether the payment or grant occurs before or after such fiscal year, and regardless\nof whether the Incentive-Based Compensation continues to be subject to a service-based vesting condition.\n(E) “Executive Officer” has the meaning assigned to it in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5608(d).\n(F) “Financial Reporting Measure” means (i) any measure determined in accordance with accounting principles used in the Company’s financial\nstatements, whether presented in or outside of the Company’s financial statements and whether or not included in a filing with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission, (ii) any measures derived wholly or in part from such measures (including non-GAAP measures), and (iii) other\nperformance measures affected by accounting-related information, including stock price, total shareholder return and relative total\nshareholder return.\n(G) “Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part on the attainment of any\nFinancial Reporting Measure, which may include awards granted under the Company’s annual incentive plan as well as performance- based\nrestricted stock units, and which may include Incentive-Based Compensation contributed to a plan, other than a tax-qualified retirement plan.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, Incentive-Based Compensation shall not include equity awards that vest solely based on continued service and\nwere not granted based on the attainment of any financial reporting measure or any bonus compensation based on discretionary or subjective\ngoals or goals that are not based on any financial reporting measure.\nGeneral Rules\nIn the event the Company determines it is required to prepare a Covered Accounting Restatement, the Committee shall review any Covered Incentive-\nBased Compensation received by a current or former Executive Officer of the Company during the Clawback Period. In the event the Committee\ndetermines that the amount of any such Covered Incentive-Based Compensation that was received during the Clawback Period exceeds the amount that\notherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated results (the “Erroneously Awarded Compensation”), the amount of such\nErroneously Awarded Compensation shall be recovered on a pre-tax basis.\nRecovery under this Policy with respect to an Executive Officer shall not require the finding of any misconduct by such Executive Officer or such\nExecutive Officer being found responsible for the accounting error leading to the Covered Accounting Restatement.\nFor purposes of this section, Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed to be “received” in the fiscal year in which the financial reporting measure included\nin the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained or satisfied, regardless of whether the payment or grant occurs before or after such fiscal year.\nCalculation of Erroneously Awarded Compensation\nIn the event any applicable Covered Incentive-Based Compensation has been granted in the form of equity or equity-based awards, and such awards\nremain outstanding as of the Clawback Trigger Date, the\nErroneously Awarded Compensation shall be calculated as the number of shares received in excess of the number that should have been received (or the\ncorresponding grant-date value of such shares). In the event that any applicable Covered Incentive-Based Compensation is in a nonqualified deferred\ncompensation plan, the Company shall calculate the amount contributed to the notional account based on the Erroneously Awarded Compensation and any\nearnings accrued to-date on that notional amount, and that sum shall be considered “Erroneously Awarded Compensation” with respect to that plan.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, in the event Covered Incentive-Based Compensation is attained only partially based on the achievement of financial reporting\nmeasures, only the portion of such compensation based on or derived from the financial reporting measures shall be subject to recovery.\nIn the event the Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not able to be calculated directly from information in an accounting restatement (e.g., equity\nawards subject to total shareholder return (“TSR”) or stock price measures), in order to determine the amount of such Erroneously Awarded Compensation\nthat shall be subject to recovery, the Committee shall use a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Covered Accounting Restatement on the TSR or stock\nprice upon which the Covered Incentive-Based Compensation was received.\nMethod for Recovery\nThe Committee shall, in its discretion, determine the appropriate means for recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, including but not limited\nto the cancellation of outstanding and future annual or long-term incentive compensation or requiring repayment by the applicable Executive Officer,\nprovided that the recovery occurs reasonably promptly. The Committee may consider all applicable facts and circumstances in determining the appropriate\nmeans for recovery, including pursuing an appropriate balance of cost and speed.\nRecovery shall be required in all circumstances unless the Committee determines that recovery would be impracticable and that one of the conditions set\nforth in in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5608(b)(1)(iv).\nNon-Exclusive; Conflicts\nThis Policy is in addition to any and all other rights the Company may have to pursue remedies against an employee or former employee in connection\nwith an accounting restatement or for misconduct or similar behavior in the course of employment by the Company, all of which are expressly retained by\nthe Company. Any right of recovery under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recovery that may be available to\nthe Company pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Incentive Compensation Forfeiture Policy and any similar policy in any employment agreement,\nequity award agreement or similar agreement or any other legal remedies available to the Company.\nThe Company will not enter into any agreement that exempts any Incentive-Based Compensation from the application of this Policy or that waives the\nCompany’s right to recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, and this Policy shall supersede any such agreement (whether entered into before,\non or after the Effective Date).\nThe provisions of this Policy are intended to be applied to the fullest extent of the law. To the extent that any provision of this Policy is found to be\nunenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such provision shall be applied to the maximum extent permitted, and shall automatically be deemed\namended in a manner consistent with its objectives to the extent necessary to conform to any limitations required under applicable law.\nIndemnification Prohibition\nThe Company is not permitted to indemnify any Executive Officer against (i) the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is repaid, returned or\nrecovered pursuant to the terms of this Policy, or (ii) any claims relating to the Company’s enforcement of its rights under this Policy. The Company is also\nprohibited from paying or reimbursing an Executive Officer for purchasing insurance to cover any such loss. To the extent of a conflict with any agreement\nwith an Executive Officer that purports to provide indemnification rights to the Executive Officer that conflict with the foregoing, this Policy shall\nsupersede any such agreement (whether entered into before, on or after the Effective Date).\nAmendment or Termination\nThe Committee may amend or terminate this Policy from time to time in its discretion, including as required to comply with any applicable law or\nregulation. Any such amendment will be binding on employees who continue in the employment after the effective date of such amendment.\nAdministration\nThe Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration\nof this Policy. The Committee has full and final authority to make all determinations under this Policy, in each case to the extent permitted under applicable\nrules and regulations and in compliance with (or pursuant to an exemption from the application of) Section 409A of the Code. All determinations and\ndecisions made by the Committee hereunder shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons.\nAny action or inaction by the Committee with respect to an Executive Officer under this Policy in no way limits the Committee’s actions or decisions not\nto act with respect to any other Executive Officer under this Policy or under any similar policy, agreement or arrangement, nor shall any such action or\ninaction serve as a waiver of any rights the Company may have against any Executive Officer other than as set forth in this Policy.\nThis Policy is intended to comply with the requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5608 (as such rule may be amended) and shall be construed and\ninterpreted in accordance with such intent.\nSuccessors\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Executive Officers and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators, and other legal\nrepresentatives.\nGoverning Law; Venue\nThe validity, enforceability, construction and interpretation of this Policy shall be governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota. Any dispute regarding\nthis Policy shall be exclusively decided by a state court in the State of Minnesota; provided that if such court declines to exercise jurisdiction, the dispute\nshall be decided by the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota.\nExhibit A\nAcknowledgement Form\nBIO-TECHNE CORPORATION\nAmended and Restated\nPolicy on Recoupment of Certain Executive Incentive Compensation\nBy signing below, the undersigned acknowledges and confirms that the undersigned has received and reviewed a copy of the Bio-Techne Corporation\nAmended and Restated Policy on Recoupment of Certain Executive Incentive Compensation (the “Policy”).
