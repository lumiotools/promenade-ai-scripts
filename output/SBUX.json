By removing the extra charge for non-dairy milks we’re embracing all the ways our customers enjoy their Starbucks,” said Brian Niccol, Starbucks chairman and chief executive officer. \n\nSubstituting non-dairy milk – whether its soymilk, oatmilk, almondmilk or coconutmilk – in a handcrafted beverage is the second most requested customization from Starbucks customers, behind adding a shot of espresso. When this change goes into effect on November 7, almost half of Starbucks current customers in the U.S. who pay to modify their beverage at company-operated stores will see a price reduction of more than 10%. \n\n“I made a commitment that we’d get back to Starbucks, focusing on what has always set Starbucks apart – a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather and we serve the finest coffee handcrafted by our skilled baristas,” continued Niccol. “This is just one of many changes we’ll make to ensure a visit to Starbucks is worth it every time.” \n\n**About Starbucks**\n\nSince 1971, Starbucks Coffee Company has been committed to ethically sourcing and roasting high-quality arabica coffee.

GAAP results in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 include items that are excluded from non-GAAP results. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures at the end of this release for more information. \n\n** Q4 Fiscal Year 2024 Highlights **\n\n  * Global comparable store sales declined 7%, driven by an 8% decline in comparable transactions, partially offset by a 2% increase in average ticket \n    * North America and U.S. comparable store sales declined 6%, driven by a 10% decline in comparable transactions, partially offset by a 4% increase in average ticket \n    * International comparable store sales declined 9%, driven by a 5% decline in average ticket and a 4% decline in comparable transactions; China comparable store sales declined 14%, driven by an 8% decline in average ticket and a 6% decline in comparable transactions \n  * The company opened 722 net new stores in Q4, ending the period with 40,199 stores: 52% company-operated and 48% licensed \n    * At the end of Q4, stores in the U.S. and China comprised 61% of the company’s global portfolio, with 16,941 and 7,596 stores in the U.S. and China, respectively \n  * Consolidated net revenues declined 3%, including on a constant currency basis, to $9.1 billion \n  * GAAP operating margin contracted 380 basis points year-over-year to 14.4%, primarily driven by deleverage, investments in store partner wages and benefits, and increased promotional activity. This contraction was partially offset by pricing and in-store operational efficiencies. \n    * Non-GAAP operating margin contracted 380 basis points year-over-year to 14.4%, or contracted 370 basis points on a constant currency basis \n  * GAAP earnings per share of $0.80 declined 25% over prior year \n    * Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.80 declined 25% over prior year, or declined 24% on a constant currency basis \n  * Starbucks Rewards loyalty program 90-day active members in the U.S. totaled 33.8 million, up 4% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter \n\n\n\n** Full Fiscal Year 2024 Highlights **\n\n  * Global comparable store sales declined 2%, driven by a 4% decline in comparable transactions, partially offset by a 2% increase in average ticket \n    * North America and U.S. comparable store sales declined 2%, driven by a 5% decline in comparable transactions, partially offset by a 4% increase in average ticket \n    * International comparable store sales declined 4%, driven by a 4% decline in average ticket; China comparable store sales declined 8%, driven by an 8% decline in average ticket \n  * Consolidated net revenues increased 1%, including on a constant currency basis, to $36.2 billion \n  * GAAP operating margin contracted 130 basis points year-over-year to 15.0%, primarily driven by investments in store partner wages and benefits, deleverage, and increased promotional activity.

I have confidence in our ability to turn around our business and expect we will return to long-term growth,” Ruggeri added. \n\n“It is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers. ‘Back to Starbucks’ is that fundamental change,” commented Brian Niccol, chairman and chief executive officer. “My experience tells me that when we get back to our core identity and consistently deliver a great experience, our customers will come back. We have a clear plan and are moving quickly to return Starbucks to growth,” Niccol added. \n\n** Q4 North America Segment Results **\n\n**Quarter Ended**  \n---  \n_($ in millions)_ |  **Sep 29, 2024** |  **Oct 1, 2023** |  **Change (%)**  \nChange in Comparable Store Sales (1) |  (6)%  |  8%   \nChange in Transactions  |  (10)%  |  2%   \nChange in Ticket  |  4%  |  6%   \nStore Count  |  18,424  |  17,810  |  3%   \nRevenues  |  $6,691.9  |  $6,900.0  |  (3)%   \nOperating Income  |  $1,253.5  |  $1,601.4  |  (22)%   \nOperating Margin  |  18.7%  |  23.2%  |  (450) bps   \n  \n(1) |  Includes only Starbucks ® company-operated stores open 13 months or longer. Comparable store sales exclude the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and Siren Retail stores. Stores that are temporarily closed or operating at reduced hours remain in comparable store sales while stores identified for permanent closure have been removed.   \n---|---  \n  \nNet revenues for the North America segment decreased 3% over Q4 FY23 to $6.7 billion in Q4 FY24, primarily due to a 6% decline in comparable store sales, driven by a 10% decline in comparable transactions, partially offset by a 4% increase in average ticket, as well as a decline in our licensed store business. This decrease was partially offset by net new company-operated store growth of 5% over the past 12 months. \n\nOperating income decreased to $1.3 billion in Q4 FY24 compared to $1.6 billion in Q4 FY23. Operating margin of 18.7% contracted from 23.2% in the prior year, primarily driven by deleverage, investments in store partner wages and benefits, and increased promotional activity. This contraction was partially offset by pricing, and in-store operational efficiencies. \n\n** Q4 International Segment Results **\n\n**Quarter Ended**  \n---  \n_($ in millions)_ |  **Sep 29, 2024** |  **Oct 1, 2023** |  **Change (%)**  \nChange in Comparable Store Sales (1) |  (9)%  |  5%   \nChange in Transactions  |  (4)%  |  6%   \nChange in Ticket  |  (5)%  |  (1)%   \nStore Count  |  21,775  |  20,228  |  8%   \nRevenues  |  $1,893.2  |  $1,979.9  |  (4)%   \nOperating Income  |  $282.9  |  $301.3  |  (6)%   \nOperating Margin  |  14.9%  |  15.2%  |  (30) bps   \n  \n(1) |  Includes only Starbucks® company-operated stores open 13 months or longer. Comparable store sales exclude the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and Siren Retail stores. Stores that are temporarily closed or operating at reduced hours remain in comparable store sales while stores identified for permanent closure have been removed.   \n---|---  \n  \nNet revenues for the International segment declined 4% over Q4 FY23 to $1.9 billion in Q4 FY24, primarily due to a 9% decline in comparable store sales, driven by a 5% decline in average ticket and a 4% decline in comparable transactions, as well as a decline in our licensed store business. Another factor was an approximate 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. This decline was partially offset by net new company-operated store growth of 10% over the past 12 months. \n\nOperating income decreased to $282.9 million in Q4 FY24 compared to $301.3 million in Q4 FY23. Operating margin of 14.9% contracted from 15.2% in the prior year, primarily driven by increased promotional activity and investments in store partner wages and benefits. This contraction was partially offset by in-store operational efficiencies and pricing. \n\n** Q4 Channel Development Segment Results **\n\n**Quarter Ended**  \n---  \n_($ in millions)_ |  **Sep 29, 2024** |  **Oct 1, 2023** |  **Change (%)**  \nRevenues  |  $465.4  |  $486.1  |  (4)%   \nOperating Income  |  $264.7  |  $271.2  |  (2)%   \nOperating Margin  |  56.9%  |  55.8%  |  110 bps   \n  \nNet revenues for the Channel Development segment declined 4% over Q4 FY23 to $465.4 million in Q4 FY24, primarily due to a decline in revenue in the Global Coffee Alliance from SKU optimization. This decline was partially offset by an increase in global ready-to-drink revenue. \n\nOperating income decreased to $264.7 million in Q4 FY24 compared to $271.2 million in Q4 FY23. Operating margin of 56.9% expanded from 55.8% in the prior year, primarily driven by sales mix shift and lower product costs related to the Global Coffee Alliance. This expansion was partially offset by the higher costs in our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture income. \n\n** Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Targets **\n\nAs stated in our October 22, 2024 announcement, given the company’s ceo transition coupled with the current state of the business, guidance is suspended for full fiscal year 2025. We believe this will allow ample opportunity to complete an assessment of the business and solidify key strategies, while stabilizing and positioning the business for long-term growth. The company will provide initial information regarding its new strategies during its Q4 and full fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call starting today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time. Our October 22, 2024 announcement and accompanying prepared remarks from our chairman and ceo can be accessed on the company's Investor Relations website. The company uses its website as a tool to disclose important information about the company and comply with its disclosure obligations under Regulation Fair Disclosure. \n\n** Company Update **\n\n  1. In August, the company announced that Brian Niccol had been appointed chief executive officer and chairman of the Starbucks Board of Directors (the \"Board\"), effective September 9, 2024. Mellody Hobson, former chairman of the Board, became the lead independent director of the Board. Laxman Narasimhan, former chief executive officer and member of the Board, stepped down from his position effective August 12, 2024, with the Board appointing Rachel Ruggeri, chief financial officer, as interim chief executive officer. \n  2.

On October 22, 2024, the company shared preliminary Q4 and full fiscal year 2024 results, reflecting a challenged customer experience and reiterating a fundamental change to our strategy. \n  7. The Board declared a cash dividend of $0.61 per share, payable on November 29, 2024, to shareholders of record on November 15, 2024.

When provided to investors, our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP general and administrative expenses (G&A), non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating income growth (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP earnings per share exclude the below-listed items and their related tax impacts, as management does not believe they contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company’s future operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to non-GAAP G&A, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating income growth (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP earnings per share are G&A, operating income, operating income growth (loss), operating margin, effective tax rate and diluted net earnings per share, respectively. \n\n** Non-GAAP Exclusion ** |  ** Rationale **  \n---|---  \nRestructuring and impairment costs  |  Management excludes restructuring and impairment costs for reasons discussed above. These expenses are anticipated to be completed within a finite period of time.   \nTransaction and integration-related costs  |  Management excludes transaction and integration costs for reasons discussed above. Additionally, we incur certain costs associated with certain divestiture activities. The majority of these costs will be recognized over a finite period of time.   \nGain on sale of assets  |  Management excludes the gain related to the sale of assets to Nestlé, primarily consisting of intellectual properties associated with the Seattle's Best Coffee brand, as these items do not reflect future gains or tax impacts for reasons discussed above.   \n  \nThe Company also presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present the constant currency information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars using the average monthly exchange rates from the comparative period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods, excluding related hedging activities. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps users better understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our underlying operating results. \n\nNon-GAAP G&A, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating income growth (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP earnings per share and constant currency may have limitations as analytical tools. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company’s results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than the company does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. \n\n**STARBUCKS CORPORATION**  \n---  \n**NET REVENUE CONSTANT CURRENCY RECONCILIATION**  \n_(unaudited, in millions)_  \n**Quarter Ended**  \n**Consolidated**  \nRevenue for the quarter ended Oct 1, 2023 as reported (GAAP)  |  $  |  9,373.6   \nRevenue for the quarter ended Sep 29, 2024 as reported (GAAP)  |  $  |  9,074.0   \nChange (%)  |  (3.2  |  )%   \nConstant Currency Impact (%)  |  0.3  |  %   \nChange in Constant Currency (%)  |  (2.9  |  )%   \n  \n**Year Ended**  \n---  \n**Consolidated**  \nRevenue for the year ended Oct 1, 2023 as reported (GAAP)  |  $  |  35,975.6   \nRevenue for the year ended Sep 29, 2024 as reported (GAAP)  |  $  |  36,176.2   \nChange (%)  |  0.6  |  %   \nConstant Currency Impact (%)  |  0.7  |  %   \nChange in Constant Currency (%)  |  1.3  |  %   \n  \n**STARBUCKS CORPORATION**  \n---  \n**RECONCILIATION OF SELECTED GAAP MEASURES TO NON-GAAP MEASURES**  \n_(unaudited, in millions, except per share data)_  \n**Quarter Ended**  \n** Consolidated ** |  **Sep 29,** **2024** |  **Oct 1,** **2023** |  **Change** |  **Constant Currency Impact** |  **Change in Constant Currency**  \nOperating income, as reported (GAAP)  |  $  |  1,306.9  |  $  |  1,706.2  |  (23.4)%   \nNon-GAAP operating income  |  $  |  1,306.9  |  $  |  1,706.2  |  (23.4)%  |  0.8%  |  (22.6)%   \nOperating margin, as reported (GAAP)  |  14.4  |  %  |  18.2  |  %  |  (380) bps   \nNon-GAAP operating margin  |  14.4  |  %  |  18.2  |  %  |  (380) bps  |  10 bps  |  (370) bps   \nDiluted net earnings per share, as reported (GAAP)  |  $  |  0.80  |  $  |  1.06  |  (24.5)%   \nNon-GAAP EPS  |  $  |  0.80  |  $  |  1.06  |  (24.5)%  |  0.9%  |  (23.6)%   \n  \n**Year Ended**  \n---  \n** Consolidated ** |  **Sep 29,** **2024** |  **Oct 1,** **2023** |  **Change** |  **Constant Currency Impact** |  **Change in Constant Currency**  \nOperating income, as reported (GAAP)  |  $  |  5,408.8  |  $  |  5,870.8  |  (7.9)%   \nRestructuring and impairment costs (1) |  —  |  21.8   \nTransaction and integration-related costs (2) |  —  |  0.1   \nGain on sale of assets  |  —  |  (91.3  |  )   \nNon-GAAP operating income  |  $  |  5,408.8  |  $  |  5,801.4  |  (6.8)%  |  1.1%  |  (5.7)%   \nOperating margin, as reported (GAAP)  |  15.0  |  %  |  16.3  |  %  |  (130) bps   \nRestructuring and impairment costs (1) |  —  |  0.1   \nTransaction and integration-related costs (2) |  —  |  0.0   \nGain on sales of assets  |  —  |  (0.3  |  )   \nNon-GAAP operating margin  |  15.0  |  %  |  16.1  |  %  |  (110) bps  |  — bps  |  (110) bps   \nDiluted net earnings per share, as reported (GAAP)  |  $  |  3.31  |  $  |  3.58  |  (7.5)%   \nRestructuring and impairment costs (1) |  —  |  0.02   \nTransaction and integration-related costs (2) |  —  |  0.00   \nGain on sale of assets  |  —  |  (0.08  |  )   \nIncome tax effect on Non-GAAP adjustments (3) |  —  |  0.02   \nNon-GAAP EPS  |  $  |  3.31  |  $  |  3.54  |  (6.5)%  |  0.9%  |  (5.6)%   \n  \n(1) |  Represents costs associated with our restructuring efforts.   \n---|---  \n(2) |  Fiscal 2023 includes transaction-related expenses related to the sale of our Seattle's Best Coffee brand.   \n(3) |  Adjustments were determined based on the nature of the underlying items and their relevant jurisdictional tax rates.   \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241030463090r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n**Starbucks Contact, Investor Relations:** Tiffany Willis investorrelations@starbucks.com\n\n**Starbucks Contact, Media:** Emily Albright press@starbucks.com\n\nSource: Starbucks Corporation\n\nCategories: Press Releases\n\n[ View all news ](/news/default.aspx)\n"

GAAP results in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 include items that are excluded from non-GAAP results. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures at the end of this release for more information. \n\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, global comparable store sales declined 7%, and consolidated net revenues declined 3% to $9.1 billion, or a 3% decline on a constant currency basis. GAAP earnings per share is $0.80, down 25% over prior year. Non-GAAP earnings per share is also $0.80, declining 24% on a constant currency basis. \n\nThe company’s results were primarily driven by softness in North America’s revenues in the quarter, specifically a 6% decline in U.S. comparable store sales, driven by a 10% decline in comparable transactions, partially offset by a 4% increase in average ticket. The accelerated investments in an expanded range of product offerings coupled with more frequent in-app promotions and integrated marketing to entice frequency across the customer base did not improve customer behaviors, specifically traffic across both Starbucks Rewards and non-SR customer segments, resulting in lower-than-expected performance. Additionally, China comparable store sales declined 14%, driven by an 8% decline in average ticket compounded by a 6% decline in comparable transactions, weighed down by intensified competition and a soft macro environment that impacted consumer spending. \n\nFor the full fiscal year 2024, global comparable store sales declined 2%, and consolidated net revenues increased 1% to $36.2 billion, also a 1% increase on a constant currency basis. GAAP earnings per share is $3.31, down 8% over prior year. Non-GAAP earnings per share is also $3.31, declining 6% on a constant currency basis. The lower-than-expected performance for the full fiscal year was a result of pronounced traffic decline, including a cautious consumer environment, and our targeted and accelerated investments not improving customer behaviors, as well as the macro and competitive environment in China pressuring our results further. \n\nGiven the company’s ceo transition coupled with the current state of the business, guidance will be suspended for the full fiscal year 2025. This will allow ample opportunity to complete an assessment of the business and solidify key strategies, while stabilizing and positioning the business for long-term growth. \n\nWith a strategic reset underway, the company remains committed to creating shareholder value and is announcing that its Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.57 to $0.61 per share of outstanding common stock. The dividend and related increase demonstrates the company’s confidence in the long-term growth. \n\n“Despite our heightened investments, we were unable to change the trajectory of our traffic decline, resulting in pressures in both our top-line and bottom-line. While our efficiency efforts continued to produce according to plan, they were not enough to outpace the impact of the decline in traffic,” commented Rachel Ruggeri, chief financial officer. “We are developing a plan to turn around our business, but it will take time. We want to amplify our confidence in the business, and provide some certainty as we drive our turnaround. For that reason, we have increased our dividend,” Ruggeri added. \n\n“Our fourth quarter performance makes it clear that we need to fundamentally change our strategy so we can get back to growth and that's exactly what we are doing with our ‘Back to Starbucks’ plan,” commented Brian Niccol, chairman and chief executive officer. “I’ve spent my first several weeks in stores engaging with and listening to feedback from our partners and customers. It’s clear that Starbucks is a much-loved brand. We need to focus on what has always set us apart — a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather and where we serve the finest coffee, handcrafted by our skilled baristas. We are energized and the team is already moving quickly. I’ll share more details at our upcoming earnings call, but invite you to listen to my initial thoughts on our investor relations website,” Niccol concluded. \n\nStarbucks released a video of prepared remarks by Brian Niccol, chairman and chief executive officer.

A forward-looking statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or circumstances, and those future events or circumstances may not occur.

We are under no obligation to update or alter any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. \n\n** Key Metrics **\n\nThe company's financial results and long-term growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings, comparable store sales growth and operating margin management. We believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. \n\n** Non-GAAP Disclosure **\n\nIn addition to the GAAP results provided in this release, the company provides certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, or alternatives for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). When provided to investors, our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP general and administrative expenses (G&A), non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating income growth (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP earnings per share exclude the below-listed items and their related tax impacts, as management does not believe they contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company’s future operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to non-GAAP G&A, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating income growth (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP earnings per share are G&A, operating income, operating income growth (loss), operating margin, effective tax rate and diluted net earnings per share, respectively. \n\n** Non-GAAP Exclusion ** |  ** Rationale **  \n---|---  \nRestructuring and impairment costs  |  Management excludes restructuring and impairment costs for reasons discussed above. These expenses are anticipated to be completed within a finite period of time.   \nTransaction and integration-related costs  |  Management excludes transaction and integration costs for reasons discussed above. Additionally, we incur certain costs associated with certain divestiture activities. The majority of these costs will be recognized over a finite period of time.   \nGain on sale of assets  |  Management excludes the gain related to the sale of assets to Nestlé, primarily consisting of intellectual properties associated with the Seattle's Best Coffee brand, as these items do not reflect future gains or tax impacts for reasons discussed above.   \n  \nThe Company also presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present the constant currency information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars using the average monthly exchange rates from the comparative period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods, excluding related hedging activities. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps users better understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our underlying operating results. \n\nNon-GAAP G&A, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating income growth (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP earnings per share and constant currency may have limitations as analytical tools. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company’s results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than the company does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. \n\n**STARBUCKS CORPORATION** **NET REVENUE CONSTANT CURRENCY RECONCILIATION** _(unaudited, in millions)_  \n---  \n**Quarter Ended**  \n**Consolidated**  \nRevenue for the quarter ended Oct 1, 2023 as reported (GAAP)  |  $  |  9,373.6   \nRevenue for the quarter ended Sep 29, 2024 as reported (GAAP)  |  $  |  9,074.0   \nChange (%)  |  (3.2  |  )%   \nConstant Currency Impact (%)  |  0.3  |  %   \nChange in Constant Currency (%)  |  (2.9  |  )%   \n  \n**Year Ended**  \n---  \n**Consolidated**  \nRevenue for the year ended Oct 1, 2023 as reported (GAAP)  |  $  |  35,975.6   \nRevenue for the year ended Sep 29, 2024 as reported (GAAP)  |  $  |  36,176.2   \nChange (%)  |  0.6  |  %   \nConstant Currency Impact (%)  |  0.7  |  %   \nChange in Constant Currency (%)  |  1.3  |  %   \n  \n**STARBUCKS CORPORATION** **RECONCILIATION OF SELECTED GAAP MEASURES TO NON-GAAP MEASURES** _(unaudited, in millions, except per share data)_  \n---  \n**Quarter Ended**  \n** Consolidated ** |  **Sep 29,** **2** **024** |  **Oct 1,** **2** **023** |  **Change** |  **Constant Currency Impact** |  **Change in Constant Currency**  \nDiluted net earnings per share, as reported (GAAP)  |  $  |  0.80  |  $  |  1.06  |  (24.5)%   \nNon-GAAP EPS  |  $  |  0.80  |  $  |  1.06  |  (24.5)%  |  0.9%  |  (23.6)%   \n  \n**Year Ended**  \n---  \n** Consolidated ** |  **Sep 29,** **2** **024** |  **Oct 1,** **2** **023** |  **Change** |  **Constant Currency Impact** |  **Change in Constant Currency**  \nDiluted net earnings per share, as reported (GAAP)  |  $  |  3.31  |  $  |  3.58  |  (7.5)%   \nRestructuring and impairment costs (1) |  —  |  0.02   \nTransaction and integration-related costs (2) |  —  |  0.00   \nGain from sale of assets  |  —  |  (0.08  |  )   \nIncome tax effect on Non-GAAP adjustments (3) |  —  |  0.02   \nNon-GAAP EPS  |  $  |  3.31  |  $  |  3.54  |  (6.5)%  |  0.9%  |  (5.6)%   \n  \n(1) |  Represents costs associated with our restructuring efforts.   \n---|---  \n(2) |  Fiscal 2023 includes transaction-related expenses related to the sale of our Seattle's Best Coffee brand.   \n(3) |  Adjustments were determined based on the nature of the underlying items and their relevant jurisdictional tax rates.   \n  \n**Appendix**\n\n**Transcript of Prepared Remarks by Brian Niccol, chairman and chief executive officer**\n\nI think, as you know, last month I made a commitment that we would get “Back to Starbucks.” \n\nThat means focusing on what has always set Starbucks apart — a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather, and where we serve the finest coffee, handcrafted by our skilled baristas. It’s our enduring identity. And it’s why millions of customers around the world visit Starbucks every single day. \n\nPeople love Starbucks, but I’ve heard from some customers that we've drifted from our core, that we’ve made it harder to be a customer than it should be, and that we’ve stopped communicating with them. As a result, some are visiting less often, and I think today’s results tell that same story. \n\nTo welcome all our customers back and return to growth, we need to fundamentally change our recent strategy. \n\n“Back to Starbucks” is that fundamental change. \n\nI believe that our problems are very fixable and that we have significant strengths to build on. I’ve spent my career understanding, stewarding and building brands, and it’s clear the Starbucks brand is strong and enduring. When we stay true to our core identity and focus on delivering a great partner and customer experience, our customers come — and importantly, they come back. \n\nSince taking this role, I’ve been digging in to understand our business. I’ve spent most of my time in stores talking with our partners and customers. I’ve also met with support center teams. I already have some learnings, and we’re applying those learnings to stabilize the business in the near-term and to shape our go-forward strategy. We have a clear plan, and we are already taking quick action, regardless of any challenges in the consumer environment. We know we must operate at our best every time we serve our customers. \n\nI look forward to sharing more and taking questions on next week’s earnings call. But, today, I want to share some of what I’ve seen and where we need to focus: \n\n**At Starbucks, coffee comes first.**\n\nNo one matches our expertise. Our deep engagement with coffee farmers, our skilled roasters, the premium equipment we use in our coffeehouses, and the skill of our baristas are all unmatched. We offer something for everyone: fresh brewed coffee from our Clover Vertica, high-quality espresso for everything from Americanos to Flat Whites, innovations in cold coffee with our reformulated iced coffee, and the popular Iced Shaken Espresso platform. Through product development, marketing, and in-store experience, we need to remind everyone that we are, and always have been, Starbucks Coffee Company. \n\n**From the very beginning, Starbucks has always been about our green apron partners.**\n\nEverything we do starts and ends with them. We must ensure our baristas have the time and tools they need to provide exceptional customer service, and that they are supported by strong leaders and managers across every store. Every person at Starbucks must work harder to support our retail teams, moving faster to respond to their feedback and get them what they need. Our green apron partners want to provide exceptional service to our customers. And as leaders, we need to remove those things that might stop them from doing that. \n\nWe’ll also build on our legacy by making Starbucks the best job in retail, offering our baristas meaningful career growth and industry-leading benefits, like the opportunity for U.S. partners to earn a free four-year college degree. \n\n**We need to offer a great experience to our customers every single time, especially during the morning peak.**\n\nWe are reorienting all our work to ensure we deliver a high-quality handcrafted beverage, prepared quickly and with care, and handed directly to the customer by our barista. This is the moment of truth. This commitment will drive every decision we make. To succeed, we need to address staffing in our stores, remove bottlenecks, and simplify things for our baristas. We need to refine mobile order and pay so it doesn’t overwhelm the café experience. We know how to make these improvements, and when we do, we know customers will visit more often. \n\n**We must reestablish ourselves as the community coffeehouse.**\n\nStarbucks has always been a place where people come together. We are revisiting our stores to make sure we’re offering the amenities you’d expect in a community coffeehouse. Even if customers don’t want to stay in the café each time they visit, we know they expect our stores to look and feel like the community coffeehouse they remember. \n\n**We have to reintroduce Starbucks to the world.**\n\nWe’re fundamentally changing our marketing. We’ve been focusing on Starbucks Rewards customers rather than talking to all our customers. And we’re changing that quickly, as you likely have already seen. We’re prioritizing our brand, highlighting the handcrafted products customers expect, and showcasing the coffee innovation that sets Starbucks apart. We will simplify our overly complex menu, fix our pricing architecture, and ensure that every customer feels Starbucks is worth it every single time they visit. \n\nAs we do all this, we’re committed to innovating with discipline and prioritizing investments that will improve the experience for both our partners and customers. \n\nAs I said last month, my near-term focus is the U.S. It’s our biggest business and we need to return it to growth. But we also have significant opportunities around the world. Our team is focused on how we return Starbucks China to growth and getting all our international businesses performing again. \n\nThroughout my career, I’ve learned and applied some powerful lessons. If you stay true to your core identity, take care of customers and your team, simplify the business, deliver consistently high-quality products and experiences, and tell your story effectively, you will be successful. \n\nSo we have a lot of work ahead of us, but I am confident we can get all these things right at Starbucks. I’m convinced that if we get back to Starbucks — with a focus on coffee and customers combined with a welcoming coffeehouse experience created by our green apron partners — we will remind people of why they love Starbucks. They will visit more often, and we will return this company to strong growth. \n\nGetting “Back to Starbucks” is our plan, and we’ll share our progress as we go. \n\nThank you for listening and I look forward to sharing the progress with you in the future. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241022788428r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n**Starbucks Contact, Investor Relations:** Tiffany Willis investorrelations@starbucks.com\n\n**Starbucks Contact, Media:** Emily Albright press@starbucks.com\n\nSource: Starbucks Corporation\n\nCategories: Press Releases\n\n[ View all news ](/news/default.aspx)\n"

GAAP results in fiscal\n2024 and fiscal 2023 include items that are excluded from non-GAAP results. Please refer to the reconciliation of\nGAAP measures to non-GAAP measures at the end of this release for more information.\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, global comparable store sales declined 7%, and consolidated net revenues\ndeclined 3% to $9.1 billion, or a 3% decline on a constant currency basis. GAAP earnings per share is $0.80, down\n25% over prior year. Non-GAAP earnings per share is also $0.80, declining 24% on a constant currency basis.\nThe company’s results were primarily driven by softness in North America’s revenues in the quarter, specifically a\n6% decline in U.S. comparable store sales, driven by a 10% decline in comparable transactions, partially offset by a\n4% increase in average ticket. The accelerated investments in an expanded range of product offerings coupled with\nmore frequent in-app promotions and integrated marketing to entice frequency across the customer base did not\nimprove customer behaviors, specifically traffic across both Starbucks Rewards and non-SR customer segments,\nresulting in lower-than-expected performance. Additionally, China comparable store sales declined 14%, driven by an\n8% decline in average ticket compounded by a 6% decline in comparable transactions, weighed down by intensified\ncompetition and a soft macro environment that impacted consumer spending.\nFor the full fiscal year 2024, global comparable store sales declined 2%, and consolidated net revenues increased 1%\nto $36.2 billion, also a 1% increase on a constant currency basis. GAAP earnings per share is $3.31, down 8% over\nprior year. Non-GAAP earnings per share is also $3.31, declining 6% on a constant currency basis. The lower-than-\nexpected performance for the full fiscal year was a result of pronounced traffic decline, including a cautious consumer\nenvironment, and our targeted and accelerated investments not improving customer behaviors, as well as the macro\nand competitive environment in China pressuring our results further.\nGiven the company’s ceo transition coupled with the current state of the business, guidance will be suspended for the\nfull fiscal year 2025. This will allow ample opportunity to complete an assessment of the business and solidify key\nstrategies, while stabilizing and positioning the business for long-term growth.\nWith a strategic reset underway, the company remains committed to creating shareholder value and is announcing that\nits Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.57 to $0.61 per share of\noutstanding common stock. The dividend and related increase demonstrates the company’s confidence in the long-\nterm growth.\n“Despite our heightened investments, we were unable to change the trajectory of our traffic decline, resulting in\npressures in both our top-line and bottom-line. While our efficiency efforts continued to produce according to plan,\nthey were not enough to outpace the impact of the decline in traffic,” commented Rachel Ruggeri, chief financial\nofficer. “We are developing a plan to turn around our business, but it will take time. We want to amplify our\nconfidence in the business, and provide some certainty as we drive our turnaround. For that reason, we have increased\nour dividend,” Ruggeri added.\n“Our fourth quarter performance makes it clear that we need to fundamentally change our strategy so we can get back\nto growth and that's exactly what we are doing with our ‘Back to Starbucks’ plan,” commented Brian Niccol,\nchairman and chief executive officer. “I’ve spent my first several weeks in stores engaging with and listening to\nfeedback from our partners and customers. It’s clear that Starbucks is a much-loved brand. We need to focus on what\nhas always set us apart — a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather and where we serve the finest coffee,\nhandcrafted by our skilled baristas. We are energized and the team is already moving quickly. I’ll share more details\nat our upcoming earnings call, but invite you to listen to my initial thoughts on our investor relations website,” Niccol\nconcluded.\n2\nStarbucks released a video of prepared remarks by Brian Niccol, chairman and chief executive officer.

The GAAP measures most\ndirectly comparable to non-GAAP G&A, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating income growth (loss),\nnon-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP earnings per share are G&A, operating\nincome, operating income growth (loss), operating margin, effective tax rate and diluted net earnings per share,\nrespectively.\nNon-GAAP Exclusion Rationale\nRestructuring and impairment Management excludes restructuring and impairment costs for reasons discussed above. These\ncosts expenses are anticipated to be completed within a finite period of time.\nTransaction and integration- Management excludes transaction and integration costs for reasons discussed above.\nrelated costs Additionally, we incur certain costs associated with certain divestiture activities. The majority\nof these costs will be recognized over a finite period of time.\nGain on sale of assets Management excludes the gain related to the sale of assets to Nestlé, primarily consisting of\nintellectual properties associated with the Seattle's Best Coffee brand, as these items do not\nreflect future gains or tax impacts for reasons discussed above.\nThe Company also presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying\nbusinesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present the constant currency\ninformation, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted\ninto United States dollars using the average monthly exchange rates from the comparative period rather than the actual\nexchange rates in effect during the respective periods, excluding related hedging activities. We believe the\npresentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps users better understand our\nperformance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our underlying\noperating results.\nNon-GAAP G&A, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating income growth (loss), non-GAAP operating\nmargin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP earnings per share and constant currency may have limitations as\nanalytical tools. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company’s\nresults as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than\nthe company does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\n5\nSTARBUCKS CORPORATION\nNET REVENUE CONSTANT CURRENCY RECONCILIATION\n(unaudited, in millions)\nQuarter Ended\nConsolidated\nRevenue for the quarter ended Oct 1, 2023 as reported (GAAP) $ 9,373.6\nRevenue for the quarter ended Sep 29, 2024 as reported (GAAP) $ 9,074.0\nChange (%) (3.2) %\nConstant Currency Impact (%) 0.3 %\nChange in Constant Currency (%) (2.9) %\nYear Ended\nConsolidated\nRevenue for the year ended Oct 1, 2023 as reported (GAAP) $ 35,975.6\nRevenue for the year ended Sep 29, 2024 as reported (GAAP) $ 36,176.2\nChange (%) 0.6 %\nConstant Currency Impact (%) 0.7 %\nChange in Constant Currency (%) 1.3 %\n6\nSTARBUCKS CORPORATION\nRECONCILIATION OF SELECTED GAAP MEASURES TO NON-GAAP MEASURES\n(unaudited, in millions, except per share data)\nQuarter Ended\nConstant Change in\nSep 29, Oct 1,\nChange Currency Constant\n2024 2023\nConsolidated Impact Currency\nDiluted net earnings per share, as reported (GAAP) $ 0.80 $ 1.06 (24.5)%\nNon-GAAP EPS $ 0.80 $ 1.06 (24.5)% 0.9% (23.6)%\nYear Ended\nConstant Change in\nSep 29, Oct 1,\nChange Currency Constant\n2024 2023\nConsolidated Impact Currency\nDiluted net earnings per share, as reported (GAAP) $ 3.31 $ 3.58 (7.5)%\nRestructuring and impairment costs (1) — 0.02\nTransaction and integration-related costs (2) — 0.00\nGain from sale of assets — (0.08)\nIncome tax effect on Non-GAAP adjustments (3) — 0.02\nNon-GAAP EPS $ 3.31 $ 3.54 (6.5)% 0.9% (5.6)%\n(1) Represents costs associated with our restructuring efforts.\n(2) Fiscal 2023 includes transaction-related expenses related to the sale of our Seattle's Best Coffee brand.\n(3) Adjustments were determined based on the nature of the underlying items and their relevant jurisdictional tax\nrates.\nAppendix\nTranscript of Prepared Remarks by Brian Niccol, chairman and chief executive officer\nI think, as you know, last month I made a commitment that we would get “Back to Starbucks.”\nThat means focusing on what has always set Starbucks apart — a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather, and\nwhere we serve the finest coffee, handcrafted by our skilled baristas. It’s our enduring identity. And it’s why millions\nof customers around the world visit Starbucks every single day.\nPeople love Starbucks, but I’ve heard from some customers that we've drifted from our core, that we’ve made it\nharder to be a customer than it should be, and that we’ve stopped communicating with them. As a result, some are\nvisiting less often, and I think today’s results tell that same story.\nTo welcome all our customers back and return to growth, we need to fundamentally change our recent strategy.\n“Back to Starbucks” is that fundamental change.\nI believe that our problems are very fixable and that we have significant strengths to build on. I’ve spent my career\nunderstanding, stewarding and building brands, and it’s clear the Starbucks brand is strong and enduring. When we\nstay true to our core identity and focus on delivering a great partner and customer experience, our customers come —\nand importantly, they come back.\nSince taking this role, I’ve been digging in to understand our business. I’ve spent most of my time in stores talking\nwith our partners and customers. I’ve also met with support center teams. I already have some learnings, and we’re\napplying those learnings to stabilize the business in the near-term and to shape our go-forward strategy. We have a\nclear plan, and we are already taking quick action, regardless of any challenges in the consumer environment. We\nknow we must operate at our best every time we serve our customers.\nI look forward to sharing more and taking questions on next week’s earnings call. But, today, I want to share some of\nwhat I’ve seen and where we need to focus:\nAt Starbucks, coffee comes first.\nNo one matches our expertise. Our deep engagement with coffee farmers, our skilled roasters, the premium equipment\nwe use in our coffeehouses, and the skill of our baristas are all unmatched. We offer something for everyone: fresh\nbrewed coffee from our Clover Vertica, high-quality espresso for everything from Americanos to Flat Whites,\ninnovations in cold coffee with our reformulated iced coffee, and the popular Iced Shaken Espresso platform. Through\nproduct development, marketing, and in-store experience, we need to remind everyone that we are, and always have\nbeen, Starbucks Coffee Company.\nFrom the very beginning, Starbucks has always been about our green apron partners.\nEverything we do starts and ends with them. We must ensure our baristas have the time and tools they need to provide\nexceptional customer service, and that they are supported by strong leaders and managers across every store. Every\nperson at Starbucks must work harder to support our retail teams, moving faster to respond to their feedback and get\nthem what they need. Our green apron partners want to provide exceptional service to our customers. And as leaders,\nwe need to remove those things that might stop them from doing that.\nWe’ll also build on our legacy by making Starbucks the best job in retail, offering our baristas meaningful career\ngrowth and industry-leading benefits, like the opportunity for U.S. partners to earn a free four-year college degree.\nWe need to offer a great experience to our customers every single time, especially during the morning peak.\nWe are reorienting all our work to ensure we deliver a high-quality handcrafted beverage, prepared quickly and with\ncare, and handed directly to the customer by our barista. This is the moment of truth. This commitment will drive\n2\nevery decision we make. To succeed, we need to address staffing in our stores, remove bottlenecks, and simplify\nthings for our baristas. We need to refine mobile order and pay so it doesn’t overwhelm the café experience. We know\nhow to make these improvements, and when we do, we know customers will visit more often.\nWe must reestablish ourselves as the community coffeehouse.\nStarbucks has always been a place where people come together. We are revisiting our stores to make sure we’re\noffering the amenities you’d expect in a community coffeehouse. Even if customers don’t want to stay in the café\neach time they visit, we know they expect our stores to look and feel like the community coffeehouse they remember.\nWe have to reintroduce Starbucks to the world.\nWe’re fundamentally changing our marketing. We’ve been focusing on Starbucks Rewards customers rather than\ntalking to all our customers. And we’re changing that quickly, as you likely have already seen. We’re prioritizing our\nbrand, highlighting the handcrafted products customers expect, and showcasing the coffee innovation that sets\nStarbucks apart. We will simplify our overly complex menu, fix our pricing architecture, and ensure that every\ncustomer feels Starbucks is worth it every single time they visit.\nAs we do all this, we’re committed to innovating with discipline and prioritizing investments that will improve the\nexperience for both our partners and customers.\nAs I said last month, my near-term focus is the U.S. It’s our biggest business and we need to return it to growth. But\nwe also have significant opportunities around the world. Our team is focused on how we return Starbucks China to\ngrowth and getting all our international businesses performing again.\nThroughout my career, I’ve learned and applied some powerful lessons. If you stay true to your core identity, take\ncare of customers and your team, simplify the business, deliver consistently high-quality products and experiences,\nand tell your story effectively, you will be successful.\nSo we have a lot of work ahead of us, but I am confident we can get all these things right at Starbucks. I’m convinced\nthat if we get back to Starbucks — with a focus on coffee and customers combined with a welcoming coffeehouse\nexperience created by our green apron partners — we will remind people of why they love Starbucks. They will visit\nmore often, and we will return this company to strong growth.\nGetting “Back to Starbucks” is our plan, and we’ll share our progress as we go.\nThank you for listening and I look forward to sharing the progress with you in the future."

Stores that are temporarily closed or operating at\nreduced hours remain in comparable store sales while stores identified for permanent closure have been removed.\nNet revenues for the North America segment decreased 3% over Q4 FY23 to $6.7 billion in Q4 FY24, primarily due to\na 6% decline in comparable store sales, driven by a 10% decline in comparable transactions, partially offset by a 4%\nincrease in average ticket, as well as a decline in our licensed store business. This decrease was partially offset by net\nnew company-operated store growth of 5% over the past 12 months.\nOperating income decreased to $1.3 billion in Q4 FY24 compared to $1.6 billion in Q4 FY23. Operating margin of\n18.7% contracted from 23.2% in the prior year, primarily driven by deleverage, investments in store partner wages and\nbenefits, and increased promotional activity.

Stores that are temporarily closed or operating at\nreduced hours remain in comparable store sales while stores identified for permanent closure have been removed.\nNet revenues for the International segment declined 4% over Q4 FY23 to $1.9 billion in Q4 FY24, primarily due to a\n9% decline in comparable store sales, driven by a 5% decline in average ticket and a 4% decline in comparable\ntransactions, as well as a decline in our licensed store business. Another factor was an approximate 1% unfavorable\nimpact from foreign currency translation. This decline was partially offset by net new company-operated store growth\nof 10% over the past 12 months.\nOperating income decreased to $282.9 million in Q4 FY24 compared to $301.3 million in Q4 FY23. Operating margin\nof 14.9% contracted from 15.2% in the prior year, primarily driven by increased promotional activity and investments\nin store partner wages and benefits.

Operating margin\nof 56.9% expanded from 55.8% in the prior year, primarily driven by sales mix shift and lower product costs related to\nthe Global Coffee Alliance. This expansion was partially offset by the higher costs in our North American Coffee\nPartnership joint venture income.\n4\nFiscal Year 2025 Financial Targets\nAs stated in our October, 22, 2024 announcement, given the company’s ceo transition coupled with the current state of\nthe business, guidance is suspended for full fiscal year 2025. We believe this will allow ample opportunity to complete\nan assessment of the business and solidify key strategies, while stabilizing and positioning the business for long-term\ngrowth.

When provided to\ninvestors, our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP general and administrative expenses (G&A), non-GAAP operating\nincome, non-GAAP operating income growth (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP\nearnings per share exclude the below-listed items and their related tax impacts, as management does not believe they contribute to\na meaningful evaluation of the company’s future operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating\nperformance. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to non-GAAP G&A, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP\noperating income growth (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP earnings per share are\nG&A, operating income, operating income growth (loss), operating margin, effective tax rate and diluted net earnings per share,\nrespectively.\nNon-GAAP Exclusion Rationale\nRestructuring and impairment Management excludes restructuring and impairment costs for reasons discussed above. These\ncosts expenses are anticipated to be completed within a finite period of time.\nTransaction and integration- Management excludes transaction and integration costs for reasons discussed above.\nrelated costs Additionally, we incur certain costs associated with certain divestiture activities. The majority\nof these costs will be recognized over a finite period of time.\nGain on sale of assets Management excludes the gain related to the sale of assets to Nestlé, primarily consisting of\nintellectual properties associated with the Seattle's Best Coffee brand, as these items do not\nreflect future gains or tax impacts for reasons discussed above.\nThe Company also presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses\nperformed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present the constant currency information, current period\nresults for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars using the\naverage monthly exchange rates from the comparative period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective\nperiods, excluding related hedging activities. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to\nGAAP results helps users better understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are\nnot indicative of our underlying operating results.\nNon-GAAP G&A, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating income growth (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-\nGAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP earnings per share and constant currency may have limitations as analytical tools. These\nmeasures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company’s results as reported under GAAP.\nOther companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than the company does, limiting the usefulness of\nthose measures for comparative purposes.\n16\nSTARBUCKS CORPORATION\nNET REVENUE CONSTANT CURRENCY RECONCILIATION\n(unaudited, in millions)\nQuarter Ended\nConsolidated\nRevenue for the quarter ended Oct 1, 2023 as reported (GAAP) $ 9,373.6\nRevenue for the quarter ended Sep 29, 2024 as reported (GAAP) $ 9,074.0\nChange (%) (3.2) %\nConstant Currency Impact (%) 0.3 %\nChange in Constant Currency (%) (2.9) %\nYear Ended\nConsolidated\nRevenue for the year ended Oct 1, 2023 as reported (GAAP) $ 35,975.6\nRevenue for the year ended Sep 29, 2024 as reported (GAAP) $ 36,176.2\nChange (%) 0.6 %\nConstant Currency Impact (%) 0.7 %\nChange in Constant Currency (%) 1.3 %\n17\nSTARBUCKS CORPORATION\nRECONCILIATION OF SELECTED GAAP MEASURES TO NON-GAAP MEASURES\n(unaudited, in millions, except per share data)\nQuarter Ended\nConstant Change in\nSep 29, Oct 1,\nChange Currency Constant\nConsolidated 2024 2023 Impact Currency\nOperating income, as reported (GAAP) $ 1,306.9 $ 1,706.2 (23.4)%\nNon-GAAP operating income $ 1,306.9 $ 1,706.2 (23.4)% 0.8% (22.6)%\nOperating margin, as reported (GAAP) 14.4 % 18.2 % (380) bps\nNon-GAAP operating margin 14.4 % 18.2 % (380) bps 10 bps (370) bps\nDiluted net earnings per share, as reported (GAAP) $ 0.80 $ 1.06 (24.5)%\nNon-GAAP EPS $ 0.80 $ 1.06 (24.5)% 0.9% (23.6)%\nYear Ended\nConstant Change in\nSep 29, Oct 1, Currency Constant\nConsolidated 2024 2023 Change Impact Currency\nOperating income, as reported (GAAP) $ 5,408.8 $ 5,870.8 (7.9)%\nRestructuring and impairment costs (1) — 21.8\nTransaction and integration-related costs (2) — 0.1\nGain on sale of assets — (91.3)\nNon-GAAP operating income $ 5,408.8 $ 5,801.4 (6.8)% 1.1% (5.7)%\nOperating margin, as reported (GAAP) 15.0 % 16.3 % (130) bps\nRestructuring and impairment costs (1) — 0.1\nTransaction and integration-related costs (2) — 0.0\nGain on sales of assets — (0.3)\nNon-GAAP operating margin 15.0 % 16.1 % (110) bps — bps (110) bps\nDiluted net earnings per share, as reported (GAAP) $ 3.31 $ 3.58 (7.5)%\nRestructuring and impairment costs (1) — 0.02\nTransaction and integration-related costs (2) — 0.00\nGain on sale of assets — (0.08)\nIncome tax effect on Non-GAAP adjustments (3) — 0.02\nNon-GAAP EPS $ 3.31 $ 3.54 (6.5)% 0.9% (5.6)%\n(1) Represents costs associated with our restructuring efforts.\n(2) Fiscal 2023 includes transaction-related expenses related to the sale of our Seattle's Best Coffee brand.\n(3) Adjustments were determined based on the nature of the underlying items and their relevant jurisdictional tax rates."

Today's discussion will be led by Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer; and Rachel Ruggeri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nThis conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties\nthat could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements.

Niccol\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Starbucks Corp.\nThank you, Tiffany, and good afternoon and thank you for joining today. Starbucks is one of the world's great\ncompanies and most iconic brands. It really is a privilege to take on this role. And I am excited to be here and\noptimistic about the future.\nSince joining Starbucks last month, I've spent my time digging into the business, listening to partners and\nconnecting with customers. These experiences and my learnings have helped me form a clear understanding of\nwhere we are and what we need to do differently moving forward. Everything I have seen and heard tells me we\nhave significant strengths to build on. The brand is strong and enduring. We have deep coffee expertise, and we\nhave a fantastic team of Green Apron partners.\nI look forward to sharing more about my plan to get Back to Starbucks with you shortly. But first I'd like to turn it\nover to Rachel for a more detailed overview of our final Q4 and full fiscal year 2024 financial results. Rachel?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nRachel Marie Ruggeri\nChief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Starbucks Corp.\nThank you, Brian. And welcome to your first Starbucks earnings call. And good afternoon, everyone. As you saw\nin our press release last week, our traffic challenges persisted in Q4, resulting in pressures throughout our P&L\nfrom our top-line to our bottom-line. With that, I'll briefly discuss our Q4 and full year results and then turn the call\nover to Brian.\nIn regards to Q4, our Q4 consolidated revenue was $9.1 billion down 3% from the prior year, driven by a 7%\ndecline in comparable store sales, consisting of an 8% decrease in transactions and a 2% increase in average\nticket, partially offset by 7% net new company-operated store growth.\nThe revenue decrease was primarily due to a 6% decline in US comparable store sales driven by a 10% decline\nin comparable transactions, partially offset by a 4% increase in average ticket mainly from pricing. Traffic declined\nacross all channels and dayparts, with the most pronounced decline in the afternoon daypart.\nIn addition to the continued decline of non-Starbucks Rewards Member visits, frequency also slowed across all\nSR member deciles in comparison to prior year, and ultimately impacted spend. While active SR membership\ngrew 4% year-over-year, to 33.8 million, it remained flat to Q3 as our product innovation and offerings, as well as\npromotions, did not create sustained excitement or the stickiness we planned.\nOur Q4 results also reflected China comparable store sales decline of 14% driven by an 8% decline in average\nticket and a 6% decline in comparable transactions, weighed down by intensified competition and a soft macro\nenvironment that impacted consumer spending.\nAlthough the market reached an all-time high of 23.5 million SR Active members during the quarter with 2.2\nmillion net new members versus prior year, comp declined due to non-SR member traffic pressures, elevated\ndiscounting given the highly-promotional environment and lower sales of high-ticket items impacted by consumer\nsentiment.\nShifting to margin. Our Q4 consolidated operating margin was 14.4%, contracting 370 basis points from the prior\nyear, primarily driven by deleverage, investments in store partner wages and benefits as well as increased\npromotional activities. The contraction was partially offset by pricing and the in-store operational efficiencies.\n4\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nStarbucks Corp.\n(SBUX) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nIn-store, we were successful in getting increased hours per partner, which is contributing to low hourly partner\nturnover and reduced training costs. However, we have additional work to do to obtain the correct staffing.\nWe also expect our throughput to be further optimized once the Siren Craft processes stabilizes across the\ncompany-operated store portfolio. Outside the store, we remained focused on capturing additional end-to-end\nsupply chain efficiencies. Collectively in and out of store efficiency efforts have yielded savings of approximately\n150 basis points in the quarter.\nOur G&A expenses were higher than expected and exceeded 7% of revenue in Q4, primarily due to unplanned\nand non-reoccurring third-party services and transition costs. Excluding these costs totaling approximately 50\nbasis points, G&A was 6.6% of revenue in Q4 and remained closer to 6% for the second half of fiscal year 2024 in\nline with expectations. We expect G&A to further decrease relative to revenue over time, leading to sustained\nmargin expansion.\nQ4 EPS was $0.80, down 24% from the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by a combination of traffic\nchallenges and heightened investments, partially offset by our pricing and efficiency efforts.\nMoving to full fiscal year 2024. Consolidated net revenues increased 1% to $36.2 billion in fiscal year 2024 driven\nby 7% net new company-operated store growth offset by a 2% decline in comparable store sales.\nFull year consolidated operating margin was 15%, contracting 110 basis points from prior year, primarily driven by\ninvestments in store partner wages and benefits, deleverage and increased promotional activity. The contraction\nwas partially offset by pricing and in-store operational efficiencies.\nOur in-store and out-of-store efficiency efforts collectively delivered roughly 250 basis points of margin\nimprovement for the full year, which is nearly $1 billion of cost reductions throughout our P&L as aligned with our\noriginal plan.\nFull year EPS was $3.31, declining 6%, including a 1% unfavorable impact from higher effective tax rate.\nShifting to our outlook. As noted in our press release last week, given the company's CEO transition, coupled with\nthe current state of the business, our guidance is suspended for full fiscal year 2025. This allows ample\nopportunity to assess the business and solidify key strategies as we refocus our efforts on the turnaround.\nI would like to still briefly touch on our capital allocation priorities. As Brian mentioned in his prepared remarks last\nweek, one of our top priorities includes re-establishing Starbucks as the community coffee house.\nTo do so, we plan to reduce the number of our new stores and renovations in fiscal year 2025 to accommodate a\nredesign while also unlocking capital to support our broader turnaround. We expect this shift, coupled with\nefficiencies, will help us balance our investments accordingly. We're working through the details of the impacts on\nkey metrics, including store growth, and will revert back with insight at a future date.\nIn the meantime, I want to be clear that this shift in store growth strategy does not reflect and should not be\ninterpreted as a statement on our long-term opportunity view or new store performance. In fact, we continue to\nsee strong, highly incremental performance from our new stores.\n5\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nStarbucks Corp.\n(SBUX) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nAs a proof point, approximately 40% of our US company-operated stores had positive comp growth in full fiscal\nyear 2024 with outsized contribution from our newer stores, especially in markets where store density remains\nlow. We continue to see store growth opportunity, especially as we focus on continuing to create a welcoming\ncoffee house and the store experience that both our Green Apron partners and our customers deserve.\nAlso last week, we announced an annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.57 to $0.61 per share.\nThis marks our 14th consecutive year of annual increase at a CAGR of approximately 20%, offering shareholders\na sense of certainty during the turnaround and our confidence in our long-term growth.\nIn summary, our results do not reflect the strength of our brand and what we're capable of. As a 20-plus year\npartner, I've seen what Starbucks is capable of when we focus on what we do best. It's because of that, that I\nhave confidence in our ability to turn around our business. And I have the utmost confidence in our partners\naround the globe that together we can deliver.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Brian.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian R. Niccol\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Starbucks Corp.\nThank you, Rachel. Our financial results were very disappointing, and it is clear we need to fundamentally change\nour strategy to win back customers and return to growth. Back to Starbucks is that fundamental change.\nWe have to get back to what has always set Starbucks apart, a welcoming coffee house where people gather and\nwhere we serve the finest coffee, handcrafted by our skilled baristas. Regardless of the consumer environment,\nwe must be at our best to succeed. And right now, despite the hard work of our Green Apron partners we aren't\nalways at our best.\nI've heard that while people love Starbucks, some feel like we have drifted from our core. We've made it harder to\nbe a customer than it should be, and we focused our marketing too narrowly on Starbucks Rewards members.\nI've spent my career understanding, building and stewarding brands, and it's clear the Starbucks brand is iconic\nand loved. My experience tells me that when we get back to our core identity and consistently deliver a great\nexperience, our customers will come back.\nOur problems are fixable, most of what we need to do is in our control. So our path forward is clear. And with our\nUS business being our priority, work is already underway. Some things will take some time as we test and learn,\nbut we're moving quickly on the things we can. I want to share a few examples.\nWe have to make it easier for our customers to get a cup of coffee. We are prioritizing work across the US\nbusiness to support a clear throughput with quality goal. We want to hand deliver a high-quality handcrafted\nbeverage to our cafe customers in 4 minutes or less and deliver orders on time for our Mobile Order & Pay\ncustomers every time. We have work to do to achieve this consistently, but we've learned lessons from our\nsuccess improving the drive-thru experience and reducing out the window times.\nOur throughput with quality aspiration and getting the core cafe experience right will drive everything we do and\nevery decision we make. The moment our barista hands a cup of coffee directly to the customer is our brand\nmoment of truth.\n6\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nStarbucks Corp.\n(SBUX) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nSo let's talk about some of the changes we're making to do this. First, we're working to get staffing right in our\nstores. As Rachel shared, we've made significant progress to improve average hours per partner and partner\nturnover is at another low. Our efforts to get partners, the hours and schedules they want are working.\nNow we need to make sure we have the right number of partners on the floor, particularly during our morning\npeak and shoulder hours. We are moving quickly to test and learn. We're also making a commitment to grow from\nwithin by identifying internal hires for 90% of our retail leadership roles and to rally our team behind our Back to\nStarbucks plan and help support strong leadership in every store, we're planning to host a store manager\nconference in 2025.\nSecond, we're making it easier for customers to enjoy brewed coffee their way. We plan to bring back condiment\ncoffee bars in all our cafes by early 2025. It's a great customer experience and will help with speed of service.\nWe also plan to complete the rollout of our Clover Vertica brewers in all our company-operated locations by the\nend of fiscal year 2025, providing customers more on-demand choice and high-quality brewed coffee. And we're\nevolving store routines to hand deliver brewed coffee to customers faster upon order.\nThird, to improve throughput, quality and consistency, we will cut down our overly complex menu to align with our\ncore identity as a coffee company. We will still offer customers great choice but we'll be focused on fewer, better\nofferings consistently crafted.\nFourth, we will continue to scale our investment in Siren equipment and Siren Craft processes to improve the in-\nstore experience for our partners and customers. This work is a critical enabler in helping to achieve our 4-minute\nwait time aspiration.\nAnd finally, we'll bring order to Mobile Order and Pay, so it doesn't overwhelm our cafes. Today, more than 30%\nof transactions are driven by mobile orders. At peak, it can drive an influx of orders that can be difficult to\nsequence and quickly deliver to our customers. When it works well, it's great, but sometimes it can be a challenge\nfor both customers and partners. So we're working to improve sequencing with a new algorithm that enables on-\ntime mobile order handoffs and supports our 4-minute throughput with quality being our goal for cafe customers.\nWe're also placing common sense guardrails on mobile ordering that we think will improve the experience for all\ncustomers. And over the coming months, we plan to take steps to better separate mobile order pickup from the\ncafe experience.\nThere are also some additional steps we're taking beyond a throughput with quality focus that we believe will\nresonate with our customers and partners. First, we are reimagining our pricing architecture, starting with non-\ndairy milk customizations. We know customization is an important part of the Starbucks experience, and we want\nto make it easier for customers to order their beverage just the way they want while still feeling like it's worth it.\nSo beginning with holiday launch on November 7, we're eliminating the upcharge for non-dairy milks at North\nAmerican cafes owned and operated by Starbucks. It's the most popular customization after an extra shot of\nespresso. And once implemented, nearly half of customers that pay for a modifier could see a price reduction of\n10% or more when they choose a non-dairy milk.\nWe're also investing in our customers with an intent not to increase menu prices at company-owned and operated\nstores in North America through fiscal year 2025. It's a great start, but we have more work to do to make our\npricing architecture straightforward and logical.\n7\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nStarbucks Corp.\n(SBUX) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nNext, we're reclaiming the Third Place. So our cafes feel like the welcoming coffee house our customers\nremember. In the coming months, we intend to reintroduce more personal touches to elevate the cafe experience.\nFor instance, we'll begin to prioritize serving coffee in ceramic mugs for customers who choose to enjoy their\ncoffee in our cafes.\nWe're also beginning to review and revise our cafe designs to bring back more comfortable seating and\namenities. And to ensure our stores are a place where customers want to sit, work and meet, we're beginning to\nrevisit certain policies with our partners and customers being top of mind.\nLastly, we're getting back to marketing Starbucks to all our customers. We've already made some changes. So\nfirst, we're focusing on coffee. Starbucks sources, roasts and crafts some of the finest quality coffee. I have\nalways loved Starbucks Coffee, but I haven't always fully appreciated the quality and care that goes into every\ncup. From the work of our agronomists to support tens of thousands of independent coffee farmers to our master\nroasters, our high-quality equipment and our skilled baristas. Our marketing needs to tell our coffee story and\nshowcase our premium coffee beverages.\nSecond, we're reducing the frequency of discount-driven offers that are proven ineffective, diluted our premium\npositioning, overburdened our baristas and detracted from a consistent customer experience. We're working to\nmake every visit worth it for our customers with straightforward pricing, timely service and a more consistent\nenjoyable cafe experience.\nThird, we need to broaden our marketing beyond our Starbucks Rewards customers. Our newly launched\ncampaign focuses on talking to all customers and elevates the Starbucks brand in a much more visible way\nthrough broad reach media like linear TV. It reminds customers across age groups that Starbucks serves the best\ncoffee.\nYou've likely seen our new approach in practice already, and you will see more of it throughout the holidays and\ninto January.\nOur customers find worth through quality, consistency and a sense of value. I'm confident that even these early\nsteps will begin to remind customers the Starbucks experience is all of these things.\nThe US is my near-term priority, but our international business presents significant opportunities. Before\ndiscussing China in detail, I need to spend time there to better understand our operations and the market. All\nindications show me the competitive environment is extreme, the macro environment is tough, and we need to\nfigure out how we grow in the market now and into the future. In the meantime, we continue to explore strategic\npartnerships that could help us grow in the long term.\nLooking elsewhere, I've been pleasantly surprised to learn about significant international growth opportunities for\nthe business beyond China. We'll spend more time and effort to capitalize on growth across other international\nmarkets in the coming years.\nAs I mentioned last week, success comes from staying true to your identity, taking care of customers and your\nteam, simplifying the business, delivering consistently high-quality products and experiences and telling your\nstory. I'm confident we'll make it easier to be a customer, and we'll encourage customers to visit more often.\n8\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nStarbucks Corp.\n(SBUX) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nAnd I'm confident we'll set our partners up for success, so they can deliver the great customer experience I know\nthey want to provide. In doing so, we'll reinvigorate our brand, drive stronger financial returns and return\nStarbucks to growth. Thank you for your time. And as we get Back to Starbucks, we'll regularly share results\ndriven by our work. And as we begin to see results from pilot projects and early initiatives, we'll share more about\nour long-term plan.\nWith that, we will open the call for questions. Operator?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJeffrey A. Bernstein Q\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\nGreat. Thank you very much, and welcome to Starbucks, Brian. Just a bigger picture question. Obviously, you\nmet with baristas presumably a lot over the past 50 days. I'm wondering what your key learnings have been in\nterms of maybe top requests or what areas you think are the greatest opportunities because presumably, you're\nbringing it back to kind of the basics at Starbucks and you would think that handoff between barista and customer\nis the most important. So just wondering kind of what your key takeaways were?\nAnd if I could just layer in another component there. I mean it just seems like you had tremendous success at\nChipotle implementing very similar initiatives. I'm just wondering what you think were some of your greatest wins\nat Chipotle with some initiatives that maybe could be applied at Starbucks? Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian R. Niccol A\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Starbucks Corp.\nYeah. Thanks. And terrific to be here at Starbucks and delighted to be talking about the business with all of you.\nSo to answer your first question, yeah, I had the opportunity, frankly, to spend time with our baristas from the\nWest Coast to East Coast, middle of the country, in the South. And one thing that was consistent that I got to start\nwith is they love this brand, okay? They love serving craft coffee that they know we go the extra mile to ensure it's\nabsolutely the best.\nAnd I had the opportunity to ask people over and over again, what is your favorite drink to prepare. And\nconsistently, every barista came back to me with, you know what, I love making the espresso drinks, the latte art,\nthe flat whites, the cappuccinos, the lattes. These are things that literally, they shined when they answered the\nquestion.\nNow as regard to – I also asked them, what do you think are some things we could be doing better. And right out\nof the gate, one of the things they said that would help the whole process is if we could get brewed coffee not to\nbe going down the line and ending up down at the counter. And so that's why you heard me in my prepared\nremarks here, talk about how we're going to bring back the coffee condiment bar, because both our customers\nare asking for it and our baristas are saying it would help them deliver the speed of service that they want to\nprovide.\nSo that's one big piece of feedback I got. The second piece of feedback right there with the brewed coffee is take\na hard look at the staffing, both during peak and shoulder hours to ensure that we're setting the teams up for\n9\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nStarbucks Corp.\n(SBUX) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nsuccess all day long. And so, we've looked at it. I'm happy to say we're already implementing some changes in a\ncouple of thousand stores, and we are going to be piloting some new approaches on how we set up the labor\nmodel so that our baristas have time to give not only great craft drinks, but also that hospitality and that human\ntouch of handing off the drink to our customer at the counter and then also making sure that we're on time with the\nmobile order business.\nThe other thing that they shared with me in some of the stores is they wanted their cafe dining room back. They\nlike leading the coffee house. I think there is a moment of pride of saying, this is my place. They know our\ncustomers by name. They have their regulars. They want to have a great seat for them. They want to have a\ngreat environment for them to enjoy whether it's a moment for themselves or whether it's sharing a moment with\nothers. And so I couldn't agree more, frankly, with a lot of their feedback.\nI'll touch on one more, which was, hey, is there any way to simplify the customization that we provide? Can we put\nin some guardrails on this, so that it's not out of hand? And so those were the big ones.\nTo your question on similarities of Chipotle, what I would tell you is the similarity start with, you've got an\nemployee/partner base at Starbucks that is hugely committed to the brand and hugely committed to doing the\nright thing for the business. And when you start with that kind of foundation, you're able to put in the right\nprograms so that we can get the business turned around.\nSo I would say that is one big similarity. The thing obviously that I've also just been really impressed by is just how\nspecial Starbucks is to so many people, both customers at all ages and whether they're getting just a brewed cup\nof coffee quickly or whether they're getting a flat white. The brand means a lot to them, and it means a lot to their\ncommunities. And I take that as a lot of responsibility. So long answer to your question, but I wanted to make sure\nI was thorough. So thanks for the question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nSara H. Senatore Q\nAnalyst, BofA Securities, Inc.\nThank you. And thank you for that color, Brian. I wanted to ask, I know you're getting a lot of questions\ncomparisons to Chipotle. But one of the things that I think struck me at the time was that there were a lot of\nbenefits that you were able to extract from what say, reallocating resources. So reinvesting in some parts of the\nbusiness and maybe finding things that were less productive elsewhere.\nAnd I guess I'm wondering, it sounds like maybe that's the case for Starbucks, too. You talked about reducing\nupcharges for non-dairy milk, which as an almond milk drinker, I thank you for, but you're also promoting less.\nAnd similarly, maybe shifting to linear television, but it sounds like perhaps away from other channels.\nSo I wanted to see if that's the right interpretation including around scheduling perhaps, which is maybe not more\nhours, but different hours?\nAnd then just a quick question for Rachel. I think you mentioned some one-time charges in G&A, but I think they\nwere included in the non-GAAP EPS. So I just want to make sure I understand what kind of non-recurring might\nactually be in the adjusted EPS? Thanks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n10\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nStarbucks Corp.\n(SBUX) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nBrian R. Niccol A\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Starbucks Corp.\nSo, I'll start, Sara. To answer your question, I mean, look, I absolutely want to stop doing the things that aren't\nworking and shifting those dollars to things that I believe will work. And in some cases, we have to test and learn\nour way through that. But yeah, look, I think to the company's credit, they've already started some terrific work on\nsupply chain and getting inefficiencies out of the supply chain that I think can support the business longer term.\nIt's not just a one-time situation. It's an ongoing capability that we're building.\nAnd then as it relates to like discounts and some of the shifting of marketing dollars and then what we're doing on\nthe labor side of things, we may find it's going to require some additional hours. Because at the end of the day, I\nwant to make sure that the teams are staffed to win every transaction.\nSo that, when somebody comes in, they walk away saying they had a great experience, time and time again. And\nI also want to have a scenario where our baristas feel like they have the ability to give a great experience. And I'm\nsure you've heard this over and over again, right? It's like the customer experience will not exceed that of the\npartner's experience.\nSo we have to make sure and we're going to test and learn our way through this, that we are setting up the right\nschedule, the right amount of hours with the right number of partners on the floor, so that we can deliver these\nhandcrafted drinks and hand them off to our customers in store. And then also support our mobile order business,\nas well as in some cases, the drive-thru business as well.\nSo we're going to be smart about the investments. And I think also you saw in the past, when I find something\nthat's working, we're going to do more of it. And so that is really what we're after. And I think collectively, the team\nreally buys into that approach.\nI'll hand it over to Rachel for the second piece.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nRachel Marie Ruggeri A\nChief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Starbucks Corp.\nSure. Thanks for the question, Sara. What I would just say just to punctuate a bit of what Brian said is that broadly\nwith our investments, you can expect that we'll continue with efficiency efforts.\nWe'll have ways to balance this, but I think it's important to note that in the near term, we may see some\nincremental investments that will have an impact on our financials, but we do expect they'll be accretive,\nparticularly as we balance that with increased transactions. So I'd look at it from that perspective.\nAs it relates to the G&A, we don't have a GAAP, non-GAAP situation with the transition cost. The cost that I spoke\nabout, the non-reoccurring one-time, are largely all related to transition in one way or another. We don't expect\nthat that will repeat. When you think about G&A for next year, the one thing to remember is while we'll continue to\nfocus on being as efficient as possible, we will be lapping lower performance-based comp in fiscal year 2024. So\nthat will have an impact on our G&A in fiscal year 2025.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Please state your\nquestion.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n11\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nStarbucks Corp.\n(SBUX) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nBrian Harbour Q\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nSure. Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks, Brian, for the thoughts and welcome. Just a menu question. The\nsimplification that's going to happen, do you have a sense for what that will be so far and roughly what the timing\nwould be? In the comment about kind of guardrails around customization, do you – I don't know if you want to say\nanything about that at this point? And then I guess just more broadly, what's – what do you think is kind of the\nright pace of innovation at Starbucks typically?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian R. Niccol A\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Starbucks Corp.\nYeah. So to answer your first question on kind of guardrails for customization and menu simplification, we're\nactually in the middle of doing that work right now. There are some obvious things that are easy to say, let's get\nthat off the menu. And then there are other things that we might have to test our way on the menu of how we exit\nthem smartly.\nAnd then on the customization, as far as guardrails go – and by the way, the menu simplification is both in\nbeverage and food. We're not just looking at beverage or just food.\nAnd then on the customization guardrails, right now, if you go through the app, you'll notice that we offer up all\nkinds of customization or it's the same customization page almost for everything that you order. So two things\nhappen.\nOne, it's complicated for the customer to get through it. And then two, we kind of incentivize people to customize\ndrinks that probably aren't the best way to execute the drink. Not to mention, it creates additional complexity for\nour partners to execute the drink.\nSo – we have some clean up to do is the way I would describe it. And then I also think we have some pricing\narchitecture tied to guardrails to ensure that we end up with – no surprises for, frankly, anybody on what was the\nprice of what they just built. And then also that we can execute it consistently every time. So that's what we're\nafter on those fronts. And what was your other question?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian Harbour Q\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nJust product innovation. What do you see in your view – what's kind of the right pace?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian R. Niccol A\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Starbucks Corp.\nYeah. Look, it's really interesting. I'm still getting up to speed on the innovation process at Starbucks. And what\nI'm happy to discover is, they have a Stage-Gate process. It hasn't been followed recently, and we're going to\nstart using the process again.\nSo innovation has been, I think, a core piece of the Starbucks proposition, and it's going to continue to be. But we\nare definitely not going to be moving at the speed you probably saw over the last two years. And part of that is\nwe're just going to take a much more disciplined approach using the Stage-Gate process. So that what we roll\nout, we have a better understanding of how it's going to perform, the supply chain can support it, the baristas can\nexecute it. And we'll make sure we're smart about how we then market it. So people are aware of it.\n12\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nStarbucks Corp.\n(SBUX) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nSo it's kind of the basics of how I would call it like Stage-Gate innovation. But what I was happy to discover is\nthere is a process already at Starbucks, it just wasn't being used, and now we're going to reinstate it.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please state your\nquestion.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn Ivankoe Q\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\nHi. Thank you very much. Brian, you just mentioned food, I think, for the first time in this call and food is nearly\n25% of Starbucks sales. Food from what I recall is in 40% of transactions. So it is actually a pretty meaningful part\nof the Starbucks business. And there has been some discussion of kind of improving the baked goods, improving\nthe sandwiches, improving the lobby, things around food warming cabinets that could be a significant enhancer to\nspeed, especially if people were to order several different things.\nHow would you prioritize food? Is that something that you think is a big long-term growth opportunity for Starbucks\nor is the answer, do fewer things better and really focus on beverage first?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian R. Niccol A\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Starbucks Corp.\nYeah. Thanks for the question, John. The – to answer your question, look, food is, I think, a key piece of the\npuzzle. And I think you're right, we have the opportunity to do fewer, better food executions. So obviously, I want\nto make sure that everybody understands the quality, the craft, the commitment we have to coffee. But I think we\ncan also have the same commitment to quality and craftsmanship in our food to match the experience you get\nwith our beverages.\nSo we're doing work on that already. And I do think we're going to be much better at food if we do fewer things on\nthe food front in a better-quality fashion. So that's part of the process. And I think you'll see some of those\nchanges evolving over the coming months.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian R. Niccol A\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Starbucks Corp.\nYeah.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: And your next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please state your question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDavid E. Tarantino Q\nAnalyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.\nHi. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask about the store redesign work that you're doing. I was just curious if you could\nelaborate on what are some of the elements you're seeking in that? And what do you envision the benefits of the\nnew design being? And then maybe secondly, once you finalize that design, do you envision a big remodel cycle\nover the next several years or however you want to frame it with that? Thanks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n13\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nStarbucks Corp.\n(SBUX) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nBrian R. Niccol A\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Starbucks Corp.\nYeah. Thanks, David. So yeah, so look, what we want to do is figure out, one, how we can reduce the cost on our\nrenovation program. And then as part of that, also create the experience where you've got a great coffee house\nchair or a seat or vibe, okay? And then at the same time, I want to separate and we believe we need to separate\nthe counter experience, meaning the in-store experience from the mobile order pickup experience. But\nregardless, whether you walk in to just pick up your coffee and go, I want you to feel like you've walked into a\nspecial place.\nAnd look, ideally, I was just saying this to our design team. I know we've got it right when people are questioning\nwhether or not they want to order mobilely because maybe if I have a few minutes, I'd rather stay in the cafe and\nget that cafe experience from our barista where it's handheld. So I have a strong belief that we can make the cafe\nexperience, frankly, really terrific and something special, really welcoming, warm space where you want to spend\nsome time.\nAnd I think there's touches, right? I mentioned just bringing back the ceramic mug if you decide to stay in the cafe\nand have your latte. Two, obviously, then the furniture that we have, the materials that we choose. I love – our\ndesigners are talking about making sure we bring back the layers, the texture, the warmth. Those are the things\nthat are really important.\nOperationally, what we're also after is clarity of where that barista handoff experience will happen. We're also\nafter less than 4 minutes for POS to the handoff. And we're also after if you order a brewed cup of coffee, it's a\nreally fast experience because we're going to just hand it to you right at the point of sale, and then you can go to\nthe coffee condiment bar and doctor up your coffee, how you see fit.\nOne of the other things we're going to be bringing back to is bringing the sharpies back to our baristas and it's\ngoing to give them the opportunity to put that additional human touch on every coffee experience as well.\nSo there's a lot of – I think there's a lot of just simple things that go a long way of saying, you know what, this is a\ncommunity place, this is a special place where people are here to connect. And I think we can do that in a really\nmeaningful way.\nAnd then obviously, on the mobile order side of things, I want to create a separate area where it's clear, so your\ndrink is ready. I can grab it. And if you need to be quick, you can be quick. And we'll be on time with it. And then\nobviously, we still have the drive-thru business where we got to make sure we get the orders correctly out the\nwindow.\nAnd then to answer your question, David, on the renovation program. I think we're still working through what is the\nright schedule once we fully understand what the renovations are going to entail. But my hope is over the coming\nyears, we'll be able to touch everything and get back to having that community coffee house vibe.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Andrew Charles with TD Cowen. Please state your\nquestion.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAndrew M. Charles Q\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n14\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nStarbucks Corp.\n(SBUX) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nGreat. Thank you. Brian, one of the things that made Chipotle successful was the digital make line that helped\nprovide capacity for traffic growth and creating production capacity, it sounds like something in your mind for\nStarbucks. I'm curious what your view is on the Siren System automated technology, and if this is something\nyou're looking to step on the gas to accelerate retrofitting the pace of this in excess of the 10% of the store base\nper year that's currently in place, would help you improve operations as well as the barista experience?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian R. Niccol A\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Starbucks Corp.\nYeah. Thanks for the question. Obviously, the one thing I'm really delighted about is the Siren Craft System, both\nthe equipment and the process I think, is a key unlock for us to deliver on this 4 minutes or less on the in-cafe\nexperience. And then also to set up the algorithm where we can allow mobile orders to have specific pickup times\nso that we're sequencing those mobile orders.\nWhat I'll tell you is we know we've got some bottlenecks out there, right, that we've got to solve. And the good\nnews is some of the bottlenecks require the full implementation, so the hot hold, the combi oven, the cold solution,\nthe process. And then there are other stores where we don't have to quite go that far in order to achieve the\nthroughput that we're after. But what I love about this is then we can – we know when transactions get to a certain\nlevel or mix gets to a certain level, how we need to roll out the system accordingly.\nSo what I would tell you is, look, would I want the organization rotating towards is how do we unlock throughput at\nless than 4 minutes in that store. If that store requires a full Siren Craft System, put it in. If it requires some pieces\nof it, put that in. If it just requires staffing and better deployment, we'll implement that.\nSo I really – I think we need to re-rotate ourselves to this idea of we are going to be a great coffee craft company\nthat has now really good throughput and operational standards for how we'll perform for each of these access\nmodes. And the good news is we've got a great group of engineers, a great group of people that have clarity on\nhow we solve any of these bottlenecks that we pop into or bump into.\nSo that's the way you should think about it. I'm putting a full-court press on solving 4 minutes is the point and then\nhow that cascades into our other access modes.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Pleas state your question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDavid Palmer Q\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\nThanks. Just a follow-up on what you were just talking about with the back of the bar changes and trying to make\nthe baristas' life easier, service times better. Are you – and you mentioned CapEx changes, away from unit\ndevelopment and perhaps towards some of these changes with the Siren System or at least just the machines.\nAre we really going to see what they were describing to us a while ago with the Siren System or – and you're just\ngoing faster with that and more aggressively towards the stores that need it? Or are you envisioning something\nnot more radical, but different in that you were going to separate the bar in different ways to make that is more\nfundamentally a departure from what we were hearing about?\nAnd then you mentioned the 4-minute service time goal. What is that service time today? And where specifically\nare the biggest bottlenecks or pain points that are keeping you – keeping that gap from 4 minutes? Thanks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n15\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nStarbucks Corp.\n(SBUX) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nBrian R. Niccol A\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Starbucks Corp.\nYeah. So David, I think the big change here is having an operating standard around less than 4 minutes. And\nthere wasn't, I guess, clarity on that aspect. Instead, we were just kind of working on pain points in isolation as\nopposed to what is the system solution to get the customer experience and the barista experience that we know\nwe need to deliver.\nAnd so the less than 4 minutes actually comes from two things: one, talking to baristas and customers to find out\nwhat are their expectations. And one of the things I'm happy to discover is, before the business got as big as it is\nand had also mobile order and food and cold, et cetera, a lot of our partners, long-time partners are used to\ngetting these handcrafted drinks done in about 2.5 minutes. So we know it's feasible.\nTo your point, though, there is some additional bottlenecks that we have to deal with. So in some cases, it's the\nfood, and that's where it's necessary to put in the combi oven, have the warming kit. In some cases, it's the mix of\ncold. And in some cases, frankly, it's the mix of mobile. And so we have to address these things throughout the\nsystem.\nAnd that's why I was saying like putting everything against this idea of, you know what, we are not going to do\nsomething or, said another way, we're going to be doing the things that enable less than 4 minutes at the counter.\nThen we're also going to be doing things that enable being on time and accurate every time for mobile order\npickup. And it's also – we're going to work towards getting less than 4 minutes in the drive-thru window as well.\nSo, the good news is we've got the equipment. We just haven't over time, used it as a system to serve against the\nneed of less than 4 minutes. And so that's the big change. And when you start to use that metric, you quickly\ndiscover where our stores have a real problem, and we're going to go very aggressive against those first. And\nwhere there are other stores that frankly don't have the transaction or the mix yet that weren't putting in all this\nequipment, but we should put in the processes, wire the place correctly so that as their transactions get close, we\ncan put it in and avoid ever having the bottlenecks.\nAnd then to just answer your question, we probably have about 50% of our stores or 50% of our transactions\nalready happening less than 4 minutes. So we know it's very doable, and this is what I'm referring to during peak.\nWe know it's very doable. We just need to do it in all our stores in every transaction.\nSo we're going to be maniacal about getting after it.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Christine Cho with Goldman Sachs. Please state your\nquestion.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nChristine Cho Q\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\nThank you for taking my questions. So I know you're not ready to put specific numbers around it. But I was\nwondering if you can kind of talk about the major areas or buckets where you would need to kind of invest in to\nkind of restore the traffic momentum as well as to improve the store infrastructure for your partners as well as\nguests? And also just to confirm that $1 billion per annum cost efficiency unlock program, is that something still\nyou can leverage in the next few years? Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n16\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nStarbucks Corp.\n(SBUX) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nBrian R. Niccol A\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Starbucks Corp.\nI'm sorry, what was the last part of your question?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nChristine Cho Q\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\nThe $1 billion per annum cost efficiency unlock. Is that something? Thanks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian R. Niccol A\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Starbucks Corp.\nOh, yeah, the productivity effort. Yeah, the productivity effort. Yeah, you got it. So, yeah, look, the things we're\nworking on are kind of what I shared in my opening remarks, which I believe will drive transactions because it's\ngoing to address our partner experience as well as our customer experience.\nSo I just spent a bunch of time talking about this, getting after the less than 4 minutes in the cafe, being on time\nand accurate in mobile order against certain time standards, getting the pricing architecture correct, broadening\nour reach beyond Starbucks Rewards customers. And then obviously, creating that community house experience\nwhere people want to be in Starbucks, spend time in Starbucks.\nAll those things will add up to, I believe, growth. And the good news is we've got some great assets and tools\navailable to us, right? That rewards program is a valuable tool. It's not the only tool, but it's a valuable tool that I\nthink we could make work harder for us if we put it in concert with marketing that has more broad reach.\nI think innovation, the capability of this organization has on innovation is a powerful tool. We haven't used it\ncorrectly of late. But I think if we use it correctly, with the Stage-Gate process, driven against the idea of these\noperating standards of less than 4 minutes and then also delivering on customers' expectations, innovation will be\nmore powerful.\nSo it is one of those things where as we get the foundation reset, I believe there's a lot of additional catalysts for\ngrowth in the business. And if you're asking me, how do I add it all up, I don't have an answer for you yet. What I\ncan tell you it adds up to is more growth. It adds up to a turnaround and it adds up to growth. So that's what we're\ngoing to spend our time on.\nAnd then on the last piece of productivity, the $1 billion. I mean the good news is the team, especially the supply\nchain team has done a tremendous job of just being much smarter about how we, I think, work with our vendors\nand partners as well as the right way to bring them these products to market. It's powerful when you have the right\nproduct at the right place at the right time, it just becomes so much more efficient for everybody involved, both the\nsupplier to all the way to our partner in store that has to deliver on. So Rachel, if you want to add anything to that.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nRachel Marie Ruggeri A\nChief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Starbucks Corp.\nThe only thing that I would add, Christine, is just to say that while we'll continue to focus on efficiencies, the target\nthat we've shared previously will be part of as we think about reassessing the business and looking at the right\nnear-term and longer-term strategies as part of our Back to Starbucks plan, we'll look at the optimal level of\nefficiencies.\n17\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nStarbucks Corp.\n(SBUX) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nBut what you can expect is we will continue, to Brian's point, we have so much opportunity across the end-to-end\nsupply chain as we optimize throughout the store and even as we manage spend. And so we'll continue to be\nfocused on that. I wouldn't be as focused on the $1 billion. I would just be focused on the fact that we will continue\nforward with efficiencies, and we'll do that as a way to help offset some of the investments we'll be making.\nAnd in the future, those efficiencies will help us not only support incremental investments, but they'll lead to\nmargin expansion and earnings growth.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jon Tower with Citi. Please state your question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJon Tower Q\nAnalyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.\nGreat. Thanks for taking the questions. And Brian, congrats, and I wish you guys all the best of luck getting this\ngoing in the right direction again. Maybe just first, when you're talking about the menu simplification and even just\nthe simple idea of not charging for non-dairy modifiers, any way to quantify the dollar amount that that's\ncontributing to revenue today?\nAnd then, I guess, my broader question for you, Brian, just looking at the brand from a high level, do you feel like\nit's a bit overdistributed today, specifically, when I look at the US, you have a large chunk of US company stores,\nbut then you have a fairly large footprint of licensed stores. And when you're talking about going through all these\ninitiatives, how can you apply that not only to your customers, your current company store base, but also to the\nlicensed stores so that the customer gets a similar experience of both venues?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian R. Niccol A\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Starbucks Corp.\nYeah. Thanks, Jon. The – look, I will tell you, I am pleasantly surprised to see how the license business in the US\nperforms. I had the opportunity to spend some time with the guys at Target and I will tell you, they are hugely\nsupportive of the idea of getting Back to Starbucks. And I think they're going to want to give people the Back to\nStarbucks experience that we're after.\nSo I'm hugely optimistic. Then even when I think about like the airports and such, there's a huge opportunity for\nus, I think, to simplify some of the execution there so that we can get people the great throughput that they want\nso they can get on their way. So from what I can tell, everybody seems to be very excited about this idea of\nthroughput with quality, this broader idea of just getting Back to Starbucks.\nSo I think this will carry not only in our licensed stores, but I think they'll carry it as it's their own, which I think is\nreally important. And then what was the other part of your question?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJon Tower Q\nAnalyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.\nWas on the menu simplification...\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian R. Niccol A\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Starbucks Corp.\nOh, menu simplification.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n18\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nStarbucks Corp.\n(SBUX) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nJon Tower Q\nAnalyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.\n... and putting numbers around that, or even just on the non-dairy modifier cost?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian R. Niccol A\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Starbucks Corp.\nYeah. So look, we're early days into the menu simplification. But there's definitely room for us, I think, to eliminate\nsome products, frankly, that add complexity, have a lot of waste and really don't add a whole lot to the experience.\nAnd so we're going to have to be – it's going to be – in some cases, it's tough because everybody has their one\nfavorite thing that maybe is on the long tail of this. But we got to clear the way so that we can get to the big\nmovers that people really interact with time and time again.\nAnd then on the customization, like the alt-milk, look, I've just seen time and time again, when people start the\nprocess of their beverage, the price is, I think, warranted given the caliber of the coffee or the drink that you're\ngetting. Where we sometimes, I think, get twisted is in all the different customizations that we offer up. And then\nthe complexity of the customization that people take us up on.\nAnd I think a lot of it is unnecessary. And I think when we simplify that aspect of it and then charge for the things\nthat we should be charging for and maybe not charging for the things that don't really need to be charged for, I\nthink everybody is going to walk away feeling a lot better about ultimately their personal beverage that they've\ncreated.\nSo, the numbers specifically, we're still working through some of that. Obviously, we've got a pretty good idea of\nwhat the alt-milk implication is, but I'm confident it's the right investment in the business to get people to reengage\nwith the brand accordingly. So I don't know if you want add anything to that, Rachel?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nRachel Marie Ruggeri A\nChief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Starbucks Corp.\nYeah. I would just say, as you think about the investments we're making, which are going to be important to\nreturning Starbucks to growth, just when you think about the shape of the year, you could expect that the first half\nof the year is where we'll be making the investment. So we expect that the back half of the year will be stronger as\nthe investments and our strategies start to take hold.\nSo, that's the way I think about it. I think there'll be a more near-term impact as we make some of these\ninvestments, but we expect that the traffic will return and that we'll see customers coming back into the stores,\nand that will help the balance so that we see gradual momentum in the back half of the year.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please state your question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPeter Saleh Q\nAnalyst, BTIG LLC\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I did want to ask again about the Siren System. This has been\naround for about two years now. And I think the pushback in terms of broader development or expansion of the\nSiren System has been, it's too disruptive to the stores unless it's a remodel store or a new store. So I guess as\nyou see it with fresh eyes, what do you see as the hurdle to a broader implementation of the Siren System? Is it\n19\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nStarbucks Corp.\n(SBUX) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nthat disruptive? Or is it just something that you're going to have to work through, given the ultimate benefit of the\nsystem itself? Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian R. Niccol A\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Starbucks Corp.\nYeah. Thanks. Well, look, one of the things that we definitely have to fix is when we do renovations, we can't have\nstores closed for two weeks or three weeks or whatever it is. That is too disruptive. So the team knows that,\nthey're working on how we fix that. But that almost has nothing to do with the Siren System. That's just in general,\nprincipal on renovations.\nThe Siren System, I would say part of the reason why I think we've maybe took a – not the most direct path on\nthis is because we haven't had clarity of what we – problem we were trying to solve. And the problem we are\nsolving now is getting to great experiences. If you really think about it right, we've got three access modes, okay?\n– or sorry, four access modes if you include delivery, right? You got in-cafe, you got mobile order pay, you got\ndrive-thru and you got delivery, all right? So there's four access modes coming. And now we're in three lines of\nbusiness, right, hot, cold and food?\nAnd we have not had operating standards for time of service that we want to provide for each of those elements.\nSo that's the problem we need to solve. And the good news is, even though it wasn't, I guess, envisioned initially,\na lot of the equipment and process solves bottlenecks that were kind of considered one-off issues. But when you\nput the whole thing together, and you realize like, oh, geez, this store is operating at such a transaction level, it's\ngot such a food mix. It's got such a cold mix. It's got such a mobile order, you got to put the entire system in, in\norder to achieve these operating standards of the excellence as it relates to the customer experience.\nSo I would tell you, part of the reason why I think we've zigged and zagged on that Siren Craft System is because\nwe didn't have clarity of what the problem we were trying to solve. And now I think we've got clarity, which is we're\nall about great throughput for the access modes that our customers want to experience Starbucks. And I think I'm\noptimistic that we can roll this out accordingly. And the places where you got the full-scale bottleneck, they're\ngoing to be the first places that we implement this, coupled with, I want to touch the stores to bring back that\ncoffee house experience.\nAnd look, the challenge or the problem for us to solve is, I don't want the store closed for weeks, and we got to\nfigure out how we can do it for less. So – and I think these things are all very solvable. So hopefully, that answers\nyour question on the Siren Craft System.\nAnd more importantly, what's the problem we're trying to solve. And the problem we're trying to solve is I want to\ngive a great customer experience from a time standpoint to go with the great craft quality coffee, drink\nexperience/food experience you're getting.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank. Please state\nyour question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nLauren Silberman Q\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nThank you. And congrats, Brian. I wanted to ask about value. You talked about the pricing architecture, no plans\nto increase prices, removing the upcharge on non-dairy. How would you assess Starbucks' value perceptions?\n20\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nStarbucks Corp.\n(SBUX) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nAnd to what extent you see that as a driver of current headwinds? And then relatedly, how are you thinking about\nthe architecture of the rewards program and opportunity there? Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian R. Niccol A\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Starbucks Corp.\nYeah. So look, I think – like I said, I think we have a real opportunity in simplifying the pricing experience, right,\nbecause you start off with a price for a latte or whatever you start with. And then the next thing you know you start\ncustomizing. And right now, everything has kind of a different price and whether it's one pump, four pumps,\nfrankly, I'm still wrapping my head around how the whole system works, and that's part of the reason why I know\nwe have to simplify it.\nWhat I have found is when you get simplification in place on pricing, people understand, okay, this is what I'm\npaying, and this is what I'm getting. And right now, I think we're surprising people a little bit on what they're paying\nthrough the customization process and we've got to fix that.\nBut look, if you actually look at just a brewed cup of coffee, and you understood the commitment we have to the\nagriculture of that coffee bean to the moment that, that coffee being roast to the moment that coffee bean makes\nits way to our store, we use equipment like Clover Vertica, it's freshly ground, freshly brewed. I'm highly confident\nit's probably the best cup of coffee you can get. And we're going to make it a lot easier for people to get access to\nit.\nAnd I think when people discover that, with a great environment, I think we're back to people saying, hey, this is\nreally worth it. And that's what we got to work on. That's what we've got to prove to our customer. And I think the\ncombination of what I've outlined is going to do just that.\nAnd I think the good news is we don't have to wait, we can start that process. And that's why you see us doing\nthings like bringing in the coffee condiment bar, not charging for alt-dairy, okay? You're going to continue to see\nus make those moves that we can. And then you'll see us continue to test and learn our way into some of the\nother things that we need to take our time on and be smart about.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Thank you. That was our last question. I will now turn the call over to Brian Niccol for closing remarks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian R. Niccol\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Starbucks Corp.\nAll right. Well, thank you, everybody. It was great to hear some familiar voices and thank you for the kind words.\nObviously, I just want to reiterate, I believe Starbucks is one of those great special companies and brands. And\nit's a real pleasure and honor to have the opportunity to be in this role. And thank you for your time and your\nquestions.\nI'll just reiterate a few things. Obviously, Q4, the fiscal year, they were disappointing, but fundamentally, we're\nchanging our strategy, okay? And we have a clear path on how we're going to get Back to Starbucks. And\nhopefully, what you've heard from this is we're already taking steps to start driving this idea of throughput with\nquality, getting the staffing right in our stores, making movement on our pricing architecture and bringing, I think,\nsome order to mobile orders while we also reclaim the Third Place and overhaul our marketing.\n21\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nStarbucks Corp.\n(SBUX) Corrected Transcript\nQ4 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nSo a lot of work is happening. I think it's been clearly communicated to the organization. Hopefully, you have a\nclear understanding of what we're focused on. And I'm confident this early work will start to stabilize the business.\nWe'll make it easier and quicker for our customers to get a great cup of coffee.\nWe'll make our cafes more enjoyable. And I think that's going to help bring customers back into our stores. And\nmost importantly, I think our barista is going to be really proud of the store that they work in and the experience\nthat they provide.\nSo as I said at the top of the call, I'm very optimistic despite the near-term challenges, I believe we have\nsignificant strengths, a strong enduring brand. We have a clear plan. We're going to be moving quickly. There's a\nlot of important work ahead of us. And look, I look forward to updating each and every one on our results as we\ngo. And I'm confident we're going to return Starbucks to growth. So with that, thank you, and have a great day.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Thank you.

Business\nGeneral\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“10-K” or “Report”) for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2024 (“fiscal 2024”), Starbucks Corporation (together with\nits subsidiaries) is referred to as “Starbucks,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our.”\nStarbucks is the premier roaster, marketer, and retailer of specialty coffee in the world, operating in 87 markets. Formed in 1985, Starbucks Corporation’s\ncommon stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “SBUX.” We purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell,\nalong with handcrafted coffee, tea, and other beverages and a variety of high-quality food items through company-operated stores. We also sell a variety of\ncoffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels, such as licensed stores as well as grocery and foodservice through our Global\nCoffee Alliance with Nestlé S.A. (“Nestlé”). In addition to our flagship Starbucks Coffee® brand, we sell goods and services under the following brands:\nTeavana®, Ethos®, and Starbucks Reserve®.\nOur primary objective is to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. We believe the continuous\ninvestments in our brand and operations will deliver long-term targeted revenue and income growth. This includes expansion of our global store base, adding\nstores in both existing, developed markets such as the U.S. and in higher growth markets, as well as optimizing the mix of company-operated and licensed\nstores around the world. In addition, by leveraging experiences gained through our stores and elsewhere, we continue to drive beverage, equipment, process,\nand technology innovation, including in our industry-leading digital platform. We strive to regularly offer consumers new, innovative coffee and other products\nin a variety of forms, across new categories, diverse channels, and alternative store formats.\nStarbucks has always been a different kind of company – one deep with purpose, where we work together to create a positive impact in the world. With coffee\nat our core, we pursue ambitious goals for our partners (employees), our communities, and our planet, which we believe also contributes to the long-term\nsustainability of creating a thriving business powered by thriving people for a thriving planet and communities. Our work to uplift one another extends well\nbeyond our partners to the communities where we do business around the world. We are committed to responsible and ethical sourcing led by Coffee and\nFarmer Equity Practices (“C.A.F.E. Practices”), the Company’s third-party verification program and the cornerstone of our approach to ethical sourcing of\ncoffee with over 98% of our coffee having been historically verified through C.A.F.E. Practices as ethically sourced.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe invest in the well-being – the mental, physical, and financial health – of every partner through our practices, policies, and benefits. This work is grounded\nin the belief that we are at our best when we create inclusive, supportive, and welcoming environments, where we uplift one another with dignity, respect, and\nkindness. And we are hard at work uplifting our communities and building environments in our stores that are welcoming and safe. We believe the strength of\nour workforce is one of the significant contributors to our success as a global brand that leads with purpose. Therefore, one of our core strategies is to invest in\nand support our partners to differentiate our brand, products, and services in the competitive specialty coffee market, including the following areas of focus:\nOversight and Management\nWe recognize the diversity of customers, partners, and communities and believe in creating an inclusive and equitable environment that represents a broad\nspectrum of backgrounds and cultures. Working under these principles, our Partner Resources Organization is tasked with managing employment-related\nmatters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation planning, performance management, and professional development. Our Board\nof Directors (the “Board”) and Board committees provide oversight on certain human capital matters, including our Inclusion and Diversity initiatives. As\nnoted in its charter, our Compensation and Management Development Committee is responsible for periodically reviewing Starbucks partner resource\nprograms and initiatives, including healthcare and other benefits, as well as our management development and succession planning practices and strategies.\nOur Audit and Compliance Committee works closely with the Risk Management Committee, led by Starbucks chief financial officer (“cfo”) and chief legal\nofficer, to monitor and mitigate current and emerging labor and human capital management risks. Our Environmental, Partner, and Community Impact\nCommittee annually reviews and assesses the effectiveness of the Company’s environmental and social\n3\nTable of Contents\nstrategies, policies, practices, goals, programs, disclosure, and risks, including review of the Company’s annual global climate and social impact report.\nThese reports and recommendations to the Board and its committees are part of the broader framework that guides how Starbucks should attract, retain, and\ndevelop a skilled workforce that aligns with our values and strategies.\nWe regularly conduct anonymous surveys to seek feedback from our partners on a variety of topics, including confidence in company leadership,\ncompetitiveness of our compensation and benefits package, career growth opportunities, and recommendations on how we can remain an employer of choice.\nThe results are shared with our partners and reviewed by senior leadership, who analyze areas of progress or deterioration and prioritize actions and activities\nin response to this feedback to drive meaningful improvements in partner engagement. Our management and cross-functional teams also work closely to\nevaluate human capital management issues such as partner retention, workplace safety, harassment, and bullying, as well as to implement measures to mitigate\nthese issues.\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging\nAs we create the future of Starbucks, we are continuing to work to improve the partner experience so our partners can thrive at work, individually, and together.\nCore to this is taking steps to ensure that Starbucks is an inclusive, diverse, equitable, and accessible company—a place where all are welcome and where our\npartners know they belong.\nUnder the leadership of our senior vice president of Talent and Inclusion and our executive leadership team, we remain committed to accountability at every\nlevel of the Company. We prioritize transparency with our partners, Inclusion and Diversity Executive Council, Partner Networks, Inclusion and Diversity\nBusiness Council, community leaders, customers, and stakeholders.\nAt Starbucks, we are committed to creating environments where everyone is welcome and belongs. In 2024, we reaffirmed this commitment by cementing\n“Belonging” as one of our company values.\nThese values have long been part of our culture, and we are working to build a more inclusive, equitable, accessible, and diverse company, to make substantial\nprogress in the representation of our partners and to expand opportunities for our partners. To further this:\n• we worked to reach a broader pool of candidates, prioritizing inclusivity in our recruitment, in partner engagement, and by continuing to foster\ninclusive leadership;\n• we established and expanded our mentorship program to make valuable guidance and networking opportunities available to all partners; and\n• we remained focused on addressing barriers impeding equal pay for equal work.\nAt the end of fiscal 2024, our U.S. partner base is made up 70.9% female and 28.4% male. Additionally, in the U.S. diverse partners represent more than 51.9%\nof our retail team and more than 37.9% of our corporate roles.\nWe are expanding workforce diversity to bring new perspectives and experiences that improve our business and workplace. To do this, we reach a broader pool\nof candidates and talent by prioritizing inclusivity in our recruitment practices, in partner engagement, and by continuing to foster inclusive leadership.\nTotal Rewards\nWe have demonstrated a history of investing in our workforce by offering competitive salaries and wages by continuously assessing the current business\nenvironment and labor market. We have consistently made enhancements in wages in order to attract talent to support our growth strategy and to elevate the\ncustomer experience. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of partners with shareholders, restricted stock units are provided to eligible\nnon-executive partners under our broad-based stock incentive programs. Furthermore, we offer comprehensive, locally relevant and innovative benefits to all\neligible partners. The following list summarizes key benefits provided in the U.S., which is our largest and most mature market:\n• Comprehensive health insurance coverage is offered to partners working an average of 20 hours or more each week.\n• 100% upfront tuition coverage through the Starbucks College Achievement Plan for partners to earn a first-time bachelor’s degree online at Arizona\nState University is offered to partners working an average of 20 hours or more each week.\n• Our Future Roast 401(k) savings plan helps partners save for their financial goal through convenient payroll deductions. Partners can contribute pre-\ntax or Roth after-tax dollars, and Starbucks matches 5% of eligible contributions with immediate vesting in those matching contributions.\n4\nTable of Contents\n• 100% paid parental leave is available to new parents that welcome a child through birth, adoption, or foster placement and work an average of 20\nhours or more each week.\n• A Partner and Family Sick Time program is provided and allows partners to accrue paid sick time based on hours worked and use that time for\nthemselves or family members in need of care.\n• We view mental health as a fundamental part of our humanity and provide a comprehensive suite of related programs and benefits. These include a\nfree subscription to Headspace, an online application that enables guided meditation, and 20 free mental health therapy or coaching sessions annually\nwith Lyra.\nOutside of the U.S., we have provided other innovative benefits to help address market-specific needs, such as providing interest-free loans to our U.K.\npartners to help cover rental deposits, mental health services in Canada, and, in China, an extra 14th Month Pay initiative, giving retail partners an additional\nmonth’s salary as a bonus on top of the 13th month pay that is customary in China, as well as a monthly housing subsidy for full-time Starbucks baristas and\nshift supervisors, and comprehensive health insurance coverage for parents of partners.\nRole-based Support\nTo help our partners succeed in their roles, we emphasize continuous training and development opportunities. These include, but are not limited to, safety and\nsecurity protocols, updates on new products and service offerings, and deployment of technologies. Training provided through our Pour Over sessions, which\nare a series of inspiring talks with thought leaders to help partners understand how to bring the Starbucks Experience to life, include a wide variety of topics\nsuch as achievable goal setting, giving and receiving constructive feedback, and effective engagement with customers and communities. To help further\npromote an inclusive culture and to better serve our customers, we encourage U.S.-based partners to enroll in the To Be Welcoming courses we created in\npartnership with Arizona State University to address different forms of bias and discrimination.\nPay Equity\nTo be an employer of choice and maintain the strength of our workforce, we consistently assess the current business environment and labor market to refine our\ncompensation and benefits programs and other resources available to our partners.\nStarbucks is committed to pay equity. We’ve achieved and maintained racial and gender pay equity for partners in the U.S. who are performing similar work,\nand we’re working toward achieving gender pay equity for Starbucks partners who are performing similar work in all of our company-operated markets\nglobally. Further, we have formulated pay-equity principles, which provide equal footing, transparency, and accountability as best practices that help address\nknown, systemic barriers to global pay equity.\nAs of September 29, 2024, Starbucks employed approximately 361,000 people worldwide. In the U.S., Starbucks employed approximately 211,000 people,\nwith approximately 201,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in corporate support, store development, roasting, manufacturing, warehousing, and\ndistribution operations. Approximately 150,000 employees were employed outside of the U.S., with approximately 144,000 in company-operated stores and the\nremainder in regional support operations. Approximately 5% of Starbucks partners in U.S. company-operated stores are represented by unions. We believe our\nefforts in managing our workforce have been effective, evidenced by low turnover, a strong culture, and active employee participation.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nName Age Position\nBrian Niccol 50 chairman and chief executive officer\nRachel Ruggeri 55 executive vice president, chief financial officer\nBrady Brewer 51 chief executive officer, Starbucks International\nSara Kelly 45 executive vice president, chief partner officer\nBrad Lerman 68 executive vice president, chief legal officer\nBrian Niccol joined Starbucks as its chairman and chief executive officer in September 2024.

Our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand\nof coffee and tea in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee, tea, and related products, as well as complementary food offerings, and by\nproviding each customer with a unique Starbucks Experience. The Starbucks Experience is built upon superior customer service, convenience, and a seamless\ndigital experience as well as safe, clean, and well-maintained stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate, thereby building a\nhigh degree of customer loyalty.\nOur strategy for expanding our global retail business is to increase our category share in a disciplined manner, by selectively opening additional stores in new\nand existing markets, as well as increasing sales in existing stores, to support our long-term strategic objective to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the\nmost recognized and respected brands in the world. Store growth in specific existing markets will vary due to many factors, including expected financial\nreturns, the maturity of the market, economic conditions, consumer behavior, and the local business environment.\nCompany-operated store data for the fiscal year-ended September 29, 2024:\nStores Open Stores Open\nas of as of\nOct 1, 2023 Opened Closed Transfers Net Sep 29, 2024\nNorth America:\nU.S. 9,645 611 (96) (2) 513 10,158\nCanada 977 37 (17) — 20 997\nSiren Retail 6 — — — — 6\nTotal North America 10,628 648 (113) (2) 533 11,161\nInternational:\nChina 6,804 855 (65) — 790 7,594\nJapan 1,733 90 (14) — 76 1,809\nU.K. 355 32 (9) — 23 378\nAll Other 67 4 — — 4 71\nSiren Retail 5 — — — — 5\nTotal International 8,964 981 (88) — 893 9,857\nTotal company-operated 19,592 1,629 (201) (2) 1,426 21,018\nStarbucks company-operated stores are typically located in high-traffic, high-visibility locations. Our ability to vary the size and format of our stores allows us\nto locate them in or near a variety of settings, including downtown and suburban retail centers, office buildings, university campuses, and rural and off-highway\nlocations. We are continuing the expansion of our stores, particularly drive-thru formats that provide a higher degree of access and convenience, as well as\nother store formats that cater to a variety of customer needs.\n7\nTable of Contents\nRetail sales mix by product type for company-operated stores:\nSep 29, Oct 1, Oct 2,\nFiscal Year Ended 2024 2023 2022\nBeverages 74 % 74 % 74 %\nFood 23 % 22 % 22 %\nOther(1) 3 % 4 % 4 %\nTotal 100 % 100 % 100 %\n(1) “Other” primarily consists of serveware, packaged and single-serve coffees and teas, and ready-to-drink beverages, among other items.\nStored Value Cards and Loyalty Program\nOur branded stored value card program (the “Starbucks Card”) is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method, support gifting, and\nincrease the frequency of store visits by cardholders, in part through the related Starbucks® Rewards loyalty program where available, as discussed below.\nStarbucks Cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most\nlicensed stores in North America, China, Japan, and many of our other markets in our International segment. Starbucks Cards can also be obtained online, via\nthe Starbucks® Mobile App, and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their Starbucks Card or\nthe Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are\nautomatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward\npoints (“Stars”) earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or\nselected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the\nStarbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to Note 1, Summary\nof Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our Starbucks Cards and loyalty program.\nLicensed Stores\nRevenues from our licensed stores accounted for 12% of total net revenues in fiscal 2024. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher\noperating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed\nstore operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower\nrevenues we receive under the licensed store model.\nIn our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees\nprovide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As\npart of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food, and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the\nlicensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees\nworking in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to\nemployees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results\nof operations from our other licensed stores.\n8\nTable of Contents\nLicensed store data for the fiscal year-ended September 29, 2024:\nStores Open Stores Open\nas of as of\nOct 1, 2023 Opened Closed Transfers Net Sep 29, 2024\nNorth America:\nU.S. 6,701 232 (158) 2 76 6,777\nCanada 481 26 (21) — 5 486\nTotal North America 7,182 258 (179) 2 81 7,263\nInternational:\nKorea 1,870 144 (34) — 110 1,980\nLatin America 1,649 139 (83) — 56 1,705\nU.K. 911 87 (22) — 65 976\nTurkey 676 46 — — 46 722\nTaiwan 563 24 (16) — 8 571\nIndonesia 581 30 (8) — 22 603\nThailand 474 40 (1) — 39 513\nPhilippines 447 33 (1) — 32 479\nAll Other 4,093 426 (150) — 276 4,369\nTotal International 11,264 969 (315) — 654 11,918\nTotal licensed 18,446 1,227 (494) 2 735 19,181\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues primarily are recorded in our Channel Development segment and include sales of packaged coffee, tea, and ready-to-drink beverages to\ncustomers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as royalties received from Nestlé under the Global Coffee Alliance and other\ncollaborative partnerships.\nProduct Supply\nStarbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages. To help ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards, we\ngenerally control substantially all coffee purchasing, roasting, and packaging, and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations. Nestlé controls\ndistribution of Starbucks packaged coffee products outside of Starbucks stores through the Global Coffee Alliance, and in some cases, also roasts and packages\nthese products. We purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee-producing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for\nour many blends and single-origin coffees.\nThe price of coffee is subject to significant volatility. Although most coffee trades in the commodity market, high-altitude arabica coffee of the quality sought\nby Starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “C” coffee commodity price. Both the premium and the commodity price depend\nupon the supply and demand at the time of purchase. Supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, water\nsupply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increases in farm inputs and costs of\nproduction, inventory levels, and political and economic conditions. Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors. Price is also impacted by\ntrading activities in the arabica coffee futures market, including hedge funds and commodity index funds. In addition, green coffee prices have been affected in\nthe past, and may be affected in the future, by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green\ncoffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies.\nWe buy coffee using fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, depending on market conditions, to secure an adequate supply of quality green\ncoffee. We also utilize forward contracts, futures contracts, and collars to hedge “C” price exposure under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts and our\nlong-term forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. Total purchase commitments, together\nwith existing inventory, are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2025.\nWe depend upon our relationships with coffee producers, outside trading companies, and exporters for our supply of green coffee. We believe, based on the\nestablished relationship and historical performance of our suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery on such purchase commitments is remote.\n9\nTable of Contents\nTo help ensure the future supply of high-quality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry, Starbucks operates ten farmer support\ncenters, including our China Farmer Support Center located in the Yunnan Province of this high-growth market. Farmer support centers are staffed with\nagronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both\ncoffee quality and yields as well as agronomy support to address climate change and other impacts.\nIn addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy, particularly fluid milk, and to a lesser degree, plant-based dairy-free alternative products,\nsuch as oat milk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated stores. We believe, based on the established relationship and historical\nperformance of our dairy and plant-based dairy-free suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient fluid milk and plant-based dairy-free alternatives to\nsupport our stores generally is remote.\nProducts other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in Starbucks stores include tea and a number of ready-to-drink beverages that are purchased\nfrom several specialty suppliers, usually under long-term supply contracts. Food products, such as pastries, breakfast sandwiches, and lunch items, are\npurchased from national, regional, and local sources. We also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups and cutlery, from several\ncompanies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations. We are also expanding our use of reusable\npackaging to reduce landfill waste. We believe, based on the established relationship and historical performance of our suppliers and manufacturers, that the\nrisk of non-delivery of sufficient amounts of these items generally is remote.\nCompetition\nOur primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee retailers and shops. We believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee\nretailers and shops primarily on the basis of product quality, brand reputation, service, and convenience, as well as price. We continue to experience direct\ncompetition from large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector and the ready-to-drink coffee beverage market, in addition to both well-established\nand start-up companies in many international markets. We also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified\npersonnel to operate both new and existing stores.\nOur coffee and tea products sold through our Channel Development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores,\nwarehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores, and foodservice accounts and also compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market.\nTrademarks, Copyrights, Patents, and Domain Names\nStarbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries throughout the world. Some of our\ntrademarks, including Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, Starbucks Reserve, and Frappuccino, are of material importance. The duration of trademark registrations\nvaries from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations\nare properly maintained.\nWe own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics, and training materials. We also hold patents on\ncertain products, systems, and designs, which have an average remaining duration of approximately thirteen years. In addition, Starbucks has registered and\nmaintains numerous Internet domain names, including “Starbucks.com,” “Starbucks.net,” and “Starbucksreserve.com.”\nSeasonality and Quarterly Results\nOur business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our second fiscal quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income.\nAdditionally, as Starbucks Cards are issued to, and loaded by, customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during\nthe first quarter of the fiscal year. However, since revenues from Starbucks Cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the\nStarbucks Cards, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. As a result of moderate seasonal\nfluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\nGovernment Regulation\nAs a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the United States and the multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate\nas well as the rules, reporting obligations, and interpretations of all such requirements and obligations by various governing bodies, which may differ among\njurisdictions. In addition, changes to such laws, regulations, rules, reporting obligations, and related compliance obligations could result in significant costs but\nare not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods.\n10\nTable of Contents\nAvailable Information\nStarbucks Annual Report on Form 10-K reports, along with all other reports and amendments filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the “SEC”), are publicly available free of charge on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.starbucks.com as soon as reasonably\npracticable after these materials are filed with or furnished to the SEC.

as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, may\nadversely affect our business.\n• If our business partners and third-party providers do not satisfactorily fulfill their responsibilities and commitments, it could damage our brand, and\nour financial results could suffer.\n• Reported incidents involving food- or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination, or mislabeling, whether or not accurate, could\nharm our business.\n• If we are unable to meet our projections for new store openings or efficiently maintain the attractiveness of our existing stores, our operating results\ncould suffer.\nRisks Related to Operating a Global Business\n• We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our North America operating segment.\n• We are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets in order to achieve our growth targets.\n• We face risks as a global business that could adversely affect our financial performance.\n• Our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations.\n11\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Supply Chain\n• Increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or\nother commodities could have an adverse impact on our business operations and financial results.\n• Our supply chain may be unable to fully support current and future business needs.\n• Interruption of our supply chain and our reliance on suppliers could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact\nour business and profitability.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\n• Our financial condition and results of operations are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, a number of macroeconomic and other factors,\nmany of which are largely outside our control.\n• Economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business and financial\nresults.\n• Failure to meet our announced guidance or market expectations for our financial performance will likely adversely affect the market price and increase\nthe volatility of our stock, and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may also impact the market price and volatility of our stock.\nRisks Related to Human Capital\n• The loss of key personnel, difficulties with recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, or ineffectively managing changes in our workforce could\nadversely impact our business and financial results.\n• Changes in the availability and cost of labor could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Competition\n• We face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability.\nRisks Related to Environmental, Social, and Governance Matters\n• Climate change may have an adverse impact on our business.\n• Our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations, including with respect to environmental,\nsocial, and governance matters, that could expose us to numerous risks.\n• Certain activist shareholder actions have caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur expense, hinder execution of our business strategy, and\nadversely impact our stock price.\nRisks Related to Regulation and Litigation\n• Failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results.\n• We have been, and could continue to be, party to litigation or other legal proceedings that could adversely affect our business, results, operations, and\nreputation.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy\n• Failure to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain privacy and data protection laws and regulations may result in substantial negative financial\nconsequences, reputational harm, and civil or criminal penalties.\n• The unauthorized access, use, theft, or destruction of customer or employee data (personal, financial, or other), or of Starbucks proprietary or\nconfidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf, could impact our reputation and brand and expose\nus to potential liability and loss of revenues.\n• We rely heavily on information technology in our operations and growth initiatives, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption, or security\nfailure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\n• Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property or ensure that we are not infringing on the intellectual property of others could harm the value of\nour brand and our business.\n12\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Brand Relevance and Brand Execution\nOur success depends substantially on the value of our brands, and failure to preserve their value could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nWe believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience, and for\nour global environmental and social impact programs. The Starbucks brand is recognized throughout most of the world, and we have received high ratings in\nglobal brand value studies. To be successful in the future, particularly outside of the U.S. where the Starbucks brand and our other brands are less well-known,\nwe believe we must preserve, grow, and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a\nvariety of subjective qualities.\nErosion of trust in our brand value can be caused by isolated or recurring incidents originating both from us or our business partners, or from external events.\nSuch incidents can potentially trigger boycotts of our stores or result in civil or criminal liability, which can have a negative impact on our financial results.\nIncidents that can erode trust in our brand value include actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws,\ncontaminated food, product recalls, store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases, safety-related incidents, or other potential\nincidents discussed in this risk factors section. The impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly\nthrough social or digital media (including for malicious reasons), or if they result in litigation. Negative postings or comments on social media or networking\nwebsites about Starbucks, even if inaccurate or malicious, have in the past, and could in the future, generate negative publicity about Starbucks across media\nchannels that could damage the value of our brand. It may be difficult to address such negative publicity, including as a result of fictitious media content (such\nas content produced by generative artificial intelligence or bad actors) across media channels. Additionally, consumer demand for our products and our brand\nvalue could diminish significantly if we, our employees, licensees, or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, act or are perceived to\nact in an unethical, illegal, racially-biased, unequal, inequitable, or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content, or sale of our\nproducts, service and treatment of customers at Starbucks stores, treatment of employees, including our responses to unionization efforts, or the use of\ncustomer data for general or direct marketing or other purposes. Allegations, even if untrue, that we are not respecting internationally recognized human rights,\nare failing to comply with applicable workplace and labor laws, or are aligned with positions on social or geopolitical issues could also negatively impact our\nbrand value. Additionally, if we fail to comply with laws and regulations, take controversial positions or actions, fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer\nexperience in each of our markets, including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees who represent the\nbrand well, or fail to foster an inclusive and diverse environment, our brand value may be diminished. In addition, we cannot ensure that our store partners,\nlicensees, or other business partners will not take actions that adversely affect the value and relevance of our brand.\nFurthermore, if we are not effective in making sufficient progress toward our environmental and social program goals, consumer trust in our brand may suffer,\nand this perception could result in negative publicity or litigation. The ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on making sufficient progress toward our\nenvironmental and social program goals, each of which requires company-wide coordination and alignment. Increased public focus, including by governmental\nand nongovernmental organizations, on environmental sustainability matters, including climate change, diminishing energy and water resources, packaging and\nwaste, deforestation, biodiversity loss, greenhouse gas emissions, and land use, may result in increased pressure to set goals and take actions to meet them,\nwhich could expose us to market, operational, and execution costs or risks. Statements regarding our environmental and social program goals reflect our\ncurrent plans and aspirations; our environmental and social program-related policies, practices, and goals are voluntary, challenging, and subject to change at\nour discretion. Some third parties may object to the scope or nature of our environmental and social program initiatives or goals, or any revisions to these\ninitiatives or goals, which could give rise to negative responses by governmental actors (such as retaliatory legislative treatment), consumers (such as boycotts\nor negative publicity campaigns), or other third parties that could adversely affect our brand value.\nWe may not be successful in our marketing strategies, promotional and advertising plans, and pricing strategies.\nOur continued success depends in part on our ability to adjust our marketing strategies, promotional and advertising plans, and pricing strategies to respond\nquickly and effectively to shifting economic and competitive conditions as well as evolving customer preferences. We operate in a complex and costly\nmarketing, promotional, and advertising environment. Competition to attract and retain high-quality marketing partners and endorsers has increased. Our\ndecisions to collaborate or to cease collaborating with certain endorsers or marketing partners in light of actions taken or statements made by them could\nseriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Our marketing, promotional,\nand advertising programs may not be successful in reaching consumers in the way we intend. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our\nadvertising, promotional, and marketing resources across different channels, including digital, allows us to effectively and efficiently reach consumers in ways\nthat are meaningful to them. Additionally, many factors, including operating costs, constraints, or changes, and our current and future competitors’ pricing\n13\nTable of Contents\nand marketing strategies, could significantly affect our pricing strategies (including price reductions, promotions, discounts, coupons, or free goods), which\nmay prevent us from competing effectively in certain geographies. For example, historically, in order to partially offset inflation and other increases in the costs\nof core operating resources, we have gradually increased menu prices. There can be no assurance that future cost increases, including as a result of inflation,\ncan be offset by increased menu prices or that our current or future menu prices will be fully absorbed by our customers without any resulting change to their\ndemand for our products. If the advertising, promotional, and marketing programs or our pricing strategies are not successful or are not as successful as those\nof our competitors, our sales and market share could decrease.\nFinally, consumers are focusing more on sustainability and the environmental impacts of Starbucks operations, as well as the alignment of Starbucks actions\nwith its stated mission, values, and promises. An inability to meet consumer expectations with respect to these issues could adversely affect our financial\nresults.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth, which may have an adverse impact on our\nbusiness and financial results.\nWe may not be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations or that generate expected returns, which may result in an\nadverse impact on our business and financial results. These strategic initiatives, which include our Back to Starbucks plan, are designed to create growth,\nimprove our results of operations, and drive long-term shareholder value, and include:\n• being an employer of choice and investing in partners to deliver a superior customer experience;\n• building our leadership position around coffee;\n• driving convenience, brand engagement, and digital relationships through our mobile, loyalty, delivery, and digital capabilities both domestically and\ninternationally;\n• simplifying store administrative tasks to allow store partners to better engage with customers;\n• increasing the scale of the Starbucks store footprint with disciplined global expansion and continuing to introduce flexible and unique store formats in\ncertain markets;\n• adjusting rapidly to changing customer preferences and behaviors as a result of changing economic conditions and increased global interest rates and\ninflation;\n• moving to a more licensed store model in certain markets and a more company-operated model in other markets;\n• creating new occasions in stores across all dayparts with new product offerings, including our growing lunch food and beverage product lineup;\n• continuing the global growth of our Channel Development business through our supply, distribution, and licensing agreements with Nestlé and other\nChannel Development business partners;\n• delivering continued growth in our cold beverage business;\n• working to address the potential effects of climate change and the sustainability of our business; and\n• reducing our operating costs, particularly general and administrative expenses.\nIn addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section, factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives, which could\nhave a material adverse impact on our business and financial results, include the following:\n• delays or cancellations of store openings for reasons beyond our control, such as potential shortages of materials and labor, delays in permits, or a lack\nof desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, any of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets in the\nU.S. and internationally;\n• not successfully scaling our supply chain infrastructure as we continue to expand;\n• not successfully adapting to customer or market factors affecting our supply chain as we work to address sustainability goals and mitigate the impacts\nof climate change;\n14\nTable of Contents\n• inability to timely innovate with new product offerings, or the potential that such offerings may not be well-received by consumers;\n• delays or cancellations of remodels based on changes in macroeconomic conditions, changes in expected project benefits, or other factors;\n• construction cost increases associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores;\n• the challenges of company-wide coordination and alignment;\n• inability to identify or act on opportunities to deliver anticipated cost savings;\n• imposition of additional taxes by jurisdictions, such as on certain types of beverages or based on number of employees;\n• governmental regulations or other health guidelines concerning operations of stores, including due to public health emergencies;\n• deterioration in our credit ratings, which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our\ninitiatives; and\n• geopolitical instability and international conflicts.\nEffectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we continue to expand in international markets where we must balance the need for flexibility\nand a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals, policies, and standards. If we are not successful in\nimplementing our strategic initiatives, or, in the event we undertake large acquisitions, integrations, and divestitures, we may be required to evaluate whether\ncertain assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, have become impaired. In the event we record an impairment charge, it could have a material impact\non our financial results.\nOur investments to transform and enhance the customer experience, including through technology, may not generate the expected results.\nOur long-term business objectives depend on the successful execution of our strategies. We continue to build upon our investments in development, technology,\ndigital engagement, and delivery in order to transform and enhance the customer experience. As part of these investments, we continue to focus on improving\nour service model and strengthening relationships with customers, in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives, mobile order and payment systems,\nand enhancement of our technologies. We also continue to expand and refine our mobile ordering process. If these customer experience initiatives are not\nsuccessfully executed or do not generate expected results, or if we do not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, our financial\nresults may suffer. It is also possible that the greater allocation of time and resources to these customer experience initiatives versus other organizational\npriorities could negatively impact other areas of our business, or that we will fail to achieve optimal allocation of resources, which could materially harm our\nbusiness and results of operations.\nEvolving consumer preferences and tastes, as well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, may adversely\naffect our business.\nOur continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers. Our financial results could be adversely affected by a shift in consumer spending\naway from outside-the-home food and beverages (such as a reduction in discretionary spending); lack of customer acceptance of new products (including due\nto price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs), brands (such as the global expansion of the Starbucks brand), and\nplatforms (such as features of our mobile technology, changes in our loyalty rewards programs, and our delivery services initiatives); or customers reducing\ntheir demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced. In addition, some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar, and other\ncompounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion of linkages to a variety of\nadverse health effects. Particularly in the U.S., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, as well as increased consumer\nlitigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. An unfavorable report on the health effects of\ncaffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether or not accurate, imposition of additional taxes on certain types of food and beverage components,\nor negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and materially\nharm our business and results of operations. Changes in diet (whether due to changes in consumer behavior and eating habits, use of weight-loss drugs, or other\nfactors) could also influence the demand for our offerings and materially harm our business and results of operations. Our financial results have been, and\ncould continue to\n15\nTable of Contents\nbe, adversely affected by changes in macroeconomic conditions, including those discussed in more detail elsewhere in this risk factors section. Such changes\nhave impacted, and could continue to impact, customer routines, employer “work-from-home” policies, and consumer behavior, including consumers’ ability or\nwillingness to spend discretionary income on our products.\nIf our business partners and third-party providers do not satisfactorily fulfill their responsibilities and commitments, it could damage our brand, and our\nfinancial results could suffer.\nOur global business strategy, including our plans for new stores, branded products, and other initiatives, relies significantly on a variety of business partners,\nincluding licensees, joint venture partners, third-party manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, particularly for our entire global Channel Development\nbusiness. Licensees, retailers, and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food, beverage, and other products directly\nto customers. We believe our customers expect the same quality of service regardless of whether they visit a licensed or company-operated store, so we provide\ntraining and support to, and monitor the operations of, certain of these licensees and other business partners. However, the product quality and service they\ndeliver may still be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control, including financial constraints or solvency issues, adherence to sanitation\nprotocols and guidance, labor shortages, and other factors. We do not have direct control over our business partners and may not have visibility into their\npractices.\nWe also source our food, beverage, and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners, and in certain cases, such products\nare produced or sourced by our licensees directly. We do not monitor the quality of non-Starbucks products served by foodservice operators who are authorized\nto use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice businesses. Failures by our licensees or business providers to comply with the laws\nor regulations of their markets, or to otherwise meet the standards consumers associate with our brand, may negatively impact our business. Additionally,\ninconsistent use of our brand and other intellectual property assets, as well as the failure to protect our intellectual property, could erode consumer trust and\ndiminish our brand value, which could result in a material negative impact on our financial results.\nReported incidents involving food- or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination, or mislabeling, whether or not accurate, could\nharm our business.\nInstances or reports, whether true or not, of unclean water supply or food-safety issues, such as food- or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration,\ncontamination, and/or mislabeling, either during growing, manufacturing, packaging, transporting, storing, or preparation, have in the past severely injured the\nreputations of companies in the food and beverage processing, grocery, and quick-service restaurant sectors. Any report linking us to such instances, even when\nfalse, unfounded, or inaccurate, could materially harm our sales and could lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions), temporary store\nclosures, or other adverse consequences. Validated food-safety issues can also result in regulatory action and may lead to a recall of impacted products. Clean\nwater is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea, and other beverages, as well as ice for our cold beverages, and our ability to ensure adequate supplies of clean\nwater and ice to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. We continue to incorporate more products in our food and beverage\nlineup that require time and temperature control, including freezing or refrigeration, which increases the risk of food-safety related incidents if correct\ntemperatures are not maintained during manufacturing, storage, distribution to stores, and at stores, due to mechanical malfunction or human error.\nWe also face risk by relying on third-party food suppliers to manufacture finished products, and to provide and transport ingredients and finished products to\nour stores. The product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. Potential food safety incidents,\nwhether at our stores, with our products, or involving our business partners, could lead to wide public exposure, regulatory action, and potential litigation,\nwhich could materially harm our business.\nA widespread Starbucks product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to\nthe unavailability of product for a period of time, and could also subject us to product liability claims and negative publicity, all of which could materially harm\nour business. A decrease in customer traffic because of food-safety concerns or negative publicity, product recalls, viral-contaminated food or beverage claims,\nor other food or beverage-safety claims or litigation, or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores, could materially harm our business and results of\noperations. Additionally, instances of food or beverage-safety issues, even those solely involving the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or\ndistributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), could adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis by\nresulting in negative publicity about us, even if no Starbucks suppliers or products are impacted, or the foodservice industry in general.\n16\nTable of Contents\nIf we are unable to meet our projections for new store openings or efficiently maintain the attractiveness of our existing stores, our operating results could\nsuffer.\nOur growth depends in part on our ability to open new stores and operate them profitably on the forecasted timeline. In recent years, the costs of opening new\nstores increased due in part to construction labor inflation and increased costs of materials and equipment. In addition, we incur substantial startup expenses\neach time we open a new store, and it takes time to ramp up the sales and profitability of a new store, during which ramp-up period costs may be higher as we\ntrain new partners and build up a customer base. If we are unable to build the customer base that we expect or fail to overcome the higher startup expenses\nassociated with new stores, our new stores may not be as profitable as our existing stores. Our ability to open and profitably operate new stores is also subject\nto various risks, such as the identification and availability of desirable locations; the negotiation of acceptable lease terms; the need to obtain all required\ngovernmental permits (including zoning approvals) and comply with other regulatory requirements, including health and safety; the availability of capable\ncontractors and subcontractors; increases in the cost and decreases in the availability of labor and building material; changes in weather, natural disasters,\npandemics, or other acts of God that could delay construction and adversely affect guest traffic; our ability to hire and train qualified management and store\npartners; and general economic and business conditions. At each potential location, we compete with other foodservice and retail businesses for desirable\ndevelopment sites, construction contractors, management personnel, partners, and other resources. It is also possible that our new stores may negatively impact\nthe profitability of existing stores nearby. If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we could face increased costs and lower-than-anticipated sales\nand earnings in future periods, which could have a material negative effect on our operating results.\nIn addition, we continue to improve our existing stores through remodels, upgrades, and regular upkeep. If the costs associated with remodels, upgrades, or\nregular upkeep are higher than anticipated, stores are closed for remodeling for longer periods than planned, or remodeled stores do not perform as expected,\nwe may not realize our projected return on investment, which could have a material negative effect on our operating results.\nRisks Related to Operating a Global Business\nWe are highly dependent on the financial performance of our North America operating segment.\nOur financial performance is highly dependent on our North America operating segment, which comprised approximately 75% of consolidated total net\nrevenues in fiscal year 2024. If the North America operating segment revenue trends slow or decline, especially in our U.S. market, our other segments may be\nunable to make up any significant shortfall, and our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Since the North America segment is relatively\nmature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows, such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of\nour international businesses and other initiatives and for returning cash to our shareholders.\nWe are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets in order to achieve our growth targets.\nOur future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets. Some or all of our international market\nbusiness units (“MBUs”), which we generally define by the markets in which they operate, may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected\ngrowth, which ultimately requires achieving consistent, stable net revenues and earnings. The performance of these international operations may be adversely\naffected by economic downturns in one or more of the markets in which our large MBUs operate. A decline in performance of one or more of our significant\ninternational MBUs could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results.\nThe International segment is an important profit center driving our global returns, along with our North America segment. In particular, our China MBU, as our\nsecond-largest market overall and 100% company-operated, contributes meaningfully to both consolidated and International net revenues and operating\nincome. Due to the significance of our China MBU for our profit and growth, we are exposed to risks in China, including the risks mentioned elsewhere and\nthe following:\n• a highly competitive retail environment and the entry of new competitors to the specialty coffee market in China;\n• changes in economic conditions in China and potential negative effects to the growth of its middle class, wages, labor, inflation, discretionary\nspending, and real estate and supply chain costs;\n• the effects of U.S.-China relations, including escalating U.S.-China tension and increased anti-Americanism, potential tariff increases, retaliations,\nrestrictive regulations, or boycotts, and increasing political sensitivities in China;\n• ongoing government regulatory reform, including relating to public health, food safety, tariffs and taxes, sustainability, and responses to climate\nchange, which result in regulatory uncertainty as well as potential significant increases in compliance costs;\n• data privacy and cybersecurity risks unique to the conduct of business in China; and\n17\nTable of Contents\n• food safety related matters, including compliance with food safety regulations and ability to ensure product quality and safety.\nAdditionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations overall are different than those affecting our U.S. stores and\nlicensees. Tastes naturally vary by region, and consumers in some international MBUs may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the\nU.S. or other international markets. Occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the U.S. due to higher rents for prime\nstore locations or costs of compliance with market-specific regulatory requirements. Because many of our international operations are in an early phase of\ndevelopment, operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations.\nWe face risks as a global business that could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe operate in 87 markets globally. We encounter differing cultural, regulatory, geopolitical, and economic environments within and among the markets in\nwhich we operate, and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on our ability to successfully navigate these differing environments. Our ability to\nmeet customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment, and our global success is partially dependent on our\nability to leverage operating successes across multiple markets. Planned initiatives may not have appeal across multiple markets with our customers and could\ndrive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and market share.\nOur international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad, such as:\n• changes or uncertainties in economic, legal, regulatory, social, and political conditions in our markets, as well as negative effects on U.S. businesses\ndue to increasing anti-American sentiment in certain markets;\n• restrictive actions of foreign or U.S. governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment, especially during periods of heightened tension\nbetween the U.S. and such foreign governmental authorities, including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs, government\nintervention favoring local competitors, and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership;\n• delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, competition with locally relevant competitors, or a lack of desirable real estate locations\navailable for lease at reasonable rates, any of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and, in turn, negatively impact net\nrevenues, operating income, and earnings per share.\n• difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations and supply chain logistics, including ensuring the consistency of product quality\nand service, due to governmental actions affecting supply chain logistics, distance, language, and cultural differences, as well as challenges in\nrecruiting and retaining high-quality employees in local markets;\n• economic or trade sanctions affecting our ability to source products or conduct business in one or more of the markets in which we operate;\n• in developing economies, the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient levels of disposable income may not meet our\nprojections;\n• interpretation and application of laws and regulations, including those relating to taxes, tariffs, labor, merchandise, anti-bribery, privacy, and\nenvironmental, social, and governance issues;\n• local laws, policies, and conditions that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with, retain, or terminate employees;\n• labor strikes or work stoppages resulting from geopolitical instability or social unrest affecting one or more of the markets in which we operate;\n• local regulations, health guidelines, and safety protocols affecting our operations;\n• the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights;\n• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations or requirements to transact in specific currencies;\n• limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions due to current or new U.S. and international regulations; and\n18\nTable of Contents\n• import or other business licensing requirements.\nMoreover, many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing markets, which are important to our long-term growth prospects. An inability to\neffectively manage the risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations.\nThe growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations. Further, the degree to\nwhich we are able to enter into, maintain, develop, negotiate, and enforce appropriate terms and conditions of commercial and other agreements, as well as the\nperformance of our business partners under such agreements, are critical to our business. Our international licensees may face capital constraints or other\nfactors, including legal constraints, that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market. Our Channel Development\nbusiness is heavily reliant on Nestlé, which has the global right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators,\nwith few exceptions. If Nestlé fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements and/or fails to support, protect, and grow our\nbrand in Channel Development, our Channel Development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time, present long-term challenges to our\nbrand, limit our ability to grow our Channel Development business, and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. Our retail\nlicensed operations are concentrated in a relatively small number of large licensees. If they are not able to access sufficient capital or are otherwise unable or\nunwilling to successfully operate and grow their businesses, it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the applicable markets.\nRisks Related to Supply Chain\nIncreases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other\ncommodities could have an adverse impact on our business operations and financial results.\nThe availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility. We purchase, roast, and sell high-quality whole bean\narabica coffee beans and related coffee products. The high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above\nthe “C” price. This premium depends upon, among other factors, the supply and demand at the time of purchase, and the amount of the premium can vary\nsignificantly. Increases in the “C” coffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and impact our ability to enter into fixed-price\npurchase commitments. We frequently enter supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the\ndate, and therefore price, at which the base “C” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established.\nThe supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather, water supply quality and\navailability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increases in farm input costs and costs of production,\ninventory levels, political and economic conditions, and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices\nof green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors.\nFor example, extreme weather conditions such as drought or frost in Brazil have impacted coffee prices in the past, and in the likely event that such weather\nconditions were to reoccur, become more frequent, and/or increase in severity in the future, they may have similar or worse consequences on coffee price\nvolatility. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined\nwith our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica\ncoffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any\nof the above factors or due to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse\nimpact on our business operations and financial performance.\nWe also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, and to a lesser degree, plant-based dairy-free alternative products, such as oat\nmilk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. Additionally, other commodities, including tea and those related to food and\nbeverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs, and energy, as well as non-food and beverage inputs, such as the components that\ncomprise our packaging materials, are important to our operations, as is the processing of these inputs. Increases in the cost of dairy products and other\ncommodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets,\ncould have a material adverse impact on our profitability. Similarly, increases in the cost of, or lack of availability of, whether due to supply shortages, or\ndelays or interruptions in the processing of, plant-based alternatives could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.\n19\nTable of Contents\nOur supply chain may be unable to fully support current and future business needs.\nEven in the absence of acute disruptions or interruptions, our supply chain may be unable to fully meet current or future business needs. There can be no\nassurance that our suppliers will be able to accommodate our anticipated growth or continue to supply current quantities at preferential prices or at all. An\ninability of our suppliers to provide products in a timely or cost-effective manner could impair our growth and have an adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, and prospects. If we are unable to accurately forecast sales levels in each market or store and obtain sufficient ingredients or\nproduce a sufficient supply to meet demand, we may incur higher expedited shipping costs and may temporarily run out of stock of certain products, which\ncould negatively impact the enthusiasm of our customers and store partners. We have been, and may in the future be, unable to fully address consumers’\ndemand for our products, particularly in the case of new offerings for which demand is higher than projected. Conversely, if demand does not meet our\nexpectations, we have incurred, and could continue to incur, increased inventory write-offs. Finally, if we are unable to scale and improve our forecasting,\nplanning, production, and logistics management, we could frustrate our customers, lose sales, or diminish our brand reputation.\nInterruption of our supply chain and our reliance on suppliers could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our\nbusiness and profitability.\nAny material interruption in our supply chain (such as material disruption of roasted coffee supply), whether due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting\nplants, interruptions in service by our third-party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, trade\nrestrictions (such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, or customs restrictions), pandemics, social or labor unrest, labor shortages, natural disasters, or\npolitical disputes and military conflicts that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could have a negative material impact on our business and our\nprofitability. Additionally, our food, beverage, and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply\nchain operations and, in certain cases, are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. We rely on these suppliers to provide high-quality products and to\ncomply with applicable laws. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a\nsignificant challenge as we increase our fresh and prepared food offerings, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. and from countries or\nregions with diminished infrastructure, developing or failing economies, or which are experiencing political instability, labor discord, disruption or shortages,\nor social unrest. For certain products, we may rely on one or very few suppliers. A supplier’s failure to meet our standards, provide products in a timely and\nefficient manner, or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control. These issues could have a material negative impact on our business and profitability.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\nOur financial condition and results of operations are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, a number of macroeconomic and other factors, many of\nwhich are largely outside our control.\nOur operating results have been, and will continue to be, subject to a number of macroeconomic and other factors, many of which are largely outside our\ncontrol. Any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could have a material adverse impact on our business,\nfinancial condition, or results of operations:\n• increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets;\n• disruptions to our supply chain;\n• changes in climate, including changes to the frequency or severity of extreme weather events, that impact the price and availability or cost of goods\nand services, energy, and other materials throughout our supply chain;\n• changes in governmental rules and approaches to taxation;\n• adverse outcomes of litigation;\n• inflationary pressures and changes in prevailing interest rates;\n• severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters affecting a large market or several closely located markets that may temporarily or for extended\nperiods of time affect our retail business in such markets;\n• government shutdowns or the risk of government shutdowns, as well as the impact or expected impact of elections, both in the U.S. and in other\nmarkets around the world;\n• especially in our largest markets, including the U.S. and China, labor discord or disruption, geopolitical events, war, terrorism (including incidents\ntargeting us), political instability, acts of public violence, boycotts, increasing anti-\n20\nTable of Contents\nAmerican sentiment in certain markets, or hostilities, social unrest, or health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on\npublic gatherings such as in our stores; and\n• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nUnfavorable economic conditions could also adversely affect our suppliers and licensees, who in turn could experience cash flow problems, more costly or\nunavailable financing, credit defaults, and other financial hardships. This could lead to supplier or licensee insolvency, increase our bad debt expense, or cause\nus to increase the levels of unsecured credit that we provide to suppliers and licensees. Further, the insolvency of any of our licensees could result in disrupted\noperations or our exit from a particular market, and negatively impact our reputation.\nEconomic conditions in the U.S. and international markets have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business and financial\nresults.\nAs a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty about macroeconomic\nconditions. A continued economic downturn or recession, or slowing or stalled recovery therefrom, may have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, or results of operations. Our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our\nproducts or switch to our or our competitors’ lower-priced products as a result of various factors, including job loss, inflation, changes in prevailing interest\nrates, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, changes in federal economic policy, a global health pandemic, international trade disputes, or geopolitical\ninstability. For example, reductions and continuing volatility in China may be caused by, among other things: changes in consumer spending behaviors,\nincluding those caused by a decrease in consumer confidence in general macroeconomic conditions, a decrease in consumer discretionary spending, increasing\ncompetition in the market, lower-priced competitor product offerings, negative economic impacts related to the rising geopolitical tensions between China and\nTaiwan, economic policies or sanctions, heightened data and cybersecurity risks associated with conduct of business in China, and food-safety related matters.\nWe may also experience a reduction or increased volatility in demand for our products in connection with a global health pandemic. Decreases in customer\ntraffic and/or average value per transaction without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and could have a material\nnegative impact on our financial results. There is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty persist for a long period of time or worsen,\nconsumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent\nbasis or enduring changes in behavior that precipitate a more general downturn in the restaurant industry. These and other macroeconomic factors could have\nan adverse effect on our sales, profitability, or development plans, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to meet our announced guidance or market expectations for our financial performance will likely adversely affect the market price and increase\nthe volatility of our stock, and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may also impact the market price and volatility of our stock.\nWe have in the past failed, and may in the future fail, to meet our announced guidance or market expectations, which has adversely affected, and could in the\nfuture adversely affect, the market price of our stock. Our guidance is based on certain assumptions, which may or may not prove to be correct. Failure to meet\nour announced guidance or market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to our operational and financial results, shareholder returns, and\nexpectations regarding the success of our Back to Starbucks plan and related guidance, whether due to our assumptions not being met or the impact of various\nrisks and uncertainties, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. In addition, price and volume fluctuations in\nthe stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance.\nRisks Related to Human Capital\nThe loss of key personnel, difficulties with recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, or ineffectively managing changes in our workforce could\nadversely impact our business and financial results.\nMuch of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel and employees. The loss of any of our executive officers,\nincluding our chief executive officer or other key senior management personnel, could harm our business. Our success also depends substantially on the\ncontributions and abilities of our retail store employees upon whom we rely to give customers a superior in-store experience and elevate our brand.\nAccordingly, our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high-quality management personnel and other employees to work in and manage our\nstores, both domestically and internationally. Our ability to do so has been and may continue to be impacted by challenges in the labor market (which has\nexperienced, and may continue to experience, wage inflation and labor shortages), our position with respect to unions and the unionization of partners,\nincreased employee turnover, changes in availability of our workforce and a shift toward remote or hybrid work arrangements. Our ability to attract and retain\ncorporate, retail, and other personnel is also acutely impacted in certain international and domestic markets where the competition for a relatively small number\nof qualified\n21\nTable of Contents\nemployees is intense or in markets where large high-tech companies are able to offer more competitive salaries and benefits. These factors and others have also\nmade, and may continue to make, it more difficult to maintain an effective system of operational internal controls for a dispersed workforce, and to train\npartners to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience. Additionally, there is intense competition for qualified technology systems\ndevelopers, who are necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives, including increasing our digital relationships with\ncustomers. If we are unable to recruit, retain, and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth, our\nbusiness and financial performance may be adversely affected.\nChanges in the availability and cost of labor could adversely affect our business.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, which, in a retail business such as ours, are two of our\nmost significant costs, both domestically and internationally. Such increases could be triggered by state and federal legislation and regulatory actions regarding\nwages, scheduling, and benefits; increases in healthcare and workers’ compensation insurance costs; and increases in wages and costs of other benefits\nnecessary to attract and retain high-quality employees with the right skill sets. For example, at the federal level, effective July 1, 2024, the United States\nDepartment of Labor increased the minimum salary threshold requirements for employees who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act overtime\nrequirements, and at the state level, Assembly Bill 1228 increased minimum wage and established working hour and working condition standards for certain\npartners in California. These changes, along with others that may occur in the future, could have a significant impact on the classification of employees as\nbeing exempt from overtime and add to our labor costs. The growth of our business can make it increasingly difficult to locate and hire sufficient numbers of\nemployees, to maintain an effective system of operational internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise, and to train employees worldwide to deliver a\nconsistently high-quality product and customer experience; the failure to do so could materially harm our business and results of operations. Furthermore, we\nhave experienced, and could continue to experience, a shortage of labor for store positions, and the increased availability of alternative telecommuting\nemployment options by other employers could decrease the pool of available qualified talent for other key functions. In addition, our wages and benefits\nprograms may be insufficient to attract and retain the best talent.\nStarting in September 2021, Starbucks partners at a number of company-operated stores sought union representation through elections conducted by the\nNational Labor Relations Board. Unions have secured representation rights at hundreds of our more than 10,000 U.S. company-operated stores, with\npotentially more to follow, and Starbucks is engaged in collective bargaining for initial collective bargaining agreements for these stores. If we encounter\ndifficulties negotiating collective bargaining agreements, are unsuccessful in those efforts, or obtain contracts with unfavorable terms, then we could incur\nadditional costs, change our employee culture, decrease our flexibility, and increase our operational complexity. These risks could also present the potential to\ndisrupt our current operational model by affecting our ability to fully implement operational changes to enhance our efficiency and adapt to changing business\nneeds.\nThe law places limitations on unilateral actions taken with respect to employees who are represented by unions because, in certain circumstances, the law\nrequires the employer to notify and to bargain with the union prior to making certain operational or other changes that may affect employee wages, hours, or\nother terms and conditions of employment. Moreover, where a petition for representation has been filed by a union, the employer is also constrained from\nmaking changes in wages, hours, and working conditions. These limitations could also negatively affect our costs, change our employee culture, decrease our\nflexibility, and increase our operational complexity. They also present the potential to disrupt our current operational model by affecting our ability to fully\nimplement operational changes to enhance our efficiency and adapt to changing business needs.\nMoreover, we have experienced job actions in some company-operated stores. Such job actions and work stoppages have the potential to negatively impact our\noperations, third-party providers upon whom we rely to deliver product, our sales and customer flow in impacted locations, our costs, and can also have a\nnegative impact on our reputation and brand.\nAdditionally, our position with respect to unions and the unionization of partners could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and could have material\nadverse effects on our business, including on our financial results. These positions could also expose us to legal risk, causing us to incur costs to defend legal\nand regulatory actions, potential penalties and restrictions, and reputational harm.\nRisks Related to Competition\nWe face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability.\nThe specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, innovation, service, convenience (such as delivery service and\nmobile ordering), and price, and we face significant and increasing competition in all of these areas in each of our channels and markets. Accordingly, we do\nnot have leadership positions in all channels and markets. In the U.S., the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling\nhigh-quality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to Starbucks® stores and/or average value per transaction, adversely affecting\nour sales and results of operations. Similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors, or\n22\nTable of Contents\ncompetition from large new entrants or well-funded smaller companies, in our domestic and international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our\nsales and results of operations in those markets. Many small competitors also continue to open coffee specialty stores in many of our markets across the world,\nwhich in the aggregate may also lead to significant decreases of customer traffic to our stores in those markets. Increased competition globally in packaged\ncoffee and tea and single-serve and ready-to-drink coffee beverage markets, including from new and large entrants to this market, could adversely affect the\nprofitability of the Channel Development segment. In addition, not all of our competitors may seek to establish environmental or sustainability goals at a\ncomparable level to ours, which could result in lower supply chain or operating costs for our competitors. We may incur increased costs associated with\nreducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, reducing the use of plastic, or imposing performance obligations on our suppliers that could\nincrease financial obligations for us and our business partners and could affect our profitability. Additionally, if we are unable to respond to consumer demand\nfor healthy beverages and foods, or our competitors respond more effectively, this could have a negative effect on our business. We believe our ability to\ncompete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products; successfully develop and introduce new products;\nprice our products appropriately; deliver a satisfactory customer experience; manage our investments in store development, technology, digital engagement,\nand delivery; and respond effectively to our competitors’ actions or offerings or to unforeseen disruptive actions. There can be no assurance these strategies will\nbe effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving certain metrics while adversely affecting others, which could have the overall effect of harming\nour business. Furthermore, declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason, including due to consumer preference for other\nproducts, flattening demand for our products, changed customer daily routines or traffic to stores, or changed customer spending behaviors due to challenging\neconomic conditions, could have a negative effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Environmental, Social, and Governance Matters\nClimate change may have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. For example, as we noted above, the supply and price of coffee we\npurchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather and water supply quality and availability. These factors may be\ncaused by or exacerbated by climate change. Climate change may also result in decreased availability, less favorable pricing, or other adverse consequences for\nnon-coffee inputs in our products. In addition to impacts in producing countries, climate change may affect the availability of water in the markets in which we\noperate and expect to operate and elsewhere in our supply chain, which could have adverse impacts on our business. We operate in 87 markets globally. Our\nproperties and operations may be vulnerable to the various adverse effects of climate change, which are predicted to increase the frequency and severity of\nextreme weather events and other natural cycles such as wildfires and droughts. Such events have the potential to disrupt our operations, cause store closures,\ndisrupt the business of our third-party suppliers, and impact our customers and partners, all of which may cause us to suffer losses and incur additional costs to\nmaintain or resume operations.\nOur business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations, including with respect to environmental,\nsocial, and governance matters, that could expose us to numerous risks.\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of regulators and organizations, including the SEC, the European Union, the Nasdaq\nStock Market, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity, and many new\nrequirements have been created in response to laws enacted by Congress and state legislatures, which in certain cases may be inconsistent with one another,\nmaking compliance more difficult and uncertain. In addition, regulators, customers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders are focusing on\nenvironmental, social, and governance (commonly referred to as “ESG”) matters and related disclosures and operational regulations. These changing rules,\nregulations, and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased\nmanagement time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. For example, developing and acting on initiatives within\nthe scope of ESG, and collecting, measuring, and reporting ESG-related information and metrics can be costly, difficult, and time consuming and is subject to\nevolving reporting standards, including the SEC’s climate-related reporting requirements and similar proposals by other international regulatory bodies. For\nexample, the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”), with different implementation dates depending on company size and\ngeographic location, has established extensive ESG-related disclosure requirements based on the European Sustainability Reporting Standards, including\ncertain assurance obligations. The standards used to identify and collect the information and data required pursuant to the CSRD are still developing and\nuncertain, and this lack of certainty could result in increased costs related to complying with our reporting obligations under the CSRD and could increase the\nrisk of failing to comply with the CSRD.\nWe may also communicate certain initiatives and goals related to environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing, social investments, and other ESG-\nrelated matters in our SEC filings or in other public disclosures. These initiatives and goals within the scope of ESG could be difficult and expensive to\nimplement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost\n23\nTable of Contents\neffective and may not advance at a sufficient pace, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of the disclosure. Further, statements\nabout our ESG-related initiatives and goals, and progress toward those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing,\ninternal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. Previously reported data may in the future be\nadjusted to reflect improvements in the availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our operations,\nand other changes in circumstances. If our ESG-related data, processes, and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, our reputation, business, financial\nperformance, and growth could be adversely affected. If we are unable to meet our ESG-related goals, commitments, initiatives, or evolving stakeholder or\nindustry expectations and standards, if we change or are perceived to have changed our goals, commitments, or initiatives, or if we are perceived to have not\nresponded appropriately to stakeholder interests in ESG issues, customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products\nfrom another company or a competitor, and our reputation, business, or financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we could be criticized by shareholders, stakeholders, regulators, or other interested parties for the scope or nature of our ESG initiatives or goals or\nfor any revisions to these goals. We have been and could continue to be subject to negative responses by governmental actors (such as anti-ESG legislation or\nretaliatory legislative treatment) or consumers (such as boycotts or negative publicity campaigns) targeting Starbucks, which could adversely affect our\nreputation, business, financial performance, and growth.\nCertain activist shareholder actions have caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur expense, hinder execution of our business strategy, and\nadversely impact our stock price.\nWe actively engage in discussions with our shareholders regarding further strengthening our Company and creating long-term shareholder value. This ongoing\ndialogue can include certain divisive activist tactics, which can take many forms. Some shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, has resulted\nin, and could in the future result in, substantial costs, such as legal fees and expenses, and the diversion of management’s and our Board’s attention and\nresources from our businesses and strategic plans. Additionally, public shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future,\nadversely affect our relationships with our customers, partners, licensees, or business partners, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel,\nand cause our stock price to fluctuate based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying\nfundamentals and prospects of our business. Activists or other shareholders holding a large portion of our outstanding shares will also have the ability to exert a\nsubstantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, including the election of directors, the approval of mergers, acquisitions, and other significant\nbusiness transactions, shareholder proposals, and amendments to our governing documents. These risks could adversely affect our business and operating\nresults.\nRisks Related to Regulation and Litigation\nFailure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results.\nOur policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, tax rules, and other regulations and\nrequirements, including those imposed by the SEC, Nasdaq, and foreign countries, as well as applicable trade, labor, healthcare, food and beverage, sanitation,\nsafety, environmental, labeling, anti-bribery and corruption, and merchandise laws. Such laws and regulations are complex and often subject to differing\ninterpretations, which can lead to unintentional or unknown instances of non-compliance. For example, changes in the enforcement priorities of regulators may\nalso shift the impact of applicable regulations on the business and the costs necessary to ensure compliance therewith, including through an expansion in the\nnature, scope, or complexity of matters on which we are required to report. Changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, including expanded or\nadditional regulations and associated costs to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, to discourage the use of plastic, or to limit or impose\nadditional costs on commercial water use, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, incremental investments, and other financial\nobligations for us and our business partners, which could affect our profitability. Other examples of emerging and potentially relevant requirements are import\ntariffs and restrictions grounded in, among other things, alleged human rights abuses.\nIn addition, our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection, and\ncompanies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters. The Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are also\ninterpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. The interpretation\nand application of existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux, and authorities around the world are considering a\nnumber of additional legislative and regulatory proposals in this area. Current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations (including the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, discussed in more detail in this risk factors section, and other applicable\ninternational and U.S. privacy laws), or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may limit our ability to collect and use data, require us to\notherwise modify our data processing practices and policies, or result in the possibility of fines, litigation, or orders, which may have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness and\n24\nTable of Contents\nresults of operations. The burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretations of existing and future laws and\nregulations, may also require us to incur substantial costs in reaching compliance in a manner adverse to our business.\nCertain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution, or sale\nof some of our products, particularly our beverages, as a result of ingredients contained in our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all\nbeverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a\nsingle tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain amount of added sugar (or other sweetener), some apply a progressive tax rate depending\nupon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage, and others apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing any amount of added sugar (or\nother sweetener). For example, in the Netherlands, a consumption tax is applicable on cold non-alcoholic beverages (non-milk based) at a flat tax rate of 26.13\nEuro per 100 Liters. In addition to the taxes on the beverages (or components thereof), we also notice a regional increase in the adoption of environmentally\nfocused taxes, including, for example, plastic packaging tax to encourage companies to increase usage of sustainable packaging options.\nThese tax measures, whatever their scope or form, have adversely impacted, and could continue to impact our business and financial performance by increasing\nthe cost of certain of our products, reducing overall consumption of our products, or leading to negative publicity.\nFinally, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has released guidance establishing a 15% global minimum tax applied on a country-by-\ncountry basis for multinational entities under Pillar Two of its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting initiative. As of September 29, 2024, certain countries in which\nwe operate have enacted legislation to adopt Pillar Two effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2023, and other countries in which we\noperate are expected to introduce similar legislation to implement Pillar Two. This global minimum tax will not be effective for the Company until fiscal 2025,\nand it is not expected to result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. We will continue to monitor regulatory developments with respect\nto this initiative for potential impacts.\nThe complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related costs of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal\nand regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels, and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic\nlaws. In addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and\nregulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal\nliability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance, and restatements of our financial statements, all of which could have an adverse\nimpact on our business and financial results.\nWe have been, and could continue to be, party to litigation or other legal proceedings that could adversely affect our business, results, operations, and\nreputation.\nWe have been, and in the future may be, subject to litigation and other legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business. These legal proceedings may\ninvolve claims brought by store partners, customers, government agencies, suppliers, shareholders, or others through private actions, administrative\nproceedings, regulatory actions, or other litigation, including litigation on a class or collective basis on behalf of what can be a large group of potential\nclaimants. These legal proceedings have involved, and in the future may involve, allegations of illegal, unfair, or inconsistent employment practices, including\nthose governing wage and hour, employment of minors, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, and vacation and family leave laws; food-safety\nissues including food-borne illness, food contamination, and adverse health effects from consumption of our food products; data security or privacy breaches;\ncustomer discrimination; personal injury in our stores; marketing and advertising claims, including claims that our environmental and social program claims\nare misleading or inaccurate; infringement of patent, copyright, or other intellectual property rights; violation of the federal securities laws; workers’\ncompensation; or other concerns. We are party to a number of pending lawsuits and governmental audits alleging violations of federal and state employment\nlaws, including wage and hour claims, and we could be involved in similar or even more significant litigation and legal proceedings in the future. Even if the\nallegations against us in current or future legal matters are unfounded or we ultimately are held not liable, the costs to defend ourselves may be significant, and\nthe litigation may subject us to substantial settlements, fines, penalties, or judgments against us and may divert management’s attention away from operating\nour business, all of which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Litigation also may generate negative publicity, regardless\nof whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are not liable, which could damage our reputation and adversely impact our sales as well as our\nrelationships with our store partners and customers. See Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8\nof Part II of this 10-K for information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved.\n25\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy\nFailure to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain privacy and data protection laws and regulations may result in substantial negative financial\nconsequences, reputational harm, and civil or criminal penalties.\nComplex local, state, national, foreign, and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other\nprocessing of personal data. These privacy and data protection laws and regulations are quickly evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed\nand implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations and increased enforcement and litigation. In addition,\nour legal and regulatory obligations are subject to unexpected changes, including the potential for regulatory or other governmental entities to enact new or\nadditional laws or regulations, to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations, or to increase penalties significantly. Complying with these laws and\nregulations can be costly and can impede the development and offering of new products and services.\nFor example, Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation (which implements the GDPR into\nU.K. law), impose stringent data protection requirements and provide for significant penalties for noncompliance. In China, the Personal Information\nProtection Law (“PIPL”) has established personal information processing rules, data subject rights, and obligations for personal information processors, among\nother things. In addition to the PIPL, China’s Data Security Law regulates data processing activities associated with personal and non-personal data.\nNoncompliance with these laws may result in significant civil and criminal penalties. Other newly enacted and proposed privacy and data protection laws in\nother jurisdictions served by Starbucks and its licensees may impose similar requirements, including restrictions on cross-border data transfers and stringent\nsafeguards on personal and non-personal data. Such laws may impact our business operations and increase the cost and expense of compliance.\nIn the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires, among other things, covered companies to provide new disclosures to California\nconsumers and allows such consumers to exercise certain rights in connection with their personal information, such as the right to opt-out of certain sales of\npersonal information. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data\nbreach litigation. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act, which became effective in January 2023, significantly modified the CCPA to include additional\ncompliance obligations. Since the CCPA was first passed, 19 other states have enacted similar data privacy legislation, eight of which are in effect as of the end\nof 2024. In addition, a number of other states have passed or are considering additional privacy laws, including laws on health data and biometric data that are\nin effect, or are expected to take effect in the near future. These state privacy laws will require us to incur additional costs and expenses in our efforts to\ncomply.\nPrivacy and data protection laws, such as those referenced above, may impact Starbucks operations and new business models, such as Starbucks Digital\nSolutions, which rely on Starbucks functioning as controller of customer personal information in licensed markets. As such, Starbucks may be primarily\nresponsible for compliance with privacy and data protection laws in the markets served by participating licensees.\nOur failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data, or to protect personal data\nfrom unauthorized access, use, or other processing, could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, claims for damages by\ncustomers and other affected individuals or parties, or fines and damage to our brand reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our\noperations, financial performance, and business. The amount and scope of insurance we maintain may not cover all types of claims that may arise.\nThe unauthorized access, use, theft, or destruction of customer or employee data (personal, financial, or other), or of Starbucks proprietary or confidential\ninformation that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf, could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential\nliability and loss of revenues.\nMany of our information technology systems (whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers), including those used for our point-of-sale, web and\nmobile platforms, online and mobile payment systems, delivery services, rewards programs, and administrative functions, contain personal, financial, or other\ninformation that is entrusted to us by our customers, business partners, and employees. Many of our information technology systems also contain Starbucks\nproprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans and product development initiatives and designs, and confidential\ninformation about third parties, such as licensees and business partners. Similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand, we\nhave in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, cyber-attacks, including phishing, and other attempts to breach, or gain unauthorized\naccess to, our systems and databases. To date, these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations, but we cannot provide assurance that they will\nnot have an impact in the future. Our third-party providers’ and business partners’ information technology systems and databases are likewise subject to such\nrisks. The number and frequency of these attempts varies from year to year and increases as the scale and scope of our technology footprint and digital\noperations increases. In addition, to conduct our business, we provide customer and employee data, as well as Starbucks proprietary information and other\nconfidential information important to our business, to third parties, including licensees and business partners. Individuals performing work for Starbucks and\nsuch third parties also may access\n26\nTable of Contents\nsome of this data, including on personally-owned digital devices. To the extent we, a third party, or such an individual were to experience a breach of our or\ntheir information technology systems that results in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of customers’ or employees’ data or\nconfidential information of the Company stored in or transmitted through such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods,\nit could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand, a decrease in our ability to retain customers or\nattract new ones, the imposition of potentially significant costs (including loss of data or payment for recovery of data) and liabilities, loss of business, loss of\nbusiness partners and licensees, and the disruption to our supply chain, business, and plans. Unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction, or other compromises\nare becoming increasingly sophisticated and may occur through a variety of methods, including attacks using malicious code, vulnerabilities in software,\nhardware, or other infrastructure (including systems used by our supply chain), system misconfigurations, phishing, deepfakes, ransomware, malware, or social\nengineering. The rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks. Our logging capabilities,\nor the logging capabilities of third parties, are not always complete or sufficiently granular, affecting our ability to fully understand the scope of security\nbreaches.\nSuch security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy, cyber, and other laws or trigger data breach notification\nlaws, including new disclosure rules promulgated by the SEC, and subject us to private consumer, business partner or licensee, or securities litigation and\ngovernmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. These risks also exist in acquired\nbusinesses, joint ventures, or companies we invest in or partner with that use separate information systems or that have not yet been fully integrated into our\ninformation systems.\nSignificant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to investigate security incidents, remedy cybersecurity problems, recuperate lost\ndata, prevent future compromises, and adapt systems and practices to react to the changing threat environment. These include costs associated with notifying\naffected individuals and other agencies, additional security technologies, trainings, personnel, experts, and credit monitoring services for those whose data has\nbeen breached. These costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred, including by\ninterfering with the pursuit of other important business strategies and initiatives, and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our\ninformation technology systems.\nMedia or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems, or those of our third-party business partners or service providers, can\nalso adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business. Additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-\nattacks and compromise information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized\nuntil such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. The rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies by\nattackers amplifies these concerns. We continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services, and personnel to develop and implement\nsystems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but\nthese security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.\nWe rely heavily on information technology in our operations and growth initiatives, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption, or security failure\nof that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations for numerous purposes, including for administrative functions, point-of-sale\nprocessing and payment in our stores and online, management of our supply chain, Starbucks Cards, online business, delivery services, mobile technology\n(including mobile payments and ordering apps), reloads and loyalty functionality, and various other processes and transactions (including providing Starbucks\nDigital Solutions to participating licensees), and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality. Many of our non-store\nemployees continue to work on a remote or hybrid basis, which has resulted in increased demand on our information technology infrastructure. Additionally,\nthe success of several of our initiatives to drive growth, including our ability to increase digital relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and\nspend, is highly dependent on our technology systems. Furthermore, we continue to expand convenience-led formats, which depend heavily on our mobile\nordering capabilities. Any failure, inadequacy, or interruption of these systems could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could\nadversely affect our financial results. In addition, the technologies and artificial intelligence tools we are incorporating into certain aspects of our operations\nmay not generate the intended efficiencies and may impact our business results.\nWe also rely on third-party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support. Our systems hardware, software, and\nservices provided by third-party service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets. Our contractual and operational safeguards\nmay not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available. Such failures may be caused by various\nfactors, including power outages, climate change-related impacts, catastrophic events, physical theft, computer and network failures, inadequate or ineffective\nredundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or\n27\nTable of Contents\nservices, errors or improper use by our employees or third-party service providers, or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms, including through\ncyber-attacks such as those that result in the blockage of our or our third-party business partners’ or service providers’ systems and platforms and those\ndiscussed in more detail in this risk factors section. If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an\neffective and timely manner, they could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and\nsales, the efficiency of our operations, and our financial results. In addition, remediation of any problems with our systems and related customer support could\nresult in significant, unplanned expenses.\nGiven the increasing complexity and sophistication of techniques used by bad actors to obtain unauthorized access to or disable information technology\nsystems, and the fact that cyber-attacks are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives, it is increasingly difficult to\nanticipate and defend against cyber-attacks, and a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected. Moreover, the\nextent of a particular cyber incident and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the incident may not be immediately clear, and it may take a\nsignificant amount of time before such investigation can be finalized and completed and reliable information about the incident is known. During the pendency\nof any such investigation, we may not know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and we may be required to disclose incidents before their full\nextent is known.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property or ensure that we are not infringing on the intellectual property of others could harm the value of\nour brand and our business.\nOur brand names, trademarks, and related intellectual property rights are critical assets, and our success depends on our continued ability to use our existing\ntrademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We\nrely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents, and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded\nproducts.\nWe have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we\ncurrently use have not been registered in all of the markets outside of the U.S. in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be\nregistered in all of these markets. It may be costly and time consuming to protect our intellectual property, particularly in rapidly evolving areas, and the steps\nwe have taken to protect our intellectual property in the U.S. and foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not\nadequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. Any claim of\ninfringement, whether or not it has merit, could, particularly in rapidly evolving areas, be time-consuming or result in costly litigation and could have an\nadverse impact on our business. In addition, we cannot ensure that licensees and other third parties who hold licenses to our intellectual property will not take\nactions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nStarbucks has implemented a cybersecurity program that leverages industry-standard cybersecurity frameworks to assess, identify, and manage cybersecurity\nrisk. Our cybersecurity program is integrated with the Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) framework and governance processes utilized by management\nand our Board to oversee our various top enterprise risks. Our internal audit function periodically evaluates our cybersecurity program and selected aspects of\nit.\nWe have implemented various processes and tools to identify cybersecurity threats, detect potential attacks, and protect our data and information technology.\nWe periodically evaluate evolving cybersecurity risks and legal and compliance requirements, and we make ongoing strategic investments to address those\nevolving risks and requirements.\nStarbucks assesses, measures, and reports on cybersecurity risk at operational, program or management, and strategic or executive oversight levels. We\nmaintain and periodically update written cybersecurity policies, standards, and controls, which are reviewed by a cross-functional management-level committee\nand designed to align with business objectives, regulatory requirements, and industry best practices. We train our employees through annual cybersecurity\nawareness training, phishing simulations, and periodic communications about timely cybersecurity topics and threats. We also implement a variety of tools to\nmonitor our systems and network activity, and we conduct various simulated attacks and penetration tests to assess the effectiveness of these tools.\n28\nTable of Contents\nWe maintain an incident response plan that guides us in identifying, evaluating, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents. The plan provides\nfor the creation of a cross-functional, tailored incident response team, led by dedicated incident responders, that may include both Company personnel and\nthird-party service providers, as appropriate. The incident response plan includes incident classification and escalation protocols, as well as processes to assess\nand comply with applicable legal obligations. We periodically test the effectiveness of the plan, and review and update it as appropriate.\nWe also maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to help us mitigate certain costs associated with cybersecurity\nincidents.\nWe engage third-party security experts, as appropriate, to support our processes for assessing, identifying, and managing cybersecurity risks, including, for\nexample, periodic evaluations of our cybersecurity program from a design and effectiveness perspective, penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, employee\nawareness training, phishing simulations, and incident monitoring and response.\nTo address cybersecurity risk arising from our relationships with our third-party business partners and service providers, we maintain a third-party risk\nmanagement program, which takes a risk-based approach and includes elements such as conducting cybersecurity assessments, including cybersecurity-related\nobligations in agreements, and utilizing external monitoring sources.\nIn addition, we maintain a global privacy program to identify, assess, and manage privacy risks related to how we are collecting, using, sharing, storing, and\notherwise processing personal data.\nAs of the date of this filing, we have not identified any cybersecurity threats or incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially\naffect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, there can be no assurance that we, or our third-party business partners or\nservice providers, will not experience a cybersecurity threat or incident in the future that could materially adversely affect our business strategy, results of\noperations, or financial condition. For further discussion of the risks related to cybersecurity, see the risk factors discussed under “Risks Related to\nCybersecurity and Data Privacy” in our Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nGovernance\nOur cybersecurity program is led by our senior vice president, chief information security officer (“ciso”), who is responsible for identifying, assessing, and\nmanaging our collective information security and technology risks. Our ciso has more than 20 years of experience in the information security and technology\nfields. The ciso reports to our executive vice president, chief technology officer, who has spent more than 25 years of service in various leadership roles in\ninformation technology across multiple Fortune 500 companies.\nThe ciso is informed about the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through management of, and participation in, the\ncybersecurity program described above, including through reports prepared by our internal cybersecurity team and the operation of our incident response plan.\nThe ciso meets regularly with leaders of our various information technology management teams and with the Risk Management Committee (a management-\nlevel committee, which is co-managed by our cfo and chief legal officer), to review and discuss our cybersecurity and other information technology risks and\nopportunities.\nOur Board has ultimate cybersecurity and data privacy risk oversight responsibility for the Company and administers this responsibility both directly and with\nassistance from the Audit and Compliance Committee (“Audit Committee”) and the Environmental, Partner, and Community Impact Committee (the “Impact\nCommittee”). The Audit Committee oversees our cybersecurity and technology risks, and the Impact Committee oversees our data privacy risks, all of which\nare integrated into our overall ERM program. The Audit Committee actively reviews and discusses our cybersecurity and technology risk management\nprograms and regularly reports out to the full Board on our relevant strengths and opportunities. The Impact Committee reviews our data privacy risk\nmanagement programs and reports out to the full Board on our relevant strengths and opportunities.\nThe Audit Committee receives quarterly updates from the ciso or other members of the ciso’s team with responsibility for oversight of our key cybersecurity\nprogram components. These updates include, as appropriate, ongoing changes in our external and internal cybersecurity threat landscape, new technology\ntrends and regulatory developments, evolving internal policies and practices used to manage and mitigate cybersecurity and technology-related risks,\ncybersecurity incidents and our response to them, and trends in various metrics that are used to help assess our overall cybersecurity program effectiveness. The\nImpact Committee receives annual updates from our vice president, data privacy, on our data privacy practices, emerging risks, and evolving global privacy\nlaws and regulations.\n29\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto\nincluded elsewhere in this 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Readers are\ncautioned that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including those identified\nabove, under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this 10-K, and elsewhere herein. Therefore, our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the\nforward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason. Please also see the cautionary\nlanguage at the beginning of Part I of this 10-K regarding forward-looking statements.\nGeneral\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related\nstore closures, unless otherwise noted. Fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 included 52 weeks.\nThe discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022, included in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) can be found in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 1,\n2023.\nOverview\nWe have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China,\nJapan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Unallocated corporate expenses are reported\nwithin Corporate and Other.\nWe believe our financial results and long-term growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings, comparable store sales, and operating margin\nmanagement, underpinned by disciplined capital allocation. We believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these\nmetrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Throughout this MD&A, we commonly discuss\nthe following key operating metrics:\n• New store openings and store count\n• Comparable store sales\n• Operating margin\nStarbucks results for fiscal 2024 reflect a challenging operating environment, notably driven by reduced customer traffic compared to fiscal 2023, that\npressured our financial results. Consolidated net revenues increased 1% to $36.2 billion in fiscal 2024 compared to $36.0 billion in fiscal 2023, primarily\ndriven by incremental revenues from net new company-operated stores over the past 12 months, partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales and the\nimpact of unfavorable foreign currency translation.\nFor both the North America segment and U.S. market, revenue increased 2% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, primarily driven by net new company-\noperated store growth over the past 12 months and higher product and equipment sales to, and royalty revenues from, our licensees. This growth was partially\noffset by a 2% decline in comparable store sales. Comparable transactions for both the North America segment and the U.S. market declined 5%, partially\noffset by average ticket growth for both the North America segment and the U.S. market of 4%, primarily driven by annualization of pricing.\nFor the International segment, revenue declined 2% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, primarily driven by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency\ntranslation, a 4% decline in comparable store sales driven by a decline in average ticket of 4%, and lower product and equipment sales to, and royalty revenues\nfrom, our licensees. These decreases were partially offset by net new company-operated and licensed store openings over the past 12 months.\nRevenue for our Channel Development segment decreased 7% in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023, primarily driven by a decline in revenue in the Global\nCoffee Alliance following the sale of our Seattle’s Best Coffee brand to Nestlé in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as well as product SKU optimization.\nOur performance was lower-than-expected as a result of a pronounced customer traffic decline, reflecting our targeted and accelerated investments not\nimproving customer behaviors as intended, as well as the macroeconomic and competitive environment in China that further pressured our results. Given these\nchallenges, under the direction of our new chief executive officer, Brian Niccol, we are changing our business strategy to bring customers back to our stores\nand return to growth. Our “Back to Starbucks” strategy includes supporting our green apron partners, enhancing the customer experience, reestablishing\nourselves as the community coffee house, and innovating the coffee tasting experience through product development, marketing, and in-store experience. This\nstrategic reset will provide us with the opportunity to assess the business and refocus\n34\nTable of Contents\nour efforts, including capital allocation priorities, efficiency efforts, and store growth initiatives. We remain confident in the strength of our brand and believe\nthat the new action plans will position the Company for sustainable long-term growth.\n35\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Highlights\n• Total net revenues increased 1% to $36.2 billion in fiscal 2024 compared to $36.0 billion in fiscal 2023.\n• Consolidated operating income decreased to $5.4 billion in fiscal 2024 compared to $5.9 billion in fiscal 2023. Fiscal 2024 operating margin was\n15.0% compared to 16.3% in fiscal 2023. Operating margin contraction of 130 basis points was primarily due to investments in store partner wages and\nbenefits (approximately 140 basis points), deleverage (approximately 130 basis points), and increased promotional activity (approximately 100 basis\npoints). These decreases were partially offset by pricing (approximately 180 basis points) and in-store operational efficiencies (approximately 130 basis\npoints).\n• Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) for fiscal 2024 decreased to $3.31, compared to EPS of $3.58 in fiscal 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by\ncontraction in operating margin as compared to the prior year.\n• Capital expenditures were $2.8 billion in fiscal 2024 and $2.3 billion in fiscal 2023.\n• We returned $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively, through dividends and share repurchases.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nSee Note 2, Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for information\nregarding acquisitions and divestitures.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2024 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2023\nConsolidated results of operations (in millions):\nRevenues\nSep 29, Oct 1, %\nFiscal Year Ended 2024 2023 Change\nNet revenues:\nCompany-operated stores $ 29,765.9 $ 29,462.3 1.0 %\nLicensed stores 4,505.1 4,512.7 (0.2)\nOther 1,905.2 2,000.6 (4.8)\nTotal net revenues $ 36,176.2 $ 35,975.6 0.6 %\nTotal net revenues increased $201 million, or 1%, over fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher revenues from company-operated stores ($304 million). The growth\nin company-operated store revenue was driven by incremental revenues from 1,426 net new company-operated stores, or a 7% increase, over the past 12\nmonths ($1.2 billion). Partially offsetting this increase were a 2% decrease in comparable store sales ($629 million), attributable to a 4% decrease in\ncomparable transactions, partially offset by a 2% increase in average ticket, primarily due to annualization of pricing, and unfavorable foreign currency\ntranslation impacts ($235 million).\nLicensed stores revenue decreased $8 million, primarily driven by lower product and equipment sales to, and royalty revenues from, our licensees in our\nInternational segment ($69 million) and unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts ($27 million), partially offset by higher product and equipment sales\nto, and royalty revenues from, our licensees in our North America segment ($80 million).\nOther revenues decreased $95 million, primarily due to a decline in revenue in the Global Coffee Alliance ($125 million) following the sale of our Seattle’s\nBest Coffee brand to Nestlé in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as well as product SKU optimization.\n36\nTable of Contents\nOperating Expenses\nSep 29, Oct 1, Sep 29, Oct 1,\nFiscal Year Ended 2024 2023 2024 2023\nAs a % of Total\nNet Revenues\nProduct and distribution costs $ 11,180.6 $ 11,409.1 30.9 % 31.7 %\nStore operating expenses 15,286.5 14,720.3 42.3 40.9\nOther operating expenses 565.6 539.4 1.6 1.5\nDepreciation and amortization expenses 1,512.6 1,362.6 4.2 3.8\nGeneral and administrative expenses 2,523.3 2,441.3 7.0 6.8\nRestructuring and impairments — 21.8 — 0.1\nTotal operating expenses 31,068.6 30,494.5 85.9 84.8\nIncome from equity investees 301.2 298.4 0.8 0.8\nGain from sale of assets — 91.3 — 0.3\nOperating income $ 5,408.8 $ 5,870.8 15.0 % 16.3 %\nStore operating expenses as a % of related\nrevenues 51.4 % 50.0 %\nProduct and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 80 basis points, primarily due to the impact of increased sales from pricing\n(approximately 70 basis points) and a reduction in supply chain costs (approximately 60 basis points).\nStore operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 140 basis points.

Also contributing to the decline in international total\nnet revenues were lower product and equipment sales to, and royalty revenues from, our licensees ($69 million), largely driven by continued disruptions due to\nmultiple international conflicts, partially offset by the performance of 654 net new licensed store openings over the past 12 months.

We actively manage our cash and\ninvestments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, fund acquisitions, and return cash\nto shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-\nsale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign), and commercial paper as well as principal-protected\nstructured deposits. As of September 29, 2024, approximately $2.1 billion of cash and short-term investments were held in foreign subsidiaries.\nBorrowing Capacity\nCredit Facilities and Commercial Paper\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOur $3.0 billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the “2021 credit facility”), of which $150.0 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit,\nis currently set to mature on September 16, 2026. The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes,\nincluding acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum\ncommitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion.\nBorrowings under the 2021 credit facility, which was most recently amended in April 2023, will bear interest at a variable rate based on Term SOFR, and, for\nU.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The\napplicable margin is based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings assigned by the Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies. The “Base Rate” is the\nhighest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility) plus 0.500%, (ii) Bank of America’s prime rate, and (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.000%.\nTerm SOFR means the forward-looking SOFR term rate administrated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plus a SOFR Adjustment of 0.100%.\nThe 2021 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio,\nwhich measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of September 29, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were\noutstanding under our 2021 credit facility as of September 29, 2024, or October 1, 2023.\n42\nTable of Contents\nOur total available contractual borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes was $3.0 billion as of the end of fiscal 2024.\nCommercial Paper\nUnder our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0\nbillion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are\nrequired to be backstopped by available commitments under our 2021 credit facility. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may\nbe used for working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash\ndividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial\npaper program.\nCredit Facilities in Japan\nAdditionally, we hold the following Japanese yen-denominated credit facilities that are available for working capital needs and capital expenditures within our\nJapanese market:\n• A ¥5.0 billion, or $34.5 million, credit facility is currently set to mature on December 30, 2024. Borrowings under this credit facility are subject to\nterms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (“TIBOR”) plus an applicable margin\nof 0.400%.\n• A ¥10.0 billion, or $69.1 million, credit facility is currently set to mature on March 27, 2025. Borrowings under this credit facility are subject to terms\ndefined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus an applicable margin of 0.300%.\nAs of September 29, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. As of October 1, 2023, we had ¥5.0 billion, or $33.5 million, of\nborrowings outstanding under these credit facilities.\nSee Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt.\nOur ability to incur new liens and conduct sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties is subject to compliance with terms of the indentures\nunder which the long-term notes were issued. As of September 29, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.\nUse of Cash\nWe expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial\npaper program, and the issuance of debt to support and invest in our core businesses, including investing in new ways to serve our customers and supporting\nour store partners, repaying maturing debts, returning cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and discretionary share repurchases,\nand investing in new business opportunities related to our core and developing businesses. Furthermore, we may use our available cash resources to make\nproportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business.\nAcquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation\nand fit with our ownership strategy.\nWe believe that net future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally, combined with our\nability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt, will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as\nshareholder distributions for at least the next 12 months. We are currently not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events, or uncertainties that will\nresult in, or that are reasonably likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way that will impact our capital needs during or beyond\nthe next 12 months. We have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings\nwould result in increased interest expense in the future. In this regard, we may incur additional debt, within targeted levels, as part of our plans to fund our\ncapital programs, including cash returns to shareholders through future dividends and discretionary share repurchases, refinancing debt maturities, as well as\ninvesting in new business opportunities. If necessary, we may pursue additional sources of financing, including both short-term and long-term borrowings and\ndebt issuances.\nWe regularly review our cash positions and our determination of partial indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. In the event we determine that all or\nanother portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes, which could be\nmaterial. Any foreign earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated at management’s discretion. During fiscal 2024, we paid approximately\n$18 million for foreign withholding taxes related to repatriating the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. See Note 14, Income Taxes, to the consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion.\n43\nTable of Contents\nDuring each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.53 per share. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023,\nand for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, we declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we declared a\ncash dividend of $0.61 per share to be paid on November 29, 2024, with an expected payout of approximately $691.4 million. Dividends are generally paid in\nthe quarter following the declaration date. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2024 and 2023 totaled $2.6 billion and $2.4 billion,\nrespectively.\nDuring the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023, we repurchased 10.0 million shares of common stock for $1.0 billion on the open market. During the fiscal year\nended September 29, 2024, we repurchased 12.8 million shares of common stock for $1.3 billion on the open market. As of September 29, 2024, 29.8 million\nshares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations.\nOther than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2025 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new\nand existing stores, our supply chain, and corporate facilities. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 are expected to be reasonably consistent with fiscal\n2024.\nThe following table summarizes current and long-term material cash requirements as of September 29, 2024, which we expect to fund primarily with operating\ncash flows (in millions):\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nLess than 1 1 - 3 3 - 5 More than\nTotal Year Years Years 5 Years\nOperating lease obligations(1) $ 11,942.3 $ 1,808.5 $ 3,202.2 $ 2,433.1 $ 4,498.5\nDebt obligations\nPrincipal payments 15,700.0 1,250.0 3,000.0 2,350.0 9,100.0\nInterest payments 6,359.4 588.3 968.9 798.6 4,003.6\nPurchase obligations(2) 1,296.0 1,010.0 245.9 40.1 —\nOther obligations(3) 350.8 116.3 101.0 37.3 96.2\nTotal $ 35,648.5 $ 4,773.1 $ 7,518.0 $ 5,659.1 $ 17,698.3\n(1) Amounts include direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance, and other related expenses.\n(2) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all\nsignificant terms. Green coffee purchase commitments comprise 86% of total purchase obligations.\n(3) Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of long-term asset retirement obligations, income taxes payable, equity\ninvestment capital commitments, and finance lease obligations.\nCash Flows\nCash provided by operating activities was $6.1 billion for fiscal 2024, compared to $6.0 billion for fiscal 2023. The change was primarily due to an increase in\nnet cash provided by changes in other operating assets and liabilities, primarily driven by net hedging activity, largely related to our coffee hedging program.\nSee Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion. Also\ncontributing were the change in operating lease liability driven by the timing of cash payment for rent, an increase in depreciation and amortization driven by\ncapital additions, and higher distributions received from our North America Coffee Partnership. These increases were partially offset by lower net earnings\nduring the period and higher inventory purchase costs, primarily driven by increased coffee commodity prices.\nCash used in investing activities was $2.7 billion for fiscal 2024, compared to $2.3 billion for fiscal 2023. The change was primarily due to increased capital\nexpenditures, driven by higher existing and new store investments in North America, and lapping the proceeds from the prior year sale of Seattle’s Best Coffee\nbrand to Nestlé. These increases were partially offset by higher maturities and calls of investments, driven by maturities of structured deposits.\nCash used in financing activities was $3.7 billion for fiscal 2024, compared to $3.0 billion for fiscal 2023. The change was primarily due to an increase in\nrepayments of debt and an increase in cash returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds\nfrom issuances of debt.\n44\nTable of Contents\nCOMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY, AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS\nCommodity price risk represents our primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase,\nroast, and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products, and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase\nsignificant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impact our\nresults of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in\nItem 1 of Part I of this 10-K, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I this 10-K.\nFINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices, and interest rates. We\nmanage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified\nand evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging\ninstruments may be used to mitigate risk. Risk limits are set annually, and speculative trading activities are prohibited. We also monitor and limit the amount of\nassociated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. We use interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to primarily hedge against changes in\nbenchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. We also use cross-currency swaps to hedge against changes in the fair value of our net\ninvestments in foreign operations. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments and cross currency swaps, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities\nin excess of three years. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, and Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the\nconsolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our hedging instruments.\nThe sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact\nof the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar, and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to\nprice fluctuations that impact our financial results. We use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-\nto-be-fixed contracts and financial derivatives, to manage our commodity price risk exposure.\nThe following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 29, 2024, to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from\nchanges in commodity prices. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the\nunderlying hedged items (in millions):\nIncrease/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI\n10% Increase in 10% Decrease in 10% Increase in 10% Decrease in\nUnderlying Rate Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Underlying Rate\nCommodity hedges $ 2 $ (2) $ 21 $ (21)\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nThe majority of our revenue, expense, and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, because a portion of our operations consists of\nactivities outside of the U.S., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, South\nKorean won, and euro. To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows\nof anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing, and lending activities, and certain other transactions in\ncurrencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. The\nvolatility in the foreign exchange market may lead to significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates and adversely impact our financial results in the\ncase of weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\n45\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 29, 2024, to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes\nin the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates. The information\nprovided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions):\nIncrease/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI\n10% Increase in 10% Decrease in 10% Increase in 10% Decrease in\nUnderlying Rate Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Underlying Rate\nForeign currency hedges $ 24 $ (24) $ 489 $ (489)\nEquity Security Price Risk\nWe have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds within our marketable equity securities portfolio.\nMarketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan\n(“MDCP”). Gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings.\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of September 29, 2024, and determined that\nsuch a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.\nInterest Rate Risk\nLong-term Debt\nWe utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as\nwell as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. See Note 3, Derivative Financial\nInstruments and Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our interest rate hedge\nagreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of September 29, 2024.\nThe following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of September 29, 2024, on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions):\nDecrease in Fair Value for a 100 Basis Point Increase in\nFair Value Underlying Rate\nLong-term debt(1) $ 14,647 $ (943)\n(1) Amount disclosed is net of $15 million change in the fair value of our designated interest rate swaps. Refer to Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments,\nfor additional information on our interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge.\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities\nOur available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. The primary objective of these\ninvestments is to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains\nand losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our investments. We performed\na sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of September 29, 2024, and\ndetermined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nCritical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the\nmost difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nJudgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.\nOur significant accounting estimates are discussed in additional detail in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the\nconsolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies\nquarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. During the past five fiscal\nyears, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise. We believe\nthat our significant accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity for the reasons discussed below.\n46\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our\nassets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which\nwe expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a\nvaluation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative\nevidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of operations. In\nprojecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal, and foreign pre-tax\noperating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and\nestimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of\ncumulative operating income/(loss).\nIn addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, such\nas the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax\nfiling positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing\nauthorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. The tax benefits recognized in the\nfinancial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate\nsettlement. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income\ntax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine\nthe tax position, or when new information becomes available. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item\n8 of Part II of this 10-K, there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a\nstatute of limitations and/or resolution of examinations with taxing authorities.\nWe have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. We regularly\nreview our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. The possibility exists that foreign earnings declared as indefinitely reinvested\nmay be repatriated as our plans are based on our estimated working and other capital needs in jurisdictions where our earnings are generated. While we do not\nexpect to repatriate cash to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we\nmay be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material.\nOur income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and\nfuture taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment\nregarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits, and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we\nbelieve that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results, including forecasted business performance, could differ, and we may\nbe exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts\nin excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.\n47\nTable of Contents\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Other Finite-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of\nthe asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset,\nwe determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge\nwhen the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over\nthe asset’s remaining useful life.\nLong-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of\nother assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level, which is inclusive of\nproperty, plant and equipment and lease ROU assets. The fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For other long-lived\nassets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows,\ncomparable transactions, or comparable company analyses.\nOur impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows\nand asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as\nwell as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating\nexpenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance, the local market economics, and the business environment impacting\nthe store’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. The fair\nvalue of a store’s ROU asset is estimated considering what a market participant would pay to lease the asset for its highest and best use. These estimates are\nsubjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets,\nchanges in economic conditions, and changes in operating performance.\nIn fiscal 2022, we announced our Reinvention Plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience. As a result of\nthe restructuring efforts in connection with the Reinvention Plan, we recorded immaterial impairment charges in our consolidated statements of earnings during\nthe fiscal years ended October 1, 2023, and October 2, 2022. No restructuring and impairment costs attributable to the Reinvention Plan were recorded in our\nconsolidated statements of earnings during the fiscal year ended September 29, 2024.\nAsset impairment charges are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or\ncircumstances change that would indicate impairment may exist. When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not\nmore likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using\ndiscounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches.\nWhen assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit is influenced by a\nnumber of factors, inclusive of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit’s estimated fair value over\ncarrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, and the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. If we\nperform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit’s goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require\nmanagement to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and\noperating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation, and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded\ncompanies and selecting an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the\nreporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth, strategic initiatives, local market economics, and the local business environment impacting the\nreporting unit’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the\nregion. These estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches, are highly subjective, and our\nability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic\nconditions, changes in our operating performance, and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. We continue\nto believe the fair value of each of our reporting units is significantly in excess of its carrying value, and absent a sustained multi-year global decline in our\nbusiness in key markets such as the U.S. and China, we do not anticipate incurring significant\n48\nTable of Contents\ngoodwill impairment in the next 12 months. Our fiscal 2024 annual goodwill impairment testing was completed in the third fiscal quarter. Where a quantitative\nassessment was performed, the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded carrying value by approximately $124 billion.\nWhen assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances\nhave occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. If we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances\nindicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. The fair value\ncalculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group’s forecasted\ngrowth and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that\nreflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value\ncalculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance, and\nchanges in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. We do not anticipate recording significant impairment charges in the\nnext 12 months.\nDefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges are discussed in Note 8, Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for a\ndetailed description of recent accounting pronouncements.\nItem 7A.

ended September 29, 2024, October 1, 2023, and October 2, 2022\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates\nDescription of Business\nWe purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee, tea, and other beverages and a variety of high-quality food items\nthrough our company-operated stores. We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels, such as licensed\nstores as well as grocery and foodservice through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé S.A. (“Nestlé”). In addition to our flagship Starbucks Coffee® brand,\nwe sell goods and services under the following brands: Teavana®, Ethos®, and Starbucks Reserve®.\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“10-K” or “Report”) for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2024 (“fiscal 2024”), Starbucks Corporation (together with\nits subsidiaries) is referred to as “Starbucks,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our.”\nSegment information is prepared on the same basis that our ceo, who is our Chief Operating Decision Maker, manages the segments, evaluates financial results,\nand makes key operating decisions.\nWe have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China,\nJapan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Unallocated corporate expenses are reported\nwithin Corporate and Other.\nAdditional details on the nature of our business and our reportable operating segments are included in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\nCertain prior period information at Note 7, Supplemental Balance Sheet and Statement of Earnings Information, has been reclassified to conform to the current\npresentation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements reflect the financial position and operating results of Starbucks, including wholly-owned subsidiaries and investees that\nwe control. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nFiscal Year End\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. Fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 included 52 weeks.\nEstimates and Assumptions\nPreparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Examples include, but are not limited to, estimates for\ninventory reserves, asset and goodwill impairments, assumptions underlying self-insurance reserves, income from unredeemed stored value cards, stock-based\ncompensation forfeiture rates, future asset retirement obligations, commitments and contingencies, and the potential outcome of future tax consequences of\nevents that have been recognized in the financial statements. Actual results and outcomes may differ from these estimates and assumptions due to risks and\nuncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment.\nRestructuring\nIn fiscal 2022, we announced our plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience. As a result of these\nrestructuring efforts, we recorded approximately $22 million and $46 million to restructuring and impairments in our consolidated statements of earnings\nduring fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. No restructuring and impairment costs attributable to this plan were recorded in our consolidated statements of\nearnings during fiscal year 2024.\nAs of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, there were no material restructuring-related accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase, as well as credit card receivables and third-party\npayment processing receivables for sales to customers in our company-operated stores that generally settle within two to five business days, to be cash\nequivalents. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that exceed federally-insured limits. We have not experienced any losses\nrelated to these balances, and we believe credit risk to be minimal.\n56\nTable of Contents\nOur cash management system provides for the funding of all major bank disbursement accounts on a daily basis as checks are presented for payment. Under\nthis system, outstanding checks are in excess of the cash balances at certain banks, which creates book overdrafts. Book overdrafts are presented as a current\nliability in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nInvestments\nAvailable-for-sale Debt Securities\nOur short-term and long-term investments include investment-grade debt securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale debt\nsecurities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive\nincome. Available-for-sale securities with remaining maturities of less than one year and those identified by management at the time of purchase to be used to\nfund operations within one year are classified as short-term. All other available-for-sale securities are classified as long-term. We evaluate our available-for-sale\nsecurities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. Unrealized losses are charged against net earnings when a decline in fair value is\ndetermined to be other than temporary. We review several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary, such as the length and extent of the fair\nvalue decline, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and whether we have the intent to sell, or will more likely than not be required to\nsell, before the securities’ anticipated recovery, which may be at maturity. Realized gains and losses are accounted for using the specific identification method.\nPurchases and sales are recorded on a trade date basis.\nStructured Deposits\nWe hold short-term, principal-protected structured deposits that provide returns in the form of both fixed and variable yields; such variable yields are indexed\nto foreign exchange rates, equity-linked instruments, or interest rate indices. The Company has elected to account for these using the fair value option with\ngains and losses recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings. For fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, resulting gains and losses were immaterial to our\nconsolidated statements of earnings.\nMarketable Equity Securities\nWe also have a marketable equity securities portfolio, which is comprised of marketable equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds. Marketable\nequity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). Gains or\nlosses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings.\nRefer to Note 4, Fair Value Measurements, for further discussion of our MDCP liability.\nEquity Investments\nEquity investments are accounted for under the equity method if we are able to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Our share of the\nearnings or losses as reported by the investees is classified as income from equity investees on our consolidated statements of earnings. The investments are\nevaluated for impairment annually and when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If a decline in fair value is\ndetermined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings.\nWe account for equity investments for which we do not have significant influence and without readily determinable fair values at cost with adjustments for\nobservable changes in price or impairments as permitted by the measurement alternative. Investments for which the measurement alternative has been elected\nare assessed for impairment quarterly, or if a triggering event indicates impairment may be present. Any adjustments as a result of price changes or impairments\nare recorded in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings.\nFair Value\nFair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. For assets\nand liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis, we determine fair value based on the following:\nLevel 1: The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. For equity and U.S.\ngovernment treasury securities and commodity futures contracts, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value.\nLevel 2: When quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available, we determine the fair value of certain assets based upon factors such as the\nquoted market price of similar assets or a discounted cash flow model using readily observable market data, which may include interest rate curves and forward\nand spot prices for currencies and commodities, depending on the nature of the investment. The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on the\nquoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities.\n57\nTable of Contents\nLevel 3: We determine the fair value of private equity instruments using valuation models, including Black Scholes’ option pricing model and discounted cash\nflow models. Inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the\nasset or liability.\nAssets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis may include items such as property, plant and equipment, ROU assets,\ngoodwill and other intangible assets, equity and other investments, and other assets. We determine the fair value of these items using Level 3 inputs, as\ndescribed in the related sections below.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe manage our exposure to various risks within our consolidated financial statements according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy,\nwe may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge interest rates, commodity prices, foreign currency-denominated revenue\nstreams, inventory purchases, and assets, liabilities, and investments in certain foreign operations. In order to manage our exposure to these risks, we use\nvarious types of derivative instruments including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars, and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures\ncontracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. A collar is a\nstrategy that uses a combination of a purchased call option and a sold put option with equal premiums to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows, or to limit\npossible gains or losses on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based\non specified underlying notional amounts, assets, and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.\nWe record all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and typically do not offset derivative assets and liabilities. Cash flows from derivative\nfinancial instruments and the related gains and losses are classified as cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nExcluding interest rate hedging instruments and cross-currency swaps, we generally do not enter into derivative instruments with maturities longer than three\nyears. However, we are allowed to net settle transactions with respective counterparties for certain derivative contracts, inclusive of interest rate swaps and\nforeign currency forwards, with a single, net amount payable by one party to the other. We also enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for\ncollateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. As of\nSeptember 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, cash collateral received under collateral security arrangements was $230.9 million and $77.1 million, respectively,\nand is included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, cash collateral pledged as part\nof our commodity derivative margin requirements was $12.4 million and $20.6 million, respectively, and is included in prepaid expenses and other current\nassets on our consolidated balance sheets. The potential effects of netting arrangements with our derivative contracts, excluding the effects of collateral, would\nnot have had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets. We also hold cash and cash equivalents from various settled-to-market exchange traded\nfutures related to coffee and dairy hedging.\nBy using these derivative instruments, we expose ourselves to potential credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of\nthe derivative contract. We minimize this credit risk by entering into transactions with carefully selected, credit-worthy counterparties and distribute contracts\namong several financial institutions to reduce the concentration of credit risk.\nCash Flow Hedges\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the derivative’s gain or loss is reported as a component of other comprehensive\nincome (“OCI”) and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) on our consolidated balance sheets. The gain or loss is subsequently\nreclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings, in the same line item as the underlying hedged item on our consolidated\nstatements of earnings.\nCash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge. Cash flows from hedging transactions are\nclassified in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. For de-designated cash flow hedges in which the transactions are no\nlonger likely to occur, the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of\nearnings.\nNet Investment Hedges\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the derivative’s, or qualifying non-derivative instrument’s, gain or loss is\nreported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI. The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is\neither sold or substantially liquidated.\n58\nTable of Contents\nFair Value Hedges\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument and the offsetting changes\nin fair value of the underlying hedged item due to changes in the hedged risk are recorded in interest income and other, net or interest expense on our\nconsolidated statements of earnings.\nDerivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments\nWe also enter into certain foreign currency forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars, and swaps that are not designated as hedging instruments\nfor accounting purposes. The changes in the fair values of these contracts are immediately recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated\nstatements of earnings.\nNormal Purchase Normal Sale\nWe enter into fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed green coffee purchase commitments, which we expect will result in physical delivery and utilization in the\nordinary course of business in a reasonable period of time. Since these types of purchase commitments qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exemption,\nthey are not recorded as derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheets.\nRefer to Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, and Note 5, Inventories, for further discussion of our derivative instruments and green coffee purchase\ncommitments.\nReceivables, net of Allowance for Credit Losses\nOur receivables are mainly generated from product and equipment sales to, and royalties from, our licensees, as well as from our Global Coffee Alliance and\nother Channel Development customers. The primary indicators of the credit quality of our receivables are aging, payment history, economic sector information,\nand outside credit monitoring. These indicators are assessed on a quarterly basis. Our credit loss exposure is mainly concentrated in our accounts receivable\nportfolio. Our allowance for credit losses is calculated using a loss-rate method based on historical experience, current market conditions, and reasonable\nforecasts. For the fiscal year ended September 29, 2024, we did not observe a significant deterioration of our receivable portfolio that required a significant\nincrease in our allowance for credit losses. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, our allowance for credit losses was $21.2 million and $23.8\nmillion, respectively.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (primarily moving average cost) or net realizable value. We record inventory reserves for obsolete and slow-moving\ninventory and for estimated shrinkage between physical inventory counts. Inventory reserves are based on inventory obsolescence trends, historical experience,\nand application of the specific identification method. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, inventory reserves were $58.0 million and $44.4 million,\nrespectively.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes all direct costs necessary to acquire and prepare assets for use or\nto develop or obtain internal-use software, including internal labor and overhead in some cases. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over\nestimated useful lives of the assets, generally ranging from 2 to 15 years for equipment, 30 to 40 years for buildings, and 2 to 8 years for capitalized software.\nLeasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease life, generally 10 years. For leases with renewal\nperiods at our option, we generally use the original lease term, excluding renewal option periods, to determine estimated useful lives. If failure to exercise a\nrenewal option imposes a significant economic penalty to us, we may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the\nrenewal option period in the determination of the appropriate estimated useful lives. Capitalized software includes the costs of developing or obtaining internal-\nuse software, such as external direct costs of materials and services, payroll and benefits costs, interest costs, and costs to develop or obtain software that\nallows for access or conversion of historical data by new systems. We capitalize costs when the preliminary project stage is complete, management has\nauthorized and committed to funding the software project, it is probable that the software project will be completed, and it is probable that the software will be\nused to perform the intended function.\nThe portion of depreciation expense related to production and distribution facilities is included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements\nof earnings. The costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred, while expenditures for refurbishments and improvements that significantly add\nto the productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. When assets are disposed of, whether through retirement or sale, the net gain or\nloss is recognized in net earnings. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell.\nWe evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be\nrecoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the\nestimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying\n59\nTable of Contents\nvalue of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated fair value and recognize an\nimpairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The fair value of the asset is estimated using a discounted cash flow model\nbased on forecasted future revenues and operating costs, using internal projections. Property, plant and equipment assets and ROU assets related to the store\nlease are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-\noperated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level.\nWe recognized net disposition and impairment charges of $94.0 million, $91.1 million, and $66.6 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Included\nin these amounts, we recorded $23.3 million, $23.2 million, and $14.3 million of impairment losses within store operating expenses on our consolidated\nstatements of earnings during the fiscal years ended September 29, 2024, October 1, 2023, and October 2, 2022, respectively. Of the total net disposition and\nimpairment charges recorded in fiscal 2022, $9.6 million was restructuring related and recorded in restructuring and impairment expenses. Unless it is\nrestructuring related, the nature of the underlying asset that is impaired or disposed of will determine the operating expense line on which the related impact is\nrecorded on our consolidated statements of earnings.\nLeases\nThe majority of our leases are operating leases for our company-operated retail store locations. We also lease, among other things, roasting, distribution and\nwarehouse facilities, and office space for corporate administrative purposes.\nWe categorize leases as either operating or finance leases at the commencement date of the lease. Operating lease agreements may contain tenant improvement\nallowances, rent holidays, rent escalation clauses, and/or contingent rent provisions. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are\naccounted for together as a single lease component for all underlying classes of assets.\nWe recognize a ROU asset and lease liability for each operating and finance lease with a contractual term greater than 12 months at the time of lease inception.\nWe do not record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on our consolidated balance sheet but continue to record rent expense on a straight-line basis\nover the lease term. We review contracts for identified assets where we have the right to direct the use of the asset and record those agreements as embedded\nleases on our consolidated balance sheet. Our leases often include options to extend or terminate at our sole discretion, which are included in the determination\nof lease term when they are reasonably certain to be exercised.\nOur lease liability represents the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. Given our policy election to combine lease and non-lease\ncomponents, we also consider fixed common area maintenance (“CAM”) part of our fixed future lease payments; therefore, fixed CAM is also included in our\nlease liability.\nWe generally cannot determine the interest rate implicit in each of our leases. Therefore, we typically use market and term-specific incremental borrowing\nrates. Our incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest we expect to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount under similar terms.\nBecause we do not borrow on a collateralized basis, we consider a combination of factors, including our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, the risk profile\nand funding cost of the specific geographic market of the lease, the lease term, and the effect of adjusting the rate to reflect consideration of collateral. Our\ncredit-adjusted risk-free rate takes into consideration interest rates we pay on our unsecured long-term bonds as well as quoted interest rates obtained from\nfinancial institutions.\nTotal lease costs recorded as rent and other occupancy costs include fixed operating lease costs, variable lease costs, and short-term lease costs. Most of our\nreal estate leases require we pay certain expenses, such as CAM costs, real estate taxes, and other executory costs, of which the fixed portion is included in\noperating lease costs. We recognize operating lease costs on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In addition to the above costs, variable lease costs also\ninclude amounts based on a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels, the costs of which are recognized when probable and are not included in\ndetermining the present value of our lease liability. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive\ncovenants. A significant majority of our leases are related to our company-operated stores, and the related costs are recorded within store operating expenses.\nThe ROU asset is measured at the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, initial direct\ncosts, and any tenant improvement allowances received. For operating leases, ROU assets are reduced over the lease term by the recognized straight-line lease\nexpense less the amount of accretion of the lease liability determined using the effective interest method. For finance leases, ROU assets are amortized on a\nstraight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset or the lease term. Interest expense on each finance lease liability is recognized utilizing\nthe effective interest method. ROU assets are tested for impairment in the same manner as long-lived assets.\nAdditionally, we monitor for events or changes in circumstances that may require a reassessment of one of our leases and determine if a remeasurement is\nrequired. See Note 10, Leases, for additional details.\n60\nTable of Contents\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change, such as material\ndeterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable. When\nevaluating goodwill for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is\nimpaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its\ncarrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. Fair value is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model. For certain\nreporting units, where deemed appropriate, we may also utilize a market approach for estimating fair value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds\nthe estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value.\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to\nrenew our lease, among other reasons. We may abandon certain assets associated with a closed store, including leasehold improvements and other non-\ntransferable assets. When a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, goodwill associated with the business is included in the\ncarrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal. Our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a\nbusiness occurs on the date of abandonment. Although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment, it does not\nconstitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of activities (substantive processes) and\nassets that are capable of being managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. As a result, when closing individual stores, we do not include\ngoodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets.\nWe recorded no goodwill impairment during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022. See Note 8, Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, for further\ninformation.\nOther Intangible Assets\nOther intangible assets include finite-lived intangible assets, which mainly consist of acquired and reacquired rights, trade secrets, licensing agreements,\ncontract-based patents, and copyrights. These assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment using a similar methodology\nto our property, plant and equipment, as described above.\nIndefinite-lived intangibles, which consist primarily of trade names and trademarks, are tested for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter, or more\nfrequently if an event occurs or circumstances change, indicating that the carrying value of the intangibles may not be recoverable. When evaluating other\nintangible assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an intangible asset group is\nimpaired. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset group\nexceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group. Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the\nintangible asset group and is typically calculated using an income approach, such as a relief-from-royalty model. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset\ngroup exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. In addition, we continuously\nmonitor and may revise our intangible asset useful lives if and when facts and circumstances change.\nThere were no significant other intangible asset impairment charges recorded during fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022. See Note 8, Other Intangible Assets and\nGoodwill, for further information.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance treaty,\nto provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including workers’ compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, and property insurance.\nLiabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience,\ndemographics, exposure and severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions.\nRevenue Recognition\nConsolidated revenues are presented net of intercompany eliminations for wholly-owned subsidiaries and investees controlled by us and for product sales to,\nand royalty and other fees from, licensees accounted for under the equity method. Additionally, consolidated revenues are recognized net of any discounts,\nreturns, allowances, and sales incentives, including coupon redemptions and rebates.\nCompany-operated Store Revenues\nCompany-operated store revenues are recognized when payment is tendered at the point-of-sale as the performance obligation has been satisfied. For products\nsold via delivery platforms, contractual terms are evaluated for each service provider to\n61\nTable of Contents\ndetermine gross versus net presentation, and revenues are also recognized when control of products are transferred to the customers. Delivery service fees were\nimmaterial in the periods presented. Company-operated store revenues are reported excluding sales, use, or other transaction taxes that are collected from\ncustomers and remitted to taxing authorities.\nLicensed Store Revenues\nLicensed store revenues consist of product and equipment sales, royalties, and other fees paid by licensees using the Starbucks brand. Sales of coffee, tea, food,\nand related products are generally recognized upon shipment to licensees, depending on contract terms. Shipping charges billed to licensees are also recognized\nas revenue, and the related shipping costs are included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings.\nWe consider pre-opening services, including site evaluation and selection, store architectural/design and development, and operational training, to be\nperformance obligations that are separate from the license to operate under the Starbucks brand. These services provide distinct value to our licensees,\nincluding business and industry insight and knowledge that transfers value apart from the license. Revenues associated with pre-opening services are\nrecognized upon completion of the related performance obligations, generally when a store is opened. Royalty revenues are recognized based upon a\npercentage of reported sales, and other continuing fees, such as marketing and service fees, are recognized as the performance obligations are met.\nStored Value Cards\nStored value cards can be activated through various channels, including at our company-operated and most licensed store locations, online at Starbucks.com, or\nvia mobile devices held by our customers and at certain other third-party websites and locations, such as grocery stores, although they cannot be reloaded at\nthese third-party websites or locations. Amounts loaded onto stored value cards are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon\nredemption. Historically, the majority of stored value cards are redeemed within one year.\nIn many of our company-operated markets, including the U.S., our stored value cards do not have an expiration date, nor do we charge service fees that cause a\ndecrement to customer balances. Based on historical redemption rates, a portion of stored value cards is not expected to be redeemed and will be recognized as\nbreakage over time in proportion to stored value card redemptions. The redemption rates are based on historical redemption patterns for each market, including\nthe timing and business channel in which the card was activated or reloaded, and remittance to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, if\napplicable.\nBreakage is recognized as company-operated stores and licensed stores revenue within the consolidated statement of earnings. For the fiscal years ended\nSeptember 29, 2024, October 1, 2023, and October 2, 2022, we recognized breakage revenue of $187.6 million, $196.1 million, and $196.0 million in\ncompany-operated store revenues, respectively, and $20.0 million, $18.9 million, and $16.7 million in licensed store revenues, respectively.\nLoyalty Program\nCustomers in the U.S., Canada, and certain other countries who register their stored value card are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program,\nwhich is primarily a spend-based loyalty program. They earn loyalty points (“Stars”) in a variety of ways, including with each purchase at participating\nStarbucks stores. Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at company-operated and\ncertain participating licensed stores in the U.S. and Canada. After accumulating a certain number of Stars, the customer earns a reward that can be redeemed for\nfree product that, regardless of where the related Stars were earned within that country, will be honored at company-operated stores and certain participating\nlicensed store locations in that same country.\nWe defer revenue associated with the estimated selling price of Stars earned by Starbucks Rewards members towards free products as each Star is earned and a\ncorresponding liability is established in deferred revenue. This deferral is based on the estimated value of the product for which the reward is expected to be\nredeemed, net of estimated unredeemed Stars. Stars generally expire after six to twelve months, depending on the market.\nWhen a customer redeems an earned reward, we recognize revenue for the redeemed product and reduce the related deferred revenue.\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues primarily include royalty revenues, sales of packaged coffee, tea, and a variety of ready-to-drink beverages and single-serve coffee and tea\nproducts to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. Sales of these products are generally recognized upon shipment to customers,\ndepending on contract terms.\nOther revenues also include product sales to, and licensing revenue from, Nestlé related to our Global Coffee Alliance. Product sales to Nestlé are generally\nrecognized when the product is shipped, whereas royalty revenues are recognized based on a percentage of reported sales.\n62\nTable of Contents\nDeferred Revenues\nOur deferred revenue primarily consists of the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestlé, for which we have continuing performance obligations to support the\nGlobal Coffee Alliance, and our unredeemed stored value card liability and unredeemed Stars associated with our loyalty program. See Note 11, Deferred\nRevenue, for further information.\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type, and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\nProduct and Distribution Costs\nProduct and distribution costs primarily include expenses related to raw materials, purchased goods, packaging, and delivery, along with operational costs of\nour supply chain organization. This encompasses wages, benefits, occupancy costs, and depreciation associated with sourcing, procuring, manufacturing,\nwarehousing, and transportation of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as through Channel Development and our other\nbusinesses. Additionally, it includes costs related to inventory and supply chain asset impairments.\nStore Operating Expenses\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees),\noccupancy costs, delivery commissions, and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees, and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and\nregional offices that support our corporate functions.\nAdvertising\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place.\nAdvertising expenses totaled $597.3 million, $507.8 million, and $416.7 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nStore Preopening Expenses\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily\nassociated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove to comply with the lease agreement. At the\ninception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the\nobligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates, and discount rates, and accrete the\nliability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets.\nUpon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or\nloss in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, our net ARO assets included in\nproperty, plant and equipment were $25.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were\n$119.2 million and $110.3 million, respectively.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock\nunits (“RSUs”), or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our\ncompensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under\nthe applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the\nexpense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable\nthe performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating\nincome, return on invested capital, total shareholder return, and metrics focused on talent and sustainability. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing\nprice of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares during the vesting\nperiod. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation\n63\nTable of Contents\nmodel. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and our\nhistorical experience. If applicable, our total shareholder return relative to our peer group is incorporated into the underlying assumptions using a Monte Carlo\nsimulation valuation model to calculate grant date fair value. The related assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model include expected\nterm, volatility, dividend yield, and risk-free interest rate. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting\nportion of the award, and only for those awards expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on our historical experience and future\nexpectations.\nForeign Currency Translation\nOur international operations generally use their local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the\nbalance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are\nreported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI on our consolidated balance sheets.\nIncome Taxes\nWe compute income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income taxes are recognized based on the differences between the\nfinancial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current\nenacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates\non deferred taxes is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence,\nwe determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdictions from\nwhich they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable\nincome, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess\nof their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nIn addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions,\nincluding the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our\nvarious tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained\nupon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our\nposition. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%\nlikelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our\nunrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations\nexpires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or when new information becomes available.\nStarbucks recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. Accrued interest\nand penalties are included within the related tax balances on our consolidated balance sheets.\nGlobal intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions are applied, providing an incremental tax on foreign income. We have made a policy election to\nclassify taxes due under the GILTI provision as a current period expense.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per\nshare is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the\nperiod, calculated using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and RSUs. Performance-based RSUs\nare considered dilutive when the related performance criterion has been met.\nCommon Stock Share Repurchases\nWe may repurchase shares of Starbucks common stock under a program authorized by our Board, including pursuant to a contract, instruction, or written plan\nmeeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Exchange Act. Under applicable Washington State law, shares repurchased are retired and not displayed\nseparately as treasury stock on the financial statements. Instead, the par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock, and the excess repurchase\nprice over par value is deducted from additional paid-in capital and from retained earnings (deficit).\n64\nTable of Contents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance related to reference rate reform. The\npronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the\nfinancial reporting burden related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other interbank offered rates to\nalternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and generally can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31,\n2024. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued guidance expanding segment disclosure requirements. The amendments require enhanced disclosure for certain segment\nitems and disclosure on how management uses reported measures to assess segment performance. The amendments do not change how segments are\ndetermined, aggregated, or how thresholds are applied to determine reportable segments. We expect to adopt the guidance for the fiscal year ending September\n28, 2025. We are currently evaluating the expanded disclosure requirements and do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our\nconsolidated financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance expanding disclosure requirements related to income taxes. The amendments require enhanced jurisdictional\ndisclosures for the income tax rate reconciliation and related to cash income taxes paid. Additionally, certain disclosures related to unrecognized tax benefits\nand indefinite reinvestment assertions were removed. The amendments are effective for our fiscal year ending September 27, 2026. While we are still\nevaluating the specific impacts and timing of adoption, we anticipate this guidance will have a significant impact on our annual income tax disclosures.\nIn March 2024, the SEC issued its final climate disclosure rules, which require the disclosure of climate-related information in annual reports and registration\nstatements. The rules require disclosure in the audited financial statements of certain effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions above certain\nfinancial thresholds, as well as amounts related to carbon offsets and renewable energy credits or certificates, if material. Under the rules as originally issued,\ndisclosure requirements begin phasing in for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. However, on April 4, 2024, the SEC determined to voluntarily\nstay the final rules pending certain legal challenges. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new rules and continue to monitor the status of the related\nlegal challenges.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued guidance expanding disclosure requirements related to certain income statement expenses. The amendments require\ntabular disclosure of certain operating expenses disaggregated into categories, such as purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and\nintangible asset amortization. The amendments are effective for our fiscal year ending October 1, 2028, and may be applied retrospectively. While we are still\nevaluating the specific impacts and adoption method, we anticipate this guidance will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statement\ndisclosures.\nNote 2: Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Strategic Alliance\nFiscal 2023\nOn January 13, 2023, we sold the assets, primarily consisting of intellectual properties associated with the Seattle’s Best Coffee brand, to Nestlé for\n$110.0 million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $91.3 million, which was included in gain from sale of assets on our consolidated statement of\nearnings for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023. Results from Seattle’s Best Coffee operations prior to the sale are reported in our Channel Development\noperating segment.\nFiscal 2022\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we sold our Evolution Fresh brand and business to Bolthouse Farms. This transaction did not have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nNote 3: Derivative Financial Instruments\nInterest Rates\nFrom time to time, we enter into designated cash flow hedges to manage the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates. We enter into\ninterest rate swap agreements, including forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury locks, settled in cash based upon the difference between an agreed-\nupon benchmark rate and the prevailing benchmark rate at settlement. These agreements are generally settled around the time of the pricing of the related debt.\nEach derivative agreement’s gain or loss is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt.\nTo hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges.\nThe changes in fair values of these derivative instruments and the offsetting changes in fair\n65\nTable of Contents\nvalues of the underlying hedged debt due to changes in the relevant benchmark interest rates are recorded in interest expense. Refer to Note 9, Debt, for\nadditional information on our long-term debt.\nForeign Currency\nTo reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated\nroyalty revenue, inventory purchases, and intercompany borrowing and lending activities. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in\nAOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue, product and distribution costs, or interest income and other, net, respectively, when the hedged exposures affect\nnet earnings.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into financial instruments, including, but not limited to, forward and swap contracts or foreign currency-denominated debt, to\nhedge the currency exposure of our net investments in certain international operations. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in\nAOCI and are subsequently reclassified to net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Gains and losses from these\nderivatives, representing hedged components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, are amortized over the life of the hedging instrument using a\nsystematic and rational method and recognized in interest expense.\nForeign currency forward and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments are used to mitigate the foreign exchange risk of certain other balance\nsheet items. Gains and losses from these derivatives are largely offset by the financial impact of translating foreign currency-denominated payables and\nreceivables, and these gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net.\nCommodities\nDepending on market conditions, we may enter into coffee forward contracts, futures contracts, and collars to hedge anticipated cash flows under our price-to-\nbe-fixed green coffee contracts, which are described further in Note 5, Inventories, or our longer-dated forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed price\nand price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to product and\ndistribution costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings.\nDepending on market conditions, we may also enter into dairy forward contracts and futures contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows under our\ndairy purchase contracts and our forecasted dairy demand. The resulting gains or losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to product and\ndistribution costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings.\nCash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge. Cash flows from hedging transactions are\nclassified in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. For de-designated cash flow hedges in which the underlying transactions\nare no longer probable of occurring or where price variability in the underlying cash flow ceases to exist, the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are\nrecognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. These derivatives may be accounted for prospectively as non-\ndesignated derivatives until maturity, re-designated to new hedging relationships, or terminated early. We continue to believe transactions related to our\ndesignated cash flow hedges are probable to occur.\nTo mitigate the price uncertainty of a portion of our future purchases, including diesel fuel and other commodities, we enter into swap contracts, futures, and\ncollars that are not designated as hedging instruments. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net to help offset price\nfluctuations on our beverage, food, packaging, and transportation costs, which are included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of\nearnings.\n66\nTable of Contents\nGains and losses on derivative contracts and foreign currency-denominated debt designated as hedging instruments included in AOCI and expected to be\nreclassified into earnings within 12 months, net of tax (in millions):\nNet Gains/(Losses)\nIncluded in AOCI Net Gains/(Losses)\nExpected to be Outstanding\nReclassified from AOCI Contract/Debt\nSep 29, Oct 1, Oct 2, into Earnings within 12 Remaining Maturity\n2024 2023 2022 Months (Months)\nCash Flow Hedges:\nCoffee $ 60.1 $ (78.1) $ 153.9 $ 60.1 3\nCross-currency swaps 0.5 (0.6) (1.9) — 2\nDairy 2.0 (1.8) (2.6) 2.0 5\nForeign currency -

Our marketable equity securities portfolio approximates a portion of our\nliability under our MDCP, a defined contribution plan. Our MDCP liability was $112.3 million and $90.4 million as of September 29, 2024, and October 1,\n2023, respectively. The changes in net unrealized holding gains and losses in the marketable equity securities portfolio included in earnings for fiscal 2024,\n2023, and 2022 were not material. Gross unrealized holding gains and losses on marketable equity securities were not material as of September 29, 2024, and\nOctober 1, 2023.\nDerivative Assets and Liabilities\nDerivative assets and liabilities are described further in Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nAssets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on the consolidated financial statements on a nonrecurring basis include items such as property, plant\nand equipment, ROU assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity and other investments, and other assets. These assets are measured at fair value if\ndetermined to be impaired. Impairment of property, plant and equipment and ROU assets is included in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nand Estimates.\nWe recognized impairments during fiscal years ended September 29, 2024, October 1, 2023, and October 2, 2022. See Note 1, Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies and Estimates for additional discussion of these impairments.\nFair Value of Other Financial Instruments\nThe estimated fair value of our long-term debt based on the quoted market price (Level 2) is included at Note 9, Debt.\nNote 5: Inventories (in millions)\nSep 29, 2024 Oct 1, 2023\nCoffee:\nUnroasted $ 665.1 $ 747.7\nRoasted 251.9 280.3\nOther merchandise held for sale (1) 384.6 364.6\nPackaging and other supplies 475.7 413.8\nTotal $ 1,777.3 $ 1,806.4\n(1) “Other merchandise held for sale” includes, among other items, serveware, food, and tea. Inventory levels vary due to seasonality, commodity market\nsupply, and price fluctuations.\nAs of September 29, 2024, we had committed to purchasing green coffee totaling $180 million under fixed-price contracts and an estimated $929 million under\nprice-to-be-fixed contracts. A portion of our price-to-be-fixed contracts are effectively fixed through the use of futures. See Note 3, Derivative Financial\nInstruments, for further discussion. Price-to-be-fixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated\nterms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore the price, at which the base “C” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been\nestablished. For most contracts, either Starbucks or the seller has the option to “fix” the base “C” coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date. For other\ncontracts, Starbucks and the seller may agree upon pricing parameters determined by the base “C” coffee commodity price. Until prices are fixed, we estimate\nthe total cost of these purchase commitments. We believe, based on established relationships with our suppliers and continuous monitoring, the risk of non-\ndelivery on these purchase commitments is remote.\nNote 6: Equity Investments (in millions)\nSep 29, 2024 Oct 1, 2023\nEquity method investments $ 424.1 $ 415.7\nOther investments 39.8 24.2\nTotal $ 463.9 $ 439.9\nEquity Method Investments\nAs of September 29, 2024, we had a 50% ownership interest in Tata Starbucks Limited (India), with a carrying value of $41.1 million.

As of\nSeptember 29, 2024, the carrying value of this investment was $112.3 million.\nOur share of income and losses from our equity method investments is included in income from equity investees on our consolidated statements of earnings.\nAlso included in this line item is our proportionate share of gross profit resulting from coffee and other product sales to, and royalty and license fee revenues\ngenerated from, equity investees. Revenues generated from these entities were $62.6 million, $85.7 million, and $80.9 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022,\nrespectively. Related product and distribution costs were $58.6 million, $85.6 million, and $76.5 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

The total carrying value of these investments was $211.9 million as of September 29, 2024. Our share of income and losses\nfrom these private equity interests is included in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. The related financial statement\nactivities were not material during the periods presented.\nAdditional disclosure regarding changes in our equity method investments due to acquisition or divestiture is included in Note 2, Acquisitions, Divestitures and\nStrategic Alliance.\nOther Investments\nWe have equity interests in entities that develop and operate Starbucks licensed stores in several global markets, as well as in companies that support our\nstrategic initiatives. We do not have significant influence over these entities, and their fair values are not readily determinable. Therefore, we elected to measure\nthese investments at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairment.\n73\nTable of Contents\nNote 7: Supplemental Balance Sheet and Statement of Earnings Information (in millions)\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, net\nSep 29, 2024 Oct 1, 2023\nLand $ 56.9 $ 46.1\nBuildings 684.8 666.5\nLeasehold improvements 11,453.9 10,133.7\nStore equipment 3,803.6 3,332.5\nRoasting equipment 865.7 859.4\nCapitalized software 1,049.7 897.2\nFurniture, fixtures and other 775.5 767.3\nWork in progress 750.9 607.5\nProperty, plant and equipment, gross 19,441.0 17,310.2\nAccumulated depreciation (10,775.5) (9,923.1)\nProperty, plant and equipment, net $ 8,665.5 $ 7,387.1\nAccrued Liabilities\nSep 29, 2024 Oct 1, 2023\nAccrued occupancy costs $ 81.7 $ 86.7\nAccrued dividends payable 691.2 651.2\nAccrued capital and other operating expenditures 842.8 771.7\nInsurance reserves 244.3 233.5\nIncome taxes payable 123.5 189.3\nAccrued business taxes 211.2 212.7\nTotal accrued liabilities $ 2,194.7 $ 2,145.1\nStore Operating Expenses\nYear Ended\nSep 29, 2024 Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022\nWages and benefits $ 8,828.6 $ 8,733.4 $ 8,157.7\nOccupancy costs 3,050.6 2,871.0 2,674.1\nOther expenses 3,407.3 3,115.9 2,730.0\nTotal store operating expenses $ 15,286.5 $ 14,720.3 $ 13,561.8\n74\nTable of Contents\nNote 8: Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n(in millions) Sep 29, 2024 Oct 1, 2023\nTrade names, trademarks, and patents $ 79.5 $ 79.4\nFinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nSep 29, 2024 Oct 1, 2023\nGross Carrying Accumulated Net Carrying Gross Carrying Accumulated Net Carrying\n(in millions) Amount Amortization Amount Amount Amortization Amount\nAcquired and reacquired rights $ 995.5 $ (995.5) $ — $ 957.6 $ (957.6) $ —\nAcquired trade secrets and processes 27.6 (27.6) — 27.6 (27.6) —\nTrade names, trademarks, and patents 130.4 (110.0) 20.4 131.0 (91.9) 39.1\nLicensing agreements 13.4 (12.4) 1.0 13.0 (11.0) 2.0\nOther finite-lived intangible assets 20.9 (20.9) — 20.1 (20.1) —\nTotal finite-lived intangible assets $ 1,187.8 $ (1,166.4) $ 21.4 $ 1,149.3 $ (1,108.2) $ 41.1\nAmortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was $20.4 million, $21.5 million, and $192.7 million during fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nEstimated future amortization expense as of September 29, 2024 (in millions):\nFiscal Year Ending\n2025 $ 14.0\n2026 2.1\n2027 1.8\n2028 1.2\n2029 0.8\nThereafter 1.5\nTotal estimated future amortization expense $ 21.4\nGoodwill\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable operating segment (in millions):\nChannel\nNorth America International Development Corporate and Other Total\nGoodwill balance at October 2, 2022 $ 491.1 $ 2,756.7 $ 34.7 $ 1.0 $ 3,283.5\nOther (1) 0.4 (65.6) — — (65.2)\nGoodwill balance at October 1, 2023 $ 491.5 $ 2,691.1 $ 34.7 $ 1.0 $ 3,218.3\nOther (1) — 97.4 — — 97.4\nGoodwill balance at September 29, 2024 $ 491.5 $ 2,788.5 $ 34.7 $ 1.0 $ 3,315.7\n(1) “Other” consists of changes in the goodwill balance resulting from foreign currency translation.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 29, 2024, we completed our annual goodwill impairment analysis.

The\napplicable margin is based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings assigned by the Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies. The “Base Rate” is the\nhighest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility) plus 0.500%, (ii) Bank of America’s prime rate, and (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.000%.\nTerm SOFR means the forward-looking SOFR term rate administrated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plus a SOFR Adjustment of 0.100%.\nThe 2021 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio,\nwhich measures our ability to cover financing expenses.

The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may\nbe used for working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash\ndividends on our common stock, and share repurchases. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under the program.\nAdditionally, we hold the following Japanese yen-denominated credit facilities that are available for working capital needs and capital expenditures within our\nJapanese market:\n• A ¥5.0 billion, or $34.5 million, credit facility is currently set to mature on December 30, 2024.

The up-front payment of approximately $7 billion was recorded as deferred revenue as we have continuing performance\nobligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, including providing Nestlé access to certain intellectual properties and products for future resale. The up-\nfront payment is being recognized as other revenue on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the arrangement of 40 years for the ongoing\naccess to the licenses within the contractual territories. Our obligations to maintain the Starbucks brand and other intellectual properties are generally constant\nthroughout the term of the arrangement. Therefore, a ratable recognition pattern is reflective of how we will satisfy our performance obligations.\nAs of September 29, 2024, the current and long-term deferred revenue related to the Nestlé up-front payment was $177.0 million and $5.8 billion, respectively.\nAs of October 1, 2023, the current and long-term deferred revenue related to the Nestlé up-front payment was $177.0 million and $6.0 billion, respectively.\nDuring each of the fiscal years ended September 29, 2024, October 1, 2023, and October 2, 2022, we recognized $176.5 million of prepaid royalty revenue\nrelated to Nestlé.\nChanges in our deferred revenue balance related to our stored value cards and loyalty program (in millions):\nFiscal Year Ended September 29, 2024 Total\nStored value cards and loyalty program at October 1, 2023 $ 1,567.5\nRevenue deferred - card activations, card reloads and Stars earned 15,807.1\nRevenue recognized - card and Stars redemptions and breakage (15,665.1)\nOther(1) 9.2\nStored value cards and loyalty program at September 29, 2024(2) $ 1,718.7\nFiscal Year Ended October 1, 2023 Total\nStored value cards and loyalty program at October 2, 2022 $ 1,503.0\nRevenue deferred - card activations, card reloads and Stars earned 14,922.1\nRevenue recognized - card and Stars redemptions and breakage (14,853.0)\nOther(1) (4.6)\nStored value cards and loyalty program at October 1, 2023(2) $ 1,567.5\n(1) “Other” primarily consists of changes in the stored value cards and loyalty program balances resulting from foreign currency translation.\n(2) As of September 29, 2024, approximately $1.6 billion of this amount was current.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for\neach of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating\nthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to\nbe communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)\ninvolved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on\nthe financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit\nmatter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit – Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year,\nand more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves\ncomparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and\nmarket approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash\nflow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and “EBITDA,” which stands for earnings\nbefore interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the\nreporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment\ncharge, if any, or both.\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the\nChina reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did\nnot record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.\n89\nTable of Contents\nWe identified the goodwill impairment assessment of the China reporting unit as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions\nmanagement made to determine the fair value. The audit of these estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit\nprocedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to revenue and cash flow projections, and the selection of\nsignificant valuation assumptions such as comparable company revenue and EBITDA multiples and discount rates. The audit also required an increased extent\nof effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.\nHow the Critical Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to revenue and cash flow projections and the selection of significant valuation assumptions, such as comparable company revenue\nand EBITDA multiples and discount rates, for the China reporting unit included the following:\n• We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s goodwill impairment evaluation, including the determination of the fair value of the China\nreporting unit, such as controls related to management’s forecasts and the selection of the discount rate and market multiples used.\n• We inquired of senior executives of the Company to corroborate strategic plans for growth.\n• We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts.\n• We performed a sensitivity analysis of the revenue growth rate, EBITDA margin, and discount rates, which included their impact on cash flows.\n• We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasts by comparing the forecasts to (1) historical results, (2) internal communications amongst\nmanagement and the Board of Directors, (3) inquiry with personnel outside of finance and accounting, and (4) forecasted information included in\nanalyst and industry reports relevant to the China reporting unit.\n• With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated (1) the valuation methodologies used, (2) the comparable company multiples selected by\nmanagement, and (3) the discount rate used in determining the present value of the expected cash flows.\n• We considered the impact of trends in the industry and current macroeconomic factors on management’s forecasts.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSeattle, Washington\nNovember 20, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1987.\n90\nTable of Contents\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNot applicable.\nItem 9A.Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed or\nsubmitted under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Our\ndisclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act\nis accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief\nexecutive officer and our chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in\nRules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report (September 29, 2024).\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most\nrecently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect internal control over financial reporting.\nThe certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as exhibits 31.1 and 31.2, respectively, to this 10-K.\nReport of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a\nprocess to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately\nand fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements;\nproviding reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on\na timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of\nour financial statements would be prevented or detected.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included\nreview of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls, and a conclusion\non this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 29, 2024.\nOur internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public\naccounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.\n91\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Starbucks Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of September 29, 2024, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based\non criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated\nfinancial statements as of and for the year ended September 29, 2024, of the Company and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified\nopinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility\nis to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating\neffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and\nthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSeattle, Washington\nNovember 20, 2024\n92\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B.

The Performance RSUs granted under this Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement, including any addi\u0000onal terms and condi\u0000ons\napplicable to the Par\u0000cipant’s country contained in Appendix A a\u0000ached hereto (together with the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant\nAgreement, this “Agreement”) shall, subject to the a\u0000ainment of certain performance goals set forth below (the “Performance Goals”), rela\u0000ng to the\nPerformance Criteria specified in the 2005 Long-Term Equity Incen\u0000ve Plan, vest and become payable in shares of Common Stock (the “Shares”), subject to\nearlier expira\u0000on or termina\u0000on of the Performance RSUs as provided in this Agreement. The Performance RSUs and the terms of this Agreement, including\nthe Appendices, shall be subject to the terms and condi\u0000ons of the 2005 Long-Term Equity Incen\u0000ve Plan (the “Plan”). Capitalized terms not explicitly defined\nin this Agreement but defined in the Plan shall have the same defini\u0000ons as in the Plan.\nPartner Name:\nTarget Restricted Stock Units:\nDate of Grant:\nPerformance Period:\n1. Ves\u0000ng Schedule. The number of Performance RSUs granted under the Award that actually vest and that will be se\u0000led shall be determined\npursuant to a two-step process: (i) first the maximum number of Performance RSUs that are eligible to vest shall be determined as provided under Sec\u0000on 1.1\nhereof on the basis of the level at which the Performance Goals specified on a\u0000ached Schedule I are actually a\u0000ained and (ii) then the maximum number of\nPerformance RSUs calculated under clause (i) that will actually vest shall be determined on the basis of the Par\u0000cipant’s comple\u0000on of the requirements set\nforth in Sec\u0000on 1.2 hereof.\n1.1 Performance Goal Requirements. The a\u0000ached Schedule I specifies the Performance Goals required to be a\u0000ained during the\nPerformance Period in order for the Performance RSUs to become eligible to vest. As soon as reasonably prac\u0000cable following the end of the\nPerformance Period, the Compensa\u0000on and Management Development Commi\u0000ee of the Board of Directors (the “Commi\u0000ee”) shall determine in\nits sole discre\u0000on the a\u0000ainment level of the Performance Goals. On the basis of the determined level of a\u0000ainment of the Performance Goals, the\nTarget RSUs will be mul\u0000plied by the applicable percentage determined in accordance with the performance matrix set forth in Schedule I. The\nnumber of Performance RSUs resul\u0000ng from such determina\u0000on shall cons\u0000tute the maximum number of Performance RSUs in which the Par\u0000cipant\nmay vest under this Award, provided that the Commi\u0000ee shall have the discre\u0000on to reduce or eliminate the number of Performance RSUs that\nwould otherwise be payable hereunder pursuant to this Sec\u0000on 1.1 (the “Earned Performance RSUs”).\n1.2 Ac\u0000ve Status Ves\u0000ng. Subject to the terms and condi\u0000ons of this Award, a number of Earned Performance RSUs will vest as detailed in\nthe a\u0000ached Schedule I of this Agreement, subject to the Par\u0000cipant’s con\u0000nued Ac\u0000ve Status through the date the Performance RSUs are paid\npursuant to Sec\u0000on 3.\n2. Dividend Equivalents. On each date that a cash dividend is paid to holders of Shares during the Performance Period, an amount (the “Dividend\nEquivalent Amount”) equal to the cash dividend that is paid on\neach Share, mul\u0000plied by the number of Shares subject to the Target RSUs and any Dividend Equivalent RSUs (as defined below) that remain unvested and\noutstanding as of the dividend payment date, shall be credited for the benefit of the Par\u0000cipant, and such credited amount shall be converted into an\naddi\u0000onal number of Performance RSUs (“Dividend Equivalent RSUs”) determined by dividing the Dividend Equivalent Amount by the Fair Market Value of a\nShare on the dividend payment date, rounded up or down to the nearest whole number. At the end of the Performance Period, the number of Dividend\nEquivalent RSUs will be adjusted to reflect the number of Dividend Equivalent RSUs that would have been credited to the Par\u0000cipant as of the Date of Grant if\nsuch calcula\u0000ons had been based on the number of Earned Performance RSUs (such adjusted number, the “Earned Dividend Equivalent RSUs”). During the\nperiod beginning immediately following the last day of the Performance Period and ending on the date the Performance RSUs granted hereunder are paid\npursuant to Sec\u0000on 3 below, Dividend Equivalent RSUs will accrue on any Earned Performance RSUs and any Earned Dividend Equivalent RSUs. Dividend\nEquivalent RSUs will be subject to the same condi\u0000ons as the underlying Performance RSUs with respect to which Dividend Equivalent RSUs were paid,\nincluding, without limita\u0000on, the ves\u0000ng condi\u0000ons and the provisions governing \u0000me and form of se\u0000lement applicable to the underlying Performance\nRSUs. Unless expressly provided otherwise, as used elsewhere in this Agreement, “Performance RSUs” shall include any Dividend Equivalent RSUs that have\nbeen credited to the Par\u0000cipant’s account.\n3. Form and Timing of Payment of Vested Performance RSUs. Subject to the terms and condi\u0000ons of this Agreement and the Plan, any Performance\nRSUs that vest will be paid to the Par\u0000cipant solely in Shares (and not in cash, as the Plan permits), on, or within sixty (60) days a\u0000er, (i) the last day of the\nPerformance Period, including upon a ves\u0000ng resul\u0000ng from the Par\u0000cipant’s termina\u0000on due the Par\u0000cipant’s Re\u0000rement pursuant to Sec\u0000on 4.3 below or\nfrom the Par\u0000cipant’s termina\u0000on prior to the last day of the Performance Period resul\u0000ng from the Par\u0000cipant’s termina\u0000on due to death or Disability\npursuant to Sec\u0000on 4.4 below or (ii) a ves\u0000ng event contemplated in Sec\u0000on 4.2 below or ves\u0000ng event resul\u0000ng from the Par\u0000cipant’s termina\u0000on following\nthe last day of the Performance Period resul\u0000ng from the Par\u0000cipant’s termina\u0000on due to death or Disability pursuant to Sec\u0000on 4.4 below.\n4. Termina\u0000on of Employment; Change of Control.\n4.1 Termina\u0000on of Employment.

Ac\u0000vely\nproviding services during only a por\u0000on of the ves\u0000ng period prior to a Ves\u0000ng Date shall not en\u0000tle the Par\u0000cipant to vest in a pro-rata por\u0000on of\nthe unvested Earned Performance RSUs (if any) that would have vested as of such Ves\u0000ng Date, nor will it en\u0000tle the Par\u0000cipant to any\ncompensa\u0000on for the lost ves\u0000ng. The Commi\u0000ee shall have the exclusive discre\u0000on to determine when the Par\u0000cipant’s Ac\u0000ve Status for purposes\nof the Award is terminated (including whether the Par\u0000cipant may s\u0000ll be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence).\n4.2 Change of Control. Upon a Change of Control, the ves\u0000ng of the Performance RSUs shall accelerate, and the Performance RSUs shall\nbecome fully vested and payable to the extent and under the terms and condi\u0000ons set forth in the Plan; provided that, for purposes of this Sec\u0000on\n4.2, “Resigna\u0000on (or Resign) for Good Reason” shall have the following meaning:\n“Resigna\u0000on (or Resign) for Good Reason” shall mean any voluntary termina\u0000on by wri\u0000en resigna\u0000on of the Ac\u0000ve Status of a Par\u0000cipant a\u0000er a Change of\nControl because of: (1) a material reduc\u0000on in the Partner’s authority, responsibili\u0000es or scope of employment; (2) an assignment of du\u0000es to the Partner\nmaterially inconsistent with the Partner’s role at the Company (including its Subsidiaries and affiliates) prior to the Change of Control, (3) a material reduc\u0000on\nin the Partner’s base salary or total incen\u0000ve compensa\u0000on; (4) a material reduc\u0000on in the Partner’s benefits unless such reduc\u0000on applies to all Partners of\ncomparable rank; or (5) the reloca\u0000on of the Partner’s primary work loca\u0000on more than 50 miles from the Partner’s primary work loca\u0000on prior to the\nChange of Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Par\u0000cipant shall not be deemed to have Resigned for Good Reason unless the Par\u0000cipant, within one\nyear a\u0000er a Change of Control, (i) no\u0000fies the Company of the existence of the condi\u0000on giving rise to a Resigna\u0000on for Good Reason within 90 days of the\nini\u0000al existence of such condi\u0000on, (ii) gives the Company at least 30 days following the date on which the Company receives such no\u0000ce (and prior to\ntermina\u0000on) in which to remedy the condi\u0000on, and (iii) if the Company does not remedy such condi\u0000on within such 30-day period, actually terminates\nemployment within 60 days a\u0000er the expira\u0000on of such 30-day period (and before the Company remedies such condi\u0000on). If the Company remedies such\ncondi\u0000on within such 30-day period (or at any \u0000me prior to the Par\u0000cipant’s actual termina\u0000on), then any Resigna\u0000on for Good Reason by the Par\u0000cipant on\naccount of such condi\u0000on will not be a Resigna\u0000on for Good Reason.\n4.3 Re\u0000rement.

If the Par\u0000cipant’s Ac\u0000ve Status terminates due to Disability or death on or prior to the last day of the\nPerformance Period, a number of Performance RSUs equal to the Target RSUs will vest in full as of the date of termina\u0000on of Ac\u0000ve Status due to\nDisability or death.

The Company reserves all other rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity.\n6.2 Clawback Policy. The Par\u0000cipant agrees that this Award and any Shares or any other benefits or proceeds therefrom that the Par\u0000cipant may\nreceive hereunder shall be subject to forfeiture and/or repayment to\nthe Company pursuant to (i) the Company’s Recovery of Incen\u0000ve Compensa\u0000on Policy (ii) any other recovery, recoupment, “clawback” or similar policy\nadopted by the Company a\u0000er the Date of Grant, to the extent required to comply with any requirements imposed under applicable laws and/or the rules\nand regula\u0000ons of the securi\u0000es exchange or inter-dealer quota\u0000on system on which the Shares are listed or quoted, in each case, as may be amended from\n\u0000me to \u0000me (with the provisions contained in such policy deemed incorporated into this Agreement without the Par\u0000cipant’s addi\u0000onal or separate consent).\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and subject to applicable law, (i) compliance with applicable law, the Company’s Standards of Business\nConduct, and the Company’s corporate policies, as applicable, shall be a pre-condi\u0000on to earning, or ves\u0000ng in respect of, this Award and (ii) to the extent this\nAward is subject to the Company’s Recovery of Incen\u0000ve Compensa\u0000on Policy, this Award will not be earned or vested, even if already granted, paid or\nse\u0000led, un\u0000l the Company’s Recovery of Incen\u0000ve Compensa\u0000on Policy ceases to apply to such Award and any other ves\u0000ng condi\u0000ons applicable to such\nAward are sa\u0000sfied.\n6.3 Recoupment Authoriza\u0000on.

Code Sec\u0000on 409A. The provisions in this Sec\u0000on 7 shall apply if the Par\u0000cipant is subject to taxa\u0000on in the United States.\n7.1 To the extent the Performance RSUs cons\u0000tute “nonqualified deferred compensa\u0000on” that is subject to Code Sec\u0000on 409A (“NQ\nDeferred Compensa\u0000on”), any Performance RSUs that are payable upon or with reference to the date that the Par\u0000cipant’s Ac\u0000ve Service terminates\n(i) shall not be paid unless the Par\u0000cipant experiences a “separa\u0000on from service” within the meaning of Code Sec\u0000on 409A and (ii) if the Par\u0000cipant\nis a “specified employee” within the meaning of Code Sec\u0000on 409A on the date of the Par\u0000cipant’s separa\u0000on from service, then the Performance\nRSUs shall be paid on the first business day of the seventh month following the Par\u0000cipant’s separa\u0000on from service, or, if earlier, on the date of the\nPar\u0000cipant’s death, to the extent such delayed payment is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribu\u0000on under Code Sec\u0000on 409A.\n7.2 This Award and payments made pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan are intended to qualify for an exemp\u0000on from or comply\nwith Code Sec\u0000on 409A. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement and the Plan, the Company, to the extent it deems necessary or\nadvisable in its sole discre\u0000on, reserves the right, but shall not be required, to unilaterally amend or modify this Agreement and/or the Plan so that\nthe Performance RSUs granted to the Par\u0000cipant qualify for exemp\u0000on from or comply with Code Sec\u0000on 409A; provided, however, that the\nCompany makes no representa\u0000ons that the Performance RSUs shall be exempt from or comply with Code Sec\u0000on 409A and makes no undertaking\nto preclude Code Sec\u0000on 409A from applying to the Performance RSUs. Nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall provide a basis for any person to\ntake ac\u0000on against the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company based on ma\u0000ers covered by Code Sec\u0000on 409A, including the tax\ntreatment of any amount paid or Award made under this Agreement, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates shall under any\ncircumstances have any liability to any Par\u0000cipant or his or her estate or any other party for any taxes, penal\u0000es or interest imposed under Code\nSec\u0000on 409A for any amounts paid or payable under this Agreement.\n7.3 If the ves\u0000ng of the Performance RSUs is accelerated in connec\u0000on with a Change of Control, the Performance RSUs are considered\nNQ Deferred Compensa\u0000on, and the Change of Control does not cons\u0000tute a “change in control event,” within the meaning of the U.S. Treasury\nRegula\u0000ons, then the cash equivalent of the Performance RSUs as of the date of the Change in Control shall be paid on the earliest of the applicable\nVes\u0000ng Date, the date of the Par\u0000cipant’s death or the date the Par\u0000cipant’s Ac\u0000ve Status terminates due to Disability.\n8. Responsibility for Taxes. Regardless of any ac\u0000on the Company or, if different, the Par\u0000cipant’s employer (the “Employer”) takes with respect to any\nor all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefit tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Par\u0000cipant’s par\u0000cipa\u0000on in\nthe Plan and legally applicable to the Par\u0000cipant (“Tax-Related Items”), the Par\u0000cipant acknowledges that the ul\u0000mate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and\nremains the Par\u0000cipant’s responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Par\u0000cipant further\nacknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representa\u0000ons or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in\nconnec\u0000on with any aspect of the Performance RSUs, including, but not limited to the grant of the Performance RSUs, the ves\u0000ng or se\u0000lement of the\nPerformance RSUs, the issuance of Shares in se\u0000lement of the Performance RSUs, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired at ves\u0000ng and the receipt of any\ndividends and/or any dividend equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obliga\u0000on to structure the terms of the Award or any aspect of the\nPerformance RSUs to reduce or eliminate the Par\u0000cipant’s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any par\u0000cular tax result. Furthermore, if the Par\u0000cipant is\nsubject to tax in more than one jurisdic\u0000on, the Par\u0000cipant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be\nrequired to withhold or otherwise en\u0000tled to or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdic\u0000on.\nIn connec\u0000on with any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Par\u0000cipant must pay or make adequate arrangements sa\u0000sfactory to the\nCompany and/or the Employer to sa\u0000sfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Par\u0000cipant hereby authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their\nrespec\u0000ve agents, in their sole discre\u0000on and without any no\u0000ce to or addi\u0000onal authoriza\u0000on by the Par\u0000cipant, to sa\u0000sfy their withholding obliga\u0000ons with\nregard to all Tax-Related Items, if any, by one or a combina\u0000on of the following:\n(a) withholding from the Par\u0000cipant’s wages, salary or other cash compensa\u0000on payable to the Par\u0000cipant by the Company, the Employer or any\nother Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company; or\n(b) withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares issued in se\u0000lement of the vested Performance RSUs, either through a voluntary sale or\nthrough a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on the Par\u0000cipant’s behalf pursuant to this authoriza\u0000on without further consent), to\nthe extent and in the manner permi\u0000ed by all applicable securi\u0000es laws, including making any necessary securi\u0000es registra\u0000on or taking any\nother necessary ac\u0000ons; or\n(c) withholding in Shares to be issued in se\u0000lement of the vested Performance RSUs; provided, however, that if the Par\u0000cipant is a Sec\u0000on 16\nofficer of the Company under the Exchange Act, then the Company will withhold in Shares upon the relevant taxable or tax withholding\nevent, as applicable (other than FICA or other employment Tax-Related Items that become payable in a year prior to the year that income\nTax-Related Items become payable), unless the use of such withholding method is problema\u0000c under applicable tax or securi\u0000es law or has\nmaterially adverse accoun\u0000ng consequences, in which case, the obliga\u0000on for Tax-Related Items may be sa\u0000sfied by one or a combina\u0000on of\nmethods (a) and (b) above; or\n(d) any other method of withholding determined by the Company to be permi\u0000ed under the Plan and, to the extent required by applicable law or\nunder the Plan, approved by the Commi\u0000ee.\nThe Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory or other withholding rates, including minimum or maximum rates\napplicable in the Par\u0000cipant’s jurisdic\u0000on(s), to the extent permi\u0000ed under the Plan. In the event of over-withholding, the Par\u0000cipant may receive a refund of\nany over-withheld amount in cash (with no en\u0000tlement to the Common Stock equivalent), or if not refunded by the Company, the Par\u0000cipant may seek a\nrefund from the applicable tax authori\u0000es. In the event of under-withholding, the Par\u0000cipant may be required to pay addi\u0000onal Tax-Related Items directly to\nthe applicable tax authori\u0000es or to the Company and/or the Employer. If the obliga\u0000on for Tax-Related Items is sa\u0000sfied by withholding in Shares, for tax\npurposes, the Par\u0000cipant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares underlying the vested Performance RSUs, notwithstanding that a number\nof the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of the Par\u0000cipant’s par\u0000cipa\u0000on in the Plan.\nFinally, the Par\u0000cipant is required to pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be\nrequired to withhold or account for as a result of the Par\u0000cipant’s par\u0000cipa\u0000on in the Plan that cannot be sa\u0000sfied by the means previously described. The\nCompany may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Par\u0000cipant fails to comply with his or her obliga\u0000ons in\nconnec\u0000on with the Tax-Related Items. The Par\u0000cipant shall have no further rights with respect to any Shares that are retained by the Company pursuant to\nthis provision, and under no circumstances will the Company be required to issue any frac\u0000onal Shares.\n9.

Responsibility for Taxes. Regardless of any ac\u0000on the Company or, if different, the Par\u0000cipant’s employer (the “Employer”) takes with respect to any\nor all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefit tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Par\u0000cipant’s par\u0000cipa\u0000on in\nthe Plan and legally applicable to the Par\u0000cipant (“Tax-Related Items”), the Par\u0000cipant acknowledges that the ul\u0000mate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and\nremains the Par\u0000cipant’s responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Par\u0000cipant further\nacknowledges that the Company and/or the\nEmployer (i) make no representa\u0000ons or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connec\u0000on with any aspect of the Restricted Stock\nUnits, including, but not limited to the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, the ves\u0000ng or se\u0000lement of the Restricted Stock Units, the issuance of Shares in\nse\u0000lement of the Restricted Stock Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired at ves\u0000ng and the receipt of any dividends and/or any dividend equivalents;\nand (ii) do not commit to and are under no obliga\u0000on to structure the terms of the Award or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate\nthe Par\u0000cipant’s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any par\u0000cular tax result. Furthermore, if the Par\u0000cipant is subject to tax in more than one\njurisdic\u0000on, the Par\u0000cipant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required or otherwise en\u0000tled\nto withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdic\u0000on.\nIn connec\u0000on with any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Par\u0000cipant must pay or make adequate arrangements sa\u0000sfactory to the\nCompany and/or the Employer to sa\u0000sfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Par\u0000cipant hereby authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their\nrespec\u0000ve agents, in their sole discre\u0000on and without any no\u0000ce to or addi\u0000onal authoriza\u0000on by the Par\u0000cipant, to sa\u0000sfy their withholding obliga\u0000ons with\nregard to all Tax-Related Items, if any, by one or a combina\u0000on of the following:\n(a) withholding from the Par\u0000cipant’s wages, salary or other cash compensa\u0000on payable to the Par\u0000cipant by the Company, the Employer or any\nother Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company; or\n(b) withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares issued in se\u0000lement of the vested Restricted Stock Units, either through a voluntary sale or\nthrough a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on the Par\u0000cipant’s behalf pursuant to this authoriza\u0000on without further consent), to\nthe extent and in the manner permi\u0000ed by all applicable securi\u0000es laws, including making any necessary securi\u0000es registra\u0000on or taking any\nother necessary ac\u0000ons; or\n(c) withholding in Shares to be issued in se\u0000lement of the vested Restricted Stock Units; provided, however, that if the Par\u0000cipant is a Sec\u0000on 16\nofficer of the Company under the Exchange Act, then the Company will withhold in Shares upon the relevant taxable or tax withholding\nevent, as applicable (other than FICA or other employment Tax-Related Items that become payable in a year prior to the year that income\nTax-Related Items become payable), unless the use of such withholding method is problema\u0000c under applicable tax or securi\u0000es law or has\nmaterially adverse accoun\u0000ng consequences, in which case, the obliga\u0000on for Tax-Related Items may be sa\u0000sfied by one or a combina\u0000on of\nmethods (a) and (b) above; or\n(d) any other method of withholding determined by the Company to be permi\u0000ed under the Plan and, to the extent required by applicable law or\nunder the Plan, approved by the Commi\u0000ee.\nThe Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory or other withholding rates, including minimum or maximum rates\napplicable in the Par\u0000cipant’s jurisdic\u0000on(s), to the extent permi\u0000ed under the Plan. In the event of over-withholding, the Par\u0000cipant may receive a refund of\nany over-withheld amount in cash(with no en\u0000tlement to the Common Stock equivalent), or if not refunded by the Company, the Par\u0000cipant may seek a\nrefund from the applicable tax authori\u0000es. In the event of under-withholding, the Par\u0000cipant may be required to pay addi\u0000onal Tax-Related Items directly to\nthe applicable tax authori\u0000es or to the Company and/or the Employer. If the obliga\u0000on for Tax-Related Items is sa\u0000sfied by withholding in Shares, for tax\npurposes, the Par\u0000cipant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a\nnumber of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of the Par\u0000cipant’s par\u0000cipa\u0000on in the Plan.\nFinally, the Par\u0000cipant is required to pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be\nrequired to withhold or account for as a result of the Par\u0000cipant’s par\u0000cipa\u0000on in the Plan that cannot be sa\u0000sfied by the means previously described. The\nCompany may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Par\u0000cipant fails to comply with his or her obliga\u0000ons in\nconnec\u0000on with the Tax-Related Items. The Par\u0000cipant shall have no further rights with respect to any Shares that are retained by the Company pursuant to\nthis provision, and under no circumstances will the Company be required to issue any frac\u0000onal Shares.\n8.

Responsibility for Taxes. Regardless of any ac\u0000on the Company or, if different, the Par\u0000cipant’s employer (the “Employer”) takes with respect to any\nor all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefit tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Par\u0000cipant’s par\u0000cipa\u0000on in\nthe Plan and legally applicable to the Par\u0000cipant (“Tax-Related Items”), the Par\u0000cipant acknowledges that the ul\u0000mate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and\nremains the Par\u0000cipant’s responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Par\u0000cipant further\nacknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representa\u0000ons or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in\nconnec\u0000on with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units, including, but not limited to the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, the ves\u0000ng or se\u0000lement of the\nRestricted Stock Units, the issuance of Shares in se\u0000lement of the Restricted Stock Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired at ves\u0000ng and the receipt of\nany dividends and/or any dividend equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obliga\u0000on to structure the terms of the Award or any aspect of the\nRestricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate the Par\u0000cipant’s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any par\u0000cular tax result. Furthermore, if the Par\u0000cipant\nis subject to tax in more than one jurisdic\u0000on, the Par\u0000cipant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may\nbe required or otherwise en\u0000tled to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdic\u0000on.\nIn connec\u0000on with any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Par\u0000cipant must pay or make adequate arrangements sa\u0000sfactory to the\nCompany and/or the Employer to sa\u0000sfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Par\u0000cipant hereby authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their\nrespec\u0000ve agents, in their sole discre\u0000on and without any no\u0000ce to or addi\u0000onal authoriza\u0000on by the Par\u0000cipant, to sa\u0000sfy their withholding obliga\u0000ons with\nregard to all Tax-Related Items, if any, by one or a combina\u0000on of the following:\n(a) withholding from the Par\u0000cipant’s wages, salary or other cash compensa\u0000on payable to the Par\u0000cipant by the Company, the Employer or any\nother Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company; or\n(b) withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares issued in se\u0000lement of the vested Restricted Stock Units, either through a voluntary sale or\nthrough a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on the Par\u0000cipant’s behalf pursuant to this authoriza\u0000on without further consent), to\nthe extent and in the manner permi\u0000ed by all applicable securi\u0000es laws, including making any necessary securi\u0000es registra\u0000on or taking any\nother necessary ac\u0000ons; or\n(c) withholding in Shares to be issued in se\u0000lement of the vested Restricted Stock Units; provided, however, that if the Par\u0000cipant is a Sec\u0000on 16\nofficer of the Company under the Exchange Act, then the Company will withhold in Shares upon the relevant taxable or tax withholding\nevent, as applicable (other than FICA or other employment Tax-Related Items that become payable in a year prior to the year that income\nTax-Related Items become payable), unless the use of such withholding method is problema\u0000c under applicable tax or securi\u0000es law or has\nmaterially adverse accoun\u0000ng consequences, in which case, the obliga\u0000on for Tax-Related Items may be sa\u0000sfied by one or a combina\u0000on of\nmethods (a) and (b) above; or\n(d) any other method of withholding determined by the Company to be permi\u0000ed under the Plan and, to the extent required by applicable law or\nunder the Plan, approved by the Commi\u0000ee.\nThe Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory or other withholding rates, including minimum or maximum rates\napplicable in the Par\u0000cipant’s jurisdic\u0000on(s), to the extent permi\u0000ed under the Plan. In the event of over-withholding, the Par\u0000cipant may receive a refund of\nany over-withheld amount in cash(with no en\u0000tlement to the Common Stock equivalent), or if not refunded by the Company, the Par\u0000cipant may seek a\nrefund from the applicable tax authori\u0000es. In the event of under-withholding, the Par\u0000cipant may be required to pay addi\u0000onal Tax-Related Items directly to\nthe applicable tax authori\u0000es or to the Company and/or the Employer. If the obliga\u0000on for Tax-Related Items is sa\u0000sfied by withholding in Shares, for tax\npurposes, the Par\u0000cipant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a\nnumber of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of the Par\u0000cipant’s par\u0000cipa\u0000on in the Plan.\nFinally, the Par\u0000cipant is required to pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be\nrequired to withhold or account for as a result of the Par\u0000cipant’s par\u0000cipa\u0000on in the Plan that cannot be sa\u0000sfied by the means previously described. The\nCompany may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Par\u0000cipant fails to comply with his or her obliga\u0000ons in\nconnec\u0000on with the Tax-Related Items. The Par\u0000cipant shall have no further rights with respect to any Shares that are retained by the Company pursuant to\nthis provision, and under no circumstances will the Company be required to issue any frac\u0000onal Shares.\n8.

The\nlegal basis, where required, for the processing of Data is the Par\u0000cipant’s consent.\nb) Stock Plan Administra\u0000on Service Providers. The Company transfers Data to Fidelity Plan Services, LLC and its affiliated companies\n(collec\u0000vely, “Fidelity”), an independent service provider based in the United States, which is assis\u0000ng the Company with the\nimplementa\u0000on, administra\u0000on and management of the Plan. The Company may select a different service provider or addi\u0000onal service\nproviders and share Data with such other provider(s) serving in a similar manner. The Par\u0000cipant may be asked to agree on separate\nterms and data processing prac\u0000ces with the service provider, with such agreement being a condi\u0000on to the ability to par\u0000cipate in the\nPlan.\nc) Interna\u0000onal Data Transfers.

Insider Trading/Market Abuse Laws. The Par\u0000cipant may be subject to insider trading restric\u0000ons and/or market abuse laws in applicable\njurisdic\u0000ons, including the United States and, if different, the Par\u0000cipant’s country, the Par\u0000cipant’s broker’s country and/or the country where the Shares are\nlisted, which may affect the Par\u0000cipant’s ability, directly or indirectly, for the Par\u0000cipant him- or herself or for a third party, to accept, acquire, sell or a\u0000empt\nto sell, or otherwise dispose of Shares, rights to Shares (e.g., Restricted Stock Units) or rights linked to the value of Shares during such \u0000mes as the Par\u0000cipant\nis considered to have “inside informa\u0000on” regarding the Company (as defined by the laws or regula\u0000ons in the applicable jurisdic\u0000on). Local insider trading\nlaws and regula\u0000ons may prohibit the cancella\u0000on or amendment of orders the Par\u0000cipant placed before possessing inside informa\u0000on. Furthermore, the\nPar\u0000cipant may be prohibited from (i) disclosing insider informa\u0000on to any third party (other than on a “need to know” basis) and (ii) “\u0000pping” third par\u0000es\nor causing them otherwise to buy or sell Company securi\u0000es, including third par\u0000es who are fellow employees. Any restric\u0000ons under these laws or\nregula\u0000ons are separate from and in addi\u0000on to any restric\u0000ons that may be imposed under any applicable insider trading policy of the Company. The\nPar\u0000cipant acknowledges that it is the Par\u0000cipant’s responsibility to comply with any applicable restric\u0000ons, and the Par\u0000cipant should consult with the\nPar\u0000cipant’s own personal legal and financial advisors on this ma\u0000er before taking any ac\u0000on related to the Plan.\n23. Foreign Asset/Account Repor\u0000ng; Exchange Controls. The Par\u0000cipant’s country may have certain foreign asset and/or account repor\u0000ng\nrequirements and/or exchange controls which may affect the Par\u0000cipant’s ability to acquire or hold Shares under the Plan or cash received from par\u0000cipa\u0000ng\nin the Plan (including from any dividends received or sale proceeds arising from the sale of Shares) in a brokerage or bank account outside the Par\u0000cipant’s\ncountry. The Par\u0000cipant may be required to report such accounts, assets or transac\u0000ons to the tax or other authori\u0000es in his or her country. The Par\u0000cipant\nalso may be required to repatriate sale proceeds or other funds received as a result of the Par\u0000cipant’s par\u0000cipa\u0000on in the Plan to his or her country through\na designated bank or broker and/or within a certain \u0000me a\u0000er receipt. The Par\u0000cipant acknowledges that it is his or her responsibility to comply with such\nregula\u0000ons, and the Par\u0000cipant should consult his or her personal legal advisor for any details.\n24. No Modifica\u0000on of Execu\u0000ve Severance Plan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or in the Plan, the benefits referenced\nherein that are provided pursuant to the Execu\u0000ve Severance Plan remain subject to the amendment and termina\u0000on provisions of the Execu\u0000ve Severance\nPlan.\nFinally, the Company hereby strongly recommends that the Par\u0000cipant seek the advice of a personal tax and/or legal advisor to obtain specific informa\u0000on\nconcerning the tax and other legal consequences associated with the Restricted Stock Units.\n* * *\nBy the Par\u0000cipant’s signature and the Company’s signature below, the Par\u0000cipant and the Company agree that this grant is governed by this Agreement and\nthe Plan.\nEXECUTED as of the Date of Grant.\nSTARBUCKS CORPORATION\nBy /s/ Brian Niccol\nIts chairman & ceo\nPARTICIPANT\nSignature\nExhibit 19.1\nSTARBUCKS CORPORATION\nINSIDER TRADING POLICY\nPURPOSE\nThis Insider Trading Policy (this “Policy”) sets forth the policy of, and the restric\u0000ons imposed by, Starbucks Corpora\u0000on and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries (collec\u0000vely, “Starbucks” or the “Company”) regarding transac\u0000ons in the Company’s securi\u0000es and the securi\u0000es of other\ncompanies about which you may become aware of Material Non-Public Informa\u0000on in the course of your work for Starbucks.\nAPPLIES TO\nThis Policy applies to all members of the Starbucks Board of Directors, partners (employees), and independent contractors, advisors and\nconsultants who provide services to Starbucks, regardless of whether they are resident within the United States. This Policy also applies to the\nimmediate family members of or those who live in the same household as such persons; en\u0000\u0000es such as partnerships, trusts, corpora\u0000ons, or\nfounda\u0000ons over which such persons have control; and anyone else whose transac\u0000ons are directed by such persons or are subject to their\ninfluence or control (collec\u0000vely, “Covered Persons”). As used in this Policy, “you” and “your” refer to Covered Persons. This Policy applies to\nac\u0000ons you take with respect to Material Non-Public Informa\u0000on (or “MNPI”, in each case as defined below) you possess from your work with\nthe Company and blackout periods that apply to you, even a\u0000er termina\u0000on of your employment or service. You are responsible for making\nsure that your ac\u0000ons comply with this Policy. In addi\u0000on, Starbucks will not transact in its own securi\u0000es, except in compliance with applicable\nsecuri\u0000es laws.\nPOLICY STATEMENT\nBackground. Insider trading is a top enforcement priority of the Securi\u0000es and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), other governmental bodies, and\nthe Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”). Criminal prosecu\u0000ons for insider trading are commonplace and may result in fines or imprisonment.\nAll Covered Persons should understand the breadth of ac\u0000vi\u0000es that cons\u0000tute insider trading and their consequences, which can be severe.\nEnforcement bodies employ highly sophis\u0000cated and effec\u0000ve methods to detect and inves\u0000gate insider trading. For example, the SEC has\nsuccessfully prosecuted people who traded through foreign accounts or family members and friends and who traded only a small number of\nshares.\nA viola\u0000on of this Policy may also result in Company disciplinary ac\u0000on, up to and including termina\u0000on of employment or other rela\u0000onship\nwith Starbucks as allowed by applicable law or in the case of members of the Board of Directors, being asked to resign from the Board or not be\nrenominated. In determining remedial ac\u0000on resul\u0000ng from a viola\u0000on of this Policy, Starbucks will consider a number of factors including, but\nnot limited to, the individual’s conduct substan\u0000ated through inves\u0000ga\u0000on, the individual’s coopera\u0000on, the individual’s past viola\u0000ons, if any,\nconsistency with remedial ac\u0000on for other similar viola\u0000ons, extent of the harm to the Company, the availability of res\u0000tu\u0000on, penal\u0000es\nassessed by regulators and the need for deterrence.\n1\nAnyone with ques\u0000ons about the applica\u0000on of this Policy should consult with and seek the approval of the corporate and securi\u0000es group in\nthe Law & Corporate Affairs department (CorporateSecretary@starbucks.com).\nDefini\u0000ons. The following defini\u0000ons are used throughout this Policy:\nCovered Companies. Starbucks and any company about which you may gain knowledge of MNPI by virtue of your work with Starbucks.\nCovered Securi\u0000es. Common stock, preferred stock, bonds, notes, op\u0000ons, warrants, puts, calls, and other equity and debt instruments of any\nCovered Company.\nInsiders. Members of Starbucks Board of Directors, execu\u0000ve officers, and other Covered Persons designated by the Law & Corporate Affairs\ndepartment based on their regular access to MNPI.\nTrading. All transfers for value of Covered Securi\u0000es, including purchases and sales. The term encompasses any ac\u0000ons that are intended either\nto make a profit or avoid a loss.\n“Trading” does not encompass:\n• Bona fide gi\u0000s of Covered Securi\u0000es that have been pre-approved by the corporate and securi\u0000es group in the Law & Corporate Affairs\ndepartment (CorporateSecretary@starbucks.com) do not cons\u0000tute Trades, unless the giver is restricted from Trading in those\nsecuri\u0000es under this Policy and knows that the recipient intends to Trade in the securi\u0000es while the giver remains restricted.\n• Transfers by will or the laws of descent and distribu\u0000on or transfers for tax planning purposes in which your beneficial ownership and\npecuniary interest in the transferred securi\u0000es does not change.\n• The simple exercise of a stock op\u0000on where the exercise price is paid in cash and the stock acquired upon exercise of the stock op\u0000on is\nnot sold. This is commonly referred to as an “exercise and hold” transac\u0000on. “Trading” does include “cashless” exercises of stock\nop\u0000ons because a “cashless” exercise involves the sale of stock in the open market to pay the exercise price of the stock op\u0000on. This\nPolicy also applies to the sale of the underlying security (including any sale of units through a “same day cashless exercise” of op\u0000ons\nfunded by a broker) or any other market sale for the purpose of genera\u0000ng the cash needed to pay the exercise price of a stock op\u0000on.\n• The ves\u0000ng of restricted stock units or the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which you elect to have the Company\nwithhold shares of stock to sa\u0000sfy tax withholding requirements upon the ves\u0000ng of any restricted stock units. This Policy does,\nhowever, apply to any market sales of restricted stock units.\n• Purchases of Starbucks stock under the Company’s employee stock purchase plans, which include the “S.I.P.” plans for the United\nStates, resul\u0000ng from periodic contribu\u0000ons to the plans pursuant to the elec\u0000ons made at the \u0000me of enrollment in the plans.\n“Trading” does include your elec\u0000on to par\u0000cipate in, or increase or decrease the amount of contribu\u0000ons to, an employee stock\npurchase plan and to sales of Starbucks stock purchased under any employee stock purchase plan.\n• Purchases of Covered Securi\u0000es under the Company’s dividend reinvestment plan (the “DRIP”) resul\u0000ng from your reinvestment of\ndividends paid on Covered Securi\u0000es. “Trading” does include purchases of Covered Securi\u0000es resul\u0000ng from addi\u0000onal contribu\u0000ons\nyou choose to make to the DRIP, your elec\u0000on to par\u0000cipate in the DRIP, or your elec\u0000on to increase your level of par\u0000cipa\u0000on in the\nDRIP. This Policy does apply to your sale of any Covered Securi\u0000es purchased pursuant to the DRIP.\nMaterial Non-Public Informa\u0000on. There is no bright-line test of what cons\u0000tutes material non-public informa\u0000on (“MNPI”). For purposes of this\nPolicy, informa\u0000on is material if there is a reasonable likelihood that an investor would consider the informa\u0000on important in making a decision\nto buy, sell, or hold a Covered Security. Both posi\u0000ve and nega\u0000ve informa\u0000on can be material, as well as informa\u0000on that forecasts whether an\nevent may or may not occur. Examples of poten\u0000ally material informa\u0000on include:\n• Financial and opera\u0000ng results or informa\u0000on, whether historical, actual or forecasts;\n• Change of the Company’s independent registered public accoun\u0000ng firm;\n• Significant new product or business launches or significant pricing changes;\n2\n• A pending or prospec\u0000ve merger, acquisi\u0000on, tender offer, joint venture or an acquisi\u0000on or disposi\u0000on of significant assets;\n• New major contracts, customers, or the loss of such contracts;\n• The sale of significant assets or a significant subsidiary, or a significant asset write-down;\n• Changes in senior management or a change in control;\n• Significant legal proceedings or regulatory developments;\n• Events regarding Starbucks securi\u0000es – e.g., a default on senior securi\u0000es, the call of a class of securi\u0000es for redemp\u0000on, stock\nrepurchase plans, stock splits, changes in dividends, changes to the rights of security holders, or public or private sales of addi\u0000onal\nsecuri\u0000es;\n• Poten\u0000al restatements of the Company’s financial statements, changes in auditors, or a no\u0000fica\u0000on that the issuer may no longer rely\non an audit report; and\n• Significant cybersecurity, data privacy, or food safety incidents.\nInforma\u0000on is “non-public” if it has not been previously disclosed and is not otherwise available to investors generally. Even informa\u0000on that\nhas been reported by the media or is the subject of widespread rumors may s\u0000ll be “non-public.” Generally, informa\u0000on about Starbucks that is\nbroadly disseminated through a Company press release or other formal financial filing will be considered public a\u0000er one full trading day (a\n“trading day” is a day on which the Nasdaq is open for business), which is typically long enough for that informa\u0000on to be absorbed by the\nfinancial markets. Informa\u0000on about other Covered Companies may require a longer period before it can be considered public.\nIn communica\u0000ng MNPI to Covered Persons, all Covered Persons must take care to emphasize the need for confiden\u0000al treatment of such\ninforma\u0000on and adherence to the Company’s policies with regard to confiden\u0000al informa\u0000on. This includes taking precau\u0000ons to prevent\nunauthorized disclosure of MNPI about the Company in accordance with such other policies. Prohibi\u0000ons and procedures rela\u0000ng to the\ninternal and external dissemina\u0000on of MNPI are addressed in the Company’s Disclosure Policy.\nThe Company will provide training programs designed to promote compliance with insider trading laws and this Policy no less than every other\nyear. Par\u0000cipa\u0000on by partners at the manager level and above in such programs is mandatory.\nIf you have ques\u0000ons whether informa\u0000on is MNPI, please contact the corporate and securi\u0000es group in the Law & Corporate Affairs\ndepartment (CorporateSecretary@starbucks.com).\nRestric\u0000ons. All Covered Persons are prohibited from taking the following ac\u0000ons:\nTrading in Covered Securi\u0000es while in possession of MNPI. Covered Persons may not Trade in Covered Securi\u0000es, including those of Starbucks or\nany other Covered Company, while they are in possession of MNPI regarding the company. Trading pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan that follows the\nrequirements of the guidelines set forth in the Appendix does not violate this provision of the Policy.\nTrading in Coffee and Dairy Futures or Op\u0000ons. Covered Persons may not directly or indirectly Trade in coffee or dairy futures, op\u0000ons, or\nsimilar instruments for their own accounts when they are in possession of MNPI about Starbucks trading ac\u0000vi\u0000es in coffee or dairy markets.\nTipping. Covered Persons may not disclose MNPI rela\u0000ng to Starbucks or any other Covered Company to any other person, except when such\nother person needs to know such informa\u0000on in order for Starbucks to effec\u0000vely conduct business and there is no reason to believe that the\ninforma\u0000on will be used for improper Trading or inappropriately disclosed by such person. Under no circumstances may Covered Persons who\nare in possession of MNPI recommend any ac\u0000on regarding Trades in Covered Securi\u0000es to any other person.\nShort Sales. Covered Persons may never engage in “short” sales of Covered Securi\u0000es or transac\u0000ons that are profitable only if the market price\nof the securi\u0000es declines. Short sales usually involve agreeing to sell securi\u0000es you do not currently own. These include “sales against the box”\n(sales with delayed delivery). For member of the Starbucks Board of\n3\nDirectors and certain Company officers, these sales also violate sec\u0000on 16 of the Securi\u0000es Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange\nAct”).\nPublicly Traded Op\u0000ons. Covered Persons may never buy, sell, or hold publicly traded op\u0000ons (such as puts or calls) or other deriva\u0000ves of\nCovered Securi\u0000es on an exchange or in any other organized market. Transac\u0000on in op\u0000ons is, in effect, a bet on the short-term movement of a\nCompany’s stock and can create the appearance that the Covered Person is Trading based on inside informa\u0000on.\nHedging. Covered Persons may never engage in any hedging or mone\u0000za\u0000on transac\u0000ons, such as zero-cost collars and prepaid variable\nforward contracts, which involve establishing a short posi\u0000on in Covered Securi\u0000es and limit or eliminate both the risks and rewards of holding\nthe securi\u0000es, or any other hedging transac\u0000ons designed to hedge or off-set decreases in the market value of Covered Securi\u0000es. These\ntransac\u0000ons may lead to a misalignment of the interests of Covered Person and the interests of the Company.\nLong-Dura\u0000on Standing Orders. Covered Persons may not enter into standing orders regarding Covered Securi\u0000es with a dura\u0000on of greater\nthan five days. A standing order placed with a broker to sell or purchase stock at a specified price leaves you with no control over the \u0000ming of\nthe transac\u0000on, and that transac\u0000on may occur when you are prohibited from Trading.\nMargin Accounts. Covered Persons may never hold Covered Securi\u0000es in a margin account. Securi\u0000es held in a margin account may be sold\nwithout your consent by the broker if you fail to meet a margin call, and that sale may occur when you are prohibited from Trading.\nPledging. Covered Persons may never pledge Covered Securi\u0000es as collateral for a loan. Securi\u0000es pledged as collateral for a loan may be sold\nwithout your consent by the lender in foreclosure if you default on the loan, and that sale may occur when you are prohibited from Trading.\nSpecial Provisions Applicable to Members of the Board of Directors, Execu\u0000ve Officers, and Certain Designated Persons. Certain designated\npersons are subject to addi\u0000onal restric\u0000ons, below:\nCoffee and Dairy Futures or Op\u0000ons\nMembers of the Starbucks Board of Directors, execu\u0000ve officers of the Company, partners in the Company’s procurement team for coffee or\ndairy, and partners who are aware of the Company’s purchasing ac\u0000vity of coffee or dairy may never directly or indirectly Trade in coffee or\ndairy futures, op\u0000ons, or similar instruments for their own account, regardless of whether they are in possession of MNPI regarding Starbucks\ntrading ac\u0000vi\u0000es in coffee or dairy futures.\nPre-Clearance\nMembers of Starbucks Board of Directors and execu\u0000ve officers of the Company, together with their immediate family members, other\nmembers of their households, and any other person or en\u0000ty whose Trading in Covered Securi\u0000es they influence or control (each, a\n“Preclearance Person”), must follow the pre-clearance procedures established by the general counsel before conduc\u0000ng any Trades in or\notherwise transferring the Company’s securi\u0000es, including the making of any gi\u0000s or dona\u0000ons of the Company’s securi\u0000es. Neither the\nCompany nor any of the Company’s officers, partners, or other representa\u0000ves, will be deemed, by par\u0000cipa\u0000ng in such pre-clearance\nprocedures, to have provided any legal advice or to have acknowledged for any purpose that the person reques\u0000ng pre-clearance is not then in\npossession of any MNPI.\nPrior to directly or indirectly engaging in, or entering into a 10b5-1 Plan for engaging in, transac\u0000ons in Covered Securi\u0000es, each Preclearance\nPerson is required to contact the corporate and securi\u0000es group in the Law & Corporate Affairs department\n(CorporateSecretary@starbucks.com) and make an ini\u0000al determina\u0000on whether the Company and/or such Preclearance Person is in\npossession of MNPI rela\u0000ng to the Covered Securi\u0000es.\nThe Preclearance Person will be permi\u0000ed to proceed with a proposed transac\u0000on or entry into a proposed 10b5-1 plan only a\u0000er (i) the ini\u0000al\ndetermina\u0000on pursuant to the previous paragraph that no MNPI is possessed, (ii) submi\u0000ng (at\n4\nleast two days prior to any desired transac\u0000on or entry into a proposed 10b5-1 plan) a cer\u0000fica\u0000on that the Preclearance Person is not in\npossession of MNPI, in the form a\u0000ached hereto as Exhibit A, and (iii) having their request for pre-clearance approved by the corporate and\nsecuri\u0000es group in the Law & Corporate Affairs department in wri\u0000ng or via e-mail.\nIf a transac\u0000on or entry into a 10b5-1 plan is pre-cleared in accordance with this Policy, a Preclearance Person will then have two business days\nto effect the transac\u0000on or enter into the 10b5-1 plan. However, if a Preclearance Person becomes aware of MNPI or becomes subject to a\nBlackout Period (as discussed below) a\u0000er receiving pre-clearance, but before the transac\u0000on has been executed or the 10b5-1 plan is entered\ninto, that person is prohibited from effec\u0000ng the pre-cleared transac\u0000on or entering into the pre-cleared 10b5-1 plan.\nThe corporate and securi\u0000es group in the Law & Corporate Affairs department is under no obliga\u0000on to approve a request under the pre-\nclearance procedures provided for under this Policy and may determine to reject any request for any reason, even if the proposed transac\u0000on\nor 10b5-1 plan would not violate the federal securi\u0000es laws or a specific provision of this Policy. The corporate and securi\u0000es group in the Law\n& Corporate Affairs department should consult others, as necessary, to gather informa\u0000on relevant to any request under this sec\u0000on of the\nPolicy, and maintain wri\u0000en records of all such requests, including the cer\u0000fica\u0000on set forth in Exhibit A hereto, and the bases for approving\nsuch requests.\nBlackout Periods\nInsiders will be subject to quarterly earnings blackout periods during which they may not Trade in Starbucks Covered Securi\u0000es regardless of\nwhether they possess MNPI. These regular earnings blackout periods begin at the end of trading on the Nasdaq on the third Friday prior to the\nend of each fiscal quarter and end at the end of trading on the Nasdaq on the first trading day a\u0000er the Company releases its earnings for the\nquarter, unless extended by the general counsel.\nAddi\u0000onally, the Company may establish addi\u0000onal blackout periods in view of significant events and developments involving the Company.\nDuring those event-specific blackout periods, those persons designated by the Law & Corporate Affairs department to be likely to have MNPI\nregarding those events may not Trade in Starbucks Covered Securi\u0000es.\nAn Insider who is subject to a quarterly earnings blackout period and who has an extraordinary, unexpected, and urgent need to sell Company\nstock in order to generate cash may be permi\u0000ed to sell Starbucks Covered Securi\u0000es even during the quarterly blackout period if such Insider\nis not, in fact, in possession of any MNPI regarding the Company. Such a hardship excep\u0000on may be granted only by the general counsel upon\nreview of the par\u0000cular facts and circumstances and must be requested at least two days in advance of the proposed Trade. However, even if\ngranted a hardship excep\u0000on, you cannot Trade if you are in possession of MNPI. Under no circumstance will a hardship excep\u0000on be granted\nduring an event-specific blackout period or to a member of the Starbucks Board of Directors or execu\u0000ve officer. Neither the Company, nor any\nof the Company’s officers, partners, or other representa\u0000ves, will be deemed, by par\u0000cipa\u0000ng in such hardship excep\u0000on procedures, to have\nprovided any legal advice or to have acknowledged for any purpose that the person reques\u0000ng the hardship exemp\u0000on does not then possess\nany MNPI.\nTrading pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan that follows the requirements of the guidelines set forth in the Appendix does not violate this provision of\nthe Policy even if it occurs during a blackout period.\nIt is important for all Covered Persons to understand that, while they must follow this Policy with respect to any blackout period, their legal\ndu\u0000es arise from the federal securi\u0000es laws, not the Company’s designa\u0000on of blackout periods. Everyone has a personal obliga\u0000on not to\nTrade while in possession of MNPI regardless of whether they are on the blackout list or whether the day on which they wish to Trade falls\noutside a blackout period. Compliance with the blackout period does not by itself cons\u0000tute compliance with the law or this Policy.\nInterpreta\u0000on; Amendment\nThe Company’s chief financial officer and general counsel will have the authority to interpret this Policy. Further, while the Company has\nendeavored to an\u0000cipate likely scenarios and events in cra\u0000ing this Policy, the Company’s chief\n5\nfinancial officer or general counsel may make excep\u0000ons to this Policy in the context of unan\u0000cipated or extraordinary scenarios or events. The\nNomina\u0000ng and Corporate Governance Commi\u0000ee may modify or amend this Policy at any \u0000me.\n6\nAppendix\nSpecial Guidelines for 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nCovered Persons may elect to enter into a 10b5-1 trading plan. Trades pursuant to a 10b5-1 trading plan that follows the requirements of this\nAppendix do not cons\u0000tute Trading while in possession of MNPI, or Trading during a blackout period, in viola\u0000on of this Policy.\nThe terms “amount”, “price”, and “date”, as used below, are defined in Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act (“the Rule”).\nA) The transac\u0000on must be made pursuant to a wri\u0000en plan (a “Plan”) entered into in good faith that complies with the Rule. The Covered\nPerson must also act in good faith throughout the dura\u0000on of the Plan. Without limi\u0000ng the foregoing, each Plan:\n1. for directors and Sec\u0000on 16 officers of the Company, is subject to a cooling-off period between the date the Plan is adopted or\nmodified and the first transac\u0000ons under the Plan. This cooling off period runs through the expira\u0000on of a period consis\u0000ng of the\nlater of: (1) 90 days a\u0000er the Plan is adopted or modified, or (2) two business days following the filing of Starbucks Form 10-Q or\nForm 10-K for the fiscal quarter in which the Plan was adopted or modified (but not to exceed 120 days following the date the Plan\nwas adopted or modified) (such \u0000me period, the “D&O Cooling Off Period”);\n2. for all other Covered Persons, is subject to a cooling-off period between the date the Plan is adopted or modified and the first\ntransac\u0000ons under the Plan, which runs through the expira\u0000on of a 30-day period a\u0000er the Plan is adopted or modified (such \u0000me\nperiod, the “Covered Persons Cooling Off Period, and, together with the D&O Cooling Off Period, the “Cooling Off Period”);\n3. must be established or modified at a \u0000me when there is no blackout period, and the Covered Person is not then in possession of\nany MNPI;\n4. must contain a wri\u0000en cer\u0000fica\u0000on at the \u0000me of establishment or modifica\u0000on that (i) the Covered Person is not aware of MNPI\nabout the Company or its securi\u0000es, and (ii) that the Covered Person is adop\u0000ng or modifying the Plan in good faith and not as part\nof a plan or scheme to evade the prohibi\u0000ons of the Rule in the form a\u0000ached hereto as Exhibit B;\n5. must specify the amount of Covered Securi\u0000es to be purchased or sold and the price at which and the date on which the Covered\nSecuri\u0000es are to be purchased or sold (or must include a wri\u0000en formula or algorithm or computer program for determining the\namount of securi\u0000es to be purchased or sold and the price at which and the date on which the securi\u0000es are to be purchased or\nsold); gran\u0000ng discre\u0000on to the Covered Person’s broker or other representa\u0000ve to determine the amount, \u0000me, and price of the\nsecuri\u0000es to be purchased or sold (other than discre\u0000on in connec\u0000on with the orderly execu\u0000on of a “limit” order) is prohibited;\n6. must prohibit the Covered Person and any other person who is then in possession of MNPI from exercising any subsequent\ninfluence over how, when, or whether to effect purchases or sales;\n7. must provide appropriate mechanisms to ensure that the Covered Person complies with all applicable rules and regula\u0000ons;\n8. must provide for the suspension of all transac\u0000ons under such Plan in the event the Company, in its sole discre\u0000on, deems such\nsuspension necessary and advisable, including suspensions necessary to comply with trading restric\u0000ons imposed in connec\u0000on\nwith any lock-up agreement required in connec\u0000on with a securi\u0000es issuance transac\u0000on or other similar events; and\n9. must prohibit Trades during the 30 days following the termina\u0000on (not including expira\u0000on) of the Plan.\nYou can generally only have one Plan in effect at a \u0000me, except as otherwise permi\u0000ed by Rule 10b5-1. You can adopt a successor Plan if\ntrades under that plan are not scheduled to begin un\u0000l trades under your predecessor plan are completed or expire without execu\u0000on;\nhowever, if you adopt a successor Plan and then terminate your predecessor Plan early, the date of termina\u0000on of your predecessor Plan\nwill be deemed to be the date of adop\u0000on of your successor plan and will trigger a new Cooling Off Period star\u0000ng from that date. You can\ngenerally only adopt\n7\none single-trade plan during any 12-month period. In general, a single trade plan is a Plan that is designed to effect an open-market trade of\nthe total amount of securi\u0000es in a single transac\u0000on.\nIn addi\u0000on, modifica\u0000ons to the amount, price or \u0000ming (or to a wri\u0000en formula, algorithm or computer program affec\u0000ng the amount,\nprice or \u0000ming) of the purchase or sale of securi\u0000es are deemed to be a termina\u0000on of a plan and adop\u0000on of a new plan, and as a result\nare subject to the \u0000ming restric\u0000ons described above.\nB) Each Plan, and every modifica\u0000on to, devia\u0000on from, or termina\u0000on of each Plan, must be pre-cleared in advance by the corporate and\nsecuri\u0000es group in the Law & Corporate Affairs department (CorporateSecretary@starbucks.com). A copy of the executed version of any\npre-cleared Plan must be provided to the corporate and securi\u0000es group. The Company reserves the right to withhold pre-clearance of any\nPlan, modifica\u0000on, devia\u0000on, or termina\u0000on that the corporate and securi\u0000es group determines:\n1. fails to comply with the Rule;\n2. exposes the Company or the Insider to liability under any other applicable state or federal rule, regula\u0000on, or law;\n3. creates any appearance of impropriety;\n4. fails to meet the guidelines established by the Company; or\n5. otherwise fails to sa\u0000sfy review by the general counsel or their designees for any reason.\nC) Neither the Company, nor any of the Company’s officers, partners, or other representa\u0000ves, will be deemed, solely by their pre-clearance\nof a Plan, to have represented that any Plan complies with the Rule or to have assumed any liability or responsibility to the Insider or any\nother party if such Plan fails to comply with the Rule.\nD) The general counsel is authorized to develop, a\u0000er the date hereof, further guidelines for individual Plans, or to modify, amend,\nsupplement, delete, or otherwise change these guidelines, as they deem, in their sole discre\u0000on, necessary or appropriate in order to\nfurther the purpose of these guidelines.\nE) The Company shall disclose informa\u0000on regarding Plans adopted by directors and officers as required by Item 408(a) of Regula\u0000on S-K\n(including your name and \u0000tle; the date of Plan adop\u0000on, amendment or termina\u0000on; the dura\u0000on of the Plan; and the aggregate number\nof securi\u0000es to be traded under the Plan) and may make a public announcement that Plans are being implemented in accordance with Rule\n10b5-1. It will consider in each case whether a public announcement of a par\u0000cular Plan should be made. It may also make public\nannouncements or respond to inquiries from the media as transac\u0000ons are made under a Plan.\nSUPPORTING INFORMATION\nPOLICY\n• Global Business Ethics Policy\nSUPPLEMENTAL DOCUMENTS\n• Trading Calendar for current Fiscal Year\n• FAQs & Other Stock Trading Restric\u0000ons\n8\nExhibit 21\nSUBSIDIARIES OF STARBUCKS CORPORATION\nThe list below excludes certain subsidiaries which, considered in the aggregate as a single subsidiary, would not constitute a significant subsidiary under SEC\nrules as of September 29, 2024.\nEntity Name Organized Under the Laws of:\nShanghai Starbucks Coffee Enterprise Co., Ltd.
