          "content": "GILEAD SCIENCES ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nProduct Sales Excluding Veklury Increased 7% Year-Over-Year to $6.8 billion\nBiktarvy Sales Increased 13% Year-Over-Year to $3.5 billion\nOncology Sales Increased 6% Year-Over-Year to $816 million\nFoster City, CA, November 6, 2024 - Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) announced today its third quarter\n2024 results of operations.\n“Gilead’s third quarter results are the strongest of the year to date, with 7% year-over-year revenue growth,\nincluding 13% year-over-year growth for Biktarvy. Based on this very strong topline growth and disciplined\noperating expense management, we are increasing our full year revenue, operating income, and earnings per\nshare guidance,” said Daniel O’Day, Gilead’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We are excited to further\nincrease our impact for patients and communities in the months ahead. This includes building on the\nmomentum from the U.S. launch of Livdelzi for primary biliary cholangitis and preparing for the potential\nlaunch of the first twice-yearly option for HIV prevention option, lenacapavir.”\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n• Total third quarter 2024 revenue increased 7% to $7.5 billion compared to the same period in 2023,\nprimarily due to higher sales in HIV as well as in Veklury® (remdesivir), Oncology and Liver Disease.\n• Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) was $1.00 in the third quarter 2024 compared to $1.73 in the same\nperiod in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a pre-tax in-process research and development\n(“IPR&D”) impairment of $1.75 billion, or $1.04 per share net of tax impact, related to assets acquired\nby Gilead from Immunomedics, Inc. (“Immunomedics”) in 2020, as well as higher acquired IPR&D\nexpense. This was partially offset by higher product sales and higher net unrealized gains on equity\nsecurities.\n• Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.02 in the third quarter 2024 compared to $2.29 in the same period in\n2023. The decrease was primarily driven by higher acquired IPR&D and tax expense, partially offset by\nhigher product sales.\n• As of September 30, 2024, Gilead had $5.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt\nsecurities compared to $8.4 billion as of December 31, 2023. The decrease primarily reflects the $3.9\nbillion acquisition of CymaBay Therapeutics, Inc.\n• During the third quarter 2024 Gilead generated $4.3 billion in operating cash flow.\n• During the third quarter 2024 Gilead paid dividends of $983 million and repurchased $300 million of\ncommon stock.\nThird Quarter 2024 Product Sales\nTotal third quarter 2024 product sales increased 7% to $7.5 billion compared to the same period in 2023. Total\nthird quarter 2024 product sales, excluding Veklury, increased 7% to $6.8 billion compared to the same period\nin 2023, primarily due to higher sales in HIV as well as in Oncology and Liver Disease.\nNovember 6, 2024 2\nHIV product sales increased 9% to $5.1 billion in the third quarter 2024 compared to the same period in 2023,\ndriven by higher average realized price, primarily due to shifts in channel mix, and higher demand, partially\noffset by inventory dynamics.\n• Biktarvy® (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200mg (“FTC”)/tenofovir alafenamide 25mg (“TAF”)) sales\nincreased 13% to $3.5 billion in the third quarter 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily\ndriven by higher demand and average realized price, partially offset by inventory dynamics.\n• Descovy® (FTC 200mg/TAF 25mg) sales increased 15% to $586 million in the third quarter 2024\ncompared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by higher demand and average realized price,\npartially offset by inventory dynamics.\nThe Liver Disease portfolio sales increased 4% to $733 million in the third quarter 2024 compared to the same\nperiod in 2023. This was primarily driven by higher demand in viral hepatitis medicines, partially offset by\nunfavorable pricing dynamics.\nVeklury sales increased 9% to $692 million in the third quarter 2024 compared to the same period in 2023,\nprimarily driven by increased rates of COVID-19 related hospitalizations, particularly in the United States.\nCell Therapy product sales of $485 million in the third quarter 2024 were relatively flat compared to the same\nperiod in 2023.\n• Yescarta® (axicabtagene ciloleucel) sales decreased 1% to $387 million in the third quarter 2024\ncompared to the same period in 2023, reflecting increased in- and out-of-class competition in the\nUnited States, partially offset by increased demand in relapsed or refractory (“R/R”) large B-cell\nlymphoma (“LBCL”) in other regions.\n• Tecartus® (brexucabtagene autoleucel) sales increased 2% to $98 million in the third quarter 2024\ncompared to the same period in 2023, driven by increased demand in adult acute lymphoblastic\nleukemia (“ALL”).\nTrodelvy® (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy) sales increased 17% to $332 million in the third quarter 2024\ncompared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by higher demand across all regions.\nThird Quarter 2024 Product Gross Margin, Operating Expenses and Effective Tax Rate\n• Product gross margin was 79.1% in the third quarter 2024 compared to 77.6% in the same period in\n2023. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 86.8% in the third quarter 2024 compared to 85.9% in the\nsame period in 2023. The increases in GAAP and non-GAAP were primarily driven by product mix.\n• Research & development (“R&D”) expenses and non-GAAP R&D expenses were $1.4 billion in the third\nquarter 2024 compared to $1.5 billion in the same period in 2023. The decreases were primarily driven\nby the timing of clinical activities, including the wind-down of the magrolimab and obeldesivir COVID\nprograms.\n• Acquired IPR&D expenses were $505 million in the third quarter 2024, primarily driven by a $320\nmillion charge related to the buy-out of global Livdelzi® (seladelpar) royalties from Janssen\nPharmaceutica NV, as well as payments related to ongoing collaborations.\n• IPR&D impairment was $1.75 billion related to the assets acquired from Immunomedics in 2020 with\nno similar charges in 2023.\n• Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses and non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $1.4 billion\nin the third quarter 2024 compared to $1.3 billion in the same period in 2023. The increases reflect the\ntiming of commercial activities, including the launch of Livdelzi in the United States, and other\ncorporate activities.\nNovember 6, 2024 3\n• The effective tax rate (“ETR”) was (31.1)% in the third quarter 2024 compared to 6.3% in the same\nperiod in 2023. The decrease in ETR primarily reflects the impact of a legal entity restructuring and the\naforementioned Immunomedics IPR&D impairment expense, partially offset by a prior year decrease\nin tax reserves that did not repeat. Non-GAAP ETR was 17.5% in the third quarter 2024 compared to\n7.0% in the same period in 2023, primarily reflecting the impact of the prior year decrease in tax\nreserves.\nGuidance and Outlook\nFor the full-year 2024, Gilead expects:\nNovember 6, 2024 Guidance\n(in millions, except per share amounts) Low End High End Comparison to August 8, 2024 Guidance\nProduct sales $ 27,800 $ 28,100 Previously $27,100 to $27,500\nProduct sales, excluding Veklury $ 26,000 $ 26,300 Previously $25,800 to $26,200\nVeklury $ 1,800 $ 1,800 Previously $1,300\nDiluted EPS $ 0.05 $ 0.25 Previously $0.00 to $0.30\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS $ 4.25 $ 4.45 Previously $3.60 to $3.90\nAdditional information and a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information for the 2024\nguidance is provided in the accompanying tables. The financial guidance is subject to a number of risks and\nuncertainties. See the Forward-Looking Statements section below.\nKey Updates Since Our Last Quarterly Release\nVirology\n• Announced results of PURPOSE 2, the second Phase 3 study of twice-yearly lenacapavir for HIV\nprevention, with data presented at the HIV Research for Prevention Conference. In the lenacapavir\ngroup, 99.9% of participants did not acquire HIV infection, with 2 incident cases among 2,179\nparticipants. Lenacapavir reduced HIV infections by 96% compared to background HIV incidence in\ncisgender men and gender-diverse people, and additionally demonstrated superiority to daily\nTruvada® (FTC 200mg and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300mg; 89% relative risk reduction).\nLenacapavir was generally well-tolerated and no significant or new safety concerns were identified.\nGilead expects to file for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval before the end of the\nyear, with global filings to follow. The use of lenacapavir for the prevention of HIV is investigational.\n• Presented HIV treatment data at the Infection Disease Week (“IDWeek”) meeting, including Week 48\ndata from the Phase 2 study evaluating the investigational oral once-weekly combination regimen of\nlenacapavir with Merck’s, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada (“Merck”), islatravir.\nIn addition, Phase 1a data of the investigational once-weekly GS-1720 and 3-year follow up from the\nPhase 2/3 CAPELLA trial of twice-yearly lenacapavir in people with multi-drug resistant HIV were also\nhighlighted.\n• Signed royalty-free voluntary licensing agreements with six manufacturers to make and sell generic\nlenacapavir for HIV prevention and for HIV treatment in heavily treatment-experienced adults with\nmulti-drug resistant HIV in 120 high-incidence, resource-limited countries, subject to regulatory\napproval of lenacapavir in those markets.\n• Presented data at IDWeek from the Phase 3 BIRCH and OAKTREE trials of investigational obeldesivir in\nnon-hospitalized participants at high-risk or standard-risk for severe COVID-19, respectively.\nPreviously, Gilead announced the early termination of the BIRCH trial and top-line results from the\nOAKTREE trial which found that while the study did not meet its primary endpoint, obeldesivir was\nfound to have a generally well tolerated safety profile. The detailed data presented add to the breadth\nof safety data on obeldesivir.\nNovember 6, 2024 4\n• Donated approximately 5,000 vials of remdesivir to the Rwanda Medical Supply in response to the\nMarburg Virus Disease (“MVD”) outbreak for emergency use. Remdesivir is not approved for the\ntreatment of MVD anywhere globally, and the safety and efficacy of this use is not known.\nOncology\n• Announced abstracts for the American Society of Hematology 2024 Annual Meeting (“ASH”), including\npreliminary data from the registrational Phase 2 iMMagine-1 trial evaluating the Arcellx, Inc.\n(“Arcellx”) partnered investigational CAR T anito-cel (anitocabtagene autoleucel) in R/R multiple\nmyeloma, as well as updated results from the Phase 1 trial. Additionally, the first patient has been\ndosed in the Phase 3 iMMagine-3 trial in 2L+ R/R multiple myeloma.\n• Announced ASH abstracts for long-term follow-up of Yescarta in R/R indolent non-Hodgkin’s\nlymphoma and Tecartus in R/R mantle cell lymphoma, as well as real world data for Tecartus in B-cell\nprecursor ALL.\n• Presented Trodelvy data at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer World\nConference on Lung Cancer across first- and second-line advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung\ncancer, as well as in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. The use of Trodelvy for lung cancer is\ninvestigational.\n• Announced plans to voluntarily withdraw the U.S. accelerated approval of Trodelvy for use in pre-\ntreated adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, following the results of\nthe Phase 3 TROPiCS-04 trial announced in May 2024.\n• Received FDA Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy Designation for the evaluation of Yescarta as\nfirst-line treatment for adult patients with newly diagnosed, high-risk LBCL, an investigational use.\nInflammation\n• Received FDA accelerated approval for Livdelzi for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis in\ncombination with ursodeoxycholic acid (“UDCA”) in adults who have an inadequate response to UDCA,\nor as monotherapy in patients unable to tolerate UDCA. The use of Livdelzi is not recommended for\npeople who have or develop decompensated cirrhosis.\nCorporate\n• Announced a strategic collaboration with Genesis Therapeutics, Inc. (“Genesis”) to discover and\ndevelop novel small molecule therapies across multiple targets using Genesis’ GEMS AI platform.\n• The Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock for the fourth quarter of\n2024. The dividend is payable on December 30, 2024, to stockholders of record at the close of\nbusiness on December 13, 2024. Future dividends will be subject to Board approval.\nCertain amounts and percentages in this press release may not sum or recalculate due to rounding.\nConference Call\nAt 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time today, Gilead will host a conference call to discuss Gilead’s results. A live webcast will\nbe available on http://investors.gilead.com and will be archived on www.gilead.com for one year.\nNovember 6, 2024 5\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThe information presented in this document has been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (“GAAP”), unless otherwise noted as non-GAAP. Management believes non-GAAP\ninformation is useful for investors, when considered in conjunction with Gilead’s GAAP financial information,\nbecause management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning\npurposes. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and should\nonly be used to supplement an understanding of Gilead’s operating results as reported under GAAP. Non-\nGAAP financial information generally excludes acquisition-related expenses including amortization of acquired\nintangible assets and other items that are considered unusual or not representative of underlying trends of\nGilead’s business, fair value adjustments of equity securities and discrete and related tax charges or benefits\nassociated with such exclusions as well as changes in tax-related laws and guidelines, transfers of intangible\nassets between certain legal entities, and legal entity restructurings. Although Gilead consistently excludes the\namortization of acquired intangible assets from the non-GAAP financial information, management believes\nthat it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of\nacquisitions and contribute to ongoing revenue generation. Non-GAAP measures may be defined and\ncalculated differently by other companies in the same industry. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial\nmeasures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the accompanying tables.\nAbout Gilead Sciences\nGilead Sciences, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that has pursued and achieved breakthroughs in\nmedicine for more than three decades, with the goal of creating a healthier world for all people.

Gilead cautions readers that\nforward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to\ndiffer materially. These risks and uncertainties include those relating to: Gilead’s ability to achieve its\nanticipated full year 2024 financial results, including as a result of the uncertainty of the amount and timing of\nVeklury revenues; Gilead’s ability to make progress on any of its long-term ambitions or priorities laid out in its\ncorporate strategy; Gilead’s ability to accelerate or sustain revenues for its virology, oncology and other\nprograms; Gilead’s ability to realize the potential benefits of acquisitions, collaborations or licensing\narrangements, including the arrangements with Arcellx, Genesis and Merck; patent protection and estimated\nloss of exclusivity for our products and product candidates; Gilead’s ability to initiate, progress or complete\nclinical trials within currently anticipated timeframes or at all, the possibility of unfavorable results from\nongoing and additional clinical trials, including those involving Trodelvy, anito-cel, GS-1720, lenacapavir, and\nobeldesivir (such as the BIRCH, CAPELLA, iMMagine-1, iMMagine-3, OAKTREE, and PURPOSE-2 studies), and\nthe risk that safety and efficacy data from clinical trials may not warrant further development of Gilead’s\nproduct candidates or the product candidates of Gilead’s strategic partners; Gilead’s ability to submit new\ndrug applications for new product candidates or expanded indications in the currently anticipated timelines,\nincluding for lenacapavir for HIV PrEP; Gilead’s ability to receive or maintain regulatory approvals in a timely\nmanner or at all, and the risk that any such approvals, if granted, may be subject to significant limitations on\nuse and may be subject to withdrawal or other adverse actions by the applicable regulatory authority; Gilead’s\nability to successfully commercialize its products; the risk of potential disruptions to the manufacturing and\nsupply chain of Gilead’s products; pricing and reimbursement pressures from government agencies and other\nthird parties, including required rebates and other discounts; a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to\nmore highly discounted payer segments; market share and price erosion caused by the introduction of generic\nversions of Gilead products; the risk that physicians and patients may not see advantages of Gilead’s products\nover other therapies and may therefore be reluctant to prescribe the products, including Livdelzi; and other\nrisks identified from time to time in Gilead’s reports filed with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K,\nNovember 6, 2024 6\nquarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.

          "content": "GILEAD SCIENCES THIRD QUARTER 2024\nEARNINGS PREPARED REMARKS\nJacquie Ross, CFA, VP, Investor Relations\nThank you, Rebekah.\nJust after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the third quarter of\n2024. The press release, slides, and supplementary data are available on the investors section of our\nwebsite at gilead.com.\nThe speakers on today’s call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O’Day, our Chief\nCommercial Officer, Johanna Mercier, our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey, and our Chief\nFinancial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we’ll open the call to Q&A, where the team will be\njoined by Cindy Perettie, the Executive Vice President of Kite.\nBefore we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward‐looking statements. Please\nrefer to slide 2 regarding the risks and uncertainties relating to forward‐looking statements that could\ncause actual results to differ materially.\nWith that, I’ll turn the call over to Dan.\nDaniel O’Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone.\nThe team and I are pleased to share Gilead’s third quarter results, highlighting another very strong\nquarter of commercial and operational execution, with robust year‐over‐year revenue performance\nacross HIV, Oncology, and Liver Disease, including 9% growth in HIV. We also delivered strong bottom‐\nline results that highlight the leverage in our business model and reflect our ongoing commitment to\ndisciplined expense management. Based on our financial results year‐to‐date, we are increasing our\n2024 guidance across almost every metric including revenue and non‐GAAP gross margin, operating\nincome, and EPS.\nWe continued to make excellent progress in our Virology and Inflammation programs in the third\nquarter. The results from the PURPOSE 2 study, which build on the 100% efficacy shown in PURPOSE 1,\ndemonstrate lenacapavir's unmatched clinical profile observed for HIV prevention. If approved,\nlenacapavir – as the first twice‐yearly subcutaneous injection for HIV prevention – could make a major\nimpact on global public health, and significantly catalyze the prevention market. I’m pleased to share\nthat the FDA recently granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to lenacapavir, and we are on‐track to\n1\nfile before the end of this year. We look forward to sharing information on our plans for lenacapavir,\nand the rest of our leading HIV portfolio, at our HIV analyst event on December 10th.\nWe are very encouraged by the initial launch of Livdelzi for primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC, which was\ngranted accelerated approval by the FDA in August. Livdelzi is a highly differentiated option for people\nwith PBC who do not respond well to first‐line therapy. Demand in the third quarter was ahead of our\ninternal expectations, and we expect to see growing momentum into 2025 and beyond. Livdelzi brings\nthe number of innovative therapies launched by Gilead since 2019 to 6, representing another step\ntowards our goal of delivering at least 10 transformative therapies by 2030.\nMoving to Oncology, we are excited to share preliminary data from the registrational Phase 2\niMMagine‐1 study of anito‐cel for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma at ASH next\nmonth, in addition to updated data from the Phase 1 study, together with our partner Arcellx. We’re\nalso pleased to have begun the Phase 3 iMMagine‐3 study in earlier‐line patients. The combination of\nanito‐cel's potential best‐in‐class clinical profile with Kite's leading cell therapy manufacturing has the\nability to transform care for a large number of multiple myeloma patients.\nWe continue to evolve our oncology program in response to clinical data, regulatory feedback, and the\ncompetitive environment. We are carefully prioritizing our resources for the most promising programs.\nFor example, we are advancing Trodelvy in first‐line, PD‐L1 high metastatic non‐small cell lung cancer\nwhere we have seen supportive data in combination with pembro, while discontinuing development in\nsecond‐line plus. We are also starting a new program for small cell lung cancer based on promising\nefficacy data from the Phase 2 TROPiCS‐03 basket trial.\nTouching briefly on slide 6, we have completed all of the clinical milestones and updates we targeted for\n2024, and look forward to a strong end to the year with key presentations coming up at ASH and our HIV\nanalyst event in December.\nThose are the main points I wanted to share for now on what has been a very strong third quarter,\nthanks to the tremendous efforts of the Gilead teams. I look forward to our Q&A session at the end and\nnow I will pass it on to Johanna.\nJohanna Mercier, Chief Commercial Officer\nThanks Dan, and good afternoon, everyone.\nIt was another strong quarter of commercial execution across the business, and I’m proud of the work\nthe teams continue to do to expand the reach of our medicines to many more people and patients\naround the world.\nAs shown on slide 8, total product sales, excluding Veklury were $6.8 billion in the third quarter, up 7%\nyear‐over‐year, reflecting strong growth across HIV, Oncology, and Liver Disease. Including Veklury,\ntotal product sales were $7.5 billion, up 7% year‐over‐year.\nStarting with HIV on slide 9, sales of $5.1 billion were up 9% year‐over‐year and 7% sequentially,\nprimarily driven by higher average realized price due to shifts in channel mix and higher demand across\ntreatment and PrEP.\n2\nThe third quarter, once again, demonstrated the quarterly pricing variability we see in HIV. Specifically,\nwe saw adjustments to government channels where there is a multi‐quarter lag for certain claims data.\nAs a result, the quarter reflected more favorable average realized pricing.\nYear‐to‐date, HIV sales have grown 5%, well above our prior full‐year growth target of 4%. With that\noutperformance in mind, we are increasing our full‐year HIV growth expectation to 5%, and we remind\nyou to focus on full year vs. quarterly trends. To that end, for the fourth quarter in particular, we expect\nHIV sales to be roughly flat quarter‐over‐quarter, with continued demand growth and modest, seasonal\ninventory build, offset by the third quarter pricing dynamics discussed earlier that are not expected to\nrepeat.\nTurning to slide 10, Biktarvy third quarter sales of $3.5 billion increased 13% year‐over‐year, driven by\nhigher demand as well as higher average realized price due to shifts in channel mix, partially offset by\ninventory dynamics. Sequentially, sales were up 7%, primarily driven by channel mix and higher\ndemand.\nIn the U.S. and across major markets, Biktarvy continues to be the regimen‐of‐choice for those starting\ntreatment and switching therapies, and has grown for 25 consecutive quarters. In the U.S., Biktarvy\nshare grew to over 49%, up more than 2% year‐over‐year, and remains the leading regimen for HIV\ntreatment. Gilead is well‐positioned to maintain its leadership in the HIV treatment market with 4 new\nregimens by the end of 2030. Overall, the HIV treatment market continues to grow in‐line with our\nexpectations of 2 to 3% annually.\nMoving to Descovy, third quarter sales were $586 million, up 15% year‐over‐year, reflecting higher\ndemand and average realized price due to channel mix, partially offset by inventory dynamics.\nSequentially, sales were up 21%, primarily driven by channel mix and higher demand.\nThe U.S. PrEP market continues to demonstrate robust growth, up 13% year‐over‐year, and Descovy for\nPrEP remains the leading branded option, capturing over 40% market share despite the availability of\ngenerics and other regimens. Overall, Descovy for PrEP sales make up an increasing portion of total\nDescovy sales, representing roughly 80% in the third quarter.\nThis is a strong foundation as we prepare for the first anticipated commercial launch of lenacapavir for\nPrEP next year. Lenacapavir’s remarkable clinical profile and unmatched, twice‐yearly administration\noffer the potential to redefine the HIV prevention market, and we look forward to sharing more details\non our commercialization plans and treatment programs at our HIV analyst event in December.\nIn the meantime, we look to file for approval in the U.S. before the end of the year and are well‐\nunderway with our preparations for the first commercial launch in 2025. In addition to our commercial\nplans, we are particularly proud of our commitment to make lenacapavir available in 120 high‐incidence,\nresource‐limited countries as quickly as possible, ensuring access for lenacapavir for PrEP is made as\nbroadly available upon approval.\nMoving to the Liver Disease portfolio on slide 11, sales of $733 million in the third quarter were up 4%\nyear‐over‐year, driven by increased demand across our viral hepatitis portfolio, partially offset by pricing\ndynamics including shifts in channel mix in the U.S. Sequentially, after an incredibly strong second\nquarter, sales declined 12%, primarily driven by inventory dynamics and fewer patient starts in HCV.\n3\nTurning to slide 12, in mid‐August, we launched Livdelzi in the U.S. for PBC, with the first prescription\nwritten within a few hours of the accelerated approval. Furthermore, with 100% of our U.S. commercial\norganization trained by the time of launch, we quickly reached more than 1,000 of our target prescribers\nwithin the first several weeks. Overall, we are very encouraged with the patient demand we’re seeing\nso far, which is ahead of our internal expectations. We believe this reflects the differentiated profile of\nLivdelzi as the only approved therapy with statistically significant improvements in both ALP and\npruritus, as well as an established safety profile.\nSales in the third quarter were modest, as we expected, in the low‐single digit millions and reflective of\nthe ramp‐up time required to on‐board patients and providers, and to work through step‐edits and prior\nauthorizations that are normal for a rare disease launch. We expect to start building momentum as we\nenter 2025 when we look to a more meaningful sales contribution.\nOutside the U.S., launch preparations are ongoing, and we look forward to the European regulatory\ndecision in early 2025.\nMoving to slide 13, Veklury has continued to remain the antiviral standard of care for hospitalized\npatients treated for COVID‐19, including in the U.S. with more than 60% share in this setting.\nAltogether, with higher‐than‐expected hospitalizations in the summer months, sales in the third quarter\nwere up 9% year‐over‐year to $692 million. Year‐to‐date sales of $1.5 billion are now well ahead of our\ninitial full‐year guidance of $1.3 billion. As a result, we are raising our full year guidance for Veklury to\napproximately $1.8 billion.\nNow turning to Oncology on slide 14, Gilead and Kite therapies have treated more than 65,000 patients\nglobally, highlighting our continued growing reach.\nSales for the quarter were $816 million, up 6% year‐over‐year, primarily driven by Trodelvy growth.\nSequentially, Oncology sales were down 3% with growth in Trodelvy offset by a decline in Cell Therapy.\nBeginning with Trodelvy on slide 15, sales of $332 million were up 17% year‐over‐year and 4% quarter‐\nover‐quarter, reflecting higher demand in all regions.\nIn breast cancer, Trodelvy remains well‐positioned as the only approved and commercially available\nTROP2‐directed ADC to demonstrate clinically meaningful survival benefits across two types of\nmetastatic breast cancers. Notably, Trodelvy is the standard of care for second‐line metastatic triple‐\nnegative breast cancer, with ongoing adoption in the pre‐treated HR+/HER2‐ metastatic breast cancer\nsetting. We’re pleased to see both indications contribute to Trodelvy’s growth year‐over‐year despite\nan evolving competitive landscape.\nTurning to slide 16, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, Cell Therapy sales of $485 million in the\nthird quarter were flat year‐over‐year, with strong 23% growth outside the U.S., offset by the U.S.\nSequentially, total Cell Therapy sales were down 7% due to competitive headwinds – both in‐ and out‐\nof‐class – in the U.S. which we expect to continue into 2025.\nAs a pioneer in cell therapy, Kite’s focus is to expand overall utilization and increase class share. As part\nof this work, we are partnering with government agencies and healthcare associations to amplify\neducation of the benefits of CAR T and remove barriers to access. To date, only 2 of every 10 eligible\npatients receive CAR T in second‐line plus large B‐cell lymphoma in the U.S., and we are committed to\nremoving these barriers so we can deliver potentially curative therapies like Yescarta to more patients.\n4\nIn the community setting, Kite is leading the way in identifying and lowering barriers and building the\nright ecosystem to enable more people to receive CAR T beyond the reach of an academic medical\ninstitution. Today, CAR T sites often need to be accredited, typically by the Foundation for the\nAccreditation of Cellular Therapy, or FACT, and this requirement has been highlighted as a hurdle for our\ncommunity partners to achieve national payer reimbursement. In the meantime, we’re pleased to share\nthat we have treated our first few patients as part of our community strategy, demonstrating that we\ncan deliver Yescarta in this setting.\nOutside the U.S., we saw year‐over‐year demand growth as we continue to expand into the second‐line\nrelapsed or refractory large B‐cell lymphoma setting in Europe and launch in new markets. In particular,\nwe’re encouraged by our progress in Japan, where we have onboarded more than 50 authorized\ntreatment centers in little over a year, with more to come in the near future.\nOverall, I would like to thank the commercialization teams for their hard work to deliver another strong\nquarter and first nine months of the year. With launch activities underway in PBC and for HIV\nprevention launch next year, our teams are excited to bring our transformative medicines to many more\npeople and patients globally.\nAnd with that, I’ll hand the call over to Merdad.\nMerdad Parsey, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer\nThank you, Johanna. We are very pleased to wrap up the third quarter with another exciting update\nfrom our PURPOSE program evaluating lenacapavir for HIV prevention.\nAs shown on slide 18, we shared two oral presentations on our PURPOSE 2 HIV prevention trial at the\nHIV Research for Prevention conference in October. Following the remarkable 100% efficacy reported\nfrom an interim analysis of the PURPOSE 1 trial in cisgender women in June, PURPOSE 2 was also\nstopped at the interim in September. Notably, twice‐yearly subcutaneous lenacapavir significantly\nreduced incidence of HIV infections compared to both background HIV incidence and Truvada in the\nexceptionally diverse population of cisgender men and gender diverse people in a Phase 3 prevention\ntrial.\nThese PURPOSE 1 and 2 results demonstrated lenacapavir's unprecedented results for HIV prevention.\nWe look forward to sharing additional insights at the HIV Glasgow meeting next week, including\npersistence data from PURPOSE 1 and a deeper look into the efficacy data from PURPOSE 2.\nBased on these data, FDA has now granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for lenacapavir for HIV\nprevention. We continue to target regulatory submission before the end of the year in the U.S., while at\nthe same time, preparing for filings with other global regulatory authorities.\nBeyond our registrational PURPOSE 1 and 2 programs, we continue to generate additional data from the\nPhase 2 PURPOSE 3, 4, and 5 trials in key populations across the U.S., U.K., and France. These studies\nare intended to contribute additional data in communities where use of – or access to – prevention\noptions have historically been challenging.\n5\nTurning to our HIV treatment pipeline on slide 19, we continue to make strong progress in developing\nnovel regimens, including:\n A once‐daily, oral regimen with two backbone therapies, lenacapavir and bictegravir. This novel\ncombination has the potential to provide another effective daily oral option for people living with\nHIV, including the 6 to 8% of people currently on complex regimens. Recently, we completed\nenrollment of the Phase 3 ARTISTRY‐1 trial within 9 months of FPI, and are on‐track to complete\nenrollment in ARTISTRY‐2 by early 2025.\n Further, we have made strong progress for our two once‐weekly oral programs.\no The Phase 2 study of our wholly‐owned combination of GS‐4182, a pro‐drug of lenacapavir with\nenhanced oral bioavailability, and GS‐1720, a long‐acting integrase inhibitor, has now completed\nenrollment within 2 months of FPI and\no We have enrolled our first participants into the Phase 3 ISLEND‐1 and ISLEND‐2 trials evaluating\nthe oral combination of lenacapavir with Merck's NRTTI, islatravir, for virologically suppressed\npeople with HIV. We presented Week 48 data from the Phase 2 trial evaluating this once‐\nweekly combination in a similar population at IDWeek. Participants in both the lenacapavir plus\nislatravir, and Biktarvy treatment arms maintained high rates of virologic suppression, and no\nparticipants discontinued due to lymphocyte count decreases.\nMoving to our Liver Disease portfolio on slide 20, FDA granted Livdelzi an accelerated approval for the\ntreatment of PBC in combination with UDCA in certain adults who have an inadequate response to\nUDCA, or as monotherapy in certain patients unable to tolerate UDCA. We have already filed with EMA\nand expect a decision early next year. As part of the accelerated approval process, we continue to\nrecruit for our confirmatory Phase 3 AFFIRM trial evaluating seladelpar for improvement in event‐free\nsurvival. Further, our Phase 3 IDEAL trial is ongoing and offers us an opportunity to understand the\neffect of seladelpar in normalizing alkaline phosphatase in a broader set of PBC patients who had an\nincomplete response to UDCA.\nSwitching now to Oncology, on slide 21, we continue to evolve our late‐stage clinical programs in lung\ncancer in response to clinical data and the changing landscape. Reflective of our commitment to\nprioritizing the most significant opportunities across all our therapeutic areas, we have decided to\ndiscontinue further evaluation of Trodelvy in second‐line plus metastatic non‐small cell lung cancer\nbased on discussions with regulators following the EVOKE‐01 readout earlier this year.\nIn the front‐line, based on the totality of data from the Phase 2 EVOKE‐02 trial, we believe Trodelvy in\ncombination with a PD‐1 inhibitor, without the addition of chemotherapy, may have the greatest\npotential in this setting. To that end, our Phase 3 EVOKE‐03 study of Trodelvy plus pembro is ongoing in\nfirst‐line patients with PD‐L1 high metastatic non‐small cell lung cancer.\nSeparately, we shared promising data for Trodelvy in extensive‐stage small cell lung cancer from our\nPhase 2 TROPiCS‐03 basket trial, and plan to advance development of Trodelvy in this population to a\nPhase 3 trial.\nWe also look forward to sharing the results from Part 1 of the Phase 2 ARC‐10 trial at the SITC meeting\nlater this week, further adding to the body of data on domvanalimab, our Fc‐silent anti‐TIGIT. As a\n6\nreminder, we discontinued enrollment of ARC‐10 earlier this year to prioritize the ongoing first‐line\nPhase 3 dom studies, STAR‐121 in metastatic non‐small cell lung cancer and STAR‐221 in upper GI\ncancers.\nMoving to slide 22, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, we are excited to share updates at the\nupcoming ASH congress, including our Phase 2 iMMagine‐1 results for anito‐cel in fourth‐line or later\nrelapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The ASH abstract shared yesterday reflects 58 patients who\nreceived anito‐cel with a median follow‐up of 10.3 months as of the June 2024 cutoff. Treatment with\nanito‐cel demonstrated deep and durable efficacy with an objective response rate of 95% and a\ncomplete response rate of 62%. Of those evaluable for MRD testing, 92% achieved MRD negativity. The\nmedian progression‐free survival and overall survival had not yet been reached.\nAdditionally, Arcellx announced yesterday that updated data from the Phase 1 study will be presented\nat ASH. In the meantime, Arcellx has already shared that an even later data cut from Phase 1 has shown\nthat anito‐cel achieved a 30.2‐month median progression‐free survival and median overall survival was\nnot yet reached.\nIn summary, we are encouraged by the compelling results so far and – with over 140 patients dosed\nacross both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 iMMagine‐1 studies – we have not yet seen any cases of delayed\nneurotoxicities. This includes no parkinsonism, no cranial nerve palsies, and no Guillan‐Barré syndrome.\nWe will be sharing updated data at the ASH conference and look forward to potentially offering anito‐\ncel’s best‐in‐class profile to these late‐stage multiple myeloma patients.\nSeparately, we are pleased FDA has granted Kite the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy\nDesignation, or RMAT, for the evaluation of Yescarta for newly diagnosed, high‐risk large B‐cell\nlymphoma who have a positive PET scan after two cycles of first‐line chemotherapy. Under the RMAT\ndesignation, the Yescarta development program for first‐line treatment of high‐risk large B‐cell\nlymphoma will be able to access the benefits of the FDA's accelerated pathways including fast track and\nbreakthrough designations. Our Phase 3 ZUMA‐23 study in this setting is ongoing, and we look forward\nto sharing updates in due course.\nMoving to our milestones on slide 23, a brief update on ASCENT‐03. As a reminder, this is an event‐\ndriven trial, and I can share that we are continuing to accrue events at this time. With that in mind, it is\npossible we will not reach data cut‐off this year, and we’ll look forward to updating you in due course.\nOther updates this quarter included:\n The read out of PURPOSE 2 data ahead of schedule,\n The review of our Phase 2 data for lenacapavir plus our broadly neutralizing antibodies with plans to\nshare the data at an upcoming scientific conference in 2025; and\n The initiation of several key HIV, Trodelvy, and Cell Therapy trials, including enrollment for ISLEND‐1,\nISLEND‐2, ASCENT‐GYN‐01, and iMMagine‐3.\nIn closing, I’d like to thank the Gilead and Kite research and development teams for a stellar quarter of\nexecution. And with that, I’ll hand the call over to Andy.\n7\nAndrew Dickinson, Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone.\nOur third quarter results represent a strong quarter for Gilead, as shown on slide 25, with our base\nbusiness up 7% year‐over‐year to $6.8 billion driven by growth in each of our core businesses. Veklury\nalso delivered substantial growth, resulting in total product sales up 7% year‐over‐year to $7.5 billion.\nBefore moving to non‐GAAP, I’ll highlight the impairment charge that impacted our third quarter\nfinancial results on a GAAP basis, as noted on slide 26.\n As a reminder, this relates to the carrying value of the IPR&D indefinite‐lived intangible assets\nacquired from Immunomedics in 2020. During the third quarter, we decreased the fair value by $1.8\nbillion, or $1.04 per share net of tax impact – reflecting the removal of the second‐line, non‐small\ncell lung cancer indication. The remaining $1.8 billion carrying value reflects Trodelvy’s opportunity\nin the first‐line setting.\n Note that potential indications that we have begun to explore since the acquisition are NOT\nreflected in the carrying value, such as endometrial or small cell lung cancer.\nMoving to our non‐GAAP results for the third quarter on slide 27.\n Product gross margin was 87%, up 84 basis points from last year primarily due to product mix.\n R&D expenses were down 5% year‐over‐year, primarily driven by timing of clinical activities, such as\nthe wind‐down of the magrolimab program and the obeldesivir oral COVID studies, and supported\nby our broader expense management initiatives.\n Acquired IPR&D was $505 million, which reflects the $320 million buy‐out of global Livdelzi royalties\nfrom Janssen announced in August, and the $35 million upfront expense to initiate a new AI\npartnership with Genesis, in addition to ongoing collaboration expenses.\n SG&A was up 8% year‐over‐year, primarily due to timing of commercial and corporate activities,\nincluding the launch of Livdelzi in the United States and other initiatives including pre‐launch\npreparations for lenacapavir for PrEP.\n Operating margin for the third quarter was 43%. Excluding the impact of the royalty buy‐out charge\nfrom Janssen, operating margin would have been 47%. While there will always be some quarterly\nvariability, recent results demonstrate a consistent trend of our operating margin firmly in the 40‐\npercent plus range, and we remain focused on being an industry‐leader in terms of operating\nmargin.\n Our effective tax rate was approximately 18% as compared to 7% in the same period last year. As a\nreminder, the tax rate in the third quarter of 2023 benefited from decreased tax reserves as a result\nof reaching an agreement with a tax authority on certain tax positions.\n8\n In total, non‐GAAP diluted EPS was $2.02 per share as compared to $2.29 per share in the same\nperiod last year, primarily reflecting higher acquired IPR&D and tax expense, partially offset by\nhigher product sales. As mentioned earlier, the $320 million expense related to buy‐out of global\nLivdelzi royalties from Janssen impacted our EPS by 20‐cents per share.\nAs highlighted on slide 28, we had a strong first nine months of the year, with solid performance in each\nof our core franchises across HIV, Oncology, and Liver Disease, driving base business growth of 7% year‐\nover‐year, with Veklury already exceeding our initial full‐year guidance of $1.3 billion.\nAltogether, total product sales for the first nine months of 2024 were up 6% year‐over‐year.\nMoving to guidance on slide 29, we are updating much of our guidance to reflect the very strong\nperformance in our business so far this year.\n We are increasing our guidance for product sales, excluding Veklury, by $150 million at the midpoint\nfrom the prior range to a new range of $26 to $26.3 billion. In addition to our strong year‐to‐date\nperformance, this guidance accounts for evolving competition in our Cell Therapy business.\n The increased revenue guidance also reflects higher full‐year expectations for HIV, now expected to\ngrow approximately 5% from 2023 compared to our prior expectations of 4%. This guidance implies\nthat fourth quarter HIV could be roughly flat, which we believe is prudent given the strength in the\nthird quarter, and the normal variability that we can see with HIV pricing.\n We expect full‐year Veklury revenue to be approximately $1.8 billion.\n We therefore expect full‐year 2024 total product sales in the range of $27.8 to $28.1 billion, an\nincrease of $650 million at the midpoint compared to the prior range.\nTurning to the rest of the P&L, on a non‐GAAP basis:\n We expect product gross margin to be approximately 86%, narrowed from our prior 85% to 86%\nrange, and reflecting year to date results as well as our expectations for a more favorable product\nmix in the fourth quarter.\n We now expect R&D expense to decline a low single‐digit percentage as compared to our prior\noutlook of low to mid‐single digit growth, reflecting the discontinuation of certain programs and\ncareful expense management; and,\n There is no change to our prior expectations for both acquired IPR&D and SG&A.\n Reflecting these updates, we now expect operating income in the range of $8 to $8.3 billion, up\nfrom $7.2 to $7.6 billion previously.\n Full‐year tax is expected to be approximately 27%, slightly lower than our prior 30% guidance and\nreflecting the higher operating income for the full year, as well as the negative impact from the one‐\ntime charge for the acquisition of CymaBay in the first quarter. As a reminder, this compares to our\ninitial guidance in February of approximately 19% prior to the CymaBay impact.\n9\n Altogether, we’ve raised our earnings per share guidance to a range of $4.25 and $4.45. This\ncompares to our prior guidance of $3.60 to $3.90, and reflects both revenue outperformance and\ncontinued operating expense discipline. At the midpoints, our updated guidance represents an\nincrease of $750M in non‐GAAP operating income and an increase of 60 cents in non‐GAAP earnings\nper share.\n On a GAAP basis, EPS is expected to be 5 cents to 25 cents.\nMoving to slide 30, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the third quarter, and a total of $3.7\nbillion in the first nine months of the year. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with\nsignificant balance sheet flexibility.\nOverall, Gilead is on track to deliver an extremely strong 2024, and we are particularly pleased with our\nprogress on operating expense management which we believe sets us up well as we enter 2025.\nAnd now, I’ll invite Rebekah to begin the Q&A.\n10"

An antibody's Fc region is essential for activation of\nthe immune system. However, activation in TIGIT antibodies may lead to tagging and elimination of non-malignant TIGIT expressing immune regulating cells, leading to\nnegative consequences. In contrast, Fc-silenced TIGITs (including domvanalimab, the first late-stage Fc-silent TIGIT) prevent Fc activity and thus the destruction of immune\ncells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), potentially improving tolerability and safety, creating an enhanced clinical profile for solid tumors.\n1.

Management believes non-GAAP information is useful for investors, when considered in conjunction with Gilead’s GAAP financial information,\nbecause management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under\na comprehensive set of accounting rules and should only be used to supplement an understanding of Gilead’s operating results as reported under GAAP. Non-\nGAAP financial information generally excludes acquisition-related expenses including amortization of acquired intangible assets and other items that are considered\nunusual or not representative of underlying trends of Gilead’s business, fair value adjustments of equity securities and discrete and related tax charges or benefits\nassociated with such exclusions as well as changes in tax-related laws and guidelines, transfers of intangible assets between certain legal entities, and legal entity\nrestructurings. Although Gilead consistently excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets from the non-GAAP financial information, management believes\nthat it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of acquisitions and contribute to ongoing revenue generation. Non-\nGAAP measures may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same industry. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most\ndirectly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided at pages 61 and 63-65, or, for Total Adjusted Debt, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Debt to Adjusted\nEBITDA ratio, in the Q324 Earnings Presentation available at investors.gilead.com.\nU.S. and European Patent Expiration Disclaimer\nThe patent expiration dates presented in this book reflect estimated expiration dates (including patent term extensions, supplementary protection certificates and/\nor pediatric exclusivity where granted) in the United States and the European Union for the primary (typically compound) patents for identified products or product\ncandidates, as applicable. For our product and product candidates that are fixed-dose combinations of single-tablet regimens, the estimated patent expiration date\nprovided corresponds to the latest expiring compound patent for one of the active ingredients in the single-tablet regimen. In some cases, we hold later-expiring\npatents and additional exclusivities relating to particular forms or compositions, formulations, methods of manufacture or uses that extend exclusivity beyond the\ndates presented in this book, which may or may not protect our product from generic or biosimilar competition after the expiration of the primary patents. Where\napplicable, settlement/license agreements with generic manufacturers relating to the patents that protect our principal products are presented. The nature and\ntiming of loss of exclusivity of our products depends upon a multitude of factors, and loss of exclusivity may be earlier under certain circumstances. Please see our\nmost recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for additional details regarding the patent expiration of our products and product candidates.\n70 Investor Resource Book\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements included in this document that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of\n1995. Gilead cautions readers that forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and\nuncertainties include those relating to: Gilead’s ability to achieve its anticipated full year 2024 financial results, including as a result of the uncertainty of the amount and timing\nof Veklury sales; Gilead’s ability to make progress on any of its long-term ambitions or strategic priorities laid out in its corporate strategy; Gilead’s ability to accelerate or sustain\nrevenues for its virology, oncology and other programs; Gilead’s ability to realize the potential benefits of acquisitions, collaborations or licensing arrangements, including Gilead’s\nability to identify suitable transactions as part of its business strategy and the risk that Gilead may not be able to complete any such transaction in a timely manner or at all,\nincluding the possibility that a governmental entity or regulatory body may delay or refuse to grant approval for the consummation of the transaction; Gilead’s ability to initiate,\nprogress or complete clinical trials within currently anticipated timeframes or at all, the possibility of unfavorable results from ongoing and additional clinical trials and the risk that\nsafety and efficacy data from clinical trials may not warrant further development of Gilead’s product candidates or the product candidates of Gilead’s strategic partners; Gilead’s\nability to submit new drug applications for new product candidates or expanded indications in the currently anticipated timelines; Gilead’s ability to receive regulatory approvals\nin a timely manner or at all, and the risk that any such approvals may be subject to significant limitations on use; Gilead’s ability to successfully commercialize its products; the\nrisk of potential disruptions to the manufacturing and supply chain of Gilead’s products; pricing and reimbursement pressures from government agencies and other third parties,\nincluding required rebates and other discounts; a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments; market share and price erosion caused by\nthe introduction of generic versions of Gilead products; the risk that physicians and patients may not see advantages of these products over other therapies and may therefore be\nreluctant to prescribe the products; and other risks identified from time to time in Gilead’s reports filed with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on\nForm 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. In addition, Gilead makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and\nrelated disclosures. Gilead bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under\nthe circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nThere may be other factors of which Gilead is not currently aware that may affect matters discussed in the forward-looking statements and may also cause actual results to differ\nsignificantly from these estimates. Gilead directs readers to its press releases, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other subsequent disclosure\ndocuments filed with the SEC. Gilead claims the protection of the Safe Harbor contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for forward-looking statements.\nThe reader is cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and is cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking\nstatements. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead and Gilead assumes no obligation to update or supplement any such forward-\nlooking statements other than as required by law. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof or as of the dates indicated in the statements.\nGilead owns or has rights to various trademarks, copyrights and trade names used in its business, including the following: GILEAD®, GILEAD SCIENCES®, KITETM, AMBISOME®,\nATRIPLA®, BIKTARVY®, CAYSTON®, COMPLERA®, DESCOVY®, DESCOVY FOR PREP®, EMTRIVA®, EPCLUSA®, EVIPLERA®, GENVOYA®, HARVONI®, HEPCLUDEX®, HEPSERA®,\nJYSELECA®, LETAIRIS®, LIVDELZI® ODEFSEY®, SOVALDI®, STRIBILD®, SUNLENCA®,TECARTUS®, TRODELVY®, TRUVADA®, TRUVADA FOR PREP®, TYBOST®, VEKLURY®,\nVEMLIDY®, VIREAD®, VOSEVI®, YESCARTA® and ZYDELIG®.

(“Arcellx”) of $561 million as of September 30, 2024, which is subject to contractual sale restrictions until June 2025.\nLevel 2 Inputs\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities\nFor our available-for-sale debt securities, we estimate the fair values by reviewing trading activity and pricing as of the measurement date and by taking\ninto consideration valuations obtained from third-party pricing services. The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income-\nbased and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate the fair value. These inputs include\nreported trades of and broker/dealer quotes on the same or similar securities, issuer credit spreads, benchmark securities, prepayment/default projections based\non historical data and other observable inputs.\nForeign Currency Derivative Contracts\nOur foreign currency derivative contracts have maturities of 18 months or less and all are with counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A- or\nequivalent by S&P Global Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings, Inc. We estimate the fair values of these contracts by utilizing an income-\nbased industry standard valuation model for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include foreign currency\nexchange rates, Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) and swap rates. These inputs, where applicable, are observable at commonly quoted intervals.\n12\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nThe following table summarizes the total estimated fair value and carrying value of our senior unsecured notes, determined using Level 2 inputs based on\ntheir quoted market values:\n(in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nFair value $ 20,931 $ 22,567\nCarrying value $ 22,094 $ 23,834\nLevel 3 Inputs\nContingent Consideration Liability\nIn connection with our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR, we are subject to a potential contingent consideration payment of up to €300 million,\nsubject to customary adjustments, which is revalued each reporting period using probability-weighted scenarios for U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n(“FDA”) approval of Hepcludex until the related contingency is resolved.\nThe following table summarizes the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liability:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBeginning balance $ 208 $ 288 $ 228 $ 275\nChanges in valuation assumptions(1) 5 (2) (6) 3\nEffect of foreign exchange remeasurement(2) 9 (11) 1 (4)\nEnding balance(3) $ 222 $ 275 $ 222 $ 275\n________________________________\n(1) Included in Research and development expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

See Note 7. Intangible Assets for additional information.\nFair Value Level Transfers\nThere were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 in the periods presented.\n13\n4. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES AND EQUITY SECURITIES\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, we sold all of our available-for-sale debt securities and used the proceeds to partially fund our acquisition\nof CymaBay discussed in Note 6.

Our investment in Galapagos was classified in Prepaid and other current assets as\nof September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 at $483 million and $686 million, respectively. Our investment in Arcus was classified in Prepaid and other\ncurrent assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 at $460 million and $283 million, respectively.\nUnrealized Gains and Losses\nThe following table summarizes net unrealized gains and losses on equity securities still held as of the respective balance sheet dates, included in Other\n(income) expense, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nUnrealized (gain) loss, net $ (257) $ 128 $ 155 $ 249\n5. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nOur operations in foreign countries expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and\nvarious foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. To manage this risk, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposures related to outstanding monetary\nassets and liabilities as well as forecasted product sales using foreign currency exchange forward contracts. In general, the market risk related to these contracts\nis offset by corresponding gains and losses on the hedged transactions. The credit risk associated with these contracts is driven by changes in interest and\ncurrency exchange rates and, as a result, varies over time. By working only with major banks and closely monitoring current market conditions, we seek to\nlimit the risk that counterparties to these contracts may be unable to perform. We also seek to limit our risk of loss by entering into contracts that permit net\nsettlement at maturity. Therefore, our overall risk of loss in the event of a counterparty default is limited to the amount of any unrealized gains on outstanding\ncontracts (i.e., those contracts that have a positive fair value) at the date of default. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading purposes.\nThe derivative instruments we use to hedge our exposures for certain monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a non-functional currency are\nnot designated as hedges. The derivative instruments we use to hedge our exposures for forecasted product sales are designated as cash flow hedges and have\nmaturities of 18 months or less.\nWe held foreign currency exchange contracts with outstanding notional amounts of $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.\n15\nWhile all our derivative contracts allow us the right to offset assets and liabilities, we have presented amounts in our Condensed Consolidated Balance\nSheets on a gross basis.

There were no discontinuances of cash flow hedges for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe cash flow effects of our derivative contracts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were included within Net cash provided by\noperating activities on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n16\n6. ACQUISITIONS, COLLABORATIONS AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS\nWe enter into acquisitions, licensing and strategic collaborations and other similar arrangements with third parties for the research, development and\ncommercialization of certain products and product candidates. The collaborations involve two or more parties who are active participants in the operating\nactivities of the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards depending on the commercial success of the activities. The financial terms of\nthese arrangements may include non-refundable upfront payments, expense reimbursements or payments by us for options to acquire certain rights, contingent\nobligations by us for potential development and regulatory milestone payments and/or sales-based milestone payments, royalty payments, revenue or profit-\nsharing arrangements, cost-sharing arrangements and equity investments.\nAcquisitions\nCymaBay\nIn March 2024, we completed the acquisition of CymaBay Therapeutics, Inc. (“CymaBay”) for total consideration of $3.9 billion, net of cash acquired.\nUpon closing, CymaBay became our wholly-owned subsidiary.\nWe accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, seladelpar, an investigational, oral, peroxisome proliferator-activated\nreceptor delta agonist shown to regulate critical metabolic and liver disease pathways, represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recorded a $3.9 billion charge, representing an acquired IPR&D asset with no alternative future use, to\nAcquired in-process research and development expenses, as well as share-based compensation expense of $133 million related to the cash settlement of\nunvested CymaBay employee stock awards attributable to post-acquisition services, with $67 million being recorded in Research and development expenses\nand $67 million in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. In connection with this acquisition,\nwe recorded $263 million of assets acquired, primarily consisting of deferred tax assets, and $228 million of liabilities assumed, primarily related to an\nassumed financing arrangement.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, we paid $101 million towards the assumed financing arrangement related to a change-of-control provision,\nand in August 2024, we paid $108 million to settle the remaining liability.\nIn July 2024, we paid $320 million to Janssen Pharmaceutica NV to extinguish a future royalty obligation related to seladelpar, which was recorded to\nAcquired in-process research and development expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended September 30,\n2024.\nIn August 2024, FDA granted accelerated approval for Livdelzi (seladelpar) for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis in combination with\nursodeoxycholic acid (“UDCA”) in adults who have had an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in patients unable to tolerate UDCA.\nXinThera\nIn May 2023, we closed an agreement to acquire XinThera, Inc. (“XinThera”), a privately held biotechnology company focused on small molecule drugs\nto treat cancer and immunologic diseases, for approximately $200 million in cash consideration, net of cash acquired. As a result, XinThera became our\nwholly-owned subsidiary.\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition and recorded a $170 million charge to Acquired in-process research and development expenses\non our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations during the three months ended June 30, 2023. The remaining purchase price relates to various other\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed. Under the agreement, the former shareholders of XinThera are eligible to receive performance-based development and\nregulatory milestone payments of up to approximately $760 million, with the first $50 million of such milestones paid and charged primarily to Acquired in-\nprocess research and development expenses in October 2023.\nTmunity\nIn February 2023, we closed an agreement to acquire Tmunity Therapeutics, Inc. (“Tmunity”), a clinical-stage, private biotechnology company focused\non next-generation chimeric antigen receptor (“CAR”) T-therapies and technologies. Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired all outstanding shares of\nTmunity other than those already owned by Gilead for approximately $300 million in cash consideration. As a result, Tmunity became our wholly-owned\nsubsidiary.\n17\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition and recorded a $244 million charge to Acquired in-process research and development expenses\non our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The remaining purchase price relates to various other\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed, consisting primarily of deferred tax assets. Under the agreement, the former shareholders of Tmunity and the University\nof Pennsylvania are eligible to receive a mix of up to approximately $1.0 billion in potential future payments upon achievement of certain development,\nregulatory and sales-based milestones, as well as royalty payments on sales, with the first $25 million of milestones charged to Acquired in-process research\nand development expenses in 2023 and paid in January 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we paid an additional $47 million for\ndevelopment milestones met, which was charged to Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nOperations.\nCollaborations and Other Arrangements\nArcellx\nIn January 2023, we closed an agreement to enter into a global strategic collaboration with Arcellx, a public company, to co-develop and co-\ncommercialize Arcellx’s lead late-stage product candidate, CART-ddBCMA, for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and\npotential future next-generation autologous and non-autologous products. In December 2023, we expanded the scope of the collaboration to include\nlymphomas and exercised our option to negotiate a license for Arcellx’s ARC-SparX program, ACLX-001, in multiple myeloma. In conjunction with these\ncollaboration agreements, we recorded a $212 million charge and a $101 million charge to Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2023, respectively, primarily related to\nupfront payments, as well as a combined equity investment of $299 million. Our equity investment is subject to lock-up provisions until June 2025 and is\nincluded in Prepaid and other current assets as of September 30, 2024. The companies will share development, clinical trial and commercialization costs for\nCART-ddBCMA and will jointly commercialize the product and split U.S. profits 50/50. Outside the U.S., we will commercialize the product and Arcellx will\nreceive royalties on sales. Arcellx is eligible to receive performance-based development and regulatory milestone payments of up to $1.5 billion related to\nCART-ddBCMA, a potential future next-generation autologous product and a potential future non-autologous product, with further commercial milestone\npayments, profit split payments on co-promoted products and royalties on at least a portion of worldwide net sales, depending on whether Arcellx opts in to co-\npromote the future products. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we paid $68 million for development milestones met, which was charged to\nAcquired in-process research and development expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. If additional future products are developed,\nArcellx would be eligible to receive additional milestone payments, profit split payments on co-promoted products and royalties on at least a portion of\nworldwide net sales, depending on whether Arcellx opts in to co-promote these additional future products as well.\nArcus\nIn January 2024, we amended our collaboration agreement with Arcus whereby we acquired approximately 15.2 million additional shares of Arcus\ncommon stock at a premium for $320 million, increasing our ownership to 30.1 million shares, or 33% of the issued and outstanding voting stock of Arcus\nimmediately following the closing of the transaction. We recorded $233 million for the fair value of the equity investment in Prepaid and other current assets\non our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and $87 million for the premium in Other (income) expense, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nOperations for the three months ended March 31, 2024. We also recorded a charge for the $100 million fourth anniversary option continuation fee under the\namended agreement to Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months\nended March 31, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we paid the continuation fee, which was included in Net cash used in investing\nactivities on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Our number of designees on Arcus’ board of directors was also increased to three.\n18\n7.

See “2024 IPR&D Impairments” below for 2024 activity. The Indefinite-lived assets – IPR&D balance as of September 30, 2024 was comprised of $1.8 billion\nrelated to SG for NSCLC and $1.1 billion related to bulevirtide.\nImpairment Assessments\nNo intangible asset-related indicators of impairment were noted for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, except as described\nunder “2024 IPR&D Impairments” below. In October 2024, we announced plans to voluntarily withdraw the U.S. accelerated approval for Trodelvy for\ntreatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have previously received a platinum-containing chemotherapy and either\nprogrammed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor. We have analyzed the implications of this and determined that it will\nnot have an impact on the carrying amount of our finite-lived intangible asset related to Trodelvy.\n2024 IPR&D Impairments\nIn January 2024, we received data from our Phase 3 EVOKE-01 study of Trodelvy evaluating SG indicating that the study did not meet its primary\nendpoint of overall survival in previously treated metastatic NSCLC, thus triggering a review for potential impairment of the NSCLC IPR&D intangible asset.\nBased on our evaluation of the study results and all other data currently available, and in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the first\nquarter, we performed an interim impairment test and determined that the revised estimated fair value of the NSCLC IPR&D intangible asset was below its\ncarrying value. As a result, we recognized a partial impairment charge of $2.4 billion in In-process research and development impairment on our Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nIn September 2024, based on discussions with regulators and external opinion leaders and the completed evaluation of the Phase 3 EVOKE-01 study data,\nwe made a strategic decision to discontinue our clinical development program in metastatic NSCLC for Trodelvy in the second-line indication. This decision\ntriggered a review for potential impairment of the NSCLC IPR&D intangible asset. Based on our evaluation, and in connection with the preparation of the\nfinancial statements for the third quarter, we performed an interim impairment test and determined that the revised estimated fair value of the NSCLC IPR&D\nintangible asset was below its carrying value. As a result, we recognized a partial impairment charge of $1.8 billion in In-process research and development\nimpairment on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nTo arrive at the revised estimated fair values as of March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2024, we used a probability-weighted income approach that\ndiscounts expected future cash flows to present value, which requires the use of Level 3 fair value measurements and inputs, and requires the use of critical\nestimated inputs, including: revenues and operating profits related to the planned utilization of SG in NSCLC, which includes inputs such as addressable\npatient population, projected market share, treatment duration, and the life of the potential commercialized product; the probability of technical and regulatory\nsuccess; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of SG in NSCLC; an appropriate discount rate based on the estimated\nweighted-average cost of capital for companies with profiles similar to our profile; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in\nany future target markets. We used a discount rate of 7.00% which is based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with profiles\nsimilar to ours. The revised estimated fair value of the NSCLC IPR&D intangible asset was $3.5 billion as of March 31, 2024 and $1.8 billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n19\n8.

We recorded $5 million and $68 million of these charges in\nResearch and development expenses and $23 million and $45 million of these charges in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\n9.

We are required to comply with certain\ncovenants under our note indentures governing our senior unsecured notes. As of September 30, 2024, we were not in violation of any covenants.\n21\nCredit Facilities\nIn June 2024, we terminated our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility maturing in June 2025 (the “2020 Revolving Credit Facility”) and entered into a\nnew $2.5 billion revolving credit facility maturing in June 2029 (the “2024 Revolving Credit Facility”), which has terms substantially similar to the 2020\nRevolving Credit Facility. The 2024 Revolving Credit Facility can be used for working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including,\nwithout limitation, acquisitions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no amounts outstanding under these revolving credit facilities.\nThe 2024 Revolving Credit Facility contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants. Loans under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either (i) Term SOFR plus the\nApplicable Percentage, (ii) the Alternative Currency Term Rate plus the Applicable Percentage, or (iii) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Percentage, each as\ndefined in the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility agreement. We may terminate or reduce the commitments and may prepay any loans under the 2024 Revolving\nCredit Facility in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty.\n10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are a party to various legal actions. Certain significant matters are described below. We recognize accruals for such actions to the extent that we\nconclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. We accrue for the best estimate of a loss within a range; however, if no estimate in the range is\nbetter than any other, then we accrue the minimum amount in the range. If we determine that a material loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss\ncan be estimated, we disclose the possible loss. Unless otherwise noted, the outcome of these matters either is not expected to be material or is not possible to\ndetermine such that we cannot reasonably estimate the maximum potential exposure or the range of possible loss. We did not have any material accruals for the\nmatters described herein on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nLitigation Relating to Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis\nIn August 2019, we filed petitions requesting inter partes review of U.S. Patent Nos. 9,044,509, 9,579,333, 9,937,191 and 10,335,423 (collectively, “HHS\nPatents”) by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”). The HHS Patents are assigned to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and\npurport to claim a process of protecting a primate host from infection by an immunodeficiency retrovirus by administering a combination of FTC and tenofovir\ndisoproxil fumarate (“TDF”) or TAF prior to exposure of the host to the immunodeficiency retrovirus, a process commonly known as pre-exposure prophylaxis\n(“PrEP”). In November 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against us in the U.S. District Court of Delaware, alleging that the use of Truvada\nand Descovy for PrEP infringes the HHS Patents. In February 2020, PTAB declined to institute our petitions for inter partes review of the HHS Patents. In\nApril 2020, we filed a lawsuit against the U.S. federal government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (“CFC”), alleging breach of three material transfer\nagreements (“MTAs”) related to the research underlying the HHS Patents and two clinical trial agreements (“CTAs”) by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention related to PrEP research. A trial for the bifurcated portion of the lawsuit in the CFC was held in June 2022, and in November 2022, the CFC\ndetermined that the government breached the MTAs. In January 2024, the CFC found the government liable for breach of both CTAs. A separate trial at the\nCFC to determine the damages we are owed based on the government’s breaches has been scheduled for March 2025. In May 2023, the District Court held a\ntrial regarding the government’s patent infringement claims, and the jury rendered a full defense verdict in favor of Gilead, finding that the asserted claims of\nthe HHS Patents are invalid and the HHS patents are not infringed. In March 2024, the District Court upheld the jury’s verdict that the government’s patents are\ninvalid, denied the government’s request for a new trial and then entered final judgment. In July 2024, the government filed a notice of appeal. Although we\ncannot predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of each of these litigation matters, we believe that the U.S. federal government breached its contracts with\nGilead, that Truvada and Descovy do not infringe the HHS Patents and that the HHS Patents are invalid over prior art descriptions of Truvada’s use for PrEP\nand post-exposure prophylaxis because physicians and patients were using the claimed methods years before HHS filed the applications for the patents.\nLitigation with Generic Manufacturers\nAs part of the approval process for some of our products, FDA granted us a New Chemical Entity (“NCE”) exclusivity period during which other\nmanufacturers’ applications for approval of generic versions of our products will not be approved. Generic manufacturers may challenge the patents protecting\nproducts that have been granted NCE exclusivity one year prior to the end of the NCE exclusivity period. Generic manufacturers have sought and may continue\nto seek FDA approval for a similar or identical drug through an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”), the application form typically used by\nmanufacturers seeking approval of a generic drug. The sale of generic versions of our products prior to their patent expiration would have a significant negative\neffect on our revenues and results of operations. To seek approval for a generic version of a product having NCE status, a generic company may submit its\nANDA to FDA four years after the branded product’s approval.\n22\nIn October 2021, we received a letter from Lupin Ltd. (“Lupin”) indicating that it has submitted an ANDA to FDA requesting permission to market and\nmanufacture a generic version of Symtuza, a product commercialized by Janssen and for which Gilead shares in revenues. In November 2021, we, along with\nJanssen and Janssen Products, L.P., filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Lupin as co-plaintiffs in the U.S. District Court of Delaware. In September 2022,\nwe received a letter from Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (“Apotex”) stating that they have submitted an ANDA for a generic version of Symtuza. In October\n2022, we, along with Janssen and Janssen Products, L.P., filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Apotex as co-plaintiffs in the U.S. District Court of\nDelaware. The cases against Lupin and Apotex have been consolidated into a single trial scheduled for February 2025.\nStarting in March 2022, we received letters from Lupin, Laurus Labs (“Laurus”) and Cipla Ltd. (“Cipla”), indicating that they have submitted ANDAs to\nFDA requesting permission to market and manufacture generic versions of the adult dosage strength of Biktarvy. Lupin, Laurus, and Cipla have challenged the\nvalidity of four of the six patents listed in the Orange Book as associated with Biktarvy. We filed a lawsuit against Lupin, Laurus and Cipla in May 2022 in the\nU.S. District Court of Delaware and intend to enforce and defend our intellectual property. Additionally, in November 2023, we received a letter from Cipla\nindicating that it has submitted an ANDA to FDA requesting permission to market and manufacture a generic version of the pediatric dosage strength of\nBiktarvy. Cipla challenged the validity of two of the patents listed in the Orange Book as associated with Biktarvy. We filed a separate lawsuit against Cipla in\nDecember 2023 in the U.S. District Court of Delaware. This lawsuit has been consolidated with the first lawsuit, with a single trial scheduled for October 2025.\nIn October 2024, Cipla separately filed a petition at the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) for Inter Partes Review (IPR) of one of the patents at issue in\nDistrict Court litigation. We intend to defend this patent at the USPTO.\nIn June 2023, we received a letter from Apotex indicating that it has submitted an ANDA to FDA requesting permission to market and manufacture a\ngeneric version of Genvoya. In July 2023, we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Apotex in the U.S. District Court of Delaware and intend to enforce\nand defend our intellectual property. This case has been consolidated with the Symtuza matters discussed above, and a trial has been scheduled for February\n2025.\nAntitrust and Consumer Protection\nWe, along with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (“BMS”), Johnson & Johnson, Inc. (“Johnson & Johnson”), and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.\n(“Teva”) have been named as defendants in class action lawsuits filed in 2019 and 2020 related to various drugs used to treat HIV, including drugs used in\ncombination antiretroviral therapy. Plaintiffs allege that we (and the other defendants) engaged in various conduct to restrain competition in violation of federal\nand state antitrust laws and state consumer protection laws. The lawsuits, which have been consolidated, are pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of California. The lawsuits seek to bring claims on behalf of direct purchasers consisting largely of wholesalers and indirect or end-payor purchasers,\nincluding health insurers and individual patients. Plaintiffs seek damages, permanent injunctive relief and other relief. In the second half of 2021 and first half\nof 2022, several plaintiffs consisting of retail pharmacies, individual health plans and United Healthcare, filed separate lawsuits effectively opting out of the\nclass action cases, asserting claims that are substantively the same as the classes. These cases have been coordinated with the class actions. In March 2023, the\nDistrict Court granted our motion to hold separate trials as to (i) the allegations against us and Teva seeking monetary damages relating to Truvada and Atripla\n(“Phase I”) and (ii) the allegations against us and, in part, Johnson & Johnson, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief relating to Complera (“Phase\nII”). In May 2023, we settled claims with the direct purchaser class and the retailer opt-out plaintiffs for $525 million, which we paid in the second half of\n2023. The settlement agreements are not an admission of liability or fault by us. In June 2023, the jury returned a complete verdict in Gilead’s favor on the\nremaining plaintiffs’ Phase I allegations. In November 2023, the court denied plaintiffs’ motion to set aside the verdict, and in February 2024, the court entered\nfinal judgment on the Phase I verdict and certain summary judgment rulings. In September 2024, plaintiffs filed their opening appellate briefs challenging the\nPhase I verdict and those summary judgment rulings. The court has stayed Phase II pending the appeal of Phase I. While we intend to vigorously oppose the\nappeal and defend against the Phase II claims, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome. If plaintiffs are successful in their appeal or Phase II claims, we could\nbe required to pay monetary damages or could be subject to permanent injunctive relief in favor of plaintiffs.\nIn January 2022, we, along with BMS and Janssen Products, L.P., were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of the State of\nCalifornia, County of San Mateo, by Aetna, Inc. on behalf of itself and its affiliates and subsidiaries that effectively opts the Aetna plaintiffs out of the above\nclass actions. The allegations are substantively the same as those in the class actions. The Aetna plaintiffs seek damages, permanent injunctive relief and other\nrelief. In March 2024, the court denied our motion for judgment on the pleadings to preclude Aetna from re-litigating claims that were dismissed at summary\njudgment in the above class action cases. We filed a writ petition appealing the denial of our motion for judgment on the pleadings, which the appellate court\ndenied in May 2024. In April 2024, the court granted our motion to bifurcate the case to adjudicate the issue of preclusion before litigating the merits of the\ncase. In July 2024, Aetna filed a request to voluntarily dismiss two of its claims with prejudice, which the court subsequently granted, leaving only the claims\nrelated to Truvada and Atripla. In September 2024, Aetna filed an amended complaint with respect to these claims.\n23\nIn February 2021, we, along with BMS and Teva, were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed in the First Judicial District Court for the State of New\nMexico, County of Santa Fe by the New Mexico Attorney General. The New Mexico Attorney General alleges that we (and the other defendants) restrained\ncompetition in violation of New Mexico antitrust and consumer protection laws. The New Mexico Attorney General seeks damages, permanent injunctive\nrelief and other relief. We moved to dismiss the case based on lack of personal jurisdiction and, in July 2023, the New Mexico Supreme Court remanded the\ncase back to the trial court for limited jurisdictional discovery.\nWe intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these actions, however, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome. If plaintiffs are successful in their claims, we\ncould be required to pay significant monetary damages or could be subject to permanent injunctive relief awarded in favor of plaintiffs, which may result in a\nmaterial, adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes\nprobable and estimable.\nProduct Liability\nWe have been named as a defendant in one putative class action lawsuit and various product liability lawsuits related to Viread, Truvada, Atripla,\nComplera and Stribild. Plaintiffs allege that Viread, Truvada, Atripla, Complera and/or Stribild caused them to experience kidney, bone and/or tooth injuries.\nThe lawsuits, which are pending in state or federal court in California and Missouri, involve approximately 25,000 active plaintiffs. Plaintiffs in these cases\nseek damages and other relief on various grounds for alleged personal injury and economic loss. The first bellwether trial in California state court was\nscheduled to begin in October 2022 but is currently stayed pending the conclusion of appellate proceedings in the California Supreme Court. A bellwether trial\ndate in California federal court has been vacated following a settlement agreement in principle. Specifically, Gilead reached an agreement to make a one-time\npayment of up to $40 million to a group of eligible plaintiffs (approximately 2,625 plaintiffs). The agreement is subject to certain conditions, including that at\nleast 98% of eligible plaintiffs elect to participate in the settlement. The putative class action in Missouri is currently awaiting decision from the court whether\nto certify the proposed class. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these actions, however, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome. If plaintiffs are\nsuccessful in their claims, we could be required to pay significant monetary damages, which may result in a material, adverse effect on our results of operations\nand financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable.\nGovernment Investigation\nIn 2017, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York requesting documents related to our promotional\nspeaker programs for HIV. We are cooperating with this inquiry.\nQui Tam Litigation\nA former sales employee filed a qui tam lawsuit against Gilead in March 2017 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Following\nthe government’s decision not to intervene in the suit, the case was unsealed in December 2020. The lawsuit alleges that certain of Gilead’s HCV sales and\nmarketing activities violated the federal False Claims Act and various state false claims acts. The lawsuit seeks all available relief under these statutes.\nHealth Choice Advocates, LLC (“Health Choice”) filed a qui tam lawsuit against Gilead in May 2020 in Texas state court. The lawsuit alleged that Gilead\nviolated the Texas Medicare Fraud Prevention Act (“TMFPA”) through our clinical educator programs for Sovaldi and Harvoni and our HCV and HIV patient\nsupport programs. The lawsuit sought all available relief under the TMFPA. Health Choice voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice in August 2023,\nand commenced a new action in October 2023, asserting largely identical allegations and claims. In the newly filed action, the Texas Attorney General has\nintervened as a plaintiff.\nWe intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these actions, however, we cannot predict the ultimate outcomes. If any of these plaintiffs are successful in\ntheir claims, we could be required to pay significant monetary damages, which may result in a material, adverse effect on our results of operations and financial\ncondition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable.\nOther Matters\nWe are a party to various legal actions that arose in the ordinary course of our business. We do not believe that it is probable or reasonably possible that\nthese other legal actions will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n24\n11. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nThe following table shows the calculation of Basic and Diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to Gilead:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions, except per share amounts) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income (loss) attributable to Gilead $ 1,253 $ 2,180 $ (1,303) $ 4,236\nShares used in basic earnings (loss) per share attributable to Gilead calculation 1,247 1,248 1,247 1,249\nDilutive effect of stock options and equivalents 7 8 — 10\nShares used in diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to Gilead calculation 1,254 1,257 1,247 1,259\nBasic earnings (loss) per share attributable to Gilead $ 1.00 $ 1.75 $ (1.04) $ 3.39\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to Gilead $ 1.00 $ 1.73 $ (1.04) $ 3.37\nPotential shares of common stock excluded from the computation of Diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to Gilead because their effect would\nhave been antidilutive were 7 million and 14 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 6 million and 4 million for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n12. INCOME TAXES\nThe following table summarizes our Income tax (benefit) expense:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions, except percentages) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nIncome (loss) before income taxes $ 956 $ 2,318 $ (1,477) $ 5,206\nIncome tax (benefit) expense $ (297) $ 146 $ (174) $ 1,010\nEffective tax rate (31.1)% 6.3 % 11.8 % 19.4 %\nOur effective income tax rate of (31.1)% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily\ndue to a non-recurring tax benefit associated with a legal entity restructuring and a decrease in state deferred tax liabilities associated with the $1.8 billion\nNSCLC IPR&D intangible asset impairment charge.\nOur effective income tax rate of 11.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due\nto $3.9 billion of non-deductible acquired IPR&D expense recorded in connection with our acquisition of CymaBay, partially offset by a non-recurring tax\nbenefit associated with a legal entity restructuring, a decrease in state deferred tax liabilities associated with the $4.2 billion NSCLC IPR&D intangible asset\nimpairment charge, and settlements with tax authorities.\nOur effective income tax rate of 6.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due\nto a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits as a result of reaching agreement with a tax authority on certain tax positions.\nOur effective income tax rate of 19.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due\nto the above-mentioned reason for the three months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by remeasurement of certain deferred tax liabilities related to\nacquired intangible assets and non-deductible acquired IPR&D expenses recorded associated with our acquisitions of XinThera and Tmunity.\nOur income tax returns are subject to audit by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue\nService for our 2019 to 2021 tax years. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these\ntax authorities involving issues on the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our\nexposures associated with our tax filing positions.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our unrecognized tax benefits balance as of December 31, 2023 increased by approximately $200\nmillion. This net increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately $700 million for current year unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by a\ndecrease of approximately $500 million for reductions to prior year tax positions and settlements.\n25\nItem 2.

In the lenacapavir group, 99.9% of participants did not acquire HIV infection, with two incident cases among 2,179\nparticipants. Lenacapavir reduced HIV infections by 96% compared to background HIV incidence in cisgender men and gender-diverse people, and\nadditionally demonstrated superiority to daily Truvada (89% relative risk reduction). Lenacapavir was generally well-tolerated and no significant or\nnew safety concerns were identified. Gilead expects to file for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval before the end of the year, with\nglobal filings to follow. The use of lenacapavir for the prevention of HIV is investigational.\n• Received approval from FDA to update Biktarvy’s label with additional data reinforcing the safety and efficacy profile to treat pregnant people with\nHIV-1 with suppressed viral loads.\n• Received approval from FDA to expand Biktarvy’s label to include treatment of people with HIV who have suppressed viral loads with known or\nsuspected M184V/I resistance.\n• Received approval from FDA to expand the indication for Vemlidy to include treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (“HBV”) in children six years and\nolder who weigh at least 25 kg with compensated liver disease.\nOncology\n• Announced plans to voluntarily withdraw the U.S. accelerated approval of Trodelvy for use in pre-treated adult patients with locally advanced or\nmetastatic urothelial cancer, following the results of the Phase 3 TROPiCS-04 trial announced in May 2024.\n• Announced a research collaboration, option and license agreement with Merus N.V. to discover novel antibody-based trispecific T-cell engagers in\noncology.\n• Entered into an exclusive license agreement with Xilio Therapeutics, Inc. (“Xilio”) to develop and commercialize Xilio’s tumor-activated IL-12\nprogram, including investigational candidate XTX301 in advanced solid tumors.\nInflammation\n• Received accelerated approval from FDA for Livdelzi (seladelpar) for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis in combination with\nursodeoxycholic acid (“UDCA”) in adults who have had an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in patients unable to tolerate UDCA.\n• Entered into an amended license agreement featuring the buy-out of global seladelpar royalties from Janssen Pharmaceutica NV (“Janssen”) for $320\nmillion.\n• Completed the acquisition of CymaBay Therapeutics, Inc. (“CymaBay”), for $4.3 billion in total equity value, or $3.9 billion net cash paid, adding\ninvestigational candidate seladelpar for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis to Gilead’s Liver Disease portfolio.\n26\nOther\n• Announced a strategic collaboration with Genesis Therapeutics, Inc. (“Genesis”) to discover and develop novel small molecule therapies across\nmultiple targets using Genesis’ artificial intelligence platform.\nKey Financial Results\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions, except percentages and per share amounts) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nTotal revenues $ 7,545 $ 7,051 7 % $ 21,185 $ 20,002 6 %\nNet income (loss) attributable to Gilead $ 1,253 $ 2,180 (43)% $ (1,303) $ 4,236 NM\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to Gilead $ 1.00 $ 1.73 (42)% $ (1.04) $ 3.37 NM\n_______________________________\nNM - Not Meaningful\nTotal revenues increased 7% to $7.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher\nproduct sales in HIV.\nTotal revenues increased 6% to $21.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to\nhigher product sales in HIV, Oncology and Liver Disease.\nNet income attributable to Gilead was $1.3 billion and diluted earnings per share attributable to Gilead was $1.00 for the three months ended September\n30, 2024, compared to net income attributable to Gilead of $2.2 billion and diluted earnings per share attributable to Gilead of $1.73 for the same period in\n2023. The decrease was primarily due to:\n• A pre-tax in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) partial impairment charge of $1.8 billion related to assets acquired by Gilead from\nImmunomedics, Inc. (“Immunomedics”) in 2020 (see further information in “Results of Operations; In-Process Research and Development\nImpairment” below); and\n• Higher acquired IPR&D expenses; partially offset by\n• Higher revenues;\n• Lower income tax expense; and\n• Higher net unrealized gains on equity securities.\nNet loss attributable to Gilead was $1.3 billion and diluted loss per share attributable to Gilead was $1.04 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to net income attributable to Gilead of $4.2 billion and diluted earnings per share attributable to Gilead of $3.37 for the same period in 2023. The\ndecrease was primarily due to:\n• A pre-tax IPR&D partial impairment charge of $4.2 billion related to assets acquired by Gilead from Immunomedics in 2020 (see further information\nin “Results of Operations; In-Process Research and Development Impairment” below); and\n• Higher acquired IPR&D expenses, primarily $3.9 billion related to the acquisition of CymaBay; partially offset by\n• Lower income tax expense;\n• Higher revenues; and\n• Lower net unrealized losses on equity securities.\n27\nResults of Operations\nRevenues\nThe following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our Total revenues:\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nRest of Rest of\n(in millions) U.S. Europe World Total U.S. Europe World Total Change\nProduct sales:\nHIV\nBiktarvy $ 2,826 $ 375 $ 272 $ 3,472 $ 2,504 $ 313 $ 268 $ 3,085 13 %\nDescovy 534 24 28 586 460 25 26 511 15 %\nGenvoya 384 44 21 449 433 47 23 503 (11)%\nOdefsey 248 69 9 326 257 74 11 343 (5)%\nSymtuza - Revenue share(1) 103 33 3 139 96 32 3 131 6 %\nOther HIV(2) 65 26 9 100 56 28 9 94 7 %\nTotal HIV 4,161 570 342 5,073 3,807 519 341 4,667 9 %\nLiver Disease\nSofosbuvir/Velpatasvir(3) 222 67 96 385 215 76 85 377 2 %\nVemlidy 126 11 95 232 112 9 106 228 2 %\nOther Liver Disease(4) 45 54 17 116 49 33 20 102 14 %\nTotal Liver Disease 393 132 207 733 376 119 211 706 4 %\nVeklury 393 81 219 692 258 65 313 636 9 %\nOncology\nCell Therapy\nTecartus 63 29 6 98 64 27 4 96 2 %\nYescarta 145 182 60 387 197 154 40 391 (1)%\nTotal Cell Therapy 208 211 66 485 261 181 45 486 — %\nTrodelvy 226 80 26 332 201 62 21 283 17 %\nTotal Oncology 433 291 92 816 462 243 65 769 6 %\nOther\nAmBisome 6 71 52 130 12 63 39 115 13 %\nOther(5) 47 8 16 71 69 9 23 101 (29)%\nTotal Other 53 80 68 201 82 72 62 216 (7)%\nTotal product sales 5,433 1,154 928 7,515 4,985 1,017 992 6,994 7 %\nRoyalty, contract and other revenues 17 13 1 30 32 23 1 56 (46)%\nTotal revenues $ 5,450 $ 1,167 $ 929 $ 7,545 $ 5,017 $ 1,040 $ 993 $ 7,051 7 %\n28\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nRest of Rest of\n(in millions) U.S. Europe World Total U.S. Europe World Total Change\nProduct sales:\nHIV\nBiktarvy $ 7,726 $ 1,110 $ 814 $ 9,649 $ 7,104 $ 920 $ 717 $ 8,741 10 %\nDescovy 1,339 75 82 1,496 1,314 75 86 1,475 1 %\nGenvoya 1,088 138 66 1,292 1,305 157 81 1,544 (16)%\nOdefsey 705 217 30 952 754 223 33 1,011 (6)%\nSymtuza - Revenue share(1) 338 101 9 448 278 101 10 390 15 %\nOther HIV(2) 190 96 36 322 192 91 38 321 — %\nTotal HIV 11,386 1,737 1,038 14,160 10,949 1,568 965 13,482 5 %\nLiver Disease\nSofosbuvir/Velpatasvir(3) 737 230 299 1,266 643 250 266 1,159 9 %\nVemlidy 338 33 328 699 295 28 322 645 8 %\nOther Liver Disease(4) 134 148 55 337 113 112 64 289 17 %\nTotal Liver Disease 1,210 411 682 2,302 1,051 390 652 2,093 10 %\nVeklury 784 204 473 1,461 607 227 630 1,465 — %\nOncology\nCell Therapy\nTecartus 181 102 22 305 179 83 11 272 12 %\nYescarta 502 509 170 1,181 624 408 99 1,130 4 %\nTotal Cell Therapy 683 611 192 1,485 802 491 109 1,402 6 %\nTrodelvy 655 217 88 960 551 169 44 764 26 %\nTotal Oncology 1,338 828 280 2,446 1,354 660 153 2,167 13 %\nOther\nAmBisome 37 210 176 424 39 192 150 381 11 %\nOther(5) 203 26 52 281 197 31 49 277 1 %\nTotal Other 241 236 228 705 236 224 199 658 7 %\nTotal product sales 14,958 3,416 2,700 21,074 14,196 3,069 2,599 19,864 6 %\nRoyalty, contract and other revenues 66 43 2 111 57 77 4 138 (19)%\nTotal revenues $ 15,024 $ 3,459 $ 2,703 $ 21,185 $ 14,253 $ 3,146 $ 2,603 $ 20,002 6 %\n_______________________________\n(1) Represents our revenue from cobicistat (“C”), emtricitabine (“FTC”) and tenofovir alafenamide (“TAF”) in Symtuza (darunavir/C/FTC/TAF), a fixed dose combination product commercialized\nby Janssen Sciences Ireland Unlimited Company (“Janssen”).\n(2) Includes Atripla, Complera/Eviplera, Emtriva, Sunlenca, Stribild, Truvada and Tybost.\n(3) Includes Epclusa and the authorized generic version of Epclusa sold by Gilead’s separate subsidiary, Asegua Therapeutics LLC (“Asegua”).\n(4) Includes ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (Harvoni and the authorized generic version of Harvoni sold by Asegua), Hepcludex, Hepsera, Livdelzi, Sovaldi, Viread and Vosevi.\n(5) Includes Cayston, Jyseleca, Letairis, Ranexa and Zydelig.\nHIV\nHIV product sales increased 9% to $5.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to\nhigher average realized price, mainly due to shifts in channel mix, and higher demand, partially offset by inventory dynamics. In particular:\n• Biktarvy sales increased primarily due to higher demand, including patients switching from Genvoya and other Gilead HIV products, and higher\naverage realized price, partially offset by lower inventory build in the distribution channel.\n• Descovy sales increased primarily due to higher demand and higher average realized price, partially offset by lower inventory build in the distribution\nchannel.\n29\nHIV product sales increased 5% to $14.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to\nhigher demand and higher average realized price, driven mainly by higher net pricing partially offset by unfavorable channel mix in the U.S. In particular:\n• Biktarvy sales increased primarily due to higher demand, including patients switching from Genvoya and other Gilead HIV products, and higher\naverage realized price.\n• Descovy sales increased primarily due to higher demand, partially offset by lower average realized price.\nLiver Disease\nLiver Disease product sales increased 4% to $733 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023,\nprimarily due to higher demand in products for chronic hepatitis C virus (“HCV”), HBV and, in Europe, chronic hepatitis D virus (“HDV”), partially offset by\nlower average realized price.\nLiver Disease product sales increased 10% to $2.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily\ndue to higher demand in products for HCV, HBV and, in Europe, HDV, as well as higher average realized price.\nVeklury\nVeklury product sales increased 9% to $692 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily\ndriven by increased rates of COVID-19-related hospitalizations, particularly in the U.S.\nVeklury product sales were $1.5 billion and remained relatively flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.\nOncology\nCell Therapy\nCell Therapy product sales were $485 million and remained relatively flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period\nin 2023, primarily due to:\n• Decreased Yescarta sales primarily due to lower demand from higher in- and out-of-class competition in the U.S. partially offset by higher demand for\nthe treatment of relapsed or refractory (“R/R”) large B-cell lymphoma (“LBCL”) outside the U.S.; and\n• Increased Tecartus sales primarily due to higher demand for the treatment of R/R adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”).\nCell Therapy product sales increased 6% to $1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily\ndue to:\n• Increased Yescarta sales primarily due to higher demand for the treatment of R/R LBCL outside the U.S., partially offset by lower demand from higher\nin- and out-of-class competition in the U.S.; and\n• Increased Tecartus sales primarily due to higher demand for the treatment of R/R ALL.\nTrodelvy\nTrodelvy product sales increased 17% to $332 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily\ndue to higher demand across all regions.\nTrodelvy product sales increased 26% to $960 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily\ndue to higher demand across all regions.\nOther\nOther product sales decreased 7% to $201 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to\nlower demand for Letairis and other products, partially offset by higher demand for AmBisome.\nOther product sales increased 7% to $705 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to\nhigher average realized price and higher demand for AmBisome as well as higher average realized price and higher demand for Letairis related to a temporary\nshortage of generics in the market.\n30\nForeign Currency Exchange Impact\nWe generally face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the Euro. We use foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge\na portion of our foreign currency exposures.\nApproximately 26% and 27% of our product sales were denominated in foreign currencies during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact on our total product sales of $56 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, based on a comparison using foreign currency exchange rates from the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nApproximately 27% of our product sales were denominated in foreign currencies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Acquisitions, Collaborations and Other Arrangements of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1\nof this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\n32\nIn-Process Research and Development Impairment\nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately $5.9 billion was assigned to an indefinite-lived IPR&D intangible asset related to Trodelvy for metastatic non-\nsmall cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”). In addition to NSCLC, Trodelvy is being explored for potential investigational use in a range of tumor types where Trop-2\nis highly expressed. Gilead’s clinical development program in metastatic NSCLC includes ongoing Phase 2 and registrational Phase 3 studies for Trodelvy as a\nfirst- or second-line indication.\nIn January 2024, we received data from our Phase 3 EVOKE-01 study of Trodelvy evaluating sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (“SG”) indicating that the\nstudy did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival in previously treated metastatic NSCLC, thus triggering a review for potential impairment of the\nNSCLC IPR&D impairment asset. Based on our evaluation of the study results and all other data currently available, and in connection with the preparation of\nthe financial statements for the first quarter, we performed an interim impairment test and determined that the revised estimated fair value of the NSCLC\nIPR&D intangible asset was below its carrying value. As a result, we recognized a partial impairment charge of $2.4 billion in In-process research and\ndevelopment impairment on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nIn September 2024, based on discussions with regulators and external opinion leaders and the completed evaluation of the Phase 3 EVOKE-01 study data,\nwe made a strategic decision to discontinue our clinical development program in metastatic NSCLC for Trodelvy in the second-line indication. This decision\ntriggered a review for potential impairment of the NSCLC IPR&D intangible asset. Based on our evaluation, and in connection with the preparation of the\nfinancial statements for the third quarter, we performed an interim impairment test and determined that the revised estimated fair value of the NSCLC IPR&D\nintangible asset was below its carrying value. As a result, we recognized a partial impairment charge of $1.8 billion in In-process research and development\nimpairment on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and including the first quarter\nimpairment described above, the total In-process research and development impairment on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 totaled $4.2 billion.\nTo arrive at the revised estimated fair value, we used a probability-weighted income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to present value,\nwhich requires the use of Level 3 fair value measurements and inputs, and requires the use of critical estimated inputs, including: revenues and operating\nprofits related to the planned utilization of SG in NSCLC, which, include inputs such as addressable patient population, projected market share, treatment\nduration, and the life of the potential commercialized product; the probability of technical and regulatory success; the time and resources needed to complete\nthe development and approval of SG in NSCLC; an appropriate discount rate based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with\nprofiles similar to our profile; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. Our revised discounted cash\nflows for the March 31, 2024 fair value estimation primarily reflect the smaller addressable market that Trodelvy could serve among metastatic NSCLC\npatients and a delay in expected launch timing for second-line plus patients. Our revised discounted cash flows for the September 30, 2024 fair value estimation\nprimarily reflect the removal of cash flows associated with second-line plus patients, and the remaining carrying value as of that date reflects Trodelvy’s\nopportunity as a combination therapy in first-line metastatic NSCLC patients supported by its ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial in this patient population. The\nrevised estimated fair value of the NSCLC IPR&D intangible asset was $3.5 billion as of March 31, 2024 and $1.8 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nIf future events result in adverse changes in the key assumptions used in determining fair value, including the timing of product launches, information on\nthe competitive landscape of treatments in this indication, changes to the probability of technical or regulatory success, failure to obtain anticipated regulatory\napproval or discount rate, among others, additional impairments may be recorded and could be material to our financial statements.\nNo IPR&D impairment charges were recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses are recorded when incurred and consist primarily of personnel costs, facilities and overhead costs, outside\nmarketing, advertising and legal expenses, and other general and administrative costs related to sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other\nadministrative activities.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 9% to $1.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in\n2023, primarily due to:\n• Higher commercial activities, including the launch of Livdelzi in the U.S.; and\n• Higher corporate activities.\n33\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased 7% to $4.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in\n2023, primarily due to:\n• A 2023 expense of $525 million for settlements with certain plaintiffs in HIV antitrust litigation which did not repeat in 2024; and\n• A decrease in our allocation of the branded prescription drug fee; partially offset by\n• Stock-based compensation expenses of $67 million and other integration costs related to the acquisition of CymaBay;\n• Higher commercial activities, including the launch of Livdelzi in the U.S.; and\n• Higher restructuring costs.\nInterest Expense and Other (Income) Expense, Net\nThe following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in Interest expense and Other (income) expense, net:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions, except percentages) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nInterest expense $ 238 $ 232 2 % $ 728 $ 692 5 %\nOther (income) expense, net $ (306) $ 72 NM $ (41) $ 95 NM\n(Gain) loss from equity securities, net $ (258) $ 168 NM $ 148 $ 356 (58)%\nInterest income $ (52) $ (106) (50)% $ (196) $ (274) (28)%\nOther, net $ 4 $ 10 (56)% $ 7 $ 13 (44)%\n_______________________________\nNM - Not Meaningful\nInterest expense was $238 million and remained relatively flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.\nInterest expense increased 5% to $728 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a\nhigher average interest rate on long-term debt, partially offset by lower debt balances.\nSee Note 9.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAn evaluation as of September 30, 2024 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures,” which are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the\nU.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that the\ninformation required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and\nreported, within the time periods specified in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures\nwere effective as of September 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated any changes in our internal control over financial\nreporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, to identify any change that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our\ninternal control over financial reporting. In August 2023, we began deploying a new enterprise resource planning system (“ERP”) as well as other related\nsystems. We have made changes to our internal control over financial reporting to address the related processes and systems. We will continue to evaluate any\nfurther changes in our internal control over financial reporting over the course of the implementation of the new ERP and other related systems, which is\nscheduled to occur in phases over the next few years.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nA control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control\nsystem are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any,\nwithin a company have been detected. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of our disclosure control system are met and, as set forth above, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based on\ntheir evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance\nthat the objectives of our disclosure control system were met.\n36\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFor a description of our significant pending legal proceedings, please see Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nItem 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following discussion of material risks, events and uncertainties that make an investment in\nus speculative or risky in addition to the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. A manifestation of any of the following risks and\nuncertainties could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our business and operations, growth,\nreputation (including the commercial or scientific reputation of our products), prospects, product pipeline and sales, operating and financial results, financial\ncondition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is\nnot possible to predict or identify all such factors; our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or\nthat we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. Therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete\nstatement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face.\nProduct and Commercialization Risks\nCertain of our products subject us to additional or heightened risks.\nHIV\nWe receive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our products for the treatment and prevention of HIV infection. We may be unable to sustain\nor increase sales of our HIV products for any number of reasons, including market share gains by competitive products, including generics, or the inability to\nintroduce new HIV medications necessary to remain competitive. In such case, we may need to scale back our operations, including our future drug\ndevelopment and spending on research and development (“R&D”) efforts. For example, many of our HIV products contain tenofovir alafenamide (“TAF”),\nwhich belongs to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutics. If there are any changes to the treatment or prevention paradigm for HIV, and nucleoside-based\ntherapeutics do not remain the preferred regimen, our HIV product sales would be adversely impacted.\nCell Therapy\nAdvancing a novel and personalized therapy such as Yescarta or Tecartus, which are chimeric antigen receptor (“CAR”) T-cell therapies, creates\nsignificant challenges, including:\n• educating and certifying medical personnel regarding the procedures and the potential side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome and neurologic\ntoxicities, in compliance with the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”);\n• securing sufficient supply of other medications to manage side effects, such as tocilizumab and corticosteroids, which may not be available in\nsufficient quantities, may not adequately control the side effects and/or may have detrimental impacts on the efficacy of cell therapy;\n• developing and maintaining a robust and reliable process for engineering a patient’s T cells in our facilities and infusing them back into the patient;\nand\n• conditioning patients with chemotherapy in advance of administering our therapy, which may increase the risk of adverse side effects.\nThe use of engineered T cells as a potential cancer treatment is a recent development and may not be broadly accepted by physicians, patients, hospitals,\ncancer treatment centers, payers and others in the medical community. For example, in January 2024, FDA instituted a class labeling change for all approved\nCAR T-cell therapies, including a “boxed warning” about the possible risk of secondary T-cell malignancies in patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy. For\nchallenges related to the reimbursement of Yescarta and Tecartus, see also “Our existing products are subject to reimbursement pressures from government\nagencies and other third parties, required rebates and discounts, and other pricing pressures.”\nWe rely on third-party sites to collect patients’ white blood cells, known as apheresis centers, as well as shippers, couriers, and hospitals for the logistical\ncollection of patients’ white blood cells and ultimate delivery of Yescarta and Tecartus to patients. These vendors may encounter disruptions or difficulties that\ncould result in product loss and regulatory action. Apheresis centers may also choose not to participate in our quality certification process, or we may be unable\nto complete such certification in a timely manner or at all, which could delay or constrain our manufacturing and commercialization efforts.\n37\nWe also face risks related to our in-house CAR T-cell therapy manufacturing facilities in California, Maryland and the Netherlands, spanning process\ndevelopment, vector manufacturing, clinical trial production and commercial product manufacturing. Quality, reliability and speed are critical in cell therapy\nmanufacturing to quickly and safely deliver our cell therapies to patients. Any delays or quality issues with our manufacturing operations could adversely affect\nour business and damage our reputation. In addition, we may not be able to sufficiently increase manufacturing network capacity to meet growing demand.\nOur success depends on developing and commercializing new products or expanding the indications for existing products.\nIf we are unable to launch commercially successful new products or new indications for existing products, our business will be adversely impacted. The\nlaunch of commercially successful products is necessary to grow our business, cover our substantial R&D expenses, and offset revenue losses when existing\nproducts lose market share due to factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in drug\ndevelopment and the introduction of new products. The product development cycle is characterized by significant investments of resources, long lead times and\nunpredictable outcomes due to the nature of developing medicines for human use. We expend significant time and resources on our product pipeline as well as\non preparations for potential commercial launch without any assurance that we will recoup our investments or that our efforts will be commercially successful.\nA high rate of failure is inherent in the discovery and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the\nprocess after substantial investment. Such failures have had, and may have in the future, a negative impact on our business and financial results, including as a\nresult of our inability to recover R&D, clinical trial, acquisition-related and other expenses incurred in connection with the development of and launch\npreparations for our product candidates. For example, we enter into commitments to purchase materials and supplies in anticipation of the potential\nmanufacture and sale of new product candidates, and in the event the development, approval or launch of these product candidates is delayed or otherwise\nunsuccessful, we may experience excess inventory that needs to be written down or other costs and expenses resulting from such commitments.\nWe face challenges in accurately forecasting sales because of the difficulties in predicting demand for our products and fluctuations in purchasing patterns\nor wholesaler/distributor inventories.\nWe may be unable to accurately predict demand for our products as demand depends on a number of factors. If we do not accurately forecast demand or\nmanufacture products at levels to align with actual demand, then we may experience product shortages or build excess inventory that may need to be written\noff. For example, product demand may be adversely affected if physicians do not see the benefit of our products. Additionally, uptake of new products may not\nmaterialize as expected, or at all in the case of unsuccessful product candidates. For example, Veklury sales generally reflect COVID-19 related rates and\nseverity of infections and hospitalizations, as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of vaccines and alternative treatments for COVID-19, and future\nsales in the short- and long-term remain uncertain.\nAdditionally, the non-retail sector in the U.S., which includes government institutions, including state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs, the U.S.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, correctional facilities and large health maintenance organizations, tends to be less consistent in terms of buying patterns and\noften causes quarter-over-quarter fluctuations that do not mirror actual patient demand for our products. Federal and state budget pressures, as well as the\nannual grant cycles for federal and state funds, may cause purchasing patterns to not reflect patient demand for our products. We expect to continue to\nexperience fluctuations in the purchasing patterns of our non-retail customers. In light of the budget crises faced by many European countries, we have\nobserved variations in purchasing patterns induced by cost containment measures in Europe. We believe these measures have caused some government\nagencies and other purchasers to reduce inventory of our products in the distribution channels, and we may continue to see this trend in the future.\nWe sell and distribute most of our products in the U.S. exclusively through the wholesaler/distributor channel. Historically, approximately 90% of our\nproduct sales in the U.S. have been to three wholesalers, Cardinal Health, Inc., Cencora, Inc., and McKesson Corporation, and their specialty distributor\naffiliates. The U.S. wholesalers and distributors with whom we have entered into inventory management agreements make estimates to determine end-user\ndemand and may not be accurate in matching their inventory levels to actual end-user demand. As a result, changes in inventory levels held by those\nwholesalers and distributors can cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly if our sales to these wholesalers and distributors do not match end-user\ndemand. In addition, inventory is held at retail and specialty pharmacies and other non-wholesaler/distributor locations with whom we have no inventory\nmanagement agreements and no control over buying patterns. Adverse changes in economic conditions, increased competition or other factors may cause retail\nand specialty pharmacies to reduce their inventories of our products, which would reduce their orders from wholesalers and distributors and, consequently, the\nwholesalers’ and distributors’ orders from us, even if end-user demand has not changed. In addition, we have observed that strong wholesaler/distributor and\nsub-wholesaler/distributor purchases of our products in the second half of the year typically results in inventory draw-down by wholesalers/distributors and\nsub-wholesalers/distributors in the subsequent first quarter. As inventory in the distribution channel fluctuates from quarter to quarter, we may continue to see\nfluctuations in our earnings and a mismatch between prescription demand for our products and our revenues.\n38\nWe face significant competition from global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialized pharmaceutical firms and generic drug\nmanufacturers.\nNew branded or generic products entering major markets affects our ability to maintain pricing and market share. Our products compete with other\navailable products based primarily on efficacy, safety, tolerability, acceptance by doctors, ease of patient compliance, ease of use, price, insurance and other\nreimbursement coverage, distribution and marketing. A number of companies are pursuing the development of products and technologies that may be\ncompetitive with our existing products or research programs. These competing companies include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and\nspecialized pharmaceutical firms acting either independently or together with other such companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies\nand other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection or may establish collaborative arrangements for competitive\nproducts or programs. We may be adversely impacted if any of these competitors gain market share as a result of new technologies, commercialization\nstrategies or otherwise.\nOur existing products are subject to reimbursement pressures from government agencies and other third parties, required rebates and discounts, and other\npricing pressures.\nProduct Reimbursements\nSuccessful commercialization of our products depends, in part, on the availability and amount of third-party payer reimbursement for our products and\nrelated treatments and medical services in the markets where we sell our products. As our products mature, pricing pressures from private insurers and\ngovernment payers often result in a reduction of the net product prices.\nLegislative and regulatory actions affecting government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement programs occur relatively frequently. We may\nbe adversely impacted by any such legislative and regulatory actions, though it is difficult to predict the impact, if any, on the use and reimbursement of our\nproducts.\nProduct Pricing, Discounts and Rebates\nIn the U.S., the European Union (“EU”) and other significant or potentially significant markets for our products and product candidates, government\nauthorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services. The volume of drug pricing-related\nlegislation has dramatically increased in recent years, including:\n• U.S. Congress has enacted laws requiring manufacturer refunds on certain amounts of discarded drug from single-use vials and eliminating the\nexisting cap on Medicaid rebate amounts beginning in 2024.\n• U.S. Congress has enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “Act”), which, among other changes, (1) requires the Department of Health and\nHuman Services to “negotiate” Medicare prices for certain drugs (starting with 10 drugs in 2026, adding 15 drugs in 2027 and 2028, and adding 20\ndrugs in 2029 and subsequent years), (2) imposes an inflation-based rebate on Medicare Part B utilization starting in 2023 and Part D utilization\nbeginning October 1, 2022, and (3) restructures the Medicare Part D benefit to cap out-of-pocket expenses for Part D beneficiaries beginning in 2024\nand, effective January 1, 2025, increases Part D plans’ contributions in the catastrophic coverage phase and increases manufacturers’ discount\ncontributions across coverage phases such that manufacturers must pay a 10% discount in the initial coverage phase and a 20% discount in the\ncatastrophic phase on drugs utilized by all Part D beneficiaries, including low income subsidy patients. In August 2024, the Centers for Medicare &\nMedicaid Services (“CMS”) disclosed the Maximum Fair Prices (“MFP”) of the first group of 10 drugs selected for the MFP determination process; if\nthese prices are lower than the Medicaid Best Price, they could also affect the manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate obligations and the 340B ceiling prices\ncharged to covered entities. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the Act on our business. CMS has issued a number of guidance\ndocuments, but it remains unclear how certain provisions of the Act will be implemented. Additional guidance, legislation or rulemaking may be\nissued that could change the scope or implementation of the Act. In addition, multiple manufacturers and trade organizations have challenged the\nMedicare “negotiation” provisions of the Act, and additional legal challenges may be filed in the future. While the full impact of the Act on our\nbusiness and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain at this time, we anticipate that the Act will increase our payment obligations under the\nredesigned Part D discount program, limit the prices we can charge for our products, and increase the rebates we must provide government programs\nfor our products, thereby reducing our profitability and negatively impacting our financial results.\n39\n• Many state legislatures are considering, or have already passed into law, legislation that seeks to indirectly or directly regulate pharmaceutical drug\npricing, such as requiring manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information, creating review boards for prices, establishing drug\npayment limits, and encouraging the use of generic drugs. For example, in August 2023, the Colorado Prescription Drug Affordability Review Board\n(“PDAB”) selected Genvoya for an affordability review, and subsequently determined that Genvoya was not unaffordable. Additional state PDABs\nhave or may in the future undertake similar affordability reviews of our products. A finding that one of our products is unaffordable could lead to\nlegislative action to designate an upper limit on the amount certain purchasers and payors can pay for our products. These initiatives and such other\nlegislation may cause added pricing pressures on our products, and the resulting impact on our business is uncertain at this time.\n• Many countries outside the U.S., including the EU member states, have established complex and lengthy procedures to obtain price approvals and\ncoverage reimbursement and periodically review their pricing and reimbursement decisions. The outcome of these reviews cannot be predicted and\ncould have an adverse effect on the pricing and reimbursement of our medical products in the EU member states. Reductions in the pricing of our\nmedical products in one member state could affect the price in other member states and have a negative impact on our financial results.\nA substantial portion of our product sales is subject to significant discounts from list price, including rebates that we may be required to pay state\nMedicaid agencies and discounts provided to covered entities under Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act (“340B”). Changes to the 340B program or\nthe Medicaid program at the federal or state level could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, the continued growth of the 340B program\nlimits the prices we may charge on an increasing percentage of sales. Changes to the calculation of rebates under the Medicaid program could substantially\nincrease our Medicaid rebate obligations and decrease the prices we charge 340B-covered entities.\nIn March 2022, we implemented a contract pharmacy integrity initiative for our branded hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) products. This integrity initiative does\nnot involve any products from Asegua Therapeutics LLC. Our integrity initiative requires covered entities that enter into 340B bill to/ship to arrangements with\ncontract pharmacies for our branded HCV products to provide claims level data for units dispensed from such contract pharmacies; covered entities without an\nin-house pharmacy that choose not to participate in the initiative can designate a single contract pharmacy for shipment. Certain manufacturers that have\nimplemented other contract pharmacy integrity programs have received enforcement letters from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”)\nasserting that those programs violate the 340B statute, have been referred to the HHS Office of Inspector General for assessment of civil monetary penalties,\nand have been subject to administrative dispute resolution proceedings brought on behalf of covered entities. Some of these manufacturers are challenging\nHHS’ position in litigation. Certain states have also enacted laws requiring manufacturers to provide 340B pricing through contract pharmacy arrangements,\nand additional states may adopt similar laws; we believe these laws, which are being challenged in ongoing litigation, are invalid but we have carved out\ncovered entities in certain states from our integrity initiative while litigation challenging these laws proceeds. We also believe that our integrity initiative\ncomplies with the requirements of the 340B statute. However, additional legal or legislative developments with respect to the 340B program, including\npotential litigation with HHS or other stakeholders, may negatively impact our ability to implement or continue our integrity initiative.\nIn addition, standard reimbursement structures do not always adequately reimburse for innovative therapies. For example, beginning in fiscal year 2021,\nCMS established a new severity-adjusted diagnosis-related group (“DRG”) 018 for Medicare inpatient reimbursement of CAR T-cell products such as Yescarta\nand Tecartus. While the new DRG has a significantly higher base payment amount than the prior DRG 016, the payment available may not be sufficient to\nreimburse some hospitals for their cost of care for patients receiving Yescarta and Tecartus. When reimbursement is not aligned well to account for treatment\ncosts, Medicare beneficiaries may be denied access as this misalignment could impact the willingness of some hospitals to offer the therapy and of doctors to\nrecommend the therapy. Additionally, in the EU, there are barriers to reimbursement in individual countries that could limit the uptake of Yescarta and Tecartus.\nMoreover, we estimate the rebates we will be required to pay in connection with sales during a particular quarter based on claims data from prior quarters.\nIn the U.S., actual rebate claims are typically made by payers one to three quarters in arrears. Actual claims and payments may vary significantly from our\nestimates.\n40\nWe may experience adverse impacts resulting from the importation of our products from lower price markets or the distribution of illegally diverted or\ncounterfeit versions of our products.\nPrices for our products are based on local market economics and competition and sometimes differ from country to country. Our sales in countries with\nrelatively higher prices may be reduced if products can be imported and resold into those countries from lower price markets. For example, in January 2024,\nFDA authorized Florida’s proposed program to import prescription drugs from Canada, and U.S. sales may be adversely affected if Florida meets the additional\nrequirements set by FDA in its authorization. We have entered into agreements with generic drug manufacturers as well as licensing agreements with the\nMedicines Patent Pool, a United Nations-backed public health organization, which allow generic drug manufacturers to manufacture generic versions of certain\nof our products for distribution in certain low- and middle-income countries. We may be adversely affected if any generic versions of our products, whether or\nnot produced and/or distributed under these agreements, are exported to the U.S., the EU or markets with higher prices.\nIn the EU, we are required to permit products purchased in one EU member state to be sold in another member state. Purchases of our products in\nmember states where our selling prices are relatively low for resale in member states in which our selling prices are relatively high can affect the inventory\nlevel held by our wholesalers and can cause the relative sales levels in the various countries to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and not reflect the actual\nconsumer demand in any given quarter.\nAdditionally, diverted products may be used in countries where they have not been approved and patients may source the diverted products outside the\nlegitimate supply chain. These diverted products may be handled, shipped and stored inappropriately, which may affect the quality and/or efficacy of the\nproducts and could harm patients and adversely impact us.\nWe are also aware of the existence of various suppliers around the world that, without Gilead’s authorization, purport to source our products and generic\nversions of our products and sell them for use in countries where those products have not been approved. As a result, patients may be at risk of taking\nunapproved medications that may not be what they purport to be, may not have the potency they claim to have or may contain harmful substances, which could\nharm patients and adversely impact us.\nFurther, third parties have illegally distributed and sold, and may continue to illegally distribute and sell, illegally diverted and counterfeit versions of our\nmedicines, which do not meet the rigorous quality standards of our manufacturing and supply chain. For example, as part of a U.S. civil enforcement lawsuit in\ncoordination with law enforcement, and pursuant to court order, we seized thousands of bottles of Gilead-labeled medication with counterfeit supply chain\ndocumentation. Our investigation revealed that pharmaceutical distributors that are not authorized by Gilead to sell Gilead medicine sold purportedly genuine\nGilead medicine sourced from an illegal counterfeiting scheme to independent pharmacies nationwide.\nIllegally diverted and counterfeit versions of Gilead-branded medicines exist and may pose a serious risk to patient health and safety. Our actions to stop\nor prevent the distribution and sale of illegally diverted and counterfeit versions of our medicines around the world may be costly and unsuccessful, which may\nadversely affect patients and our reputation and business, including our product revenues and financial results.\nProduct Development and Supply Chain Risks\nWe face risks in our clinical trials, including the potential for unfavorable results, delays in anticipated timelines and disruption.\nWe are required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of product candidates that we develop for each intended use through extensive preclinical studies\nand clinical trials. The results from these studies do not always accurately predict results in later, large-scale clinical trials. Even successfully completed large-\nscale clinical trials may not result in marketable products.\nWe face numerous risks and uncertainties with our clinical trials that could result in delays or prevent completion of the development and approval of our\nproduct candidates, including challenges in clinical trial protocol design, our ability to enroll patients in clinical trials, the possibility of unfavorable or\ninadequate trial results to support further development of our product candidates, including failure to meet a trial’s primary endpoint, safety issues arising from\nour clinical trials, and the need to modify or delay our clinical trials or to perform additional trials. For example, in January 2024, we announced that our Phase\n3 EVOKE-01 study evaluating sacituzumab govitecan-hziy did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival in previously treated metastatic non-small cell\nlung cancer (“NSCLC”), which resulted in us recording an impairment charge during the three months ended March 31, 2024. In September 2024, we decided\nto discontinue our clinical development program in NSCLC for the second-line indication, resulting in us recording an impairment charge during the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 (for more information, see Note 7. Intangible Assets of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included\nin Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). In May 2024, we provided an update that (i) our Phase 3 TROPiCs-04 study did not meet its primary\nendpoint, which was a confirmatory study required in connection with the accelerated approval of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy for treatment of metastatic\nurothelial cancer, and (ii) there was a higher number of deaths due to adverse events with sacituzumab govitecan-hziy compared to treatment of physician’s\nchoice. In addition, following results and data from several magrolimab studies as well as corresponding FDA clinical holds, we announced in February 2024\nthat we would not pursue further development of magrolimab in hematologic cancers.\n41\nAs a result, we may be unable to successfully complete our clinical trials on our anticipated timelines, or at all. Based on trial results, it is possible that\nFDA and other regulatory authorities do not approve our product candidates, or that any market approvals include significant limitations on the products’ use.\nAdditionally, products and indications approved under accelerated approval pathways may be subject to withdrawal where confirmatory studies are\nunsuccessful. In October 2024, we announced plans to voluntarily withdraw the U.S. accelerated approval for Trodelvy (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy; SG) for\ntreatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have previously received a platinum-containing chemotherapy and either\nprogrammed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor. In addition, clinical trials involving our commercial products can raise\nnew safety issues for our existing products, which could adversely impact our business. Further, we have in the past and we may in the future make a strategic\ndecision to discontinue development of our product candidates, including but not limited to situations where we believe commercialization will be difficult\nrelative to other opportunities in our pipeline. For example, in January 2024, we announced with our partner Arcus Biosciences, Inc. (“Arcus”) the\ndiscontinuation of further enrollment in the Phase 3 ARC-10 study evaluating domvanalimab plus zimberelimab in first-line locally advanced or metastatic,\nPD-L1-high NSCLC based on strategic prioritization to advance and potentially accelerate other Phase 3 studies in our collaboration with Arcus. Therefore, our\nproduct candidates may never be successfully commercialized, and we may be unable to recoup the significant R&D, clinical trial, acquisition-related and other\nexpenses incurred. We expect to spend significant time and resources on our clinical trial activities without any assurance that we will recoup our investments\nor that our efforts will be commercially successful.\nThere are also risks associated with the use of third parties in our clinical trial activities. We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually\nperform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. We rely on third-party contract research organizations (“CROs”) to perform most of our clinical\nstudies, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, program management, patient enrollment,\nongoing monitoring, site management and bioanalysis. In addition, we depend on third-party contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”), including those\nlocated outside the U.S., to manufacture clinical materials. Many important aspects of the services performed for us by the CROs and CMOs are not within our\ndirect control. If there is any dispute or disruption in our relationships with our CROs and CMOs, including as a result of legislative or regulatory actions (such\nas the recently proposed BIOSECURE Act in the U.S. (the “BIOSECURE Act”)), our clinical trials and regulatory submissions may be delayed and our costs\nmay increase. Moreover, in our regulatory submissions, we rely on the quality and validity of the clinical work performed by third-party CROs. If any of our\nCROs’ processes, methodologies or results were determined to be invalid or inadequate, our own clinical data and results and related regulatory approvals may\nbe adversely affected.\nWe may face manufacturing difficulties, delays or interruptions, including at our third-party manufacturers and corporate partners.\nOur products, which are manufactured at our own facilities or by third-party manufacturers and corporate partners, are the result of complex, highly\nregulated manufacturing processes. We depend on third-party manufacturers and corporate partners to perform manufacturing activities effectively and on a\ntimely basis for the majority of our active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug products. These third parties are independent entities subject to their own unique\noperational and financial risks that are out of our control. We and our third-party manufacturers and corporate partners are subject to Good Manufacturing\nPractices (“GMP”), which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, recordkeeping and quality standards as defined by\nFDA and European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), as well as comparable regulations in other jurisdictions. Manufacturing operations are also subject to routine\ninspections by regulatory agencies.\nAny adverse developments affecting or resulting from our manufacturing operations or the operations of our third-party manufacturers and corporate\npartners can result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls or other interruptions in the commercial supply of our\nproducts. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, inventory write-off charges and other expenses for products that fail to meet specifications and quality\nstandards as well as changes we may adopt in our manufacturing strategy, and we may need to undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly\nmanufacturing alternatives. Such developments could increase our manufacturing costs, cause us to lose revenues or market share and damage our reputation.\nIn addition, manufacturing issues may cause delays in our clinical trials and applications for regulatory approval. For example, if we are unable to remedy any\ndeficiencies cited by FDA or other regulatory agencies in their inspections, our existing products and the timing of regulatory approval of product candidates in\ndevelopment could be adversely affected. Further, there is risk that regulatory agencies in other countries where marketing applications are pending will\nundertake similar additional reviews or apply a heightened standard of review, which could delay the regulatory approvals for products in those countries. Our\nbusiness may be adversely affected if approval of any of our product candidates were delayed or if production of our products were interrupted.\n42\nWe may not be able to obtain materials or supplies necessary to conduct clinical trials or to manufacture and sell our products, which could limit our\nability to generate revenues as well as increase our expenses.\nWe need access to certain materials and supplies to conduct our clinical trials and to manufacture and sell our products. If we are unable to purchase\nenough of these materials and supplies or find suitable alternatives in a timely manner, our development efforts for our product candidates may be delayed or\nour ability to manufacture and sell our products could be limited. For example, in the U.S., there has been a shortage of certain cancer drugs that are the\nbackbone of standard-of-care treatments, such as carboplatin and cisplatin, which are also used in R&D and clinical trials. While we have observed minimal\nimpacts to our oncology clinical trials to date, if these shortages continue or increase in magnitude, our ongoing and future oncology clinical trials may be\ndelayed, halted or adversely impacted.\nSuppliers of key components and materials must be named in the new drug application or marketing authorization application filed with the regulatory\nauthority for any product candidate for which we are seeking marketing approval, and significant delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is\nrequired. Even after a supplier is qualified by the regulatory authority, the supplier must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production\nand quality control to maintain full compliance with GMP. Suppliers are subject to regular periodic inspections by regulatory authorities following initial\napproval. If, as a result of these inspections, a regulatory authority determines that the equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with\napplicable regulations and conditions of product approval, the regulatory authority may suspend the manufacturing operations. If the manufacturing operations\nof any of the single suppliers for our products are suspended, we may be unable to generate sufficient quantities of commercial or clinical supplies of product to\nmeet market demand. In addition, if deliveries of materials from our suppliers are interrupted for any reason, including as a result of natural disasters or\nextreme weather conditions, we may be unable to ship certain of our products for commercial supply or to supply our product candidates in development for\nclinical trials. Also, some of our products and the materials that we utilize in our operations are manufactured by only one supplier or at only one facility, which\nwe may not be able to replace in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Problems with any of the single suppliers or facilities we\ndepend on, including in the event of a disaster, such as an earthquake, flood or fire, equipment failure or other difficulty, may negatively impact our\ndevelopment and commercialization efforts.\nA significant portion of the raw materials and intermediates used to manufacture our products and product candidates are supplied by third-party\nmanufacturers and corporate partners outside of the U.S. As a result, any political or economic factors in a specific country or region, including any new, or\nchanges in or interpretations of existing, trade regulations, compliance requirements or tax or other legislation (such as the recently proposed BIOSECURE\nAct), that would limit or prevent third parties outside of the U.S. from supplying these materials could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and supply\nour products to meet market needs and have a material and adverse effect on our operating results. Such factors may also negatively impact our ability to\nsupply our clinical trials, which may result in the delay of our clinical trials and regulatory submissions as well as increased costs.\nIf we were to encounter any of these difficulties, our ability to conduct clinical trials on product candidates and to manufacture and sell our products could\nbe impaired.\nRegulatory and Other Legal Risks\nOur operations depend on compliance with complex FDA and comparable international regulations. Failure to obtain approvals on a timely basis or to\nmaintain compliance could delay or halt commercialization of our products.\nThe products we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory authorities and, once approved, are subject to extensive regulation by\nFDA, EMA and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries. We have filed, and anticipate that we will continue to file, for marketing approval in\nadditional countries and for additional indications and products. These and any future marketing applications we file may not be approved by the regulatory\nauthorities on a timely basis, or at all. For example, in October 2022, we announced that FDA issued a complete response letter for our Biologics License\nApplication for bulevirtide for the treatment of adults with hepatitis delta virus infection. Even if marketing approval is granted for these products, there may be\nsignificant limitations on their use. We cannot state with certainty when or whether any of our product candidates under development will be approved or\nlaunched; whether we will be able to develop, license or acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether any products, once launched, will be\ncommercially successful.\n43\nFurther, how we manufacture and sell our products is subject to extensive regulation and review. For example, under FDA rules, we are often required to\nconduct post-approval clinical studies to assess a known serious risk, signals of serious risk or to identify an unexpected serious risk. In certain circumstances,\nwe may be required to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program for our products, which could include a medication guide, patient\npackage insert, a communication plan to healthcare providers, restrictions on distribution or use of a product and other elements FDA deems necessary to\nassure safe use of the drug. Discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products or product candidates, including serious safety, resistance\nor drug interaction issues, or problems with our manufacturing, safety reporting or promotional activities, may result in regulatory approvals being delayed,\ndenied or granted with significant restrictions on our products, including limitations on or the withdrawal of the products from the market.\nFailure to comply with these or other requirements imposed by FDA could result in significant civil monetary penalties, fines, suspensions of regulatory\napprovals, product recalls, seizure of products and criminal prosecutions.\nWe are impacted by evolving laws, regulations and legislative or regulatory actions applicable to the healthcare industry.\nThe healthcare industry is subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations pertaining to drug approval, reimbursement, rebates,\nprice reporting, healthcare fraud and abuse, and data privacy and security. In the U.S., these laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, the Federal Food,\nDrug, and Cosmetic Act, laws and regulations relating to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other federal and state programs, such as the Medicaid\nRebate Statute and the 340B statute, laws that regulate written and verbal communications about our products, individual state laws relating to pricing and sales\nand marketing practices, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and other federal and state laws relating to the privacy and security of health\ninformation, including the Executive Order on Preventing Access to Americans’ Bulk Sensitive Personal Data and United States Government-Related Data by\nCountries of Concern issued in February 2024. Actual or alleged violations of these laws or any related regulations may be punishable by criminal and/or civil\nsanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, civil monetary penalties, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs,\nincluding Medicare, Medicaid and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and U.S. Department of Defense health programs, actions against executives\noverseeing our business and significant remediation measures, negative publicity or other consequences. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and\nsubject to changing and evolving interpretations, including as a result of legal challenges, which may increase following the U.S. Supreme Court decision to\noverrule the Chevron doctrine, any of which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance, alter one or more of our sales or marketing\npractices, or impact our ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals. The resulting impact on our business is uncertain and could be material.\nAdditionally, recently proposed legislation in the U.S., such as the BIOSECURE Act (which, among other things, could prohibit U.S. executive agencies from\ncontracting with, or expending loans or granting funds to, companies that use biotechnology equipment or services for certain activities from certain foreign-\nowned entities), has the potential to adversely impact our ability to receive equipment or services from such entities, including certain of which we use in\nconnection with our clinical trials and our clinical and commercial manufacturing, which could increase the cost or limit the supply of material available to us,\ndelay the procurement or supply of such material, delay or impact clinical trials and regulatory submissions, delay the launch of commercial products and\nadversely affect our financial condition and business prospects.\nIn addition, government price reporting and payment regulations are complex, and we are continually assessing the methods by which we calculate and\nreport pricing in accordance with these obligations. Our methodologies for calculations are inherently subject to assumptions and may be subject to review and\nchallenge by various government agencies, which may disagree with our interpretation. If the government disagrees with our reported calculations, we may\nneed to restate previously reported data and could be subject to additional financial and legal liability.\nThere also continues to be enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including co-pay assistance programs and manufacturer\ndonations to third-party charities that provide such assistance. There has also been enhanced scrutiny by governments on reimbursement support offerings and\nother patient support offerings, clinical education programs and promotional speaker programs. If we, or our agents and vendors, are deemed to have failed to\ncomply with laws, regulations or government guidance in any of these areas, we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions. Any similar violations by our\ncompetitors could also negatively impact our industry’s reputation and increase scrutiny over our business and our products.\nFor a description of our government investigations and related litigation, see Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nWe are subject to risks if significant safety issues arise for our marketed products or our product candidates.\nAs additional studies are conducted after obtaining marketing approval for our products, and as our products are used over longer periods of time by\nmany patients, including patients with underlying health problems or those taking other medicines, we expect to continue finding new issues related to safety,\nresistance or drug interactions. Any such issues may require changes to our product labels, such as additional warnings, contraindications or even narrowed\nindications, or the halt of product sales.\n44\nRegulatory authorities have been moving towards more active and transparent pharmacovigilance and are making greater amounts of stand-alone safety\ninformation and clinical trial data directly available to the public through websites and other means, such as periodic safety update report summaries, risk\nmanagement plan summaries and various adverse event data. Safety information, without the appropriate context and expertise, may be misinterpreted and lead\nto misperception or legal action.\nOur success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and defend our patents and other intellectual property rights both domestically and\ninternationally, and to operate without infringing upon the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.\nPatents and other proprietary rights are very important to our business. As part of our business strategy, we actively seek patent protection both in the U.S.\nand internationally and file additional patent applications, when appropriate, to cover improvements in our compounds, products and technology. Our success\ndepends to a significant degree on our ability to:\n• obtain patents and licenses to patent rights;\n• preserve trade secrets and internal know-how;\n• defend against infringement of our patents and efforts to invalidate them; and\n• operate without infringing on the intellectual property of others.\nBecause patent applications are confidential for a period of time after filing, we may not know if our competitors have filed applications for technology\ncovered by our pending applications or if we were the first to invent or first to file an application directed toward the technology that is the subject of our patent\napplications. If competitors file patent applications covering our technology, we may have to participate in litigation, post-grant proceedings before the U.S.\nPatent and Trademark Office or other proceedings to determine the right to a patent or validity of any patent granted. Such litigation and proceedings are\nunpredictable and expensive, and could divert management attention from other operations, such that, even if we are ultimately successful, we may be\nadversely impacted.\nPatents covering our existing compounds, products and processes, and those that we will likely file in the future, may not provide complete or adequate\nprotection. Filing patent applications is a fact-intensive and complex process. We may file patent applications that ultimately do not result in patents or have\npatents that do not provide adequate protection for the related product. Future litigation or other proceedings regarding the enforcement or validity of our\nexisting patents or any future patents could result in the invalidation of our patents or substantially reduce their protection. In addition, we may face criticism as\na result of our legitimate use of the patent systems to protect our investments in new and useful innovations in medicine.\nGeneric manufacturers have sought, and may continue to seek, FDA approval to market generic versions of our products through an abbreviated new drug\napplication (“ANDA”), the application process typically used by manufacturers seeking approval of a generic drug. For a description of our ANDA litigation,\nsee Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q. ANDA litigation and related settlement and license agreements, in some cases, may result in a loss of exclusivity for our patents sooner than we\nwould otherwise expect. In addition, loss of exclusivity may be earlier than expected under these settlement and license agreements under certain\ncircumstances. For example, settlement and license agreements with generic manufacturers typically include acceleration clauses that permit generic entry\nbefore the agreed-upon entry date in certain circumstances, and generic manufacturers may continue to challenge the patents protecting our products. The entry\nof generic versions of our products has, and may in the future, lead to market share and price erosion.\nIf we are found to infringe the valid patents of third parties, we may be required to pay significant monetary damages or we may be prevented from\ncommercializing products or may be required to obtain licenses from these third parties. We may not be able to obtain alternative technologies or any required\nlicense on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain these licenses or alternative technologies, we may be unable to develop or\ncommercialize some or all of our products. For example, we are aware of patents and patent applications owned by other parties that such parties may claim to\ncover the use of our products and research activities. For a description of our pending patent litigation, see Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies of the\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n45\nFurthermore, we also rely on unpatented trade secrets and improvements, unpatented internal know-how and technological innovation. We protect these\nrights mainly through confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners, employees, consultants and vendors. We cannot be certain that these parties will\ncomply with these confidentiality agreements, that we have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets, internal know-how or technological\ninnovation will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. Under some of our R&D agreements, inventions become\njointly owned by us and our corporate partner and in other cases become the exclusive property of one party. In certain circumstances, it can be difficult to\ndetermine who owns a particular invention and disputes could arise regarding those inventions. We could be adversely affected if our trade secrets, internal\nknow-how, technological innovation or confidential information become known or independently discovered by competitors or if we enter into disputes over\nownership of inventions.\nWe face potentially significant liability and increased expenses from litigation and government investigations relating to our products and operations.\nWe are involved in a number of litigation, investigation and other dispute-related matters that require us to expend substantial internal and financial\nresources. From time to time, these matters require us to pay significant monetary amounts, including royalty payments for past and future sales. We expect\nthese matters will continue to require a high level of internal and financial resources for the foreseeable future. These matters have reduced, and are expected to\ncontinue to reduce, our earnings and require significant management attention.\nIn addition, the testing, manufacturing, marketing and use of our commercial products, as well as product candidates in development, involve substantial\nrisk of product liability claims. These claims may be made directly by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others. We have limited\ninsurance for product liabilities that may arise and claims may exceed our coverage.\nFor a description of our litigation, investigation and other dispute-related matters, see Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The outcome of such legal proceedings or any\nother legal proceedings that may be brought against us, the investigations or any other investigations that may be initiated and any other dispute-related\nmatters, are inherently uncertain, and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant expenses, monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief\nagainst us.\nOperational Risks\nOur business has been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic or contagious diseases.\nActual or threatened outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic or contagious diseases, or other public health emergencies, may significantly disrupt our global\noperations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we have seen with the COVID-19 pandemic, outbreaks can result\nin global supply chain and logistics disruptions and distribution constraints. The impact of an outbreak or other public health crisis on our results of operations\nand financial condition would depend on numerous evolving factors, but could involve higher operating expenses, lower demand for our products as a result of\ngovernmental, business and individuals’ actions taken in response to such an event (including quarantines, travel restrictions and interruptions to healthcare\nservices, which can impact enrollment in or operation of our clinical trials or limit patients’ ability or willingness to access and seek care), challenges\nassociated with the safety of our employees and safe occupancy of our job sites, and financial market volatility and significant macroeconomic uncertainty in\nglobal markets. An outbreak or public health emergency also could amplify many of the other risks described throughout the “Risk Factors” section of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nWe face risks associated with our global operations.\nOur global operations are accompanied by certain financial, political, economic and other risks, including those listed below:\n• Foreign Currency Exchange: Because a significant percentage of our product sales is denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, we face\nexposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies, and therefore, we benefit\nfrom a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar. Our hedging program does not eliminate our exposure to currency\nfluctuations. We may be adversely impacted if the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly against certain currencies and our hedging program does not\nsufficiently offset the effects of such appreciation. For example, see “Foreign Currency Exchange Impact” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q for a discussion of our exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the Euro, and the impacts from foreign\ncurrency exchange, net of hedges, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n46\n• Interest Rates and Inflation: We have interest-generating assets and interest-bearing liabilities, including our senior unsecured notes and credit\nfacilities. Fluctuations in interest rates could expose us to increased financial risk. In addition, high inflation, such as what we are seeing in the current\neconomic environment, has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business and financial results.\n• Anti-Bribery: We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws that govern our international\noperations with respect to payments to government officials. Our international operations are heavily regulated and require significant interaction with\nforeign officials. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. In certain circumstances, strict\ncompliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices or may require us to interact with doctors and hospitals, some of\nwhich may be state-controlled, in a manner that is different than local custom. It is possible that certain of our practices may be challenged under these\nlaws. In addition, our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees and\nagents. Enforcement activities under anti-bribery laws could subject us to administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could result in civil\nand criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties and exclusion from healthcare programs.\nOther risks inherent in conducting a global business include:\n• Restrictive government actions against our intellectual property and other assets such as nationalization, expropriation, the imposition of compulsory\nlicenses or similar actions, including waiver of intellectual property protections.\n• Protective economic policies taken by governments, such as trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements, which may\nresult in the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions by the U.S. or other governments.\n• Political instability or disruption in a geographic region where we operate, regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, social unrest and political\nchanges, including in China, Russia, Ukraine, Israel and surrounding areas.\n• Increasing use of social media platforms and modern technologies present new risks and challenges, and inappropriate or unauthorized use of these\nplatforms can result in exposure of sensitive data or information and damage our brand and reputation.\nClimate change and related natural disasters, as well as legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, can negatively affect our business\nand operations.\nMany of our operations and facilities, including those essential to our manufacturing, R&D and commercialization/distribution activities, are located in\nregions subject to natural or man-made disasters, such as climate change, earthquakes, hurricanes, rising sea levels and flooding, fires, extreme heat, drought or\nother extreme weather conditions, or efforts taken by third parties to prevent or mitigate such disasters, such as public safety power shutoffs and facility\nshutdowns. The severity and frequency of weather-related events has been amplified, and is expected to continue to be amplified, by climate change. Such\nnatural disasters have caused, and in the future may cause, damage to and/or disrupt our operations, which may result in a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness and financial results. For example, our facility in Cork, Ireland, where we conduct commercial manufacturing, packaging and labeling and perform\nquality control testing and final release of many of our products, temporarily suspended on-site operations as a result of the flooding caused by Storm Babet in\nOctober 2023. Additionally, our corporate headquarters in Foster City and certain R&D and manufacturing facilities are located in California, a seismically\nactive region. Although we have business continuity plans and contingencies in place and conduct periodic assessments of our natural disaster risk as part of\nour overall enterprise risk management program, a major earthquake or other natural disaster can result in significant recovery time and a prolonged\ninterruption to our operational and business activities. We may be required to incur significant costs to remedy the effects of such natural disasters and to\nresume or restore our operations, which could adversely impact us. Our suppliers and third-party manufacturers and corporate partners face similar risks, and\nany disruption to their operations could have an adverse effect on our manufacturing and supply chain. Also, see risks under the headings “We may face\nmanufacturing difficulties, delays or interruptions, including at our third-party manufacturers and corporate partners” and “We may not be able to obtain\nmaterials or supplies necessary to conduct clinical trials or to manufacture and sell our products, which could limit our ability to generate revenues as well as\nincrease our expenses.”\nIn addition, growing concern regarding climate change has resulted in an evolving legal and regulatory landscape, with new requirements enacted to\nprevent, mitigate or adapt to the implications of climate change. These regulations, which can differ across jurisdictions, subject Gilead to many transitional\nrisks, including, for example, new or expanded carbon pricing or taxes, increased compliance costs, restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions, investment in\nnew technologies, increased carbon disclosure and transparency, investments in data gathering and reporting systems, upgrades of facilities to meet new\nbuilding codes and the redesign of utility systems, which could increase the company’s operating costs, including the cost of electricity and energy. Our\nsuppliers and third-party manufacturers and corporate partners face similar transition risks and may pass along any increased costs to us.\n47\nOur aspirations, goals and disclosures related to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters expose us to numerous risks, including risks to\nour reputation and stock price.\nInstitutional and individual investors are increasingly using ESG screening criteria to determine whether Gilead qualifies for inclusion in their investment\nportfolios. We are frequently asked by investors and other stakeholders to set ambitious ESG goals and provide new and more robust disclosure on goals,\nprogress toward goals and other matters of interest to ESG stakeholders. In response, we have adapted the tracking and reporting of our corporate responsibility\nprogram to various evolving ESG frameworks, and we have established and announced goals and other objectives related to ESG matters. These goal\nstatements reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Our efforts to accomplish and accurately report\non these goals and objectives present numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal and other risks, any of which could have a material negative impact,\nincluding on our reputation and stock price.\nOur ability to achieve any goal or objective, including with respect to environmental and diversity initiatives, is subject to numerous risks, many of which\nare outside of our control. Examples of such risks include: (1) the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources and technologies, (2)\nevolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures, (3) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability, diversity and other\nstandards, (4) our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent in our labor markets and (5) the impact of our organic growth and acquisitions or\ndispositions of businesses or operations.\nThe standards for tracking and reporting on ESG matters are relatively new, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Our selection of disclosure\nframeworks that seek to align with various reporting standards may change from time to time and may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful comparative\ndata from period to period. In addition, regulatory authorities may impose mandatory disclosure requirements with respect to ESG matters, such as recent U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission rules requiring companies to make certain climate-related disclosures, including information about climate-related risks,\ngreenhouse gas emissions and certain climate-related financial statement metrics, or California’s Climate-Related Financial Risk Act and the Climate Corporate\nData Accountability Act. Our processes and controls may not reflect evolving standards for identifying, measuring and reporting ESG matters, immediately or\nat all, our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others, and such standards may change over time, any of which could result in\nsignificant revisions to our goals or reported progress in achieving such goals. In addition, enhancements to our processes and controls to reflect evolving\nreporting standards may be costly and require additional resources.\nIf our ESG practices do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, then our reputation, our ability to attract or retain\nemployees and our attractiveness as an investment, business partner or acquiror could be negatively impacted. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to\npursue or fulfill our goals, targets and objectives or to satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could also have similar\nnegative impacts and expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation.\nWe depend on relationships with third parties for sales and marketing performance, technology, development, logistics and commercialization of products.\nFailure to maintain these relationships, poor performance by these companies or disputes with these third parties could negatively impact our business.\nWe rely on a number of collaborative relationships with third parties for our sales and marketing performance in certain territories. In some countries, we\nrely on international distributors for sales of certain of our products. Some of these relationships also involve the clinical development of these products by our\npartners. Reliance on collaborative relationships poses a number of risks, including the risk that:\n• we are unable to control the resources our corporate partners devote to our programs or products;\n• disputes may arise with respect to the ownership of rights to technology developed with our corporate partners;\n• disagreements with our corporate partners could cause delays in, or termination of, the research, development or commercialization of product\ncandidates or result in litigation or arbitration;\n• contracts with our corporate partners may fail to provide significant protection or may fail to be effectively enforced if one of these partners fails to\nperform;\n• our corporate partners have considerable discretion in electing whether to pursue the development of any additional products and may pursue\nalternative technologies or products either on their own or in collaboration with our competitors;\n• our corporate partners with marketing rights may choose to pursue competing technologies or to devote fewer resources to the marketing of our\nproducts than they do to products of their own development; and\n• our distributors and our corporate partners may be unable to pay us.\nGiven these risks, there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative efforts. If these efforts fail, our product\ndevelopment or commercialization of new products could be delayed or revenues from products could decline.\n48\nDue to the specialized and technical nature of our business, the failure to attract, develop and retain highly qualified personnel could adversely impact us.\nOur future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management\npersonnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical testing, governmental regulation and commercialization. Our ability to do so also depends in part on\nhow well we maintain a strong workplace culture that is attractive to employees. In addition, competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field\nis intense, and there is a limited pool of qualified potential employees to recruit. We face competition for personnel from other companies, universities, public\nand private research institutions, government entities and other organizations. Furthermore, changes to immigration and work authorization laws and\nregulations could make it more difficult for employees to work in or transfer to one of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Additionally, we periodically make\nadjustments, including to the size and composition of our workforce, to reflect our personnel needs in response to changing macroeconomic conditions, market\nopportunities, management changes, acquisitions, cost levels and other internal and external considerations, which may adversely impact our workplace culture\nand ability to retain and incentivize employees.\nThe failure to successfully implement or upgrade enterprise resource planning and other information systems could adversely impact our business and\nresults of operations.\nWe periodically implement or upgrade new or enhanced enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) and other information systems in order to better manage\nour business operations, align our global organizations and enable future growth. Implementation or upgrade of new business processes and information\nsystems requires the commitment of significant personnel, training and financial resources, and entails risks to our business operations. If we do not\nsuccessfully implement ERP and other information systems improvements, or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing these systems, we may not\nrealize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and we may experience operational difficulties and challenges in effectively managing our\nbusiness, all of which could result in quality issues, reputational harm, lost market and revenue opportunities, and otherwise adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nFor example, we are currently in the process of implementing new ERP and other information systems to help us manage our operations and financial\nreporting. Costs and risks inherent in this transition may include disruptions to business continuity, administrative and technical problems, interruptions or\ndelays in sales, manufacturing or R&D processes, expenditure overruns, delays in paying our suppliers and employees, and data migration issues. If we do not\nproperly address or mitigate these issues, this could result in increased costs and diversion of resources, negatively impacting our operating results and ability\nto effectively manage our business. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned, or the ERP system does not operate as\nintended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be negatively affected.\nInformation system service interruptions or breaches, including significant cybersecurity incidents, could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action\nunder data protection and privacy laws and adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data, including our Kite Konnect platform, which is critical to maintain chain\nof identity and chain of custody of Yescarta and Tecartus. The multitude and complexity of our computer systems make them inherently vulnerable to service\ninterruption or destruction, including those caused by failures during system upgrades or implementations, user error, network or hardware failure, malicious\nintrusion and ransomware attack. Likewise, data privacy or cybersecurity incidents or breaches by employees or others can result in the exposure of sensitive\ndata, including our intellectual property or trade secrets or the personal information of our employees, patients, customers or other business partners to\nunauthorized persons or to the public. If our information systems or third-party information systems on which we rely suffer severe damage, disruption or\nshutdown, including during upgrades or new implementations, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we\ncould experience delays in reporting our financial results, and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely manufacture, distribute,\ninvoice and collect payments. Cybersecurity attacks and incidents are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity. Malicious actors seek to steal\nmoney, gain unauthorized access to, destroy or manipulate data, and disrupt operations, and some of their attacks may not be recognized or discovered until\nafter a significant period of time well after initial entry into the environment, such as novel or zero-day attacks that are launched before patches are available\nand defenses can be readied. Malicious actors are also increasingly developing methods to avoid prevention, detection and alerting capabilities, including\nemploying counter-forensic tactics making response activities more difficult. Such attacks and incidents include, for example, the deployment of harmful\nmalware, exploitation of vulnerabilities, computer viruses, key loggers, ransomware, denial-of-service, social engineering and other means to affect service\nreliability and operations and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Our business and technology partners face similar risks and any security\nbreach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture.\n49\nLike many companies, we have experienced and expect to continue to be the target of cybersecurity incidents, including data breaches and temporary\nservice interruptions. When cybersecurity incidents occur, our policy is to respond and address them in accordance with applicable governmental regulations\nand other legal requirements, including our cybersecurity protocols. There can be no assurance that our efforts in response to cybersecurity incidents, as well as\nour investments to protect our information technology infrastructure and data, will shield us from significant losses, brand and reputational harm and potential\nliability or prevent any future interruption or breach of our systems. Such cybersecurity incidents can cause the loss of critical or sensitive information,\nincluding personal information, and could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws. Financial, legal, business, or\nreputational losses may result from a cybersecurity incident or breach of our information technology systems.\nRegulators globally are also imposing data privacy and security requirements, such as EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and other\ndomestic data privacy and security laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act. These and other similar types of\nlaws and regulations that have been or may be passed, often include requirements with respect to personal information, and non-compliance with such laws\nmay result in liability through private actions (subject to statutorily defined damages in the event of certain data breaches) and government enforcement. Other\nchanges or new laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal information, could greatly increase our cost of providing our products\nand services or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions in which we operate.\nStrategic and Financial Risks\nWe are subject to risks associated with engaging in business acquisitions, licensing arrangements, collaborations, options, equity investments, asset\ndivestitures and other strategic transactions.\nWe have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, such transactions as part of our business strategy. We may not identify suitable transactions in the\nfuture and, if we do, we may not complete such transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, including the possibility that a governmental\nentity or regulatory body may delay or refuse to grant approval for the consummation of the transaction. If we are successful in making an acquisition or\nclosing a licensing arrangement or collaboration, the products, intellectual property and technologies that are acquired or licensed may not be successful or may\nrequire significantly greater resources and investments than anticipated. As required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we conduct annual\nimpairment testing of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that it is more likely than not that the assets are impaired. We have in the past and may in the future need to recognize impairment charges related to\nthe products, intellectual property and technologies that are acquired or licensed as a result of such testing. For example, as a result of an impairment analysis\nwe conducted following our receipt of data in March 2022 from the Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 study evaluating Trodelvy in patients with hormone receptor-\npositive, human epidermal growth receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer, we recognized a partial in-process research and development impairment\ncharge on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income during 2022. Similarly, we recorded partial impairment charges during the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024 in connection with our Phase 3 EVOKE-01 study evaluating sacituzumab govitecan-hziy and during the three months ended September 30,\n2024 following the strategic decision to discontinue our clinical development program in metastatic NSCLC for Trodelvy in the second-line indication (for\nmore information, see Note 7. Intangible Assets of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q). We also continue to monitor the progression of our in-process research and development assets related to sacituzumab govitecan-hziy\nfor non-small cell lung cancer and bulevirtide for chronic hepatitis D virus for treatment primarily in the U.S. and may need to evaluate these items for\nimpairment prior to the fourth quarter if there are any events or circumstances in our ongoing development activities indicating it is more like than not that\nthese assets might be impaired. For option structured deals, there is no assurance that we will elect to exercise our option right, and it is possible that\ndisagreements, uncertainties or other circumstances may arise, including with respect to whether our option rights have been appropriately triggered, which\nmay hinder our ability to realize the expected benefits. For example, in March 2023, we waived our exclusive option to acquire Pionyr Immunotherapeutics,\nand in September 2023, we waived our exclusive option to acquire Tizona Therapeutics, Inc. For equity investments in our strategic partners, such as in\nconnection with our collaborations with Arcus Biosciences, Inc., Galapagos NV and Arcellx, Inc., the value of our equity investments may fluctuate and\ndecline in value. If we are not successful in the execution or implementation of these transactions, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations\nmay be adversely affected, and our stock price could decline.\n50\nWe have paid substantial amounts of cash and incurred additional debt to finance our strategic transactions. Additional indebtedness and a lower cash\nbalance could result in a downgrade of our credit ratings, limit our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt on favorable terms, increase our\nvulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions, and reduce our financial flexibility to continue with our capital investments, stock repurchases and\ndividend payments. For example, as a result of the cash used and the debt issued in connection with our acquisition of Immunomedics, Inc. in 2020, S&P\nGlobal Ratings downgraded our credit rating. We may be adversely impacted by any failure to overcome these additional risks.\nChanges in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, various countries are actively\nconsidering and have made changes to existing tax laws, and we cannot predict the form or timing of such changes. Our effective tax rates are affected by\nchanges in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of\nnew taxes, and changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices and interpretations, including in the U.S., Germany and Ireland.\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and tax authorities in various foreign\njurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and, as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving\nissues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We may be adversely affected by the resolution of\none or more of these exposures in any reporting period.\n51\nItem 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nIn the first quarter of 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a $5.0 billion stock repurchase program (“2020 Program”), with no fixed expiration.\nPurchases under the 2020 Program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, but the program does not obligate us to repurchase\nany specific number of shares and may be amended, suspended or discontinued at any time. We started repurchases under the 2020 Program in December 2022.\nThe table below summarizes our stock repurchase activity for the three months ended September 30, 2024:\nTotal Number of Shares Approximate Dollar Value of\nPurchased as Part of Publicly Shares that May Yet Be\nTotal Number of Shares Announced Programs (in Purchased Under the\nPurchased (in thousands) Average Price Paid per Share thousands) Programs (in millions)\nJuly 1 - July 31, 2024 1,360 $ 72.06 1,317 $ 3,279\nAugust 1 - August 31, 2024 2,075 $ 74.99 1,456 $ 3,169\nSeptember 1 - September 30, 2024 1,575 $ 81.76 1,160 $ 3,074\nTotal(1) 5,010 $ 76.32 3,933\n_______________________________\n(1) The difference between the total number of shares purchased and the total number of shares purchased as part of a publicly announced program is due to shares of common stock withheld by us\nfrom employee restricted stock awards in order to satisfy applicable tax withholding obligations.\nItem 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\nNot applicable.\nItem 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. OTHER INFORMATION\nOn August 28, 2024, Merdad V. Parsey, M.D., Ph.D., our Chief Medical Officer, adopted a trading plan intended to satisfy Rule 10b5-1(c) under the\nExchange Act to sell, subject to certain conditions, through April 8, 2025: (a) up to 395,164 shares of our common stock; and (b) 40% of the net vested shares\nof our common stock to be issued to Dr. Parsey in connection with the potential vesting and settlement of certain performance stock units.\nOn August 29, 2024, Andrew Dickinson, our Chief Financial Officer, adopted a trading plan intended to satisfy Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act to\nsell up to 695,164 shares of our common stock through November 29, 2026, subject to certain conditions.\nItem 6.

INTRODUCTION\nThe Gilead Sciences, Inc. Severance Plan (the “Plan”) was originally adopted by the Company effective January 29, 2003, and was\nsubsequently amended and restated on May 9, 2006, May 8, 2007, in February, May and December 2008, in December 2009, in\nJanuary 2010, in January 2012, in March 2016, in July 2019, in May 2020, and most recently in August 2024. This Plan and\nSummary Plan Description as so amended and restated replaces all severance or similar plans or programs of the Company\npreviously in effect. Except as expressly set forth in a written agreement between an Eligible Employee and the Company, the\nCompany currently maintains no severance or similar plan, program, policy or arrangement other than this Plan.\nThe purpose of the Plan is to provide a Severance Pay Benefit to certain Eligible Employees whose employment with the Company\nterminates under certain prescribed circumstances. Eligible Employees who previously participated in the Gilead Sciences\nInternational Severance Plan are eligible to participate in the Plan, as well as other Eligible Employees who are not remunerated\nthrough payroll in the United States. The program of benefits for Eligible Employees who previously participated in the Gilead\nSciences International Severance Plan and/or who are otherwise not remunerated through payroll in the United States shall be\nreferred to herein as the “International Program.”\nThe Company is the Plan Administrator for purposes of ERISA (other than with respect to the International Program). For the\navoidance of doubt, the International Program is not subject to ERISA. For Participants who are U.S. taxpayers, the Plan is intended\nto comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.\nCapitalized terms used in this Plan shall have the meanings set forth in Section XVIII.\nII. COMMENCEMENT OF PARTICIPATION\nAn Eligible Employee shall commence participation in the Plan upon the later of (i) January 29, 2003 or (ii) his or her date of hire.\nIII. TERMINATION OF PARTICIPATION\nA Participant’s participation in the Plan shall terminate upon the occurrence of the earliest of the following:\n(a) The Participant’s employment terminates without meeting the requirements of Section IV(a)(i)(1).\n1\n(b) The Participant’s employment terminates with a provision of Section IV(a)(ii) being applicable.\n(c) The Participant fails to meet the requirements of Section IV(a)(i)(2).\n(d) The Participant has received a complete distribution of his or her Severance Pay Benefit.\n(e) The Participant ceases to be an Eligible Employee (other than by reason of termination of his or her employment with the\nCompany).\n(f) The Plan terminates.\nIV. SEVERANCE PAY BENEFIT\n(a) Eligibility for Severance Pay Benefit.\n(i) Subject to Section IV(a)(ii), a Participant shall be eligible for a Severance Pay Benefit only if the Participant meets\nthe requirements of Section IV(a)(i)(1) and Section IV(a)(i)(2).\n(1) The Participant incurs a Separation from Service as a result of: (A) a termination of his or her Employee status\nby the Company without Cause; (B) a resignation of his or her Employee status as a result of a transfer,\nwithout consent, to a new work location that is more than 50 miles from his or her previous work location; or\n(C) in the case of a Participant whose Severance Pay Benefit is determined with reference to Appendix A, B,\nC or D, a Constructive Termination (as defined in Section 2(m) of the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan) in\nconjunction with a Change in Control and within the Change in Control Period specified in Appendix A, B, C\nor D, as applicable.\n(2) The Participant (A) executes and delivers to the Company the Release within the time frame prescribed by the\nCompany therein, and the period (if any such period is prescribed by the Company in the Release) for\nrevoking the execution of the Release under applicable law expires without the Participant’s revocation of\nsuch Release, and (B) fulfills any required prerequisites for the Release to be enforceable (such as, by way of\nexample, obtaining any governmental or third-party ratification or approval of such Release). A Participant’s\nfailure to comply on a timely basis with such Release requirement shall render such individual ineligible to\nreceive any Separation Pay Benefit under the Plan.\nThe business decisions that may result in a Participant qualifying for a Severance Pay Benefit are decisions to be\nmade by the Company in its sole discretion. In making these decisions, similarly situated organizations, locations,\nfunctions, classifications, and/or Participants need not be treated in the same manner. Each Participant who is\nremunerated through payroll in the United States remains an\n2\nemployee at will, and the date selected by the Company to terminate the Participant’s Employee status is within its\nsole discretion.\n(ii) Notwithstanding Section IV(a)(i), a Participant shall be disqualified from receiving a Severance Pay Benefit upon the\noccurrence of any of the following:\n(1) The Participant voluntarily terminates Employee status for any reason prior to the termination date set by the\nCompany;\n(2) The Participant’s Employee status is terminated by death or for Cause;\n(3) The Participant terminates Employee status in order to accept employment with an organization that is wholly\nor partly owned (directly or indirectly) by the Company or an Affiliate;\n(4) The Participant accepts any job with a Buyer or Outsourcing Supplier;\n(5) The Participant is offered full-time employment with a Buyer or Outsourcing Supplier at a new work location\n50 miles or less from his or her previous work location with the Company and taking such position would not\nresult in a reduction in his or her Regular Earnings; or\n(6) Except in the case of a Severance Pay Benefit payable in connection with a Change in Control, the Participant\nreceived a severance benefit in connection with an acquisition effected by the Company within 24 months\nprior to his or her Separation from Service.\nUnder no circumstances shall a Participant be eligible for a Severance Pay Benefit under the Plan if he or she\nterminates Employee status for the purpose of accepting employment with the entity that effectuates a Change in\nControl, or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. In addition, except as expressly provided otherwise in Section IV(a)(i)\n(1), for the avoidance of doubt, no Participant shall be eligible for a Severance Pay Benefit under the Plan if he or she\nterminates his or her own Employee status, including for good reason or as a result of any alleged or actual\nconstructive termination.\n(b) Amount of Severance Pay Benefit.\n(i) Subject to Section IV(b)(ii), the Severance Pay Benefit payable to a Participant shall be as set forth in the applicable\nAppendix for that Participant based on his or her position:\nAppendix A - The Executive Chairman (if any) and the Chief Executive Officer.\nAppendix B - Executive Vice Presidents and any other executive officers of the Company not covered by Appendix\nA.\nAppendix C - Senior Vice Presidents.\n3\nAppendix D - Vice Presidents.\nAppendix E - All Eligible Employees not covered by Appendix A, B, C, or D.\n(ii) Notwithstanding Section IV(b)(i), the total Severance Pay Benefit otherwise payable to a Participant under the Plan\nshall be subject to reduction (but not below zero) as follows:\n(1) If a Participant is reemployed by the Company or an Affiliate within the number of weeks after his or her\nSeparation from Service that is equal to the number of weeks taken into consideration in calculating the\nRegular Earnings component of his or her Severance Pay Benefit, the total Severance Pay Benefit payable to\nsuch Participant shall be reduced to the dollar amount that the Participant’s Regular Earnings would have been\nfor the period from the date of termination to the date of reemployment. In all cases, the reduced benefit will\nbe based on the Participant’s Regular Earnings originally used to calculate such Participant’s Severance Pay\nBenefit under the Plan.

Upon the expiration of the applicable deferral period, all payments deferred pursuant to this\nSection V(d), whether they were otherwise payable in installments or a lump sum, shall be paid in a lump sum to the\nParticipant, and any remaining Severance Pay Benefit shall be paid in accordance with the schedule described in Section\nV(a) above or in a lump sum to the extent such Severance Pay Benefit is to be paid pursuant to Section V(c) above.\n(e) Notwithstanding Section V(d), should a Participant who is a U.S. taxpayer and a Specified Employee at the time of his or her\nSeparation from Service become entitled to a Severance Pay Benefit prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control, then the\nportion of that Severance Pay Benefit that does not exceed the dollar limit described below and is otherwise scheduled to be\npaid no later than the last day of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which his or her Separation from\nService occurs will not be subject to any deferred commencement date under Section V(d) and shall be paid to such\nParticipant as it becomes due under Section V(a), to the extent that such portion qualifies as an involuntary separation pay\nplan in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) of the Treasury Regulations. For purposes of\nthis Section V(e), the applicable dollar limitation will be equal to two times the lesser of (i) the Participant’s annualized\ncompensation (based on his or her annual rate of pay for the taxable year preceding the taxable year of his or her Separation\nfrom Service, adjusted to reflect any increase during that taxable year which was expected to continue indefinitely had such\nSeparation from Service not occurred) or (ii) the compensation limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code as in effect in the\nyear of the Separation from Service. To the extent the portion of the Severance Pay Benefit to which such Participant would\notherwise be entitled under Section V(a) during the deferral period under Section V(d) exceeds the foregoing dollar\nlimitation, such excess shall be paid in a lump sum upon the expiration of that deferral period, in accordance with the\npayment delay provisions of Section V(d), and the remainder of the Severance Pay Benefit (if any) shall be paid in\n7\naccordance with the schedule described in Section V(a). In no event, however, shall this Section V(e) be applicable to any\nSeverance Pay Benefit (or any portion thereof) which does not qualify as an involuntary separation pay plan under Section\n1.409A-(b)(9)(iii) of the Treasury Regulations.\n(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, no distribution shall be made from the Plan to any U.S.\ntaxpayers that would constitute an impermissible acceleration of payment as defined in Section 409A(a)(3) of the Code and\nthe Treasury Regulations thereunder.\n(g) No interest shall be paid on a Severance Pay Benefit required to be deferred in accordance with the foregoing.\nVI. DEATH OF A PARTICIPANT\nIf a Participant dies after qualifying for a Severance Pay Benefit but before such benefit is completely paid, the balance of the\nSeverance Pay Benefit shall be paid in a lump sum to the Participant’s Beneficiary not later than the later of (i) December 31\nof the year in which the Participant’s death occurred or (ii) the 15th day of the third calendar month following the date of the\nParticipant’s death.\nVII.

Should any charge or action be filed on your\nbehalf involving claims released by the Releases, you agree to promptly inform the relevant agency, court, or arbitral forum that any\nindividual claims you might otherwise have had have been released. Additionally, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit you from\n(a) discussing or disclosing information about unlawful acts in the workplace, such as harassment or discrimination or any other\nconduct that you have reason to believe is unlawful, (b) reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any\ngovernmental agency or entity, including but not limited to the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the\nCongress, and any agency Inspector General, or (c) making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions\nof federal or state law or regulation, and you do not need prior authorization from the Company to make any such reports or\ndisclosures and you are not required to notify the Company that you have made such reports or disclosures.\n11. No Admission of Liability. Neither this Agreement, nor anything contained in it, shall constitute or shall be used or\nconstrued as an admission or as evidence of any liability or wrongdoing. Neither this Agreement, nor anything contained in it, shall\nbe introduced in any proceeding except to enforce this Agreement or to defend against any claim relating to the subject matter of the\nrelease contained herein or as required by court order, subpoena or other legal process, and such introduction under these exceptions\nshall be pursuant to an appropriate order protecting its confidentiality.\n12.

Furthermore, any such\ndispute or claim shall be brought in an individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported or actual class or\ncollective action proceeding except where applicable law prohibits a class or collective action waiver. A copy of the JAMS\nEmployment Arbitration Rules and Procedures can be found online at www.jamsadr.com/rules-employment-arbitration/. There will\nbe one arbitrator appointed in accordance with said rules. The arbitrator will conduct any arbitration consistent with the rules. The\narbitrator will have the authority to determine the arbitrability of any dispute between the parties. The arbitrator will have the\nauthority to award attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party pursuant to statute or this Agreement as described below in Paragraph 24.

You also may\nnot be held so liable for such disclosures made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing\nis made under seal. In addition, individuals who file a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of\nlaw may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the\nindividual files any document\nMerdad Parsey Page 10 of 13\ncontaining the trade secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

Section 1542 of the Civil Code states:\n“A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to\nexist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, and that if known by him or her, would have\nmaterially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”\nParsey acknowledges that Parsey may later discover claims or facts in addition to or different to those which Parsey now knows or\nbelieves to exist with respect to the subject matter of this Supplemental Release and the Transition Agreement and which, if known\nor suspected at the time of executing this Supplemental Release, may have materially affected this settlement. Nevertheless, Parsey\nwaives any right, claim or cause of action that might arise as a result of such different or additional claims or facts.\n(e) Covenant Not to Sue. As to any claim released under the Releases, Parsey specifically agrees and acknowledges that: (i)\nsuch claims, including those Parsey has or might have pertaining to Parsey’s employment with any Releasee, or separation of\nemployment from any Releasee, or pertaining to any Releasee’s employment practices arising under any municipal, state, or federal\nlaw, are completely released; and (ii) Parsey has not filed or initiated any pending complaints, charges, claims, or causes of action\nagainst any Releasee with any municipal, state, or federal government agency or court directly or indirectly related to Parsey’s\nemployment with Gilead, which includes, for the sake of clarity, claims of sexual assault, or workplace harassment or discrimination\nbased on sex, or failure to prevent an act of workplace harassment or discrimination based on sex, or an act of retaliation against a\nperson for reporting harassment or discrimination based on sex. Parsey agrees not to reargue, reinstitute, refile, appeal, renew, or\nseek reconsideration or any kind of judicial review of any of the claims released under this Agreement in any court or other legal\nforum whatsoever, nor shall any other court actions, suits, appeals or other legal proceedings of any type be pursued or filed that are\nconnected in any fashion to Parsey’s employment with Gilead or to Parsey’s separation from employment. For the sake of clarity,\nthis covenant not to sue does not prevent Parsey from seeking a binding determination as to the validity of this Supplemental Release\nor from engaging in any protected activity described in Paragraph 1(f), nor does it cover any claim not released under this\nSupplemental Release.\nA-3\n(f) Protected Activity. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prohibit Parsey from engaging in any protected or\nconcerted activity, or filing a complaint or charge with, or participating in any investigation or proceeding conducted by, or\nproviding information to or otherwise assisting the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission, Department of Fair Employment\nand Housing, National Labor Relations Board, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Securities and Exchange\nCommission or any other federal, state, or local governmental agency or commission (“Government Agencies”). By signing this\nAgreement Parsey agrees to waive Parsey’s right to recover individual relief based on any claims asserted in such a complaint or\ncharge; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement limits Parsey’s right to receive an award for information Parsey provides\nto any Government Agencies that are authorized to provide monetary or other awards to eligible individuals who come forward with\ninformation that leads to an agency enforcement action. Parsey further understands that this Agreement does not limit Parsey’s\nability to communicate with any Government Agencies or otherwise participate in any investigation or proceeding that may be\nconducted by any of the Government Agencies, including providing documents or other information, without notice to Gilead nor\ndoes it limit Parsey’s ability to disclose factual information relating to a claim filed in a civil action or a complaint filed in an\nadministrative action regarding sexual assault, or workplace harassment or discrimination based on sex, or failure to prevent an act\nof workplace harassment or discrimination based on sex, or an act of retaliation against a person for reporting harassment or\ndiscrimination based on sex. Should any charge or action be filed on Parsey’s behalf involving claims released by the Releases,\nParsey agrees to promptly inform the relevant agency, court, or arbitral forum that any individual claims Parsey might otherwise\nhave had have been released. Additionally, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Parsey from (i) discussing or disclosing\ninformation about unlawful acts in the workplace, such as harassment or discrimination or any other conduct that Parsey has reason\nto believe is unlawful, (ii) reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, including\nbut not limited to the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Congress, and any agency Inspector\nGeneral, or (iii) making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal or state law or regulation,\nand Parsey does not need prior authorization from Gilead to make any such reports or disclosures and Parsey is not required to notify\nGilead that Parsey has made such reports or disclosures.\n(g) Knowing and Voluntary Agreement. Parsey expressly recognizes and agrees that, by entering into this Agreement,\nParsey is waiving any and all rights or claims that Parsey may have arising under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as\namended by the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act of 1990, which have arisen on or before the date Parsey executes this Release.\n2.

(Nasdaq: GILD) today announced _The_ _New England Journal of Medicine_ ( _NEJM_ ) published the full results from the company’s pivotal Phase 3 PURPOSE 2 trial evaluating twice-yearly lenacapavir for the investigational use of HIV prevention among a broad and geographically diverse range of cisgender men and gender-diverse people. \n\nThe study found that twice-yearly lenacapavir for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) was highly efficacious at reducing HIV infections, reducing them by 96% compared to background HIV incidence. There were two incident cases among 2,179 participants, corresponding to 99.9% of participants not acquiring HIV infection in the lenacapavir group. Twice-yearly lenacapavir for PrEP also demonstrated superiority to once-daily Truvada ® (emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg; F/TDF) for PrEP and was generally well-tolerated, with no significant or new safety concerns identified.

(Nasdaq: GILD) today announced data from a two-and-a-half-year interim analysis from the ongoing Phase 3 ASSURE study, which showed that 81% (30 out of 37) of participants with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) treated with Livdelzi ® (seladelpar) achieved a composite biochemical response (CBR), demonstrating significant improvements in a key measures of PBC progression. Additionally, 41% (15 out of 37) of participants achieved normalization of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, a critical biomarker of liver function. These findings were unveiled as a late-breaker presentation at The Liver Meeting ® 2024 hosted by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) in San Diego, California from November 15-19. \n\nASSURE ([NCT03301506](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT03301506&esheet=54153267&newsitemid=20241114931214&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT03301506&index=1&md5=b4192b694062b464ddd3ab2826267de6)) is an ongoing, open-label, study evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of Livdelzi. ASSURE is enrolling adults with PBC who previously participated in a study of Livdelzi where a key eligibility criterion includes having an inadequate response or intolerance to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Using a data cutoff of January 31, 2024, the interim analysis represented all participants in the ASSURE study, including those who participated in prior clinical studies of Livdelzi (legacy studies) and participants from the pivotal Phase 3 RESPONSE study. Results demonstrate the safety profile of Livdelzi remains robust, with no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) reported throughout the study duration. The exposure-adjusted incidence of adverse events decreased over time, with 86, 70, and 63 participants per 100 patient-years observed in years 1, 2 and 3 of treatment, respectively. Livdelzi continues to appear generally well tolerated, with no new safety signals or change in frequency of adverse events (AEs) with up to three years of exposure. These results are consistent with the results [presented](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gilead.com%2Fnews%2Fnews-details%2F2024%2Fgileads-seladelpar-demonstrated-a-sustained-and-consistent-long-term-efficacy-and-safety-profile-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis&esheet=54153267&newsitemid=20241114931214&lan=en-US&anchor=presented&index=2&md5=abc1fdccbcc2ec6d623900dff76cee8f) at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) Congress earlier this year. \n\n“These data support what we’ve already observed with seladelpar. The long-term data from the ASSURE study reinforce that seladelpar consistently lowers ALP, offering a promising and much-needed option for patients living with this chronic liver condition,” said Eric J. Lawitz, MD, principal investigator and Medical Director of the Texas Liver Institute and a Clinical Professor of Medicine at University of Texas Health San Antonio, Texas, USA. “ALP levels are recognized as an important surrogate marker of disease progression in PBC, and providers are shifting to view ALP normalization as a treatment goal. ALP levels are critical markers in assessing liver health, and for people with PBC who are not adequately responding to first-line therapies, reducing, or even normalizing these levels, can make a significant difference in the management of this disease.” \n\nIn addition to the ASSURE data, Gilead showcased findings from two oral presentations highlighting additional analyses from the Phase 3 RESPONSE trial ([NCT04620733](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT04620733&esheet=54153267&newsitemid=20241114931214&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT04620733&index=3&md5=ba9f566dbf4e722f48e7bcdc26508375)): \n\n  * A prespecified subgroup analysis underscored the efficacy and safety profile of Livdelzi in people living with PBC and compensated cirrhosis. At Month 12, the adjusted mean change from baseline in ALP for participants with cirrhosis on Livdelzi was -121.4 U/L (a decrease of approximately 35% from baseline) versus 23.2 U/L (an increase of approximately 6.6%) on placebo, and -134.8 U/L (a decrease of approximately 43.5%) for Livdelzi versus -18.0 U/L (a decrease of approximately 5.8%) for placebo in participants without cirrhosis. In Livdelzi participants, AEs were reported in 89% and 86% of participants with and without cirrhosis, respectively, versus 89% and 84% in placebo participants. \n  * A secondary analysis of pruritus in RESPONSE showed that among participants with a numerical rating score (NRS) of ≥4 and NRS ≥7 at baseline, Livdelzi led to near resolution (NRS of 0 or 1) of itch at Month 12 in 26.5% and 18.8% of participants, respectively, versus 0% of participants on placebo. In Livdelzi participants, AEs were reported in 87.8% and 86.1% of participants with baseline NRS ≥4 and NRS <4, respectively, versus 91.3% and 81% in placebo participants. Overall, the proportion of participants with AEs was similar for Livdelzi and placebo regardless of baseline itch severity. \n\n\n\n“Gilead has a legacy of bringing groundbreaking treatments to people in need and Livdelzi is the first and only treatment to demonstrate statistically significant and durable improvements in both pruritus and markers of cholestasis related to the risk of disease progression,” said Timothy Watkins, MD, MSc, Vice President, Clinical Development, Inflammation Therapeutics, Gilead Sciences. “With Livdelzi, we’ve introduced an effective and well tolerated option for people living with PBC, offering an important novel treatment option. We remain committed to advancing innovative therapies that provide real hope and improved outcomes for people facing this challenging liver disease.” \n\nIn a separate analysis, which spans the Livdelzi program in PBC, Gilead highlighted findings from a large safety database of people treated with Livdelzi for up to five years, which demonstrated that Livdelzi was generally well tolerated considering cumulative use across studies. A total of 486 participants received Livdelzi 10 mg and 152 participants received placebo. The exposure-adjusted subject incidence (per 100 patient-years) for Livdelzi was 48.3 for AEs, 8.0 for SAEs, and 6.1 for liver-related AEs, as compared to 132 for AEs (rate reflective of shorter exposure time for placebo participants), 7.8 for SAEs, and 13.3 for liver-related AEs in placebo participants. There were no treatment-related SAEs. \n\nFor more information on the AASLD Annual Meeting and Gilead’s presentations, please visit the [AASLD website](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aasld.org%2Fthe-liver-meeting&esheet=54153267&newsitemid=20241114931214&lan=en-US&anchor=AASLD+website&index=4&md5=55777289875e8e202614dba7fbb7b93d). \n\nPlease see below for U.S. Indication and Important Safety Information for Livdelzi. \n\n** About ASSURE (NCT03301506) **\n\nASSURE is an open label study to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of seladelpar in people with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) who have already participated in other PBC clinical trials of seladelpar. The study is currently enrolling up to 500 people living with PBC from across 160 sites around the world. \n\nParticipants enrolled in ASSURE at the time of this interim data analysis include participants from previous studies of seladelpar in PBC, including the Phase 3 registrational RESPONSE study and legacy clinical trials. Legacy studies include the open label Phase 2 dose-ranging study (2 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg seladelpar), the open label Phase 3/4 long-term safety study (5 mg or 10 mg seladelpar), the Phase 3 placebo-controlled ENHANCE study (5 mg or 10 mg seladelpar vs placebo), and the ongoing open label study in people with PBC and hepatic impairment. ENHANCE and the long-term study were both terminated early. \n\n** About RESPONSE (NCT04620733) **\n\nRESPONSE is the pivotal Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of seladelpar in adults with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) who have shown inadequate response or intolerance to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). The trial enrolled 193 participants across multiple sites worldwide. RESPONSE assessed the key biomarker of cholestasis alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and other parameters of liver function, as well as secondary endpoints including pruritus and other patient quality of life measurements. \n\nParticipants in the RESPONSE trial received a daily oral dose of 10 mg of seladelpar for 12 months. The trial also aims to address the high unmet need for effective second-line therapies for individuals with PBC. \n\n** About Livdelzi **\n\nLivdelzi ®  (seladelpar) is an oral PPAR-delta agonist, or delpar, for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). PPAR-delta has been shown to regulate critical metabolic and liver disease pathways. Preclinical and clinical data indicate Livdelzi has anticholestatic, anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and antifibrotic effects. \n\nLivdelzi has potential to help meet the current unmet need of people living with PBC, as the first and only treatment that achieved statistically significant reduction across biochemical response, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) normalization, and pruritus versus placebo. Pruritus is a common symptom that can significantly impair quality of life in people with PBC. \n\nLivdelzi (10 mg capsule) was granted accelerated approval for the treatment of PBC by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2024. Livdelzi received FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation, as well as Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of people living with PBC. Seladelpar has also been accepted for review by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). \n\nAs part of the FDA accelerated approval, Gilead has committed to a confirmatory long-term outcomes study called AFFIRM, which has already been initiated in people with compensated cirrhosis. Continued approval may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s). \n\nThe Gilead Support Path ® Program offers information and resources to help patients who are prescribed Livdelzi understand coverage and financial options. \n\n** U.S. Indication for Livdelzi **\n\nLivdelzi is indicated for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults who have had an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in patients unable to tolerate UDCA. \n\nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on a reduction of ALP. Improvement in survival or prevention of liver decompensation events have not been demonstrated. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s). \n\nLimitations of Use: Use of Livdelzi is not recommended in patients who have or develop decompensated cirrhosis (e.g., ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy). \n\n** U.S. Important Safety Information for Livdelzi **\n\n**Warnings and Precautions**\n\n  * Fractures: Fractures occurred in 4% of LIVDELZI-treated patients compared to no placebo-treated patients. Consider the risk of fracture in the care of patients treated with LIVDELZI and monitor bone health according to current standards of care. \n  * Liver Test Abnormalities: LIVDELZI has been associated with dose-related increases in serum transaminase (AST and ALT) levels > 3 x ULN in patients receiving 50 mg and 200 mg once daily (5x and 20x higher than the recommended dosage of 10 mg once daily). Perform baseline clinical and laboratory testing when starting LIVDELZI and monitor thereafter according to routine patient management. Interrupt treatment if the liver tests (ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and/or ALP) worsen, or if the patient develops signs and symptoms of clinical hepatitis (eg, jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, eosinophilia). Consider permanent discontinuation if liver tests worsen after restarting LIVDELZI. \n  * Biliary Obstruction: Avoid use of LIVDELZI in patients with complete biliary obstruction. If biliary obstruction is suspected, interrupt LIVDELZI and treat as clinically indicated. \n\n\n\n**Adverse Reactions**\n\n  * The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) with LIVDELZI were headache (8%), abdominal pain (7%), nausea (6%), abdominal distension (6%), and dizziness (5%). \n\n\n\n**Drug Interactions**\n\n  * OAT3 Inhibitors and Strong CYP2C9 Inhibitors: Avoid coadministration with LIVDELZI due to increased LIVDELZI exposure. \n  * Rifampin: Monitor biochemical response (e.g., ALP and bilirubin) when patients initiate rifampin during LIVDELZI treatment. Coadministration may result in delayed or suboptimal biochemical response of LIVDELZI. \n  * Dual Moderate CYP2C9 and Moderate-to-Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors and BCRP Inhibitors (eg, cyclosporine): Monitor closely for adverse effects. Concomitant administration with LIVDELZI may increase LIVDELZI exposure. \n  * CYP2C9 Poor Metabolizers Using Moderate-to-Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Monitor more frequently for adverse reactions as concomitant use of a moderate-to-strong CYP3A4 inhibitor in patients who are CYP2C9 poor metabolizers may increase LIVDELZI exposure and risk of LIVDELZI adverse reactions. \n  * Bile Acid Sequestrants: Administer LIVDELZI at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after taking a bile acid sequestrant, or at as great an interval as possible. \n\n\n\n**Pregnancy and Lactation**\n\n  * Pregnancy: There are insufficient data from human pregnancies exposed to LIVDELZI to allow an assessment of a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Report pregnancies to Gilead Sciences, Inc., at 1-800-445-3235. \n  * Lactation: There are no data on the presence of LIVDELZI in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for LIVDELZI and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from LIVDELZI. \n\n\n\n** About PBC **\n\nPBC is a rare, chronic inflammatory liver disease primarily affecting women (1 in 1,000 women over the age of 40 or about 130,000 total people in the U.S.). PBC is characterized by impaired bile flow (known as cholestasis) and the accumulation of toxic bile acids in the liver, leading to inflammation and destruction of the bile ducts within the liver and causing increased levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), enzymes found primarily in the liver, as well as total bilirubin. The most common symptoms of PBC are pruritus and fatigue, which can be debilitating for some people. Progression of PBC is associated with an increased risk of liver-related mortality. \n\n** About Gilead Sciences in Liver Disease **\n\nFor decades, Gilead has pioneered the way forward to improve the lives of people living with liver disease around the world.
