[Operator\nInstructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded.\nThis call may include forward-looking statements and the company's actual results may differ materially\nfrom those indicated in any forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results\nto differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements are listed in the earnings\nrelease and the company's SEC feelings.\nI would now like to turn the conference call over to the Alerus Financial Corporation President and CEO,\nKatie Lorenson, to begin. Katie, please go ahead.\nKatie A. Lorenson\nPresident, CEO & Director\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our quarterly earnings call. Here in the Twin\nCity today with me is Al Villalon, our CFO; Karin Taylor, our Chief Operating and Risk Officer; and Jim\nCollins, our Chief Revenue Officer and Head of our Commercial Wealth Bank. Forrest Wilson, our Chief\nRetirement Services Officer is also joining us on the call.\nI'll start the call with some prepared remarks and strategic highlights for the quarter. Al will spend a\nfew minutes hitting on the key financial highlights, and then we will address your questions. There is no\nquestion that this was a tough quarter for Alerus. We are not and will not be satisfied with our results until\nwe are delivering superior returns. That being said, we also firmly believe success is not measured by a\nsingle quarter. And while the third quarter came up short, it was also a period of continued progress and\nexecution of our key long-term strategic initiatives for our company.\nWhile the path to returning to top performance is not linear, the substantial strides we've made\ndemonstrate our commitment to achieving our consistent top-tier performance. Our focus remains on\ndriving shareholder value through steady growth, diversified revenue positive operating leverage and\nmaintaining conservative efforts.\nLet me begin with the transformational changes we've been making over the past 1.5 years as we build a\npremier commercial wealth bank. Over this period, we have added key talent, continue to diversify our\nloan portfolio and closed on our largest acquisition to date. We've also managed through the challenging\nwork of numerous restructurings, rightsizing and exiting of several business lines, which were not core to\nour focus.\nRegarding talent, we have worked with urgency on getting the right people in the right seats. And our\ngreat culture and best-in-class diversified business model has allowed us to retain top balance and recruit\ndozens of new team members to the company, including many key hires with areas of deep expertise.\nOur additions on the revenue proving side are supported with key hires and continued investments in risk\nmanagement infrastructure. These are all long-term investments that put some near-term pressure on\noperating expenses, but keep growing in the right way to support the consistent top-tier returns we expect\nto deliver in the future and have delivered in the past.\nA key strategic priority was, and will continue to be to build strong mid-market and business-making C&I\nteams in our larger markets to support the well-established and successful teams in our North Dakota\nmarkets. Changes of this significance take time to show through to the bottom line, but the momentum is\nclear with nearly 45% of year-to-date loan origination to C&I clients compared to our pre-transformation\norigination percentages of 17%.\nWe recently rolled out our formal private banking offering after adding a team of professionals and\nthe synergies between wealth management commercial banking and mortgage are exceeding our\nexpectations, particularly in deposit and wealth generation. We remain deeply committed to diversification\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

We've added specialty areas of SBA, government non profit, and most\nrecently, our equipment finance vertical.\nTurning to our most recent announcement, which was the receipt of regulatory approval and the closing\nof our Home Federal acquisition, both of which happened in the expected time frame, and a signal of our\nposition of strength, relationships with our regulators and capabilities in executing acquisitions.\nThe Home Federal partnership is our 26th acquisition in the past 20-ish years. Our playbook of integration\nis proven. And in this particular partnership, the conversion is more straightforward than the previous\nsmaller mix we've acquired. We are so pleased with the leaders and the banking group that have joined\nus. Together as a bigger company, we are committed to getting better and achieving the results in our pro\nforma company and feel confident in our ability to do so.\nAs for the results of the third quarter, our deposit growth for the year is over 7% and despite facing\nthe headwinds of seasonal outflows we held deposits flat by continuing to win new clients despite the\nincredibly competitive environment. We experienced some positive migration, but it's important to note\nthe majority was simply in movement between accounts. We continue to operate with no brokered\ndeposits and highlight our CD portfolio that is core clients with a rollover rate in excess of 96%.\nLoan growth was also robust during the year with the majority of business coming from market share\ngains of long-established companies. Although the economy in our market continues to be strong, we\nremain highly selective. And in commercial real estate, where we run below regulatory guidelines in terms\nof concentration, we are stringent with our dry powder, reserving capacity for the highest quality sponsors\nwith underwriting structures that fit within our time-tested underwriting standards and those relationships\nthat deliver superior ROEs.\nCredit quality remains a key area of focus. Early identification of problem loans, coupled with proactive\nand decisive actions are part of our credit culture. We continue to closely monitor and proactively\ndowngrade loans where we see potential or emerging weaknesses. We monitor the individual loan level\non an ongoing basis, severing of our large multifamily projects, and we do not see systemic issues in this\nportfolio.\nHowever, normalization of credit in the broader portfolio continued during the quarter as 2 large\nrelationships drove the increase in nonaccrual loans, of which we believe we are adequately reserved. One\nof the loans was a long-term bank and wealth client who has experienced the credit issues and the other\nwas an acquired CRE loan originated in 2021 that was identified as higher risk marked in diligence.\nCredit migration has come from the a category, and we do not -- we have not backfilled despite\ncontinuously reviewing our portfolio through annual review, independent internal and external loan views.\nCharge-offs to average loans remained low for the quarter at 4 basis points and reserves to loans was\nstable at 1.29%.\nI will cover the margin in more detail, but I won't shy away from the reality of the magnitude of it. We\ndid take a step back to 2023 after a much anticipated step forward last quarter. Our long-term guidance\nremains intact. The NIM was impacted by the continued pricing pressure on deposits. We have consistently\ndiscussed the impact of deposit competition in our market, where many banks face high loan-to-deposit\nratios and a reliance on brokered funds. The competition remains fierce and we are focused here again on\nthe long-term retention and doing what's right. We have evaluated all exception price deposits on an\naccount by account level, and we will be adjusting incentives to correlate with volume and pricing.\nAlso, always the highlight for Alerus is our wealth management division, which has consistently grown\ntop line revenue for many years. Our advisers are the best in the business and our wealth business is\ndeeply embedded in our business lines with over 40% of our client works from part of our retirement focus\nbusiness and 20% of our wealth clients take personal or commercial bank relationships. We know how\nspecial our wealth business is and we are completely committed to continuing to invest in the business.\nWe recently signed to move to a new technology platform that will transform the client experience and\ngreatly improve the processes for our advisors and their support teams. This technology upgrade will\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 4\nALERUS FINANCIAL CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 30, 2024\nhelp build on our established success in recruiting advisors as we offer a great user experience and the\nexceptional synergies that advisors are able to leverage from our retirement business.\nSpeaking of our retirement business and our ultimate differentiator when it comes to value creation, given\nthe recurring nature of the business with minimal capital allocation. Here, too, we have new leadership,\nnew team members and enhanced structure. The team had a record quarter of new revenue, and we see\ncontinued positive growth trends in plans and participants, which is where the majority of our new fees are\nsourced. National partnerships are one of the key initiatives in building our business, and we are pleased\nwith the progress and the momentum we are seeing so far. We will continue to invest in this business\nwith key talent additions and technology to improve efficiency, increase automation and strengthen our\nmargins in the business.\nYear-over-year core nonmarket-related revenues are up 5%. We are very bullish on the commentary in\nour business and view the recent legislation of Secure Act 2.0 as a key catalyst in continuing our trend of\nimproving organic growth.\nMoving on to expenses during the quarter, which trended upwards due to a few factors: the addition of key\nhires and the correlated severance and retirement-related packages in addition to M&A-related expenses,\nwhich were $1.7 million. We had some lumpiness between the quarters related to FDIC insurance, and we\nhad some increases in professional fees, which I would characterize as operational but not recurring.\nWe believe each of our revenue producing hires will contribute to an improving fee with higher levels\nof production and more profitable business. The platform and technology changes in our wealth and\nretirement business will also create greatly improve our processes, which will lead to efficiencies, all of\nwhich will allow us to continue to effectively manage headcount in the company.\nIn regards to capital levels, they bounced back closer to core with the payoff of BTFP and we grew book\nvalue by 4.6%. Our book value continues to include $63 million of AOCI that will be casually recaptured\nover the coming years. We believe in maintaining a fortress balance sheet and remain committed to our\nlong history of delivering dividends to support returns to our shareholders. We have not been active in\nrepurchases due to the recently closed acquisition and our priorities remain focused on organic growth, but\nwe absolutely understand the value of the sum of the parts of our business and will be active as deep\ndisconnects on value present themselves.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Al for specifics on the quarter.\nAlan A. Villalon\nExecutive VP & CFO\nThanks, Katie. I'll start my commentary on Page 11 of our investor deck as posted on the Investor\nRelations part of our website. Let's start on our key revenue drivers. On a reported basis, net income\ndecreased 6.1% over the prior quarter, while fee income grew 3.6%. The decrease in net interest income\nwas driven primarily by lower purchase accounting accretion for the Metro Phoenix Bank acquisition, an\nincrease in nonaccruals and higher interest expense due to mix shift from noninterest-bearing deposits due\nto interest-bearing deposits. Growth in fee income was primarily driven by an increase in overall asset base\nfees within our wealth, retirement business line and from a gain recognized in the sale of one of our\noffices.\nTurning to Page 12 in the third quarter. We can dive into interest income a little more closely. Net interest\nincome decreased to $22.5 million and our core net interest margin decreased partly due to 3 factors. The\nfirst one being lower purchase accounting accretion for Metro Phoenix as you can see above decrease from\n10 basis points to 2, less net interest income due to higher nonaccruals and higher interest expense from\nan increase in interest-bearing deposits.\nAt the end of the quarter, we repaid our borrowings from the BTFP as the Fed recently reduced interest\nrates. So going forward, our reported net interest margin no longer reflect the drag from these low interest\nearning assets. We continue to see a path to our net interest margin reaching 3%. The path will not be\nlinear as each quarter will have the different factors affecting net interest margin. For the migration of\nnoninterest-bearing deposits to interest-bearing would drive our cost of funds higher.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5\nALERUS FINANCIAL CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 30, 2024\nTurning to Page 13 to talk about earning assets. Since acquisition of Metro Phoenix Bank, we had our\neighth consecutive quarter on growth as loans grew 4% over the prior quarter. We continue to let our loan\ninvestment portfolio run down as we mix low-yielding securities to higher-yielding loans.\nTurning to Page 14. On a period-end basis, our costs increased 0.8% from the prior quarter. While we\nsaw seasonal outpost from our public funds, we continue to drive or get deposit growth to offset these\noutflows. Given the 2.7% growth in interest-bearing deposits and 6.3% decline in noninterest-bearing\ndeposits, noninterest-bearing deposits are now 19.8% of total deposits versus 21.3% in the prior quarter.\nGiven the stable deposit level overall, our loan-to-deposit ratio was 91.2%, which is well below our target\nlevel of 95%. We continue to not utilize any broker deposits for funding needs.\nTurning to Page 15. I will now talk about our banking segment, which also includes our mortgage business.\nI'll focus on the fee income components now since interest income was pre-discussed. Overall, noninterest\nincome from banking was up $600,000 or over 12% from the prior quarter. Most of the increase was from\nthe gain recognized in the sale of one of our offices in Minneapolis Metro Market. For the fourth quarter, we\nexpect overall level of noninterest income to decrease from third quarter levels as we expect mortgage\nrevenue to slow on the back of a seasonal slowdown in originations.\nOn Page 16, I'll provide some highlights on our retirement business. Our total revenue from the business\nincreased 0.4%, while assets under management increased 4.7%, mainly as equity and bond markets\ncontinue to improve. Participants within retirement grew 1.5% during the quarter. New business\nproduction continues to be strong as over 500 opportunities were won this year. For the fourth quarter, we\ncontinue to expect fee income for our retirement business to be stable.\nTurning to Page 17, you can see some highlights from our wealth management business. On a linked\nquarter basis, revenues increased 5.1%, while our end of quarter assets under management increased\n5.4% due to continued improvement in economy bond markets. For the fourth quarter, excluding any\nmarket impact, we expect fee income from our wealth business to be up slightly.\nPage 18 provides an overview of our noninterest expense. Third quarter noninterest expense increased\n9.5%. During the quarter, we did incur $1.7 million of onetime merger-related expenses related to\nthe recently completed acquisition of HMN Financial. Excluding these merger expenses, core noninterest\nexpense increased 7.6%. Compensation and benefits saw an increase due to the onboarding of the\nequipment finance team, additional key hires and from an increase in employee benefits. We also saw\nan $800,000 increase in professional fees, excluding M&A-related activity due to increased examination\nand audit expenses. For the fourth quarter, reported expenses will increase due to merger and acquisition\nexpenses related to the Home Federal deal. For 2026 -- 2025, we are still committed to achieving 30%\ncost saves announced in the Home Federal acquisition.\nTurning to Page 19, you can see our credit metrics. As Katie covered a lot of this in her prepared remarks,\nI will go the next slide. I will discuss our capital liquidity on Page 20. We continue to remain very well\ncapitalized as a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is 11.1%. Our tangible common\nequity ratio also improved 85 basis points to 8.11% as we saw an improvement in unrealized losses and\nwe repaid the BTFP.\nPost the acquisition of Home Federal now have an outstanding share of over $25.3 million, which is in line\nwith our original deal assumptions. Additionally, we also added over $868 million of loans and $952 million\nof deposits. On the bottom right, you'll see the breakdown in the sources of our $2.2 billion of potential\nliquidity. Overall, we continue to remain well positioned from both the liquidity and capital standpoint to\nsupport future growth or whether any uncertainty.\nOn Page 21, we continue to see strong organic loan growth, which offset any seasonal outflows. We\ncontinue to see positive momentum in our retirement and wealth businesses, while seasonal capital levels\nremain strong to weather any economic uncertainty.\nWith that, I will now open up for Q&A.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

And our first question comes from the line of Jeff Rulis from D.A. Davidson & Co.\nJeffrey Allen Rulis\nD.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division\nQuestion on the larger credit, I guess, on nonaccrual, as you extend were to potentially put yourself in\na good position there. I guess, is that capped the extension of credit to that the construction item? Or is\nthere more to come to kind of get it over to completion? And then I guess, secondarily, could you just\nremind us kind of where that is located and the time line on resolution?\nKarin M. Taylor\nExecutive VP and Chief Risk & Operating Officer\nSure, Jeff, this is Karin. Yes. We continue to evaluate a number of options with regard to this particular\ncredit. If you recall from last time, the borrower has been proactive in injecting equity into the project to\ncover overruns. It went to nonaccrual because additional equity injections were delayed. They continue to\ntry and source additional update. That said, we will look at a range of options as we determine how to best\nresolve the credit.\nIt is here in the in cities market. It's on the east side of the cities, relatively close to both downtown. St.\nPaul and downtown Minneapolis. It's well located to entertainment, to public transportation, it's a Class A\nproperty in a preferable location. So we continue to feel good about the market dynamics and the market\nability to support that property. It is about 87% complete at this point, and we're looking at early 2025 for\ncompletion. Obviously, we're doing everything we can to resolve as quickly as possible, but I don't have a\nfirm time line for you.\nJeffrey Allen Rulis\nD.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division\nOkay. I appreciate it. On the expense side, Katie, I think you have, I guess, I'm interested in those areas\nthat aren't necessarily -- that were operational, but maybe not recurring. We can carve out the one-\ntimers, but I guess of the areas that were elevated trying to get a sense for the comp line? Are those hires\nfully baked in and then maybe professional services, just some areas that you may see maybe tail off\npotentially that aren't recurring, if you will.\nKatie A. Lorenson\nPresident, CEO & Director\nSure. Yes. In regards to the professional fees. I would expect to see more normalization if you take the run\nrate for the past couple of quarters ex the M&A. There's some lumpiness in between the second quarter\nand third quarter I would say for both the compensation line as well as the professional fees line item.\nJeffrey Allen Rulis\nD.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division\nOkay. I guess on a core basis to Al's commentary, I mean, ex the added platform, you're bringing on\nlegacy expenses, can we expect flat to down? Trying to get a sense for what the trend is there?\nAlan A. Villalon\nExecutive VP & CFO\nSo Jeff, you're going to see just on a reported basis, so our expenses, we are going to combine mergers.\nBut on a standalone basis, if you were just to look at us, we are committed to getting that down. But from\na combined entity because we're now 2 companies getting combined up, you will see reported expenses,\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7\nALERUS FINANCIAL CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 30, 2024\nof course, go up. We're committed to the 30% cost saves -- 30-plus percent cost saves that we detailed\nout in our original performance for the deal.\nJeffrey Allen Rulis\nD.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division\nYes. I guess I'm trying to get a sense for -- we could track the expenses on HMN side and what that\npotentially could add. We can carve out cost saves in '25. But just the run rate for legacy that's the key\nI'm trying to nail down.\nAlan A. Villalon\nExecutive VP & CFO\nYes. Yes, you would expect that to come down.\nJeffrey Allen Rulis\nD.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division\nOkay. Yes. Got you. Maybe just one last one then on the loan growth. Really strong growth, Katie. I\nappreciate the tilted towards the market share gains to the degree of -- I guess, does that suggest that\nthe market overall, maybe the pie is not growing, you're just taking a bigger piece of that? Or question\nreally is just on the underlying business trends and activity. Is that improving some, but you're executing\nwell on taking share. I just wanted to kind of wade into that discussion a little bit more.\nJim R. Collins\nExecutive VP and Chief Banking & Revenue Officer\nJeff, this is Jim. That is taking market share. We brought in a lot of talent over the last 18 months. Those\nnon-solicits are up. So a lot of the relationships that are moving over, and we're seeing that in the growth.\nOur relationships that have been known to a lot of the employees here now that have come over for a long\ntime. So it is market share in some of the other banks that are probably resting on the laurels a little bit.\nJeffrey Allen Rulis\nD.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division\nOkay. And Jim, your pulse on the activity, generally speaking, of the market from demand, what would\nthat be?\nJim R. Collins\nExecutive VP and Chief Banking & Revenue Officer\nI think all the markets that we're currently in are in pretty good economic shape. There's not a ton of\nrobust growth, I would say, but pretty average. So I don't think there's a lot of growth exponentially, but\nthere's enough growth for us as other banks are still not overly active in the marketplace. I think our\nactivities are going to generate a lot as the market competition comes back. Our activities now are going\nto be more fruitful in the '25 to '26 just because they haven't -- a lot of the banks haven't been in the\nmarket as much as we have been.\nOperator\nOur next question that comes from David Feaster with Raymond James.\nDavid Pipkin Feaster\nRaymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division\nI wanted to dig into the margin for a second. Look, there's a lot of moving parts in here. I was hoping\nyou could just help us think through maybe like a core margin what's a good starting point? Look, we've\nunwound the BTFP. You got HMNF in the fold. Just thinking through the trajectory, again, you got the\nnonaccrual reversal in the last quarter. Just how do you think about a good core margin starting point, the\ntrajectory going forward as your liability sensitivity had improved. And if you had any updated expectations\nfor accretion just on rate marks now the deals closed.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8\nALERUS FINANCIAL CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 30, 2024\nAlan A. Villalon\nExecutive VP & CFO\nThanks, David. So with September on a legacy portfolio with an interest margin of around 2.41%. When\nyou think about the acquired portfolio, HMN portfolio, their net interest margin is around 2.8% for the\nthird quarter, okay? So those are both quarter-to-quarter, no deal marks, of course.\nNow on a going forward basis, we did indicate about a $54.2 million mark, on the loan book. We're still\nwaiting back on the final valuation there, but we do expect that $54.2 million on original deal assumptions\nto be a little bit less given where the rates have moved since our announcement in May. So we'll have\nless income accretion -- purchase account accretion to net interest income for next year in terms of deal\naccretion, but we also will have less goodwill because of the marks.\nDavid Pipkin Feaster\nRaymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division\nOkay. Okay. And then just how do you think about deposit betas on the way down? You talked a lot about\nthe competitive landscape in your market for deposits. That's obviously well on the margin. How do you\nthink about the competitive landscape maybe impacting your ability to reprice deposits on the way down?\nI mean is that going to make it maybe a bit more difficult to do that? And just curious how you think about\nthat and some of the assumptions in your outlook?\nAlan A. Villalon\nExecutive VP & CFO\nYes. We've been pretty conservative in our assumptions in terms of deposit betas. We do expect deposit\nbetas -- I mean our deposit pricing to lag a little bit on the way down because given how many banks are\nstill north of 100% loan-to-deposit ratio and still continued. Again, in this quarter, we saw migration from\nnoninterest-bearing to interest-bearing too, which increased our cost of funds.\nSo in terms of the betas, now we are seeing some rationalization though, because we did see in all our\nmarkets CD rates pull back some. So that is encouraging to see some of that now. We're not seeing stuff\nin the high 5s or 6s anymore. We're now seeing things come back, especially with the Fed cut. But I do\nthink deposit betas on the way down will be a little bit slower to realize than probably take another 50 to\n100 basis points before we start seeing meaningful shift in deposit costs.\nDavid Pipkin Feaster\nRaymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division\nSo that just kind of putting that all together, your margin trajectory is probably going to be more back half\nweighted for the expansion side. Is that a fair characterization?\nAlan A. Villalon\nExecutive VP & CFO\nYes, that's correct. That's correct. I think when we still look at our ALM modeling, based on what we're\nseeing still though, and I'm not talking about any deal marks, we're looking on a legacy book right now\nbecause we're still importing a lot of stuff in understanding the HMN portfolio. When we look at our legacy\nAlerus book, we still see a path to 3% with even that lag effect coming in. So nothing has changed right\nwith no rate cuts, we still get to 3% in 2026.\nAnd on the to add there, too, that David, just the last thing I'll add to is on a down 100 basis point\nscenario, we still see our NII increasing in the legacy book about mid-single digits.\nDavid Pipkin Feaster\nRaymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division\nOkay. Good point. That's a good point. And then just last one. You've had a lot of success in the retirement\nand wealth businesses. I appreciate some of the commentary that you had. You talked about some\nsuccesses on national partners. I'm just curious where you're seeing success in those lines of business?\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9\nALERUS FINANCIAL CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 30, 2024\nAnd then just following up on the commentary about improving efficiency. I mean profitability has come\ndown pretty much in those businesses. I'm just kind of curious when do think that that's going to start\nmanifesting itself? And how do you think about the profitability profile of those businesses?\nForrest R. Wilson\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Retirement Services Officer\nYes, I can take that. This is Forrest. I can take that for the retirement business. One of the other benefits\nto this business is it's very steady business, but we do anticipate margins to improve really in response to\nthe groundwork that we're laying in 3 areas: in efficiency, increased revenue and reduced client turnover.\nAs Katie mentioned some of that in her opening comments, but we're moving forward with multiple efforts\nin each of these areas, including upgrading some technology that we're very excited about working on\nprocess improvement and forming new partnerships, which you specifically mentioned, I think there's\nabout 10-plus states now that have state-mandated retirement plans and a lot of private companies do\nnot want to go with the state plan, and it's definitely -- there's a groundswell of startup plans, which\nwith our [ path are ] pooled employer plan model, we're taking advantage of, and that's leading to some\nsignificant partnerships, one that we could highlight is our partnership with Mass Mutual financial advisors\nthat has yielded north of 150 new retirement plan clients in the last 14 months or so. So as far as margins\ngo, we anticipate expanding margins through these various efforts, but it's going to be steady over time.\nOperator\nAnd the next question comes from Brendan Nosal from Hovde.\nBrendan Jeffrey Nosal\nHovde Group, LLC, Research Division\nMaybe just to unpack like this quarter's margin before we get into the outlook here, could you help us\nunderstand some of the drivers of the loan and earning asset yield pressure? I guess, one, how much of a\ndrag came to nonaccrual piece? And is that recurring as long as those loans may not accrual and then two,\nwas there any impact from the swap maturity in this quarter.\nAlan A. Villalon\nExecutive VP & CFO\nYes. Thanks, Brendan. So nothing on the swap maturity when it comes to the nonaccruals, you could see\nthat about roughly around 7 to 8 basis points was from the nonaccruals.\nBrendan Jeffrey Nosal\nHovde Group, LLC, Research Division\nAnd does that drag stick around as long as those bonds are on nonaccrual? Or is that more of an interest\nreversal?\nAlan A. Villalon\nExecutive VP & CFO\nThere will be a reversal.\nBrendan Jeffrey Nosal\nHovde Group, LLC, Research Division\nSo that 8 basis point drag will not be present in the fourth quarter, just to make sure I understand\ncompletely clearly.\nAlan A. Villalon\nExecutive VP & CFO\nYes, that should not be there. Correct.\nBrendan Jeffrey Nosal\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 10\nALERUS FINANCIAL CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 30, 2024\nHovde Group, LLC, Research Division\nOkay. Got it. Okay. And then as the rest of the swap book rolls off, as it is pertaining to timing versus\nwhere the terms of those stats are versus where Fed funds is? Is there any kind of intermediate impact\none way or the other as those fall off the...\nAlan A. Villalon\nExecutive VP & CFO\nNo. I mean what we're anticipating in this quarter is a slight decrease in our -- on the legacy interest\nexpense. But we should start seeing margin improvement going forward because the swaps, we had $200\nmillion rolling off here in January. Then we only have another $200 million left from January 2026. So\nthere will be a very minor impact left from the remaining swap.\nBrendan Jeffrey Nosal\nHovde Group, LLC, Research Division\nOkay. Okay. Perfect. And then maybe last one on mortgage. I know you've kind of offered the guidance for\nthe fourth quarter there. I mean, for this quarter, it seemed like things were better than I was thinking,\neven though originations were down kind of the core gain on sale was quite a bit stronger quarter-\nover-quarter. Just wondering if there's anything that was kind of worth calling out for the third quarter\nperformance.\nAlan A. Villalon\nExecutive VP & CFO\nNo, we did disciplined pricing in that area is what really helped in the mortgage area. Hence why you saw\nthe better gain on sale.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from Nathan Race with Piper Sandler.\nNathan James Race\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\nJust put all the pieces together on the margin outlook and just the impact from Home Federal. Al, can you\njust help us with kind of a 4Q NII starting point, both on a core and reported basis?\nAlan A. Villalon\nExecutive VP & CFO\nYes. So I would look at it, it's like Home Federal at 2.8% take 20% of that and then 80% as around 2.4%,\nyou're going to get to somewhere in the mid-2s like 2.5-ish.\nNathan James Race\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\nSo you're talking margin, I was referring to NII.\nAlan A. Villalon\nExecutive VP & CFO\nI'm sorry, for NII, my bad. Sorry. When we talk about NII, we're looking at right now, let me just get that\nnumber up for you.\nBecause we're doing about, I'm going to say, around $32 million to $33 million in total for NII.\nNathan James Race\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\nThat's kind of the starting 4Q with Home Federal?\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 11\nALERUS FINANCIAL CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 30, 2024\nAlan A. Villalon\nExecutive VP & CFO\nYes. without any deal marks.\nNathan James Race\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\nRight, right. And just thinking about the opportunity to maybe deleverage the balance sheet at Home\nFederal. Any other balance sheet optimization initiatives that could come to fruition with that deal? Just\ncurious to hear any thoughts as it relates to your loan sales or just securities portfolio restructuring that\ncould help that margin outlook as we get through the integration into early 2025?\nAlan A. Villalon\nExecutive VP & CFO\nYes. So we already looked at doing some loan sales for that, we're contemplating laying off options on the\nloan front. On the securities front, you can expect that we're going to make -- we've done some stuff on\nthat front to help with NII. But the lift from the securities book because they only had about $190 million\nworth of securities is going to be very small.\nNathan James Race\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\nOkay. Perfect. Very helpful. And then just in terms of just the rate sensitivity of the combined franchise\ngoing forward. I think we talked about the liabilities since the position of the balance sheet previously.\nYou have some swaps going off next year. So just curious how you're kind of thinking about just the static\nmargin or NII impact from each 25 basis points going forward.\nAlan A. Villalon\nExecutive VP & CFO\nYes. We're still working through that right now as we get our 2 systems merged in place. But what we\ncould see from the surface right now is that they're liability sensitive, so that's just going to add to liability\nsensitivity that we have.\nNathan James Race\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\nGot it. Switching gears, maybe a question for Karin. Curious if you could just touch on what you saw in\nterms of criticized classified loan trends in the quarter?\nKarin M. Taylor\nExecutive VP and Chief Risk & Operating Officer\nSure. We did see those increase again. What I would say about that is that while we've been experiencing\nincreases, overall levels are fairly consistent with what we saw pre-pandemic. And so the nonperforming\nobviously, are higher, and those are being driven over half of that by that one loan. So those are higher\nthan what we've experienced in the past. But generally speaking, the criticized and classified levels are\nmore consistent with pre-pandemic.\nAnd when you look past these few credits that Katie pointed out in her comments, there's they're really\nmade up of all different segments. Even the asset classes within the commercial real estate are different\nand then origination date. Kind of span all the way back actually to mid-2015. And so I think really what\nwe're seeing is we're seeing some continued normalization, which isn't unexpected, but then we've got\nthese couple of big deals that are really bouncing those nonperforming numbers.\nNathan James Race\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\nGot it. That's very helpful. Maybe one last question for me for Katie. Now that you got Home Federal\nclosed in a pretty timely fashion here in the fourth quarter. I would just love to hear your updated\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 12\nALERUS FINANCIAL CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 30, 2024\nperspective in terms of managing excess capital. Obviously, with the profitability improvement with Home\nFederal, you guys should be accreting excess capital at stronger clips going forward. So just curious how\nyou're thinking about weighing those options and deploying excess capital between additional acquisitions,\nwhether it's on the retirement or wealth side or in terms of whole big acquisitions or perhaps resuming\nshare repurchases just given where the stock is trading.\nKatie A. Lorenson\nPresident, CEO & Director\nSure. Yes. Thank you. In regards to capital, our priorities remain consistent with the previous quarters.\nOrganic growth is certainly a key priority to maintain our fortress balance sheet is always #1 in our priority\nbooks. Our commitment to our dividend remains consistent with our long history. And as I mentioned in\nmy opening comments, we understand the value embedded in this company. And so having the share\nrepurchase out there from a defensive standpoint, I think, serves us all well.\nIn regards to M&A, again, there's a couple of catalysts particularly in the retirement space for some\nscale providers. And we are known and have proven that we are a partner of choice for many of those\ncompanies, we'll be highly selective of course, because there's a lot of work that we're doing internally in\nthat business, but we believe we will continue to see opportunities specifically in that retirement as well as\nin the wealth space.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Damon DelMonte with KBW.\nDamon Paul DelMonte\nKeefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division\nFirst one, just regards to expenses. Al, kind of just wondering what your thoughts are on the combined\ncompany here in the fourth quarter. I think you guys mentioned the wealth management platform upgrade\nyou guys are going to be doing. So just trying to get a gauge on kind of what we could expect here in the\nfourth quarter.\nAlan A. Villalon\nExecutive VP & CFO\nYes. Damon, I'm going to say that fourth quarter is going to be a little messy here because we're going\nto have a lot of the deal expenses flowing through especially contract terminations and onboarding of\nnew stuff. So I don't have a good guide for you at this moment in terms of the fourth quarter run rate.\nBut what I could say for the '25 run rate is that we are looking once you get pass all the deal costs and\neverything from a combined basis that we're still on track to meeting all the goals we set for in 2025.\nDamon Paul DelMonte\nKeefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division\nOkay. Yes. And I understand there'll be a lot of moving parts. But I mean is the simple way of looking at\nit is -- if you take out the merger this quarter, you're around $40.8 million today, basically layer on the\nHMNF expense base and then start to take off some expenses, which would kind of put you in the upper\n$47 million, low $48 million range. Is that ballpark?\nAlan A. Villalon\nExecutive VP & CFO\nThat's the way to think about it, right, on a core basis. Correct.\nDamon Paul DelMonte\nKeefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division\nOkay. Great. And then with regards to the 2 new loans that moved into nonaccrual this quarter, Could you\njust scale a little bit more color, one of them was a large residential relationship. Like how big was it? And\nwhat kind of reserves do you have against that?\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 13\nALERUS FINANCIAL CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 30, 2024\nKarin M. Taylor\nExecutive VP and Chief Risk & Operating Officer\nYes. Damon, this is Karin. That relationship was about -- is about $8.5 million. And it's comprised of an\nowner-occupied property as well as the previous property that's listed for sale. The current reserve on is\nabout 5%, and we will be getting updated valuations on both of those properties.\nDamon Paul DelMonte\nKeefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division\nOkay. Great. Great. So both of those were to one borrower. One part of it was residential and one was\nowner-occupied?\nKarin M. Taylor\nExecutive VP and Chief Risk & Operating Officer\nIt's a long-term banking and wealth client, as Kate mentioned, and he had a primary residence,\nconstructed a new residents, which we financed. And so both of those residents are single-family\nresidences. And he is in the new home now and the previous homes listed for sale.\nDamon Paul DelMonte\nKeefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division\nGot it. Okay. And then with regard to the construction loan, this may have been asked before, so I\napologize. But is there any additional funds to be released to this borrower to help complete the project?\nOr are you at full exposure right now?\nKarin M. Taylor\nExecutive VP and Chief Risk & Operating Officer\nWe're at full exposure on that deal.\nDamon Paul DelMonte\nKeefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division\nOkay. And then that's at about how much now 20, is it upper 20s?\nKarin M. Taylor\nExecutive VP and Chief Risk & Operating Officer\nI'm sorry, you're talking about the original deal. I thought you were talking about the residential deal. No,\nI'm sorry.\nDamon Paul DelMonte\nKeefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division\nI'm talking about the Construction loan, yes. Sorry.\nKarin M. Taylor\nExecutive VP and Chief Risk & Operating Officer\nOkay. Yes. That one, we're considering -- we still are considering a number of options on that one, Damon.\nThe borrower is continuing to try to raise equity. They've demonstrated their willingness to inject equity.\nAnd so we're supporting that process. But certainly, additional fundings may be on the table as we look at\nhow we can most quickly resolve this.\nDamon Paul DelMonte\nKeefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division\nGot you. Okay. And have you quantified what the total exposure is to that one particular borrower?\nKarin M. Taylor\nExecutive VP and Chief Risk & Operating Officer\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 14\nALERUS FINANCIAL CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 30, 2024\nRight as of 9/30, the balance was $25 million, and the approved -- or they're approved up to just under\n$29 million.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from David Feaster with Raymond James.\nDavid Pipkin Feaster\nRaymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division\nI just wanted to touch on the hiring front. You got you guys have been really active. You've attracted a lot\nof new talent. I'm curious, I guess, a, what's your appetite for new hires. And how much of the production\n-- like how much of the growth that you're seeing from those guys? Or is that kind of still on the come?\nJim R. Collins\nExecutive VP and Chief Banking & Revenue Officer\nDavid, this is Jim. I will say we're still active on hires, but I do want to note we are -- as we have some\nindividuals leaving the organization, we are repurposing those FTEs for a lot of the new hires. The growth\nis coming from those new hires because they have capacity and relationships that are new, but we also\nhave a lot of growth coming from our existing traditional portfolios as well.\nDavid Pipkin Feaster\nRaymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division\nOkay. Okay. And I guess, as you think about funding growth going forward, we've kind of talked about a\nmid-90s loan-to-deposit ratio. Is that kind of still the target. And how do you think about funding growth\nwith core deposits in light of the competition that you talked about?\nAlan A. Villalon\nExecutive VP & CFO\nYes. Thanks, David, thank for the question. I mean that is our target is 95%, but we understand too that\nwill drift up above that in certain quarters due to seasonality. So you could see us get up to 97%, 98%\nand maybe some quarters below 95%. So the average will get to 95% through the cycle. But with that\nbeing said, too, though, as we continue to grow, we will probably be utilizing other areas other means to\nfund those growth if we can get core deposits in the door.\nJim R. Collins\nExecutive VP and Chief Banking & Revenue Officer\nI do want to note, David, we do have some very specific deposit strategies around our homeowners\nassociations around large nonprofits and large specific mid-market clients generate a lot of cash and don't\nneed a lot of loans. So we are very focused on driving those core deposits. And I think we've been fairly\nsuccessful over the last year, and we will continue to drive those.\nDavid Pipkin Feaster\nRaymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division\nAnd just to be crystal clear, that 2.45% is a core margin that we talked about out, right? Accretion would\nbe on top of that.\nUnknown Executive\nCorrect. That is correct.\nOperator\nSo this does conclude our question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the conference back over\nto Katie Lorenson for any closing remarks.\nKatie A.

In the transaction, we acquired a strong core deposit base and strategically expanded into the vibrant Rochester and Southern Minnesota markets. Throughout the quarter and ahead of this closing, we continued to make long term investments to support and grow our uniquely diversified business model and revenue streams. We continued to demonstrate our position as an employer of choice, with the addition of a specialized equipment leasing team and key hires to drive growth and efficiencies throughout our organization, especially in our retirement and benefit services segment. \n\nWe have continued to see market share gains and growth of our client base both in adding new business and deepening relationships with current clients. This year, our retirement and benefits business has grown over 19%, our wealth management business has grown 18%, and we have grown loans nearly 10% and deposits over 7% in a very challenging and competitive environment. \n\nCredit quality remains a key area of focus. Early identification of problem loans coupled with proactive and decisive actions are part of our credit culture. We continue to closely monitor and proactively downgrade loans where we see potential or emerging weaknesses. Normalization of credit continued during the quarter, as two large relationships drove the increase in nonaccrual loans. Charge-offs to average loans for the quarter were 0.04% and reserves to loans was stable at 1.29%. \n\nWe are focused on efficient headcount management, and balancing investments in talent, technology and infrastructure, while remaining committed to a strong balance sheet, capital levels, and improving performance as a bigger and better combined entity. \n\nThank you to the team members both new and long tenured for your hard work, dedication and invaluable contributions supporting our company, our clients and our communities, and helping us on our journey to achieving new milestones and our return to high-performance and top tier financial results.” \n\n**Third Quarter Highlights**\n\n  * Total loans were $3.0 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $272.8 million, or 9.9%, from December 31, 2023. \n  * Total deposits were $3.3 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $227.9 million, or 7.4%, from December 31, 2023; brokered deposits remained at $0. \n  * The loan to deposit ratio as of September 30, 2024 was 91.2%, compared to 89.1% as of December 31, 2023. \n  * Noninterest income, which represented 55.7% of total revenues, was $28.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 3.6% from $27.4 million in the second quarter of 2024. \n  * Total assets under administration/management at September 30, 2024 were $45.6 billion, a 4.8% increase from June 30, 2024. \n  * Net charge-offs to average loans were 0.04% in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 32 basis points from 0.36% in the second quarter of 2024. \n  * Tangible book value per common share (non-GAAP) was $16.50 as of September 30, 2024, a 6.7% increase from December 31, 2023. \n  * Tangible common equity to tangible assets (non-GAAP) was 8.11% at September 30, 2024, an increase of 85 basis points from 7.26% in the second quarter of 2024. \n  * Common equity tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets as of September 30, 2024 was 11.12% and continues to be well above the minimum threshold to be “well capitalized” of 6.50%. \n  * Repaid Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”) borrowings, resulting in risk-free net interest income of $1.2 million earned during the course of the year to date. \n  * $400.0 million of interest rate swaps matured during the third quarter of 2024, which drove increased liability sensitivity as the Federal Reserve began to cut interest rates. Of the remaining $400.0 million of interest rate swaps, $200.0 million will mature in January 2025. \n\n\n\n** HMN Financial Acquisition **\n\nOn October 9, 2024, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of HMN Financial, Inc. and its subsidiary, Home Federal Savings Bank (together, \"HMNF\").

With the addition of HMNF, the Company now has over $5.5 billion in total assets, $3.8 billion in total loans, $4.3 billion in total deposits, and asset under administration and management of approximately $43.6 billion, with 29 locations across the Midwest, as well as Arizona. \n\n**Selected Financial Data (unaudited)**\n\n**As of and for the**  \n---  \n**Three months ended** |  **Nine months ended**  \n_(dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data)_ |  **September 30, 2024** |  **June 30,** **2024** |  **September 30,** **2023** |  **September 30,** **2024** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n**Performance Ratios**  \nReturn on average total assets  |  0.48  |  %  |  0.58  |  %  |  0.95  |  %  |  0.56  |  %  |  0.93  |  %   \nAdjusted return on average total assets (1) |  0.57  |  %  |  0.65  |  %  |  0.75  |  %  |  0.62  |  %  |  0.85  |  %   \nReturn on average common equity  |  5.52  |  %  |  6.76  |  %  |  10.05  |  %  |  6.43  |  %  |  9.79  |  %   \nReturn on average tangible common equity (1) |  7.83  |  %  |  9.40  |  %  |  13.51  |  %  |  8.98  |  %  |  13.27  |  %   \nAdjusted return on average tangible common equity (1) |  9.04  |  %  |  10.30  |  %  |  10.97  |  %  |  9.80  |  %  |  12.27  |  %   \nNoninterest income as a % of revenue  |  55.72  |  %  |  53.28  |  %  |  58.21  |  %  |  54.10  |  %  |  54.51  |  %   \nNet interest margin (tax-equivalent)  |  2.23  |  %  |  2.39  |  %  |  2.27  |  %  |  2.31  |  %  |  2.50  |  %   \nAdjusted net interest margin (tax-equivalent) (1) |  2.35  |  %  |  2.47  |  %  |  2.24  |  %  |  2.41  |  %  |  2.46  |  %   \nEfficiency ratio (1) |  80.29  |  %  |  72.50  |  %  |  73.37  |  %  |  77.17  |  %  |  73.57  |  %   \nAdjusted efficiency ratio (1) |  77.71  |  %  |  70.80  |  %  |  77.03  |  %  |  75.50  |  %  |  74.58  |  %   \nNet charge-offs/(recoveries) to average loans  |  0.04  |  %  |  0.36  |  %  |  (0.09  |  )%  |  0.14  |  %  |  (0.04  |  )%   \nDividend payout ratio  |  76.92  |  %  |  64.52  |  %  |  42.22  |  %  |  66.29  |  %  |  43.08  |  %   \n**Per Common Share**  \nEarnings per common share - basic  |  $  |  0.26  |  $  |  0.31  |  $  |  0.46  |  $  |  0.90  |  $  |  1.31   \nEarnings per common share - diluted  |  $  |  0.26  |  $  |  0.31  |  $  |  0.45  |  $  |  0.89  |  $  |  1.30   \nAdjusted earnings per common share - diluted (1) |  $  |  0.31  |  $  |  0.34  |  $  |  0.36  |  $  |  0.98  |  $  |  1.19   \nDividends declared per common share  |  $  |  0.20  |  $  |  0.20  |  $  |  0.19  |  $  |  0.59  |  $  |  0.56   \nBook value per common share  |  $  |  19.53  |  $  |  18.87  |  $  |  17.60   \nTangible book value per common share (1) |  $  |  16.50  |  $  |  15.77  |  $  |  14.32   \nAverage common shares outstanding - basic  |  19,788  |  19,777  |  19,872  |  19,768  |  19,977   \nAverage common shares outstanding - diluted  |  20,075  |  20,050  |  20,095  |  20,037  |  20,193   \n**Other Data**  \nRetirement and benefit services assets under administration/management  |  $  |  41,249,280  |  $  |  39,389,533  |  $  |  34,552,569   \nWealth management assets under administration/management  |  $  |  4,397,505  |  $  |  4,172,290  |  $  |  3,724,091   \nMortgage originations  |  $  |  82,388  |  $  |  109,254  |  $  |  109,637  |  $  |  245,743  |  $  |  298,626   \n  \n______________  \n---  \n(1) Represents a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP to GAAP Reconciliations and Calculation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”   \n  \n**Results of Operations**\n\n**_Net Interest Income_ **\n\nNet interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $22.5 million, a $1.5 million, or 6.1%, decrease from the second quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest income on lower cash balances, lower purchase accounting accretion from the Metro Phoenix Bank acquisition, and increased interest expense on higher deposit balances. These pressures were partially offset by an increase in interest income on higher average loan balances. \n\nNet interest income increased $2.1 million, or 10.5%, from $20.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. Interest income increased $10.2 million, or 24.2%, from the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by strong organic loan growth at higher yields, in addition to higher cash balances due to the BTFP. The increase in interest income was partially offset by an $8.0 million, or 37.1%, increase in interest expense, due to both an increase in rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and higher deposit and short-term borrowing balances. \n\nNet interest margin (on a tax-equivalent basis) was 2.23% for the third quarter of 2024, a 16 basis point decrease from 2.39% for the second quarter of 2024, and a 4 basis point decrease from 2.27% for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in net interest margin (on a tax-equivalent basis) was mainly attributable to less purchase accounting accretion, the impact of nonaccrual loans, and higher cost of funds from growth in average interest-bearing deposit balances. This was partially offset by strong loan growth. Adjusted net interest margin (on a tax-equivalent basis) (non-GAAP), which excludes BTFP borrowings and purchase accounting accretion, was 2.35% for the third quarter of 2024, an 11 basis point decrease from 2.47% for the second quarter of 2024, and an 11 basis point increase from 2.24% for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**_Noninterest Income_ **\n\nNoninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $28.4 million, a $1.0 million increase from the second quarter of 2024. The quarter over quarter increase was primarily driven by improvement across all fee-based businesses. Wealth revenues increased $0.3 million during the third quarter of 2024, a 5.1% increase from the second quarter of 2024. Retirement and benefit services revenue increased $0.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 0.4% increase from the second quarter of 2024 results. Combined assets under administration/management in wealth and retirement and benefit services increased 4.8% from June 30, 2024. The increase in wealth, retirement and benefit services revenue, and assets under administration/management was primarily due to improved equity and bond markets. Additionally, other noninterest income increased $0.6 million during the third quarter of 2024, a 28.7% increase from the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to a gain on the sale of fixed assets related to the sale of the Shorewood, Minnesota office in the western suburbs of the Twin Cities. \n\nNoninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 decreased by $44 thousand, or 0.2%, from the third quarter of 2023. Wealth revenues increased $1.4 million, or 26.8%, in the third quarter of 2024, due to an increase in assets under administration/management of 5.4% during that same period. Other noninterest income increased $0.8 million, or 46.1% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to a gain on the sale of fixed assets related to the sale of the Shorewood, Minnesota office and increased client swap fees. Offsetting these increases, retirement and benefit services revenue decreased $2.5 million, or 13.2%, from $18.6 million in the third quarter of 2023, driven by the divestiture of the ESOP trustee business in the third quarter of 2023 which resulted in a one-time recognized gain of $2.8 million. \n\n**_Noninterest Expense_ **\n\nNoninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $42.4 million, a $3.7 million, or 9.5%, increase from the second quarter of 2024. Professional fees and assessments increased $1.9 million, or 79.8%, from the second quarter of 2024, primarily driven by increased merger-related expenses of $1.1 million in connection with the acquisition of HMNF. Compensation expenses increased $0.8 million, or 3.9%, from the second quarter of 2024, primarily driven by experienced talent acquisitions in commercial lending and increased labor costs. Business services, software and technology expense increased $0.3 million, or 6.1%, from the second quarter of 2024, primarily driven by increased data processing expenses and custodian fees. Occupancy and equipment expense increased $0.3 million, or 14.7%, from the second quarter of 2024, primarily driven by increased rent and depreciation expense driven by the opening of the Shoreview, Minnesota office in the northern suburbs of the Twin Cities in July 2024. \n\nNoninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased $5.2 million, or 13.9%, from $37.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by professional fees and assessments, compensation and employee taxes and benefits. Professional fees and assessments increased primarily due to increased merger-related expenses of $1.7 million in connection with the acquisition of HMNF and an increase in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) assessments. Compensation expense increased $2.0 million, or 10.4%, in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to increased labor costs. Employee taxes and benefits expense increased $0.5 million, or 10.3%, primarily due to increased costs related to group insurance. \n\n**Financial Condition**\n\nTotal assets were $4.1 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $176.9 million, or 4.5%, from December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $272.8 million increase in loans, partially offset by a decrease of $63.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and a decrease of $35.6 million in investment securities. \n\n**_Loans_ **\n\nTotal loans were $3.0 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $272.8 million, or 9.9%, from December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a $116.7 million increase in non-owner occupied commercial real estate (“CRE”) loans, a $49.6 million increase in construction, land and development CRE loans, a $44.1 million increase in commercial and industrial loans, a $30.3 million increase in multifamily CRE loans and a $24.7 million increase in owner occupied CRE loans, partially offset by $7.4 million and $17.2 million decreases in residential real estate first lien and construction loans, respectively. \n\nThe following table presents the composition of our loan portfolio as of the dates indicated: \n\n**September 30,** |  **June 30,** |  **March 30,** |  **December 31,** |  **September 30,**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **2024** |  **2024** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2023**  \n**Commercial**  \nCommercial and industrial  |  $  |  606,245  |  $  |  591,779  |  $  |  575,259  |  $  |  562,180  |  $  |  547,644   \nCommercial real estate   \nConstruction, land and development  |  173,629  |  161,751  |  125,966  |  124,034  |  97,742   \nMultifamily  |  275,377  |  242,041  |  260,609  |  245,103  |  214,148   \nNon-owner occupied  |  686,071  |  647,776  |  565,979  |  569,354  |  504,827   \nOwner occupied  |  296,366  |  283,356  |  285,211  |  271,623  |  264,458   \nTotal commercial real estate  |  1,431,443  |  1,334,924  |  1,237,765  |  1,210,114  |  1,081,175   \nAgricultural   \nLand  |  45,821  |  41,410  |  41,149  |  40,832  |  41,581   \nProduction  |  39,436  |  40,549  |  36,436  |  36,141  |  34,743   \nTotal agricultural  |  85,257  |  81,959  |  77,585  |  76,973  |  76,324   \nTotal commercial  |  2,122,945  |  2,008,662  |  1,890,609  |  1,849,267  |  1,705,143   \n**Consumer**  \nResidential real estate   \nFirst lien  |  690,451  |  686,286  |  703,726  |  697,900  |  680,634   \nConstruction  |  11,808  |  22,573  |  18,425  |  28,979  |  37,159   \nHELOC  |  134,301  |  126,211  |  120,501  |  118,315  |  116,296   \nJunior lien  |  36,445  |  36,323  |  36,381  |  35,819  |  36,381   \nTotal residential real estate  |  873,005  |  871,393  |  879,033  |  881,013  |  870,470   \nOther consumer  |  36,393  |  35,737  |  29,833  |  29,303  |  30,817   \nTotal consumer  |  909,398  |  907,130  |  908,866  |  910,316  |  901,287   \nTotal loans  |  $  |  3,032,343  |  $  |  2,915,792  |  $  |  2,799,475  |  $  |  2,759,583  |  $  |  2,606,430   \n  \n**_Deposits_ **\n\nTotal deposits were $3.3 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $227.9 million, or 7.4%, from December 31, 2023. Interest-bearing deposits increased $298.5 million, while noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $70.5 million, from December 31, 2023. The increase in total deposits was due to both expanded and new commercial deposit relationships and synergistic deposit growth.

During the third quarter of 2024, management elected to make protective advances in order for construction to continue on that project. Management is actively working with the borrower on strategies to complete construction, preserve value and support repayment of the loan. A large residential real estate relationship and one CRE non-owner occupied loan moving to nonaccrual status also contributed $13.6 million to the increase in nonaccrual loans during the third quarter of 2024. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses on loans was $39.1 million, or 1.29% of total loans, compared to $35.8 million, or 1.30% of total loans, as of December 31, 2023. \n\nThe following table presents selected asset quality data as of and for the periods indicated: \n\n**As of and for the three months ended**  \n---  \n**September 30,** |  **June 30,** |  **March 30,** |  **December 31,** |  **September 30,**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **2024** |  **2024** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2023**  \nNonaccrual loans  |  $  |  48,026  |  $  |  27,618  |  $  |  7,345  |  $  |  8,596  |  $  |  9,007   \nAccruing loans 90+ days past due  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  139  |  —   \nTotal nonperforming loans  |  48,026  |  27,618  |  7,345  |  8,735  |  9,007   \nOREO and repossessed assets  |  —  |  —  |  3  |  32  |  3   \nTotal nonperforming assets  |  $  |  48,026  |  $  |  27,618  |  $  |  7,348  |  $  |  8,767  |  $  |  9,010   \nNet charge-offs/(recoveries)  |  316  |  2,522  |  58  |  (238  |  )  |  (594  |  )   \nNet charge-offs/(recoveries) to average loans  |  0.04  |  %  |  0.36  |  %  |  0.01  |  %  |  (0.04  |  )%  |  (0.09  |  )%   \nNonperforming loans to total loans  |  1.58  |  %  |  0.95  |  %  |  0.26  |  %  |  0.32  |  %  |  0.35  |  %   \nNonperforming assets to total assets  |  1.18  |  %  |  0.63  |  %  |  0.17  |  %  |  0.22  |  %  |  0.23  |  %   \nAllowance for credit losses on loans to total loans  |  1.29  |  %  |  1.31  |  %  |  1.31  |  %  |  1.30  |  %  |  1.39  |  %   \nAllowance for credit losses on loans to nonperforming loans  |  82  |  %  |  139  |  %  |  498  |  %  |  410  |  %  |  403  |  %   \n  \nFor the third quarter of 2024, the Company had net charge-offs of $0.3 million, compared to net charge-offs of $2.5 million for the second quarter of 2024 and net recoveries of $0.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in net charge-offs was driven by a $2.6 million charge-off of one commercial and industrial loan in the second quarter of 2024. \n\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $1.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a provision for credit losses of $4.5 million for the second quarter of 2024 and no provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2023. The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by loan growth and an increase in nonaccrual loans. \n\nThe unearned fair value adjustments on the acquired Metro Phoenix Bank loan portfolio were $3.8 million as of September 30, 2024, $5.2 million as of December 31, 2023, and $5.5 million as of September 30, 2023. \n\n**_Capital_ **\n\nTotal stockholders’ equity was $386.5 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $17.4 million from December 31, 2023. This change was primarily driven by an improvement in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $10.2 million and an increase in retained earnings of $6.2 million. Tangible book value per common share (non-GAAP) increased to $16.50 as of September 30, 2024, from $15.46 as of December 31, 2023. Tangible common equity to tangible assets (non-GAAP) increased to 8.11% as of September 30, 2024, from 7.94% as of December 31, 2023. Common equity tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets decreased to 11.12% as of September 30, 2024, from 11.82% as of December 31, 2023. \n\nThe following table presents our capital ratios as of the dates indicated: \n\n**September 30,** |  **December 31,** |  **September 30,**  \n---|---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2023**  \n**Capital Ratios(1) **  \n_Alerus Financial Corporation Consolidated_  \nCommon equity tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets  |  11.12  |  %  |  11.82  |  %  |  13.01  |  %   \nTier 1 capital to risk weighted assets  |  11.38  |  %  |  12.10  |  %  |  13.30  |  %   \nTotal capital to risk weighted assets  |  14.04  |  %  |  14.76  |  %  |  16.10  |  %   \nTier 1 capital to average assets  |  9.30  |  %  |  10.57  |  %  |  11.14  |  %   \nTangible common equity / tangible assets (2) |  8.11  |  %  |  7.94  |  %  |  7.47  |  %   \n_Alerus Financial, N.A._  \nCommon equity tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets  |  10.73  |  %  |  11.40  |  %  |  12.68  |  %   \nTier 1 capital to risk weighted assets  |  10.73  |  %  |  11.40  |  %  |  12.68  |  %   \nTotal capital to risk weighted assets  |  11.98  |  %  |  12.51  |  %  |  13.86  |  %   \nTier 1 capital to average assets  |  8.90  |  %  |  9.92  |  %  |  10.72  |  %   \n  \n_______________  \n---  \n(1)  |  Capital ratios for the current quarter are to be considered preliminary until the Call Report for Alerus Financial, N.A. is filed.   \n(2)  |  Represents a non-GAAP financial measure.

These non-GAAP financial measures include the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, adjusted tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible common equity, efficiency ratio, pre-provision net revenue, adjusted noninterest income, adjusted noninterest expense, adjusted pre-provision net revenue, adjusted efficiency ratio, adjusted net income, adjusted return on average assets, adjusted return on average tangible common equity, net interest margin (tax-equivalent), adjusted net interest margin (tax-equivalent), and adjusted earnings per common share - diluted. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of its performance, and believes financial analysts and investors frequently use these measures, and other similar measures, to evaluate capital adequacy and financial performance. Reconciliations of non-GAAP disclosures used in this press release to the comparable GAAP measures are provided in the accompanying tables. Management, banking regulators, many financial analysts and other investors use these measures in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, which typically stem from the use of the purchase accounting method of accounting for mergers and acquisitions. \n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total stockholders’ equity, total assets, book value per share, return on average assets, return on average equity, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which the Company calculates these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. \n\n**_Forward-Looking Statements_ **\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements concerning plans, estimates, calculations, forecasts and projections with respect to the anticipated future performance of Alerus Financial Corporation. These statements are often, but not always, identified by words such as “may”, “might”, “should”, “could”, “predict”, “potential”, “believe”, “expect”, “continue”, “will”, “anticipate”, “seek”, “estimate”, “intend”, “plan”, “projection”, “would”, “annualized”, “target” and “outlook”, or the negative version of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements the Company makes regarding our projected growth, anticipated future financial performance, financial condition, credit quality, management’s long-term performance goals and the future plans and prospects of Alerus Financial Corporation. \n\nForward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: interest rate risk, including the effects of changes in interest rates; our ability to successfully manage credit risk and maintain an adequate level of allowance for credit losses; new or revised accounting standards; business and economic conditions generally and in the financial services industry, nationally and within our market areas, including the level and impact of inflation and possible recession; the effects of recent developments and events in the financial services industry, including the large-scale deposit withdrawals over a short period of time that resulted in recent bank failures; our ability to raise additional capital to implement our business plan; the overall health of the local and national real estate market; concentrations within our loan portfolio; the concentration of large loans to certain borrowers; our ability to successfully manage credit risk; the level of nonperforming assets on our balance sheet; our ability to implement our organic and acquisition growth strategies, including the integration of HMNF which the Company acquired in the fourth quarter of 2024; the impact of economic or market conditions on our fee-based services; our ability to continue to grow our retirement and benefit services business; our ability to continue to originate a sufficient volume of residential mortgages; the occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of our or our third-party vendors’ information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents, including as a result of sophisticated attacks using artificial intelligence and similar tools; interruptions involving our information technology and telecommunications systems or third-party servicers; potential losses incurred in connection with mortgage loan repurchases; the composition of our executive management team and our ability to attract and retain key personnel; rapid technological change in the financial services industry; increased competition in the financial services industry, including from non-banks such as credit unions, Fintech companies and digital asset service providers; our ability to successfully manage liquidity risk, including our need to access higher cost sources of funds such as fed funds purchased and short-term borrowings; the concentration of large deposits from certain clients, including those who have balances above current FDIC insurance limits; the effectiveness of our risk management framework; the commencement and outcome of litigation and other legal proceedings and regulatory actions against us or to which the Company may become subject; potential impairment to the goodwill the Company recorded in connection with our past acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Metro Phoenix Bank and HMNF; the extensive regulatory framework that applies to us; the impact of recent and future legislative and regulatory changes, including in response to recent bank failures; fluctuations in the values of the securities held in our securities portfolio, including as a result of changes in interest rates; governmental monetary, trade and fiscal policies; risks related to climate change and the negative impact it may have on our customers and their businesses; severe weather, natural disasters, widespread disease or pandemics; acts of war or terrorism, including the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, or other adverse external events; any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; changes to U.S. or state tax laws, regulations and guidance; potential changes in federal policy and at regulatory agencies as a result of the upcoming 2024 presidential election; talent and labor shortages and employee turnover; our success at managing the risks involved in the foregoing items; and any other risks described in the “Risk Factors” sections of the reports filed by Alerus Financial Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \n\nAny forward-looking statement made by us in this press release is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. \n\n**Alerus Financial Corporation and Subsidiaries** **Consolidated Balance Sheets** _(dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)_\n\n**September 30,** |

Statements (Unaudited)**\n\n**NOTE** ** _1_ Basis of Presentation**\n\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements and notes thereto of the Company have been prepared in accordance with instructions for Form _10_ -Q and, therefore, do _not_ include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, for complete presentation of financial statements. In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the consolidated balance sheets of Alerus Financial Corporation, or the Company, as of  _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , the consolidated statements of income for the _three_ and _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_ , consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the _three_ and _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_ , the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity for the _three_ and _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_ , and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_.\n\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company’s principal operating subsidiary is Alerus Financial, National Association, or the Bank. Certain items previously reported have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s reporting format. Such reclassifications did _not_ affect net income or stockholders’ equity. The results of operations for the interim periods are _not_ necessarily indicative of the results for the full year or any other period. The Company has also evaluated all subsequent events for potential recognition and disclosure through the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form _10_ -Q. These interim unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto as of and for the year ended _December 31, 2023_ , included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form _10_ -K filed with the SEC on _March 8, 2024._\n\n**Emerging Growth Company**\n\nThe Company qualifies as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of _2012,_ or the JOBS Act, and _may_ take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are _not_ emerging growth companies, including, but _not_ limited to, _not_ being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section _404_ of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of _2002,_ or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments _not_ previously approved. In addition, even if the Company complies with the greater obligations of public companies that are _not_ emerging growth companies, the Company _may_ avail itself of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future, so long as the Company is an emerging growth company. The Company will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (_1_) the end of the fiscal year following the _fifth_ anniversary of the date of the _first_ sale of common equity securities under the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-_1,_ which was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on _September 12, 2019; (__2_) the last day of the fiscal year in which the Company has _$1.235_ billion or more in annual revenues; (_3_) the date on which the Company is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the Securities Exchange Act of _1934,_ as amended, or the Exchange Act; or (_4_) the date on which the Company has, during the previous _three_ -year period, issued publicly or privately, more than _$1.0_ billion in non-convertible debt securities. Management cannot predict if investors will find the Company’s common stock less attractive because it will rely on the exemptions available to emerging growth companies. If some investors find the Company’s common stock less attractive as a result, there _may_ be a less active trading market for its common stock and the Company’s stock price _may_ be more volatile. The last year the Company qualifies as an emerging growth company is _2024._\n\nSection _107_ of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section _7_(a)(_2_)(B) of the Securities Act of _1933_ for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As an emerging growth company, the Company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.\n\n**NOTE** ** _2_ Recent Accounting Pronouncements**\n\nThe following Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Updates, or ASUs, are divided into pronouncements which have been adopted by the Company since _January_ _1,_ _2024,_ and those which are _not_ yet effective and have been evaluated or are currently being evaluated by management as of _September 30, 2024_.\n\n**Adopted Pronouncements**\n\nThere have been _no_ new ASUs adopted by the Company since _January 1, 2024._\n\n**Pronouncements _Not_ Yet Effective**\n\nIn _November 2023,_ the FASB issued guidance within ASU _2023_ -_07,_ Segment Reporting (Topic _280_). The amendments in this update are intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures related to significant segment expenses. The amendments do _not_ change how an entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments, and all existing segment disclosure requirements in ASC _280_ and other Codification topics remain unchanged. The amendments in this update are incremental and require public entities that report segment information to disclose, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss as well as other segment items. Annual disclosure of the title and position of the chief operating decision maker and how the reported measures of segment profit or loss are used to assess performance and allocation of resources is also required.\n\nThe amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after _December 15, 2023,_ and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after _December 15, 2024,_ and are applied on a retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact these amendments will have on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n_7_\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\nIn _December 2023,_ the FASB issued ASU _2023_ -_09,_ Income Taxes (Topic _740_): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amendments in this ASU related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures, to improve the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction disclosures. The amendments allow investors to better assess, in their capital allocation decisions, how an entity’s worldwide operations and related tax risks and tax planning and operational opportunities affect its income tax rate and prospects for future cash flows. The other amendments in this ASU improve the effectiveness and comparability of disclosures by adding disclosures of pretax income (or loss) and income tax expense (or benefit) to be consistent with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Regulation S-_X_ _210.4_ -_08_(h), Rules of General Application—General Notes to Financial Statements: Income Tax Expense, and removing disclosures that _no_ longer are considered cost beneficial or relevant. For public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after _December 15, 2024._ Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have _not_ yet been issued or made available for issuance. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a prospective basis. Retrospective application is also permitted.\n\n**NOTE** ** _3_ Business Combinations**\n\nOn _October 9, 2024,_ the Company completed the acquisition of HMN Financial, Inc. (“HMNF”) (Nasdaq: HMNF) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Home Federal Savings Bank (together, “Home Federal”). As a result of the transaction, HMNF merged with and into Alerus Financial Corporation, and Home Federal Savings Bank merged with and into Alerus Financial, National Association. The all-stock transaction was valued at approximately $128.8 million as of closing, based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on _October 8, 2024,_ the trading day immediately preceding the closing of the merger, of $22.90. \n\nFounded in _1934,_ Home Federal had 12 branches in Minnesota and one branch in each of Iowa and Wisconsin. As of _June 30, 2024,_ HMNF had, on a consolidated basis, $1.1 billion in total assets, which included approximately $876.6 million in loans and $199.0 million in investment securities, as well as $983.2 million in total deposits.\n\nThe transaction expanded the Company’s franchise into Rochester, Minnesota and represents the largest bank acquisition in the Company’s history. The Company’s acquisition of Home Federal is expected to provide earnings benefit, growth potential, synergies and economies of scale arising from the combination of Home Federal with the Company. With the addition of Home Federal, based on _June 30, 2024_ amounts, the Company now has approximately $5.5 billion in total assets, $3.8 billion in total loans, $4.3 billion in total deposits, and $43.6 billion in assets under administration/management, with 29 locations across the Midwest, as well as Arizona.\n\nThe Company is in the process of determining the value of the acquired assets and liabilities, and, therefore, _no_ estimated fair value adjustments are available as of _October 31, 2024_.\n\nAs a result of the transaction, stockholders of HMNF received 1.25 shares of the Company’s common stock for each share of HMNF common stock, resulting in the issuance of 5,547,658 shares of the Company’s common stock. The merger was structured to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for HMNF’s stockholders. Following the transaction, former stockholders of HMNF now hold approximately 21.9% of the Company’s outstanding common stock.\n\nDuring the _three_ and _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ , the Company incurred $1.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively, in pre-tax acquisition expenses related to the acquisition of HMNF, comprised of legal and professional fees included in professional fees and assessments expense in the consolidated statements of income. \n\n**NOTE** ** _4_ Investment Securities**\n\nTrading securities are reported on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at fair value. As of _September 30, 2024_ , the fair value of the Company’s trading securities was $2.7 million. There were no trading securities as of _December 31, 2023_. Changes in fair value of trading securities are recorded in other noninterest income on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. These securities are held in a rabbi trust account and invested in mutual funds. The trading securities will be used for future payments associated with the Company’s deferred compensation plan for eligible employees, executives, and directors.\n\nThe following tables present amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, allowance for credit losses, or ACL, and fair value of the available-for-sale, or AFS, investment securities and the amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses and fair value of held-to-maturity, or HTM, securities as of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ :\n\n**September 30, 2024**  \n---  \n**Amortized** |  **Unrealized** |  **Unrealized** |  **Allowance for** |  **Fair**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **Cost** |  **Gains** |  **Losses** |  **Credit Losses** |  **Value**  \nAvailable-for-sale  \nU.S. Treasury and agencies | $| 739| $| 2| $| (2| )| $| —| $| 739  \nMortgage backed securities  \nResidential agency | 488,915| 2| (74,529| )| —| 414,388  \nCommercial | 1,460| —| (59| )| —| 1,401  \nAsset backed securities | 20| —| —| —| 20  \nCorporate bonds | 57,988| —| (8,533| )| —| 49,455  \nTotal available-for-sale investment securities | 549,122| 4| (83,123| )| —| 466,003  \nHeld-to-maturity  \nObligations of state and political agencies | 122,717| —| (9,124| )| 81| 113,593  \nMortgage backed securities  \nResidential agency | 159,333| —| (23,064| )| 56| 136,269  \nTotal held-to-maturity investment securities | 282,050| —| (32,188| )| 137| 249,862  \nTotal investment securities | $| 831,172| $| 4| $| (115,311| )| $| 137| $| 715,865  \n  \n_8_\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\n**December 31, 2023**  \n---  \n**Amortized** |  **Unrealized** |  **Unrealized** |  **Allowance for** |  **Fair**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **Cost** |  **Gains** |  **Losses** |  **Credit Losses** |  **Value**  \nAvailable-for-sale  \nU.S. Treasury and agencies | $| 1,119| $| 4| $| (3| )| —| $| 1,120  \nMortgage backed securities  \nResidential agency | 524,140| 1| (88,547| )| —| 435,594  \nCommercial | 1,476| —| (123| )| —| 1,353  \nAsset backed securities | 26| —| (1| )| —| 25  \nCorporate bonds | 57,993| —| (9,349| )| —| 48,644  \nTotal available-for-sale investment securities | 584,754| 5| (98,023| )| —| 486,736  \nHeld-to-maturity  \nObligations of state and political agencies | 129,603| —| (12,613| )| 114| 116,990  \nMortgage backed securities  \nResidential agency | 170,125| —| (28,498| )| 99| 141,627  \nTotal held-to-maturity investment securities | 299,728| —| (41,111| )| 213| 258,617  \nTotal investment securities | $| 884,482| $| 5| $| (139,134| )| $| 213| $| 745,353  \n  \nThe adequacy of the ACL on investment securities is assessed at the end of each quarter. The Company does _not_ believe that the AFS debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of _September 30, 2024_ represented a credit loss impairment. As of both _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , the gross unrealized loss positions were primarily related to mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government, are widely recognized as “risk free,” and have a long history of _zero_ credit loss. Additionally, there were corporate bonds in gross unrealized loss positions as of both _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ ; however, all such bonds had an investment grade rating as of both _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_. Total gross unrealized losses were attributable to changes in interest rates, relative to when the investment securities were purchased, and _not_ due to the credit quality of the investment securities. The Company does _not_ intend to sell the investment securities that were in an unrealized loss position and it is _not_ more likely than _not_ that the Company will be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which _may_ be at maturity.\n\nThe ACL on HTM debt securities is estimated using relevant information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Using a probability of default and loss given default analysis, the ACL on HTM debt securities was $137 thousand and $213 thousand as of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , respectively. The change in the ACL on HTM debt securities was due to a change in the provision for credit losses, with no charge-offs or recoveries for the _three_ and _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_.\n\nAccrued interest receivable on AFS investment securities and HTM investment securities is recorded in accrued interest receivable and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. As of _September 30, 2024_ , the accrued interest receivable on AFS investment securities and HTM investment securities totaled $1.6 million and $0.9 million, respectively. As of _December 31, 2023_ , the accrued interest receivable on AFS investment securities and HTM investment securities totaled $1.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively.\n\nThe Company had no sales or calls of AFS investment securities for the _three_ and _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_.\n\nThe Company had no sales of HTM investment securities for the _three_ and _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_.\n\nThe following tables present investment securities with gross unrealized losses, for which an ACL was _not_ recorded at _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual investment securities have been in a continuous loss position:\n\n**______September 30, 2024______**  \n---  \n**__Less than 12 Months__** |  **__Over 12 Months__** |  **__Total__**  \n**_Number of_** |  **_Unrealized_** |  **_Fair_** |  **_Unrealized_** |  **_Fair_** |  **_Unrealized_** |  **_Fair_**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **_Holdings_** |  **_Losses_** |  **_Value_** |  **_Losses_** |  **_Value_** |  **_Losses_** |  **_Value_**  \nAvailable-for-sale  \nU.S. Treasury and agencies | 1| $| (2| )| $| 370| $| —| $| —| $| (2| )| $| 370  \nMortgage backed securities  \nResidential agency | 108| —| —| (74,529| )| 414,315| (74,529| )| 414,315  \nCommercial | 1| —| —| (59| )| 1,401| (59| )| 1,401  \nAsset backed securities | 3| —| —| —| 20| —| 20  \nCorporate bonds | 12| —| —| (8,533| )| 49,455| (8,533| )| 49,455  \nTotal available-for-sale investment securities | 125| $| (2| )| $| 370| $| (83,121| )| $| 465,191| $| (83,123| )| $| 465,561  \n**December 31, 2023**  \n---  \n**Less than 12 Months** |  **Over 12 Months** |  **Total**  \n**_Number of_** |  **_Unrealized_** |  **_Fair_** |  **_Unrealized_** |  **_Fair_** |  **_Unrealized_** |  **_Fair_**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **_Holdings_** |  **_Losses_** |  **_Value_** |  **_Losses_** |  **_Value_** |  **_Losses_** |  **_Value_**  \nAvailable-for-sale  \nU.S. Treasury and agencies | 1| $| (3| )| $| 489| $| —| $| —| $| (3| )| $| 489  \nMortgage backed securities  \nResidential agency | 112| —| 43| (88,547| )| 435,505| (88,547| )| 435,548  \nCommercial | 1| —| —| (123| )| 1,353| (123| )| 1,353  \nAsset backed securities | 3| —| —| (1| )| 25| (1| )| 25  \nCorporate bonds | 12| —| —| (9,349| )| 48,644| (9,349| )| 48,644  \nTotal available-for-sale investment securities | 129| $| (3| )| $| 532| $| (98,020| )| $| 485,527| $| (98,023| )| $| 486,059  \n  \n_9_\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\nAs of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , none of the Company’s HTM debt securities were past due or on nonaccrual status.

The Company records these non-marketable equity securities as a component of other assets and periodically evaluates these securities for impairment. Management considers these non-marketable equity securities to be long-term investments. Accordingly, when evaluating these securities for impairment, management considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value.\n\n_Visa Class B Restricted Shares_\n\nIn _2008,_ the Company received Visa Class B restricted shares as part of Visa’s initial public offering. These shares are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into the publicly traded Class A common shares. This conversion will _not_ occur until the settlement of certain litigation which will be indemnified by Visa members, including the Company. Visa funded an escrow account from its initial public offering to settle these litigation claims. Should this escrow account be insufficient to cover these litigation claims, Visa is entitled to fund additional amounts to the escrow account by reducing each member bank’s Class B conversion ratio to unrestricted Class A shares. As of _September 30, 2024_ , the conversion ratio was 1.5875. Based on the existing transfer restriction and the uncertainty of the outcome of the Visa litigation mentioned above, the 6,924 Class B shares (10,992 Class A equivalents) that the Company owned as of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , were carried at a zero cost basis.\n\n_10_\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\n**NOTE** ** _5_ Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses**\n\nThe following table presents total loans outstanding, by portfolio segment, as of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ :\n\n**_September 30,_** |  **_December 31,_**  \n---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **_2024_** |  **_2023_**  \nCommercial  \nCommercial and industrial | $| 606,245| $| 562,180  \nCommercial real estate  \nConstruction, land and development | 173,629| 124,034  \nMultifamily | 275,377| 245,103  \nNon-owner occupied | 686,071| 569,354  \nOwner occupied | 296,366| 271,623  \nTotal commercial real estate | 1,431,443| 1,210,114  \nAgricultural  \nLand | 45,821| 40,832  \nProduction | 39,436| 36,141  \nTotal agricultural | 85,257| 76,973  \nTotal commercial | 2,122,945| 1,849,267  \nConsumer  \nResidential real estate  \nFirst lien | 690,451| 697,900  \nConstruction | 11,808| 28,979  \nHELOC | 134,301| 118,315  \nJunior lien | 36,445| 35,819  \nTotal residential real estate | 873,005| 881,013  \nOther consumer | 36,393| 29,303  \nTotal consumer | 909,398| 910,316  \nTotal loans | $| 3,032,343| $| 2,759,583  \n  \nTotal loans included net deferred loan fees and costs of $601 thousand and $248 thousand at _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , respectively.

on loans at _September 30, 2024_ was $39.1 million, an increase of $3.3 million, or 9.2%, from _December 31, 2023_. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $4.2 million in the provision for credit losses on construction, land and development loans. This increase was primarily due to organic loan growth and an increased reserve related to an individually evaluated construction, land and development loan. This was partially offset by a decreased ACL for commercial and industrial loans and residential real estate (“RRE”) loans. This decrease was primarily driven by a $2.6 million charge-off of _one_ commercial and industrial loan in the _second_ quarter of _2024._\n\n**Credit Concentrations**\n\nThe Company focuses on maintaining a well-balanced and diversified loan portfolio. Despite such efforts, it is recognized that credit concentrations _may_ occasionally emerge as a result of economic conditions, changes in local demand, natural loan growth and runoff. To identify credit concentrations effectively, all commercial and industrial and owner occupied real estate loans are assigned Standard Industrial Classification codes, North American Industry Classification System codes and state and county codes. Property type coding is used for investment real estate. There were  _no_ industry concentrations exceeding _10%_ of the Company’s total loan portfolio as of _September 30, 2024_.\n\n**Credit Quality Indicators**\n\nThe Company’s consumer loan portfolio is primarily comprised of secured loans that are evaluated at origination on a centralized basis against standardized underwriting criteria. The Company generally does _not_ risk rate consumer loans unless a default event such as bankruptcy or extended nonperformance takes place. Credit quality for the consumer loan portfolio is measured by delinquency rates, nonaccrual amounts and actual losses incurred. These loans are rated as either performing or nonperforming.\n\nThe Company assigns a risk rating to all commercial loans, except pools of homogeneous loans, and performs detailed internal and external reviews of risk rated loans over a certain threshold to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of the portfolio. These risk ratings are also subject to examination by the Company’s regulators. During the internal reviews, management monitors and analyzes the financial condition of borrowers and guarantors, trends in the industries in which the borrowers operate and the estimated fair values of collateral securing the loans. These credit quality indicators are used to assign a risk rating to each individual loan.\n\nThe Company’s ratings are aligned to pass and criticized categories. The criticized category includes special mention, substandard, and doubtful risk ratings. The risk ratings are defined as follows:\n\n● |  _Pass:_ A pass loan is a credit with _no_ existing or known potential weaknesses deserving of management’s close attention.  \n---|---  \n● |  _Special Mention:_ Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses _may_ result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or in the Company’s credit position at some future date. Special mention loans are _not_ adversely classified and do _not_ expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.  \n---|---  \n● |  _Substandard:_ Loans classified as substandard are _not_ adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well‑defined weakness, or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are _not_ corrected.  \n---|---  \n● |  _Doubtful:_ Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or repayment in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.  \n---|---  \n● |  _Loss:_ Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and charged off immediately.  \n---|---  \n

A loan is placed on nonaccrual status when the financial condition of the borrower is deteriorating, payment in full of both principal and interest is _not_ expected as scheduled or principal or interest has been in default for _90_ days or more. Exceptions _may_ be made if the asset is secured by collateral sufficient to satisfy both the principal and accrued interest in full and collection is reasonably assured. When _one_ loan to a borrower is placed on nonaccrual status, all other loans to the borrower are re-evaluated to determine if they should also be placed on nonaccrual status. All previously accrued and unpaid interest is reversed at that time. A loan will return to accrual when collection of principal and interest is assured and the borrower has demonstrated timely payments of principal and interest for a reasonable period, generally at least _six_ months.\n\nThe following tables present a past due aging analysis of total loans outstanding, by portfolio segment, as of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ :\n\n**______September 30, 2024______**  \n---  \n**_90 Days_**  \n**_Accruing_** |  **_30 - 59 Days_** |  **_60 - 89 Days_** |  **_or More_** |  **_Total_**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **_Current_** |  **_Past Due_** |  **_Past Due_** |  **_Past Due_** |  **_Nonaccrual_** |  **_Loans_**  \nCommercial  \nCommercial and industrial | $| 600,976| $| 1,807| $| 397| $| —| $| 3,065| $| 606,245  \nCommercial real estate  \nConstruction, land and development | 148,624| —| —| —| 25,005| 173,629  \nMultifamily | 275,377| —| —| —| —| 275,377  \nNon-owner occupied | 677,266| 3,588| —| —| 5,217| 686,071  \nOwner occupied | 293,851| 3| —| —| 2,512| 296,366  \nTotal commercial real estate | 1,395,118| 3,591| —| —| 32,734| 1,431,443  \nAgricultural  \nLand | 45,821| —| —| —| —| 45,821  \nProduction | 39,366| —| —| —| 70| 39,436  \nTotal agricultural | 85,187| —| —| —| 70| 85,257  \nTotal commercial | 2,081,281| 5,398| 397| —| 35,869| 2,122,945  \nConsumer  \nResidential real estate  \nFirst lien | 687,874| 151| 478| —| 1,948| 690,451  \nConstruction | 7,128| —| —| —| 4,680| 11,808  \nHELOC | 132,077| 655| 81| —| 1,488| 134,301  \nJunior lien | 32,653| 17| 24| —| 3,751| 36,445  \nTotal residential real estate | 859,732| 823| 583| —| 11,867| 873,005  \nOther consumer | 36,007| 88| 8| —| 290| 36,393  \nTotal consumer | 895,739| 911| 591| —| 12,157| 909,398  \nTotal | $| 2,977,020| $| 6,309| $| 988| $| —| $| 48,026| $| 3,032,343  \n**December 31, 2023**  \n---  \n**90 Days**  \n**_Accruing_** |  **_30 - 59 Days_** |  **_60 - 89 Days_** |  **_or More_** |  **_Total_**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **_Current_** |  **_Past Due_** |  **_Past Due_** |  **_Past Due_** |  **_Nonaccrual_** |  **_Loans_**  \nCommercial  \nCommercial and industrial | $| 554,602| $| 844| $| —| $| 139| $| 6,595| $| 562,180  \nCommercial real estate  \nConstruction, land and development | 124,034| —| —| —| —| 124,034  \nMultifamily | 245,103| —| —| —| —| 245,103  \nNon-owner occupied | 569,267| 87| —| —| —| 569,354  \nOwner occupied | 270,467| 41| —| —| 1,115| 271,623  \nTotal commercial real estate | 1,208,871| 128| —| —| 1,115| 1,210,114  \nAgricultural  \nLand | 40,832| —| —| —| —| 40,832  \nProduction | 36,061| 80| —| —| —| 36,141  \nTotal agricultural | 76,893| 80| —| —| —| 76,973  \nTotal commercial | 1,840,366| 1,052| —| 139| 7,710| 1,849,267  \nConsumer  \nResidential real estate  \nFirst lien | 695,807| 901| 554| —| 638| 697,900  \nConstruction | 28,979| —| —| —| —| 28,979  \nHELOC | 117,540| 597| —| —| 178| 118,315  \nJunior lien | 35,680| 69| —| —| 70| 35,819  \nTotal residential real estate | 878,006| 1,567| 554| —| 886| 881,013  \nOther consumer | 29,086| 170| 47| —| —| 29,303  \nTotal consumer | 907,092| 1,737| 601| —| 886| 910,316  \nTotal | $| 2,747,458| $| 2,789| $| 601| $| 139| $| 8,596| $| 2,759,583  \n  \n_17_\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\nIn calculating expected credit losses, the Company includes loans on nonaccrual status and loans _90_ days or more past due and still accruing.

The following table presents the classification of the Company’s right-of-use, or ROU, assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated financial statements as of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ :\n\n**_September 30,_** |  **_December 31,_**  \n---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **_2024_** |  **_2023_**  \n**Lease Right-of-Use Assets** |  **_Classification_**  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets |  _Operating lease right-of-use assets_ | $| 9,268| $| 5,436  \n**Lease Liabilities**  \nOperating lease liabilities |  _Operating lease liabilities_ | $| 9,643| $| 5,751  \n  \nThe calculated amount of the ROU assets and lease liabilities in the table above are impacted by the length of the lease term and the discount rate used to present value the minimum lease payments. The Company’s lease agreements often include _one_ or more options to renew at the Company’s discretion. If at lease inception the Company considers the exercising of a renewal option to be reasonably certain, the Company will include the extended term in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. The Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, on a collateralized basis, over a similar term for the discount rate. For the Company’s only finance lease, the Company utilized its incremental borrowing rate at lease inception.\n\n**_September 30,_** |  **_December 31,_**  \n---|---  \n**_2024_** |  **_2023_**  \n**Weighted-average remaining lease term, years**  \nOperating leases | 12.1| 7.3  \n**Weighted-average discount rate**  \nOperating leases | 4.47| %| 3.9| %  \n  \nAs the Company elected, for all classes of underlying assets, _not_ to separate lease and non‑lease components and instead to account for them as a single lease component, the variable lease cost primarily represents variable payments such as common area maintenance and utilities. Variable lease cost also includes payments for usage or maintenance of those capitalized equipment operating leases.\n\n_21_\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\nThe following table presents lease costs and other lease information for the _three_ and _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_ :\n\n**__Three months ended__** |  **__Nine Months Ended__**  \n---|---  \n**__September 30,__** |  **__September 30,__**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **_2024_** |  **_2023_** |  **_2024_** |  **_2023_**  \nLease costs  \nOperating lease cost | $| 500| $| 503| $| 1,404| $| 1,438  \nVariable lease cost | 269| 219| 741| 918  \nShort-term lease cost | 54| 46| 158| 128  \nFinance lease cost  \nInterest on lease liabilities | —| —| —| —  \nAmortization of right-of-use assets | —| —| —| —  \nSublease income | (47| )| (50| )| (146| )| (169| )  \nNet lease cost | $| 776| $| 718| $| 2,157| $| 2,315  \nOther information  \nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities operating cash flows from operating leases | $| 549| $| 499| $| 1,469| $| 1,275  \nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities | 5,136| (1,240| )| 5,244| 1,938  \n  \nFuture minimum payments for finance and operating leases with initial or remaining terms of _one_ year or more as of _September 30, 2024_ were as follows:\n\n**_Operating_**  \n---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **_Leases_**  \nTwelve months ended  \nSeptember 30, 2025 | $| 1,747  \nSeptember 30, 2026 | 1,574  \nSeptember 30, 2027 | 1,470  \nSeptember 30, 2028 | 970  \nSeptember 30, 2029 | 758  \nThereafter | 8,309  \nTotal future minimum lease payments | $| 14,828  \nAmounts representing interest | (5,185| )  \nTotal operating lease liabilities | $| 9,643  \n  \n**NOTE** ** _10_ Deposits**\n\nThe components of deposits in the consolidated balance sheets as of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ were as follows:\n\n**_September 30,_** |  **_December 31,_**  \n---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **_2024_** |  **_2023_**  \nNoninterest-bearing | $| 657,547| $| 728,082  \nInterest-bearing  \nInterest-bearing demand | 1,034,694| 840,711  \nSavings accounts | 75,675| 82,485  \nMoney market savings | 1,067,187| 1,032,771  \nTime deposits | 488,447| 411,562  \nTotal interest-bearing | 2,666,003| 2,367,529  \nTotal deposits | $| 3,323,550| $| 3,095,611  \n  \nCertificates of deposit in excess of _$250,000_ totaled $170.9 million and $121.8 million at _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , respectively.\n\n**NOTE** ** _11_ Short**‑**Term Borrowings**\n\nShort-term borrowings at _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ consisted of the following:\n\n**_September 30,_** |  **_December 31,_**  \n---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **_2024_** |  **_2023_**  \nFed funds purchased | $ | 44,700 | $ | 114,170  \nFHLB short-term advances | 200,000 | 200,000  \nTotal | $ | 244,700 | $ | 314,170  \n  \n_22_\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\n**NOTE** ** _12_ Long**‑**Term Debt**\n\nLong‑term debt as of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ consisted of the following:\n\n**______September 30, 2024______**  \n---  \n**_Period End_**  \n**_Face_** |  **_Carrying_** |  **_Interest_** |  **_Maturity_**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **_Value_** |  **_Value_** |  **Interest Rate** |  **_Rate_** |  **_Date_** |  **_Call Date_**  \nSubordinated notes payable | $| 50,000| $| 50,000|  _Fixed_ | 3.50| %|  _3/30/2031_ |  _3/31/2026_  \nJunior subordinated debenture (Trust I) | 4,124| 3,616|  _Three-month CME SOFR + 0.26% + 3.10%_ | 8.02| %|  _6/26/2033_ |  _6/26/2008_  \nJunior subordinated debenture (Trust II) | 6,186| 5,425|  _Three-month CME SOFR + 0.26% + 1.80%_ | 7.01| %|  _9/15/2036_ |  _9/15/2011_  \nTotal long-term debt | $| 60,310| $| 59,041  \n**December 31, 2023**  \n---  \n**Period End**  \n**_Face_** |  **_Carrying_** |  **_Interest_** |  **_Maturity_**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **_Value_** |  **_Value_** |  **Interest** **Rate** |  **_Rate_** |  **_Date_** |  **Call** **Date**  \nSubordinated notes payable | $| 50,000| $| 50,000|  _Fixed_ | 3.50| %|  _3/30/2031_ |  _3/31/2026_  \nJunior subordinated debenture (Trust I) | 4,124| 3,583|  _Three-month CME SOFR + 0.26% + 3.10%_ | 8.72| %|  _6/26/2033_ |  _6/26/2008_  \nJunior subordinated debenture (Trust II) | 6,186| 5,373|  _Three-month CME SOFR + 0.26% + 1.80%_ | 7.45| %|  _9/15/2036_ |  _9/15/2011_  \nTotal long-term debt | $| 60,310| $| 58,956  \n  \n**NOTE** ** _13_ Commitments and Contingencies**\n\n**Commitments**\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company has outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which are _not_ included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making such commitments as it does for instruments that are included in the statements of financial condition.\n\nA summary of the contractual amounts of the Company’s exposure to off-balance sheet risk as of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , respectively, was as follows:\n\n**_September 30,_** |  **_December 31,_**  \n---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **_2024_** |  **_2023_**  \nCommitments to extend credit | $| 927,235| $| 942,413  \nStandby letters of credit | 11,231| 10,045  \nTotal | $| 938,466| $| 952,458  \n  \nThe Company establishes an ACL on unfunded commitments, except those that are unconditionally cancellable by the Company. As of both  _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , the ACL on unfunded commitments was $7.4 million. The ACL on unfunded commitments was presented within accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. For the _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_ , the provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments was $31 thousand and $44 thousand, respectively.\n\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a client as long as there is _no_ violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses, and _may_ require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do _not_ necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each client’s creditworthiness on a case by case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but _may_ include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, and income producing commercial properties.\n\nThe Company was _not_ required to perform on any financial guarantees and did _not_ incur any losses on its commitments during the past _two_ years.\n\nThe Company utilizes standby letters of credit issued by either the FHLB or the Bank of North Dakota to secure public unit deposits. The Company had no letters of credit outstanding with the FHLB as of _September 30, 2024_ or _December 31, 2023_. With the Bank of North Dakota, the Company had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $150.0 million and $182.0 million as of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , respectively. Letters of credit with the Bank of North Dakota were collateralized by loans pledged to the Bank of North Dakota in the amount of $469.1 million and $454.6 million as of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , respectively.\n\n_23_\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\n**Legal Contingencies**\n\nIn the normal course of business, including in connection with business combinations pursued by the Company, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to pending and threatened litigation, claims investigations and legal and administrative cases and proceedings. Although the Company is _not_ able to predict the outcome of such actions, after reviewing pending and threatened actions with counsel, management believes that, based on the information currently available, the outcome of such actions, individually or in the aggregate, will _not_ have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\nReserves are established for legal claims only when losses associated with the claims are judged to be probable, and the loss can be reasonably estimated. Assessments of litigation exposure are difficult because they involve inherently unpredictable factors including, but _not_ limited to: whether the proceeding is in the early stages; whether damages are unspecified, unsupported or uncertain; whether there is a potential for punitive or other pecuniary damages; whether the matter involves legal uncertainties, including novel issues of law; whether the matter involves multiple parties and/or jurisdictions; whether discovery has begun or is _not_ complete; whether meaningful settlement discussions have commenced; and whether the lawsuit involves class allegations. In many lawsuits and arbitrations, it is _not_ possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the case is close to resolution, in which case a reserve will _not_ be recognized until that time. Assessments of class action litigation, which is generally more complex than other types of litigation, are particularly difficult, especially in the early stages of the proceeding when it is _not_ known whether a class will be certified or how a potential class, if certified, will be defined. As a result, the Company _may_ be unable to estimate reasonably possible losses with respect to every litigation matter it faces.\n\nThe Company did _not_ have any material loss contingencies that were provided for and/or that were required to be disclosed as of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , respectively.\n\n**NOTE** ** _14_ Share-Based Compensation**\n\nOn _May_ _6,_ _2019,_ the Company’s stockholders approved the Alerus Financial Corporation _2019_ Equity Incentive Plan. This plan allows the compensation committee the ability to grant a wide variety of equity awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and cash incentive awards in such forms and amounts as it deems appropriate to accomplish the goals of the plan. Since inception, all awards issued under the plan have been restricted stock and restricted stock units. Any shares subject to an award that is cancelled, forfeited, or expires prior to exercise or realization, either in full or in part, shall again become available for issuance under the plan. However, shares subject to an award shall _not_ again be made available for issuance or delivery under the plan if such shares are (a) tendered in payment of the exercise price of a stock option, (b) delivered to, or withheld by, the Company to satisfy any tax withholding obligation, or (c) covered by a stock-settled stock appreciation right or other awards that were _not_ issued upon the settlement of the award. Restricted stock units issued do _not_ participate in dividends and recipients are _not_ entitled to vote these restricted stock units until shares of the Company’s common stock are delivered after vesting of the restricted stock units. Shares vest, become exercisable and contain such other terms and conditions as determined by the compensation committee and set forth in individual agreements with the participant receiving the award. Awards issued to Company directors are _not_ subject to any service requirements and vest immediately. The plan authorizes the issuance of up to 1,100,000 shares of common stock. As of _September 30, 2024_ , 669,332 shares of common stock are still available for issuance under the plan.\n\nThe compensation expense relating to awards under these plans was $488 thousand and $377 thousand for the _three_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_ , respectively. The compensation expense relating to awards under these plans was $1.2 million for both the _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_.\n\nThe following table presents the activity in the stock plans for the _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_ :\n\n**____Nine Months Ended September 30,____**  \n---  \n**__2024__** |  **__2023__**  \n**_Weighted-_** |  **_Weighted-_**  \n**_Average Grant_** |  **_Average Grant_**  \n**_Awards_** |  **_Date Fair Value_** |  **_Awards_** |  **_Date Fair Value_**  \nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Awards  \nOutstanding at beginning of period | 231,657| $| 22.96| 238,929| $| 23.66  \nGranted | 108,561| 20.93| 115,174| 20.00  \nVested | (55,429| )| 23.87| (93,767| )| 21.34  \nForfeited or cancelled | —| —| (26,840| )| 21.33  \nOutstanding at end of period | 284,789| $| 22.00| 233,496| $| 23.05  \n  \nAs of _September 30, 2024_ , there was $3.1 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested awards granted under the plans.

The Company’s chief operating decision maker is the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Reportable segments are determined based on the services offered, the significance of the services offered, the significance of those services to the Company’s financial statements, and management’s regular review of the operating results of those services. The Company currently operates through three operating segments: Banking, Retirement and Benefit Services, and Wealth Management. In prior periods, the Company had a _fourth_ operating segment, Mortgage.

The Company manages these risks as part of its overall asset and liability management process and through its policies and procedures. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually require little or _no_ initial net investment and result in _one_ party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a notional amount and an underlying as specified in the contract.\n\nDerivatives are often measured in terms of notional amount, but this amount is generally _not_ exchanged, and it is _not_ recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The notional amount is the basis to which the underlying is applied to determine required payments under the derivative contract. The underlying is a referenced interest rate, security price, credit spread, or other index. Residential and commercial real estate loan commitments associated with loans to be sold also qualify as derivative instruments.\n\n**Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments**\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity and credit risk. Certain hedging relationships are formally designated and qualify for hedge accounting under GAAP. On the date the Company enters into a derivative contract designated as a hedging instrument, the derivative is designated as either a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. When a derivative is designated as a fair value, cash flow, or net investment hedge, the Company performs an assessment, at inception and, at a minimum, quarterly thereafter, to determine the effectiveness of the derivative in offsetting changes in the value or cash flows of the hedged item(s). As of _September 30, 2024_ , the Company only used fair value and cash flow hedges.\n\n_27_\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\n_Fair value hedges:_ These derivatives are interest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge the change in fair value related to interest rate changes of its underlying mortgage-backed investment securities and mortgage loan pools. The interest rate swaps are carried on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value in other assets (when the fair value is positive) or in accrued expenses and other liabilities (when the fair value is negative). The changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in interest income. The unrealized gains or losses due to changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps due to changes in benchmark interest rates are recorded as an adjustment to the hedged instruments and offset in the same interest income line items.\n\n_Cash flow hedges:_ These derivatives are interest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge the variability of expected future cash flows due to market interest changes. The interest rate swap is carried on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at its fair value in other assets (when the fair value is positive) or in accrued expenses and other liabilities (when the fair value is negative). Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), or OCI, until the cash flows of the hedged items are realized. If a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is terminated or ceases to be highly effective, the gain or loss in OCI is amortized to earnings over the period the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings. If a hedged forecasted transaction is _no_ longer probable, hedge accounting is ceased and any gain or loss included in OCI is reported in earnings immediately, unless the forecasted transaction is at least reasonably possible of occurring, whereby the amounts remain within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), or AOCI. The Company estimates that an additional $0.1 million will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense over the next _12_ months. All cash flow hedges were highly effective for the _three_ and _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_. As of _September 30, 2024_ , the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 16 months.\n\n**Derivatives _Not_ Designated as Hedging Instruments**\n\n_Interest rate swaps:_ The Company periodically enters into commercial loan interest rate swap agreements in order to provide commercial loan customers with the ability to convert from variable to fixed interest rates. These derivative contracts relate to transactions in which the Company enters into an interest rate swap with a customer, while simultaneously entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with an institutional counterparty.\n\n_Interest rate lock commitments, forward loan sales commitments and to be announced (TBA) mortgage backed securities:_ The Company enters into forward delivery contracts to sell mortgage loans at specific prices and dates in order to hedge the interest rate risk in its portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale and its residential mortgage interest rate lock commitments.\n\nThe following table presents the total notional amounts and gross fair values of the Company’s derivatives as of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ :\n\n**Derivative

These requirements are dependent on certain specified credit measures. The amount of collateral posted with _third_ parties was $0.8 million and $0.6 million as of  _September 30, 2024_ and  _December 31, 2023_ , respectively. The amount of collateral posted with _third_ parties was deemed to be sufficient as of those dates to collateralize both the fair market value change as well as any additional amounts that _may_ be required as a result of a change in the specified credit measures.\n\n**Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features**\n\nBy using derivatives, the Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent that counterparties to the derivative contracts do _not_ perform as required. Should a counterparty fail to perform under the terms of a derivative contract, the Company’s credit exposure on interest rate swaps is limited to the net positive fair value and accrued interest of all swaps with each counterparty. The Company seeks to minimize counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. As such, management believes the risk of incurring credit losses on derivative contracts with institutional counterparties is remote.\n\nThe Company has agreements with its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where, if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including defaults where repayment of the indebtedness has _not_ been accelerated by the lender, the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. In addition, the Company also has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where, if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well-capitalized institution, the counterparty could terminate the derivative position(s) and the Company could be required to settle its obligations under the agreements.\n\n_30_\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\nAs of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, which included accrued interest but excluded any adjustment for non-performance risk, related to these agreements was $1.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively.

The Company and the Bank are subject to the rules of the Basel III regulatory capital framework and related Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act rules. The rules include a _2.5_ percent capital conservation buffer that is added to the minimum requirements for capital adequacy purposes. A banking organization with a conservation buffer of less than the required amount will be subject to the limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. As of _September 30, 2024_ , the capital ratios for the Company and the Bank were sufficient to meet the conservation buffer. In addition, the Company must adhere to various U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, regulatory guidelines including required minimum capital and liquidity to maintain their Federal Housing Administration approval status. Failure to comply with the HUD guidelines could result in withdrawal of this certification. As of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , the Company was in compliance with the aforementioned guidelines.\n\n_32_\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\n**NOTE** ** _21_ Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)**\n\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of the changes in the components of other comprehensive income and loss for the periods indicated, including the amount of tax (expense) benefit allocated to each component:\n\n**______For the Three Months Ended______**  \n---  \n**___September 30, 2024___** |  **___September 30, 2023___**  \n**_Tax_** |  **_Tax_**  \n**_Pre-Tax_** |  **_(Expense)_** |  **_After-Tax_** |  **_Pre-Tax_** |  **_(Expense)_** |  **_After-Tax_**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **_Amount_** |  **_Benefit_** |  **_Amount_** |  **_Amount_** |  **_Benefit_** |  **_Amount_**  \n**Debt Securities:**  \nChange in fair value | $ | 19,497 | $ | (4,894 | ) | $ | 14,603 | $ | (19,075 | ) | $ | 4,789 | $ | (14,286 | )  \nLess: reclassification adjustment from amortization of securities transferred from AFS to HTM (1) | 66 | (16 | ) | 50 | 80 | (20 | ) | 60  \nLess: reclassification adjustment for net realized losses (2) | — | — | — | — | — | —  \nNet change | 19,431 | (4,878 | ) | 14,553 | (19,155 | ) | 4,809 | (14,346 | )  \n**Cash Flow Hedges:**  \nChange in fair value | (616 | ) | 706 | 90 | 1,216 | (305 | ) | 911  \nLess: reclassified AOCI gain (loss) into interest expense (3) | 253 | (64 | ) | 189 | 205 | (51 | ) | 154  \nNet change | (869 | ) | 770 | (99 | ) | 1,011 | (254 | ) | 757  \n**Other Derivatives:**  \nChange in fair value | (3,068 | ) | 219 | (2,849 | ) | 1,133 | (285 | ) | 848  \nLess: reclassified AOCI gain (loss) into interest expense (4) | — | — | — | — | — | —  \nNet change | (3,068 | ) | 219 | (2,849 | ) | 1,133 | (285 | ) | 848  \nOther comprehensive income (loss) | $ | 15,494 | $ | (3,889 | ) | $ | 11,605 | $ | (17,011 | ) | $ | 4,270 | $ | (12,741 | )  \n(_1_) |  Reclassified into taxable and/or exempt from federal income taxes interest income on investment securities on the consolidated statements of income.

The Old Stock Repurchase Program expired on _February 18, 2024._\n\nOn _December 12, 2023,_ the Board of Directors of the Company approved a new stock repurchase program, or the New Stock Repurchase Program, which authorizes the Company to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of its common stock subject to certain limitations and conditions. The New Stock Repurchase Program became effective on _February 18, 2024,_ and will expire on _February 18, 2027._ On _February 18, 2024,_ the New Stock Repurchase Program replaced and superseded the Old Stock Repurchase Program.\n\nThe New Stock Repurchase Program does _not_ obligate the Company to repurchase any shares of its common stock and there is _no_ assurance that the Company will do so. For the _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ , the Company had not repurchased any shares under the Old Stock Repurchase Program or the New Stock Repurchase Program. The Company also repurchases shares to pay withholding taxes on the vesting of restricted stock awards and units.\n\n**NOTE** ** _23_ Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities**\n\nThe Company categorizes its assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value into a _three_ level hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique used to determine estimated fair value. The estimated fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level  _1_) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level  _3_). If the inputs used in the determination of the estimated fair value measurement fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the estimated fair value measurement. Assets and liabilities valued at estimated fair value are categorized based on the following inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:\n\n_Level_  __1__ —Inputs that utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that an entity has the ability to access.\n\n_Level_  __2__ —Inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Estimated fair values for these instruments are estimated using pricing models, quoted prices of investment securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows.\n\n_Level_  __3__ —Inputs that are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company _may_ re‑measure the carrying value of assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis to estimated fair value. Adjustments to estimated fair value usually result when certain assets are impaired. Such assets are written down from their carrying amounts to their estimated fair value.\n\n_34_\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\nProfessional standards allow entities the irrevocable option to elect to measure certain financial instruments and other items at estimated fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement on an instrument‑by‑instrument basis. The Company adopted the policy to value certain financial instruments at estimated fair value. The Company has _not_ elected to measure any existing financial instruments at estimated fair value; however, it _may_ elect to measure newly acquired financial instruments at estimated fair value in the future.\n\n**Recurring Basis**\n\nThe Company uses estimated fair value measurements to record estimated fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine estimated fair value disclosures.\n\nThe following tables present the balances of the assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis as of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ :\n\n**____September 30, 2024____**  \n---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **_Level 1_** |  **_Level 2_** |  **_Level 3_** |  **_Total_**  \nTrading | $| 2,708| $| —| $| —| $| 2,708  \nAvailable-for-sale  \nU.S. treasury and government agencies | —| 739| —| 739  \nMortgage backed securities  \nResidential agency | —| 414,388| —| 414,388  \nCommercial | —| 1,401| —| 1,401  \nAsset backed securities | —| 20| —| 20  \nCorporate bonds | —| 49,455| —| 49,455  \nTotal available-for-sale investment securities | $| —| $| 466,003| $| —| $| 466,003  \nOther assets  \nDerivatives | $| —| $| 12,177| $| —| $| 12,177  \nOther liabilities  \nDerivatives | $| —| $| 13,329| $| —| $| 13,329  \n**____December 31, 2023____**  \n---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **_Level 1_** |  **_Level 2_** |  **_Level 3_** |  **_Total_**  \nAvailable-for-sale  \nU.S. treasury and government agencies | $| —| $| 1,120| $| —| $| 1,120  \nMortgage backed securities  \nResidential agency | —| 435,594| —| 435,594  \nCommercial | —| 1,353| —| 1,353  \nAsset backed securities | —| 25| —| 25  \nCorporate bonds | —| 48,644| —| 48,644  \nTotal available-for-sale investment securities | $| —| $| 486,736| $| —| $| 486,736  \nOther assets  \nDerivatives | $| —| $| 8,512| $| —| $| 8,512  \nOther liabilities  \nDerivatives | $| —| $| 9,180| $| —| $| 9,180  \n  \nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.\n\n**Investment Securities, Trading for Deferred Compensation**\n\nThe fair value of trading securities for deferred compensation is reported using market quoted prices as such securities and underlying securities are actively traded and _no_ valuation adjustments have been applied and therefore are classified as Level _1._\n\n**Investment Securities, Available-for-Sale**\n\nGenerally, debt securities are valued using pricing for similar securities, recently executed transactions, and other pricing models utilizing observable inputs and therefore are classified as Level _2._\n\n**Derivatives**\n\nAll of the Company’s derivatives are traded in over‑the‑counter markets where quoted market prices are _not_ readily available. For these derivatives, estimated fair value is measured using internally developed models that use primarily market observable inputs, such as yield curves and option volatilities, and accordingly, classify as Level  _2._ Examples of Level  _2_ derivatives are basic interest rate swaps and forward contracts.\n\n_35_\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\n**Nonrecurring Basis**\n\nCertain assets are measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets are _not_ measured at estimated fair value on an ongoing basis; however, they are subject to estimated fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment or a change in the amount of previously recognized impairment.\n\nThe estimated fair value of certain assets on a nonrecurring basis as of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ consisted of the following:\n\n**____September 30, 2024____**  \n---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **_Level 1_** |  **_Level 2_** |  **_Level 3_** |  **_Total_**  \nCollateral dependent loans | $| —| $| —| $| 28,930| $| 28,930  \nServicing rights | —| —| 1,874| 1,874  \n**December 31, 2023**  \n---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **Level 1** |  **Level 2** |  **Level 3** |  **Total**  \nCollateral dependent loans | $| —| $| —| $| 3,998| $| 3,998  \nForeclosed assets | —| —| 32| 32  \nServicing rights | —| —| 2,062| 2,062  \n  \n**Loans Held for Sale**\n\nLoans originated and held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. The Company obtains quotes or bids on these loans directly from purchasing financial institutions. Typically, these quotes include a premium on the sale and thus these quotes indicate estimated fair value of the held for sale loans is greater than cost.\n\nImpairment losses for loans held for sale that are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value represent additional net write‑downs during the period to record these loans at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, subsequent to their initial classification as loans held for sale.\n\nThe valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used to measure Level  _3_ estimated fair values as of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , were as follows:\n\n**___September 30, 2024___**  \n---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **_Weighted_**  \n**Asset Type** |  **_Valuation Technique_** |  **_Unobservable Input_** |  **_Fair Value_** |  **_Range_** |  **_Average_**  \nIndividually evaluated |  _Appraisal value_ |  _Property specific adjustment_ | $| 28,930| 10.0| %| 10.0| %  \nServicing rights |  _Discounted cash flows_ |  _Prepayment speed assumptions_ | 1,874| 100 - 847| 169  \n_Discount rate_ | 10.5| %| 10.5| %  \n**___December 31, 2023___**  \n---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **_Weighted_**  \n**Asset Type** |  **_Valuation Technique_** |  **_Unobservable Input_** |  **_Fair Value_** |  **_Range_** |  **_Average_**  \nIndividually evaluated |  _Appraisal value_ |  _Property specific adjustment_ | $| 3,998| 10.0| %| 10.0| %  \nForeclosed assets |  _Appraisal value_ |  Property specific adjustment (1) | 32|  _N/A_|  _N/A_  \nServicing rights |  _Discounted cash flows_ |  _Prepayment speed assumptions_ | 2,062| 85 - 151| 104  \n_Discount rate_ | 11.1| %| 11.1| %  \n(_1_) |  There were no discounts taken on the collateral that comprises the balance of foreclosed assets as of _December 31, 2023_.  \n---|---  \n  \nDisclosure of estimated fair value information about financial instruments, for which it is practicable to estimate that value, is required whether or _not_ recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. In cases in which quoted market prices are _not_ available, estimated fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimate of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived estimated fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases could _not_ be realized in immediate settlement of the instruments. Certain financial instruments, with an estimated fair value that is _not_ practicable to estimate and all non‑financial instruments, are excluded from the disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate estimated fair value amounts presented do _not_ necessarily represent the underlying value of the Company.\n\nThe following disclosures represent financial instruments for which the ending balances, as of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , were _not_ carried at estimated fair value in their entirety on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n**Cash and Cash Equivalents and Accrued Interest**\n\nThe carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate those assets and liabilities estimated fair values.\n\n**Investment Securities, Held-to-Maturity**\n\nThe fair values of debt securities held-to-maturity are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar securities, recently executed transactions and pricing models.\n\n_36_\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\n**Loans**\n\nFor variable‑rate loans that reprice frequently and with _no_ significant change in credit risk, estimated fair values are based on carrying values. The estimated fair values of other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality.\n\n**Bank** ‑**Owned Life Insurance**\n\nBank‑owned life insurance is carried at the amount due upon surrender of the policy, which is also the estimated fair value. This amount was provided by the insurance companies based on the terms of the underlying insurance contract.\n\n**Deposits**\n\nThe estimated fair values of demand deposits are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the consolidated balance sheet date. The estimated fair values of fixed‑rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current incremental interest rates being offered on certificates of deposit to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities of the outstanding certificates of deposit.\n\n**Short** ‑**Term Borrowings and Long** ‑**Term Debt**\n\nFor variable‑rate borrowings that reprice frequently, estimated fair values are based on carrying values. The estimated fair values of fixed‑rate borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on the Company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.\n\n**Off** ‑**Balance Sheet Credit** ‑**Related Commitments**\n\nOff‑balance sheet credit related commitments are generally of short‑term nature. The contract amount of such commitments approximates their estimated fair value since the commitments are comprised primarily of unfunded loan commitments which are generally priced at market at the time of funding.\n\nThe estimated fair values, and related carrying or notional amounts, of the Company’s financial instruments at the dates indicated were as follows:\n\n**_____September 30, 2024_____**  \n---  \n**_Carrying_** |  **____Estimated Fair Value____**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **_Amount_** |  **_Level 1_** |  **_Level 2_** |  **_Level 3_** |  **_Total_**  \n**Financial Assets**  \nCash and cash equivalents | $| 65,975| $| 65,975| $| —| $| —| $| 65,975  \nInvestment securities held-to-maturity | 281,913| —| 249,862| —| 249,862  \nLoans, net | 2,993,201| —| —| 2,864,072| 2,864,072  \nAccrued interest receivable | 16,469| 16,469| —| —| 16,469  \nBank-owned life insurance | 35,793| —| 35,793| —| 35,793  \n**Financial Liabilities**  \nNoninterest-bearing deposits | $| 657,547| $| —| $| 657,547| $| —| $| 657,547  \nInterest-bearing deposits | 2,177,556| —| 2,177,556| —| 2,177,556  \nTime deposits | 488,447| —| 487,291| —| 487,291  \nShort-term borrowings | 244,700| 244,700| —| —| 244,700  \nLong-term debt | 59,041| —| 58,210| —| 58,210  \nAccrued interest payable | 7,636| 7,636| —| —| 7,636  \n**December 31, 2023**  \n---  \n**Carrying** |  **Estimated Fair Value**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **Amount** |  **Level 1** |  **Level 2** |  **Level 3** |  **Total**  \n**Financial Assets**  \nCash and cash equivalents | $| 129,893| $| 129,893| $| —| $| —| $| 129,893  \nInvestment securities held-to-maturity | 299,728| —| 258,617| —| 258,617  \nLoans, net | 2,723,740| —| —| 2,590,535| 2,590,535  \nAccrued interest receivable | 15,700| 15,700| —| —| 15,700  \nBank-owned life insurance | 33,236| —| 33,236| —| 33,236  \n**Financial Liabilities**  \nNoninterest-bearing deposits | $| 728,082| $| —| $| 728,082| $| —| $| 728,082  \nInterest-bearing deposits | 1,955,967| —| 1,955,967| —| 1,955,967  \nTime deposits | 411,562| —| 408,910| —| 408,910  \nShort-term borrowings | 314,170| 314,170| —| —| 314,170  \nLong-term debt | 58,956| —| 57,437| —| 57,437  \nAccrued interest payable | 6,826| 6,826| —| —| 6,826  \n  \n_37_\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\n**[](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_ \"mda\")Item** **2** –**Management** ’**s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations**\n\n**General**\n\n_The following discussion explains the Company_ ’ _s financial condition and results of operations as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023_ _. Annualized results for this interim period may not be indicative of results for the full year or future periods. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes presented elsewhere in this report and the Company_ ’ _s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023_ _, filed with the SEC on March 8, 2024._\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements concerning plans, estimates, calculations, forecasts and projections with respect to the anticipated future performance of Alerus Financial Corporation. These statements are often, but not always, identified by words such as “may,” “might,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “projection,” “would,” “annualized,” “target” and “outlook,” or the negative version of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements the Company makes regarding the Company’s projected growth, anticipated future financial performance, financial condition, credit quality, management’s long-term performance goals and the future plans and prospects of Alerus Financial Corporation.\n\nForward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on the Company’s current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the Company’s business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company’s control. The Company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause the Company’s actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:\n\n● |  interest rate risk, including the effects of changes in interest rates;

The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe Company is a commercial wealth bank and national retirement services provider headquartered in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Through the Company’s subsidiary, Alerus Financial, National Association, the Company provides financial solutions to businesses and consumers through three distinct business lines—banking, retirement and benefit services, and wealth management. These solutions are delivered through a relationship‑oriented primary point of contact along with responsive and client‑friendly technology.\n\nThe Company’s business model produces strong financial performance and a diversified revenue stream, which has helped the Company establish a brand and culture yielding both a loyal client base and passionate and dedicated employees. The Company generates a majority of overall revenue from noninterest income, which is driven primarily by the Company’s retirement and benefit services and wealth management business lines. The remainder of the Company’s revenue consists of net interest income, which the Company derives from offering traditional banking products and services.\n\n39 \n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies**\n\nCritical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgements and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. In preparing the Company’s consolidated financial statements, management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses reported. Actual results could differ materially from our current estimates as a result of changing conditions and future events. Several estimates are particularly critical and are susceptible to significant near term change, including (i) the ACL, including the ACL on investment securities, loans, and unfunded commitments; (ii) goodwill and intangible assets impairment; and (iii) fair value measurements.\n\nThere have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies from those disclosed within its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of the Company’s critical accounting policies.\n\nRefer to “NOTE 2 Recent Accounting Pronouncements” of the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of accounting pronouncements issued but yet to be adopted and implemented.\n\nThe JOBS Act permits the Company an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards affecting public companies. The Company has elected to take advantage of this extended transition period, which means that the financial statements included in this report, as well as any financial statements filed in the future, will not be subject to all new or revised accounting standards generally applicable to public companies for the transition period for so long as the Company remains an emerging growth company or until the Company affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period under the JOBS Act.\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\n**_Business Combination_**\n\nOn October 9, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of HMNF and its wholly owned subsidiary, Home Federal Savings Bank. As a result of the transaction, HMNF merged with and into Alerus Financial Corporation, and Home Federal Savings Bank merged with and into Alerus Financial, National Association. The all-stock transaction was valued at approximately $128.8 million as of closing, based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock October 8, 2024, the trading day immediately preceding the closing of the merger, of $22.90. Former stockholders of HMNF received 1.25 shares of the Company’s common stock for each share of HMNF common stock, resulting in the issuance of 5,547,658 shares of the Company’s common stock. The merger was structured to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for HMNF’s stockholders. Following the transaction, former stockholders of HMNF now hold approximately 21.9% of the Company’s outstanding common stock.\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred $1.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively, in pre-tax acquisition expenses related to the acquisition of HMNF, comprised of legal and professional fees included in professional fees and assessments expense in the consolidated statements of income.\n\n**_Stockholder Dividend_**\n\nOn August 20, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per common share. This dividend was paid on October 11, 2024, to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 13, 2024.\n\n**_Property Sale_**\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to sell its South Fargo branch in Fargo, North Dakota. The completion of the sale of this facility is likely to occur in 2024, and the Company expects to record a gain on the sale upon closing, since the purchase price of $5.1 million is greater than the property’s carrying value of approximately $1.7 million. The Company’s West Fargo, North Dakota branch is listed for sale for $3.8 million and is expected to sell within the next 12 months. At September 30, 2024, the facility included assets with a carrying value of approximately $0.4 million. The Company expects to record a gain on the sale upon closing, as the expected sale price is greater than the property’s carrying value.\n\n40 \n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\n**Operating Results Overview**\n\nThe following table summarizes key financial results as of and for the periods indicated:\n\n**Three months ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30,** |  **June 30,** |  **September 30,** |  **September 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n_(dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data)_ |  **2024** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Performance Ratios**  \nReturn on average total assets | 0.48 | % | 0.58 | % | 0.95 | % | 0.56 | % | 0.93 | %  \nAdjusted return on average total assets (1) | 0.57 | % | 0.65 | % | 0.75 | % | 0.62 | % | 0.85 | %  \nReturn on average common equity | 5.52 | % | 6.76 | % | 10.05 | % | 6.43 | % | 9.79 | %  \nReturn on average tangible common equity (1) | 7.83 | % | 9.40 | % | 13.51 | % | 8.98 | % | 13.27 | %  \nAdjusted return on average tangible common equity (1) | 9.04 | % | 10.30 | % | 10.97 | % | 9.80 | % | 12.27 | %  \nNoninterest income as a % of revenue | 55.72 | % | 53.28 | % | 58.21 | % | 54.10 | % | 54.51 | %  \nNet interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) | 2.23 | % | 2.39 | % | 2.27 | % | 2.31 | % | 2.50 | %  \nAdjusted net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis) (1) | 2.35 | % | 2.47 | % | 2.24 | % | 2.41 | % | 2.46 | %  \nEfficiency ratio (1) | 80.29 | % | 72.50 | % | 73.37 | % | 77.17 | % | 73.57 | %  \nAdjusted efficiency ratio (1) | 77.71 | % | 70.80 | % | 77.03 | % | 75.50 | % | 74.58 | %  \nAverage equity to average assets | 8.73 | % | 8.59 | % | 9.47 | % | 8.73 | % | 9.51 | %  \nNet charge-offs/(recoveries) to average loans | 0.04 | % | 0.36 | % | (0.09 | )% | 0.14 | % | (0.04 | )%  \nDividend payout ratio | 76.92 | % | 64.52 | % | 42.22 | % | 66.29 | % | 43.08 | %  \n**Per Common Share**  \nEarnings (losses) per common share − basic | $ | 0.26 | $ | 0.31 | $ | 0.46 | $ | 0.90 | $ | 1.31  \nEarnings (losses) per common share − diluted | $ | 0.26 | $ | 0.31 | $ | 0.45 | $ | 0.89 | $ | 1.30  \nAdjusted earnings (losses) per common share − diluted (1) | $ | 0.31 | $ | 0.34 | $ | 0.36 | $ | 0.98 | $ | 1.19  \nDividends declared per common share | $ | 0.20 | $ | 0.20 | $ | 0.19 | $ | 0.59 | $ | 0.56  \nBook value per common share | $ | 19.53 | $ | 18.87 | $ | 17.60  \nTangible book value per common share (1) | $ | 16.50 | $ | 15.77 | $ | 14.32  \nAverage common shares outstanding − basic | 19,788 | 19,777 | 19,872 | 19,768 | 19,977  \nAverage common shares outstanding − diluted | 20,075 | 20,050 | 20,095 | 20,037 | 20,193  \n**Other Data**  \nRetirement and benefit services assets under administration/management | $ | 41,249,280 | $ | 39,389,533 | $ | 34,552,569  \nWealth management assets under administration/management | $ | 4,397,505 | $ | 4,172,290 | $ | 3,724,091  \nMortgage originations | $ | 82,388 | $ | 109,254 | $ | 109,637 | $ | 245,743 | $ | 298,626  \n(1) |  Represents a non-GAAP financial measure.

These non-GAAP financial measures include the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, adjusted tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible common equity, efficiency ratio, pre-provision net revenue, adjusted noninterest income, adjusted noninterest expense, adjusted pre-provision net revenue, adjusted efficiency ratio, adjusted net income, adjusted return on average assets, adjusted return on average tangible common equity, net interest margin (tax-equivalent), and adjusted net interest margin (tax-equivalent). Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of its performance, and believes financial analysts and others frequently use these measures, and other similar measures, to evaluate capital adequacy. Management calculates: (i) tangible common equity as total common stockholders’ equity less goodwill and other intangible assets; (ii) adjusted tangible common equity as total common stockholders’ equity less goodwill, other intangible assets, and cash proceeds from BTFP; (iii) tangible book value per common share as tangible common equity divided by shares of common stock outstanding; (iv) tangible assets as total assets, less goodwill and other intangible assets; (v) return on average tangible common equity as net income adjusted for intangible amortization net of tax, divided by average tangible common equity; (vi) efficiency ratio as noninterest expense less intangible amortization expense, divided by net interest income plus noninterest income plus a tax-equivalent adjustment; (vii) pre-provision net revenue as net interest income plus noninterest income less noninterest expense; (viii) adjusted noninterest income as noninterest income less BOLI mortality proceeds less gain on sale of ESOP trustee business less net gain on sale of premises and equipment; (ix) adjusted noninterest expense as noninterest expense less HMNF merger- and acquisition-related expenses less severance and signing bonus; (x) adjusted pre-provision net revenue as net interest income plus adjusted noninterest income less adjusted noninterest expense; (xii) adjusted efficiency ratio as adjusted noninterest expense less intangible amortization expense, divided by net interest income plus adjusted noninterest income plus a tax-equivalent adjustment; (xiii) adjusted net income as net income less adjusted noninterest income items net of tax plus adjusted noninterest expense items net of tax; (xiv) adjusted return on average assets as adjusted net income divided by average total assets; (xv) adjusted return on average tangible common equity as adjusted net income adjusted for intangible amortization net of tax, divided by average tangible common equity; (xvi) adjusted net interest margin (tax equivalent) as net interest income less cash interest income and interest expense related to BTFP and less purchase accounting net accretion, adjusted for tax equivalent related to loans and securities, and adjust interest earning assets less average cash proceeds balance from BTFP and add the change in unearned purchase accounting discount; and (xvii) adjusted earnings per common share - diluted as net income adding back HMNF merger- and acquisition-related expenses adjusted for tax less dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities, divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share.\n\nThe following tables present these non-GAAP financial measures along with the most directly

Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\n**Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations**\n\n**_Net Income_**\n\nNet income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $5.2 million, or $0.26 per diluted common share, a $4.0 million, or 43.2%, decrease compared to $9.2 million, or $0.45 per diluted common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Earnings for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 decreased primarily due to a $5.2 million increase in noninterest expense and $1.7 million increase in provision for credit losses. This negative result was partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in net interest income.\n\nNet income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $17.8 million, or $0.89 per diluted common share, a $8.6 million, or 32.5%, decrease compared to $26.5 million, or $1.30 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 decreased primarily due to an $8.7 million increase in noninterest expense and a $5.6 million increase in provision for credit losses. This negative result was partially offset by a $2.5 million increase in net interest income and a $1.6 million increase in noninterest income.\n\n**_Net Interest Income_**\n\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income and yield related fees earned on assets and interest expense paid on liabilities. Net interest margin is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities as a percentage of interest earning assets. Net interest margin is presented on a tax-equivalent basis, which means that tax-free interest income has been adjusted to a pre-tax-equivalent income, assuming a federal income tax rate of 21% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\nNet interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $22.5 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 10.5%, compared to $20.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to a $10.2 million increase in interest income, as interest earning assets increased $486.2 million while the average interest earning asset yield increased 46 basis points. This was partially offset by the increasing cost of interest-bearing liabilities as interest expense increased $8.0 million, mainly driven by an increase of 48 basis points in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $525.6 million. The increase in interest earning assets was primarily due to organic loan growth and increased cash balances from deposit growth and BTFP borrowings. The increase in interest-bearing liabilities was due to core deposit growth, a shift from noninterest-bearing deposits to interest-bearing deposits and BTFP borrowings.\n\nNet interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $68.8 million, an increase of $2.5 million, or 3.7%, compared to $66.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income for the first nine months of 2024 increased compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to a $34.1 million increase in interest income, as average interest earning assets increased $450.3 million while the average interest earning asset yield increased 64 basis points. This was partially offset by the increased cost of interest-bearing liabilities as interest expense increased $31.6 million, mainly driven by an increase of 89 basis points in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $520.4 million. The increase in interest earning assets was primarily due to organic loan growth and increased cash balances from deposit growth and BTFP borrowings. The increase in interest-bearing liabilities was due to core deposit growth, a shift from noninterest-bearing deposits to interest-bearing deposits and BTFP borrowings.\n\nNet interest margin (on a tax-equivalent basis) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.23%, compared to 2.27% for the same period in 2023. The decrease in net interest margin (on a tax-equivalent basis) was mainly attributable to higher earning assets at lower yields resulting from the BTFP funding as those proceeds were held at the Federal Reserve Bank. Adjusted net interest margin (on a tax-equivalent basis) (non-GAAP), which excludes BTFP borrowings and purchase accounting accretion, was 2.35% for the third quarter of 2024, a 11 basis point increase from 2.24% for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe high target federal funds interest rate continues to pressure funding costs. However, the Company anticipates that net interest income and net interest margin (on an adjusted tax equivalent basis) will increase in future periods as the impact of recent and anticipated interest rate cuts lower funding costs and fixed interest rate derivatives mature.\n\n45 \n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\nThe following table presents average balance sheet information, interest income, interest expense and the corresponding average yields on assets, average yields earned, and rates paid for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company derived these yields and rates by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities. The Company derived average balances from the daily balances throughout the periods indicated. Average loan balances include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status, while interest previously accrued on these loans is reversed against interest income. In these tables, adjustments are made to the yields on tax‑exempt assets in order to present tax‑exempt income and fully taxable income on a fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) basis.\n\n**Three months

The decrease in noninterest income was primarily driven by a decrease of $2.5 million in retirement and benefit services revenue, driven by the divestiture of the Employee Stock Ownership Program (“ESOP”) trustee business included in the three months ended September 30, 2023, which resulted in a recognized gain of $2.8 million. This decrease was partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in wealth management revenue, primarily due to assets under administration/management growth as well as a $0.8 million increase in other noninterest income, primarily due to a gain on the sale of fixed assets related to the sale of the Shorewood, Minnesota branch in the western suburbs of the Twin Cities as well as increased client swap fees.\n\nTotal noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $81.1 million, a $1.6 million, or 2.0%, increase compared to $79.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in noninterest income was primarily driven by an increase of $3.2 million in wealth management revenue due to assets under administration/management growth, primarily driven by improved equity and bond markets. Other noninterest income increased $0.4 million, primarily driven by a gain on the sale of fixed assets related to the sale of the Shorewood, Minnesota branch. This increase was partially offset by a $2.1 million decrease in retirement and benefits services, primarily driven by the divestiture of the ESOP trustee business included in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which resulted in a recognized gain of $2.8 million.\n\nThe Company anticipates that noninterest income will continue to be adversely affected in future periods if interest rates remain higher than in periods prior to the Fed's rate hikes beginning in 2022 and inflationary pressure continues. These factors have adversely affected mortgage originations and mortgage banking revenue in recent periods. The Company believes mortgage revenue will increase in future periods as a result of recent and anticipated interest rate cuts.\n\nSee “NOTE 17 Segment Reporting” of the consolidated financial statements and Segment Reporting section below for additional discussion regarding the Company’s business lines.\n\n**_Noninterest Expense_**\n\nThe following table presents noninterest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\n**Three months ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nCompensation | $ | 21,058 | $ | 19,071 | $ | 60,655 | $ | 57,076  \nEmployee taxes and benefits | 5,400 | 4,895 | 16,722 | 15,472  \nOccupancy and equipment expense | 2,082 | 1,883 | 5,803 | 5,619  \nBusiness services, software and technology expense | 4,879 | 4,774 | 14,823 | 15,367  \nIntangible amortization expense | 1,324 | 1,324 | 3,972 | 3,972  \nProfessional fees and assessments | 4,267 | 1,716 | 8,633 | 4,397  \nMarketing and business development | 764 | 750 | 2,200 | 2,139  \nSupplies and postage | 422 | 410 | 1,321 | 1,275  \nTravel | 330 | 322 | 954 | 876  \nMortgage and lending expenses | 684 | 689 | 1,592 | 1,401  \nOther | 1,237 | 1,426 | 3,543 | 3,909  \nTotal noninterest expense | $ | 42,447 | $ | 37,260 | $ | 120,218 | $ | 111,503  \n  \n49 \n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\nTotal noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $42.4 million, a $5.2 million, or 13.9%, increase compared to $37.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The year over year increase was primarily driven by higher professional fees and assessments, compensation, and employee taxes and benefits expenses. Professional fees and assessments increased primarily due to increased merger-related expenses of $1.7 million in connection with the acquisition of HMNF and an increase in FDIC assessments. Compensation expense increased primarily due to increased labor costs. Employee taxes and benefits expense increased primarily due to increased costs related to group insurance.\n\nTotal noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $120.2 million, a $8.7 million, or 7.8%, increase compared to $111.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by increases of $4.2 million in professional fees and assessments, $3.6 million in compensation, and $1.3 million in employee taxes and benefits expense. The increase in professional fees and assessments was primarily due to increased merger-related expenses in connection with the acquisition of HMNF and an increase in FDIC assessments. The increase in compensation expense was primarily due to rising labor costs. The increase in employee taxes and benefits expense was primarily due to increased costs related to group insurance and payroll taxes. These increases were partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in business services, software and technology expense primarily due to reduced core processing and information technology hardware expenses.\n\n**_Income Tax Expense_**\n\nIncome tax expense is an estimate based on the amount the Company expects to owe the applicable taxing authorities, plus the impact of deferred tax items. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due, or to be received from, taxing authorities. In estimating accrued taxes, management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions, taking into account statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance in the context of the Company’s tax position. If the final resolution of taxes payable differs from the Company’s estimates due to regulatory determination or legislative or judicial actions, adjustments to tax expense may be required.\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized income tax expense of $1.6 million on $6.8 million of pre-tax income, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.4%, compared to income tax expense of $2.4 million on $11.5 million of pre-tax income for the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in an effective tax rate of 20.6%.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized income tax expense of $5.6 million on $23.5 million of pre-tax income, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.9%, compared to income tax expense of $7.2 million on $33.7 million of pre-tax income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in an effective tax rate of 21.4%.\n\n**Segment Reporting**\n\nThe Company determined reportable segments based on the significance of the services offered, the significance of those services to the Company’s financial condition and operating results, and the Company’s regular review of the operating results of those services. The Company has three operating segments—banking, retirement and benefit services, and wealth. These segments are components for which financial information is prepared and evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.\n\nThe selected financial information presented for each segment sets forth net interest income, provision for loan losses, noninterest income, and direct and indirect noninterest expense overhead allocations. Corporate administration includes all remaining income and expenses not allocated to the three operating segments. Certain reclassification adjustments have been made between corporate administration and the various lines of business for consistency in presentation.\n\nFor additional financial information on the Company’s segments see “NOTE 17 Segment Reporting” of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\n_**Banking**_\n\nThe banking division offers a complete line of loan, deposit, cash management, and treasury services through fourteen offices in North Dakota, Minnesota, and Arizona. After the closing of the HMNF acquisition, the Company added 15 banking offices in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa. These products and services are supported through web and mobile based applications. The majority of the Company’s assets and liabilities are in the banking segment’s balance sheet.\n\nThe following table presents the banking segment income statement, net of corporate administration, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\n**Three months ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNet interest income | $ | 22,542 | $ | 20,395 | $ | 68,761 | $ | 66,287  \nProvision for credit losses | 1,661 | — | 6,150 | 550  \nNoninterest income | 5,535 | 4,531 | 14,020 | 13,547  \nTotal revenue | 26,416 | 24,926 | 76,631 | 79,284  \nNoninterest expense (1) | 20,269 | 18,881 | 57,837 | 56,832  \nNet income before taxes | $ | 6,147 | $ | 6,045 | $ | 18,794 | $ | 22,452  \n(1) |  Noninterest expenses do not include corporate administration expenses.

As of September 30, 2024, approximately 19.9% of loans outstanding were commercial and industrial, 47.3% of loans outstanding were CRE, 2.8% of loans outstanding were agricultural, and 30.0% of loans outstanding were consumer.\n\n52 \n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\n**September 30, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \n**Percent of** |  **Percent of**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **Balance** |  **Portfolio** |  **Balance** |  **Portfolio**  \n**Commercial and industrial:**  \nGeneral business | $ | 301,629 | 9.9 | % | $ | 258,008 | 9.3 | %  \nServices | 152,354 | 5.0 | 146,318 | 5.3  \nRetail trade | 93,437 | 3.1 | 91,216 | 3.3  \nManufacturing | 58,825 | 1.9 | 66,638 | 2.4  \nTotal commercial and industrial | 606,245 | 19.9 | 562,180 | 20.3  \n**Commercial real estate:**  \nConstruction, land and development | 173,629 | 5.7 | 124,034 | 4.5  \nMultifamily | 275,377 | 9.1 | 245,103 | 8.9  \nNon-owner occupied  \nOffice | 103,422 | 3.4 | 124,684 | 4.5  \nIndustrial | 109,904 | 3.6 | 104,241 | 3.8  \nRetail | 117,536 | 3.9 | 96,578 | 3.5  \nHotel | 125,451 | 4.1 | 80,576 | 2.9  \nMedical office | 106,808 | 3.5 | 63,788 | 2.3  \nMedical or nursing facility | 72,256 | 2.4 | 47,625 | 1.7  \nOther commercial real estate | 50,694 | 1.8 | 51,862 | 1.9  \nTotal non-owner occupied | 686,071 | 22.7 | 569,354 | 20.6  \nOwner occupied | 296,366 | 9.8 | 271,623 | 9.8  \nTotal commercial real estate | 1,431,443 | 47.3 | 1,210,114 | 43.8  \n**Agricultural:**  \nLand | 45,821 | 1.5 | 40,832 | 1.5  \nProduction | 39,436 | 1.3 | 36,141 | 1.3  \nTotal agricultural | 85,257 | 2.8 | 76,973 | 2.8  \n**Consumer:**  \nRRE − First lien | 690,451 | 22.8 | 697,900 | 25.3  \nRRE − Construction | 11,808 | 0.4 | 28,979 | 1.1  \nRRE − HELOC | 134,301 | 4.4 | 118,315 | 4.3  \nRRE − Junior lien | 36,445 | 1.2 | 35,819 | 1.3  \nOther consumer | 36,393 | 1.2 | 29,303 | 1.1  \nTotal consumer | 909,398 | 30.0 | 910,316 | 33.1  \nTotal loans | $ | 3,032,343 | 100.0 | % | $ | 2,759,583 | 100.0 | %  \n  \nDespite headwinds from a higher interest rate environment and competition in the Company’s market areas, the Company anticipates continued loan growth in the remainder of 2024 for the commercial and industrial and CRE loan portfolios as a result of recently added production talent.\n\nCommercial and industrial loans represent loans for working capital, purchases of equipment and other needs of commercial customers primarily located within the Bank’s geographical footprint. These loans are underwritten individually and represent ongoing relationships based on a thorough knowledge of the customer, the customer’s industry and the customer’s market. While commercial loans are generally secured by the customer’s assets, including real property, inventory, accounts receivable, operating equipment and other property, and may also include personal guarantees of the owners and related parties, the primary source of repayment of the loans is the ongoing cash flow from operations of the customer’s business. In addition, revolving lines of credit are generally governed by a borrowing base. Inherent lending risks are monitored on a continuous basis through interim reporting, covenant testing and annual underwriting.\n\nCRE loans consist of term loans secured by a mortgage lien on real property and include both owner occupied CRE loans as well as non-owner occupied loans. Non-owner occupied CRE loans consist of mortgage loans to finance investments in real property that may include, but are not limited to, multi-family, industrial, office, retail and other specific use properties as well as CRE construction loans that are offered to builders and developers generally within the Bank’s geographical footprint. The primary risk characteristics in the non-owner occupied portfolio include impacts of overall leasing rates, absorption timelines, levels of vacancy rates and operating expenses. The Company requires collateral values in excess of the loan amounts, cash flows in excess of expected debt service requirements and equity investment in the project. The expected cash flows from all significant new or renewed income producing property commitments are stress tested to reflect the risks in varying interest rates, vacancy rates and rental rates. Inherent lending risks are monitored on a continuous basis through quarterly monitoring and the Bank’s annual underwriting process, incorporating an analysis of cash flow, collateral, market conditions and guarantor liquidity, if applicable. CRE loan policies are specific to individual product types and underwriting parameters vary depending on the risk profile of each asset class. CRE loan policies are reviewed no less than semi-annually by management and approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors to ensure they align with current market conditions and the Bank’s moderate risk appetite. Construction loans are monitored monthly and includes on-site inspections. Management reviews all construction loans quarterly to ensure projects are on time and within budget. CRE concentration limits have been established by product type and are monitored quarterly by the Bank’s Credit Governance Committee and Bank Board of Directors.\n\nCRE loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The Company does not monitor the CRE portfolio for attributes such as loan-to-value ratios, occupancy rates or net operating income, as these characteristics are assessed and evaluated on an individual loan basis. Portfolio stress testing is completed based on property type and takes into consideration changes to net operating income and capitalization rates. The Company does not have exposure to the office building sector in central business districts as the office portfolio is generally diversified in suburban markets with strong occupancy levels.\n\n53 \n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\nThe following table presents the geographical markets of the collateral related to non-owner occupied and multifamily CRE loans for the periods presented:\n\n**September 30, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \n**Percent of** |  **Percent of**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **Balance** |  **Total** |  **Balance** |  **Total**  \n**Geographical Market:**  \nMinnesota | $ | 413,482 | 43.0 | % | $ | 394,754 | 48.5 | %  \nNorth Dakota | 211,022 | 21.9 | 214,884 | 26.4  \nArizona | 169,947 | 17.7 | 139,450 | 17.1  \nTexas | 34,570 | 3.6 | — | —  \nColorado | 22,171 | 2.3 | 1,246 | 0.2  \nOregon | 18,031 | 1.9 | 14,953 | 1.8  \nWisconsin | 17,446 | 1.8 | 502 | 0.1  \nMissouri | 16,866 | 1.8 | 15,969 | 2.0  \nKansas | 15,215 | 1.6 | 4,343 | 0.5  \nSouth Dakota | 14,617 | 1.5 | 14,790 | 1.8  \nOther | 28,081 | 2.9 | 13,566 | 1.7  \nTotal non-owner occupied and multifamily commercial real estate loans | $ | 961,448 | 100.0 | % | $ | 814,457 | 100.0 | %  \n  \nThe Bank does not currently monitor owner occupied CRE loans based on geographical markets, as the primary source of repayment for these loans is predicated on the cash flow from the underlying operating entity. These loans are generally located within the Company’s geographical footprint.\n\nHighly competitive conditions continue to prevail in the small- and middle-market commercial segments in which the Company primarily operates. The Company maintains a commitment to generating growth in the Company’s business portfolio in a manner that adheres to its twin goals of maintaining strong asset quality and producing profitable margins. The Company continues to invest in additional personnel, technology and business development resources to further strengthen its capabilities.\n\nAgricultural loans include loans secured by farmland and loans for agricultural production. Farmland includes purposes such as crop and livestock production. Farmland loans are typically written with amortizing payment structures. Collateral values for farmland are determined based upon appraisals and evaluations in accordance with established policy guidelines and maximum loan-to-value ratios at origination are governed by established policy and regulatory guidelines. Agricultural production loans are for the purpose of financing working capital and/or capital investment for agriculture production activities. Collateral generally consists of pledges of business assets including, but not limited to, accounts receivable, inventory, plant and equipment, and/or real estate in applicable. Agricultural production loans are primarily paid by the operating cash flow of the borrower. Agricultural production loans may be secured or unsecured.\n\nResidential real estate loans represent loans to consumers for the purchase or refinance of a residence. These loans are generally financed over a 15- to 30-year term and, in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence with both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate terms. Real estate construction loans are also offered to consumers who wish to build their own homes and are often structured to be converted to permanent loans at the end of the construction phase, which is typically twelve months. RRE loans also include home equity loans and lines of credit that are secured by a first or second lien on the borrower’s residence. Home equity lines of credit, or “HELOC”, consist mainly of revolving lines of credit secured by residential real estate.\n\nOther consumer loans include loans made to individuals not secured by real estate, including loans secured by automobiles or watercraft, and personal unsecured loans.\n\nThe Company originates both fixed and adjustable rate residential real estate loans conforming to the underwriting guidelines of the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, as well as home equity loans and lines of credit that are secured by first or junior liens. Most of the Company’s fixed rate residential loans, along with some of the Company’s adjustable rate mortgages are sold to other financial institutions with which the Company has established a correspondent lending relationship.\n\nThe Company’s RRE loans have minimal direct exposure to subprime mortgages as the loans are underwritten to conform to secondary market standards. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s RRE portfolio was $873.0 million, representing a $8.0 million, or 0.9%, decrease from $881.0 million as of December 31, 2023. Market interest rates, expected duration, and the Company’s overall interest rate sensitivity profile continue to be the most significant factors in determining whether the Company chooses to retain versus sell portions of new consumer mortgage originations.\n\n54 \n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\nThe following table presents the maturities and types of interest rates for the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024:\n\n**September 30, 2024**  \n---  \n**After one** |  **After five**  \n**One year** |  **but within** |  **but within** |  **After**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **or less** |  **five years** |  **fifteen years** |  **fifteen years** |  **Total**  \n**Commercial**  \nCommercial and industrial | $ | 107,232 | $ | 299,211 | $ | 196,950 | $ | 2,852 | $ | 606,245  \nCommercial real estate  \nConstruction, land and development | 40,774 | 108,678 | 23,839 | 338 | 173,629  \nMultifamily | 9,230 | 178,980 | 86,073 | 1,094 | 275,377  \nNon-owner occupied | 92,321 | 409,055 | 161,720 | 22,975 | 686,071  \nOwner occupied | 27,059 | 172,076 | 71,835 | 25,396 | 296,366  \nTotal commercial real estate | 169,384 | 868,789 | 343,467 | 49,803 | 1,431,443  \nAgricultural | — | — | — | — | —  \nLand | 910 | 12,656 | 11,669 | 20,586 | 45,821  \nProduction | 19,795 | 16,569 | 3,072 | — | 39,436  \nTotal agricultural | 20,705 | 29,225 | 14,741 | 20,586 | 85,257  \nTotal commercial | 297,321 | 1,197,225 | 555,158 | 73,241 | 2,122,945  \n**Consumer**  \nResidential real estate  \nFirst lien | 2,531 | 31,704 | 39,236 | 616,980 | 690,451  \nConstruction | 1,625 | 3,178 | — | 7,005 | 11,808  \nHELOC | 3,567 | 15,767 | 13,839 | 101,128 | 134,301  \nJunior lien | 3,468 | 6,778 | 16,365 | 9,834 | 36,445  \nTotal residential real estate | 11,191 | 57,427 | 69,440 | 734,947 | 873,005  \nOther consumer | 14,609 | 19,610 | 2,174 | — | 36,393  \nTotal consumer | 25,800 | 77,037 | 71,614 | 734,947 | 909,398  \nTotal loans | $ | 323,121 | $ | 1,274,262 | $ | 626,772 | $ | 808,188 | $ | 3,032,343  \n**Loans with fixed interest rates:**  \n**Commercial**  \nCommercial and industrial | $ | 15,631 | $ | 210,933 | $ | 75,291 | $ | — | $ | 301,855  \nCommercial real estate  \nConstruction, land and development | 15,967 | 36,615 | 1,001 | — | 53,583  \nMultifamily | 4,442 | 88,147 | 65,185 | 1,094 | 158,868  \nNon-owner occupied | 61,694 | 233,074 | 87,830 | 442 | 383,040  \nOwner occupied | 22,205 | 136,978 | 30,904 | — | 190,087  \nTotal commercial real estate | 104,308 | 494,814 | 184,920 | 1,536 | 785,578  \nAgricultural  \nLand | 828 | 12,535 | 11,606 | 19,189 | 44,158  \nProduction | 1,115 | 15,979 | 2,251 | — | 19,345  \nTotal agricultural | 1,943 | 28,514 | 13,857 | 19,189 | 63,503  \nTotal commercial | 121,882 | 734,261 | 274,068 | 20,725 | 1,150,936  \n**Consumer**  \nResidential real estate  \nFirst lien | 2,279 | 28,412 | 32,690 | 390,755 | 454,136  \nConstruction | 817 | 662 | — | 2,325 | 3,804  \nHELOC | 27 | 2,239 | 8,734 | 4,951 | 15,951  \nJunior lien | 1,749 | 4,244 | 12,924 | 9,834 | 28,751  \nTotal residential real estate | 4,872 | 35,557 | 54,348 | 407,865 | 502,642  \nOther consumer | 3,823 | 13,793 | 2,174 | — | 19,790  \nTotal consumer | 8,695 | 49,350 | 56,522 | 407,865 | 522,432  \nTotal loans with fixed interest rates | $ | 130,577 | $ | 783,611 | $ | 330,590 | $ | 428,590 | $ | 1,673,368  \n**Loans with floating interest rates:**  \n**Commercial**  \nCommercial and industrial | $ | 91,601 | $ | 88,278 | $ | 121,659 | $ | 2,852 | $ | 304,390  \nCommercial real estate  \nConstruction, land and development | 24,807 | 72,063 | 22,838 | 338 | 120,046  \nMultifamily | 4,788 | 90,833 | 20,888 | — | 116,509  \nNon-owner occupied | 30,627 | 175,981 | 73,890 | 22,533 | 303,031  \nOwner occupied | 4,854 | 35,098 | 40,931 | 25,396 | 106,279  \nTotal commercial real estate | 65,076 | 373,975 | 158,547 | 48,267 | 645,865  \nAgricultural  \nLand | 82 | 121 | 63 | 1,397 | 1,663  \nProduction | 18,680 | 590 | 821 | — | 20,091  \nTotal agricultural | 18,762 | 711 | 884 | 1,397 | 21,754  \nTotal commercial | 175,439 | 462,964 | 281,090 | 52,516 | 972,009  \n**Consumer**  \nResidential real estate  \nFirst lien | 252 | 3,292 | 6,546 | 226,225 | 236,315  \nConstruction | 808 | 2,516 | — | 4,680 | 8,004  \nHELOC | 3,540 | 13,528 | 5,105 | 96,177 | 118,350  \nJunior lien | 1,719 | 2,534 | 3,441 | — | 7,694  \nTotal residential real estate | 6,319 | 21,870 | 15,092 | 327,082 | 370,363  \nOther consumer | 10,786 | 5,817 | — | — | 16,603  \nTotal consumer | 17,105 | 27,687 | 15,092 | 327,082 | 386,966  \nTotal loans with floating interest rates | $ | 192,544 | $ | 490,651 | $ | 296,182 | $ | 379,598 | $ | 1,358,975  \n  \n55 \n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\nThe expected life of the Company’s loan portfolio will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to curtail or prepay their loans with or without penalties. Consequently, the table above includes information limited to contractual maturities of the underlying loans.\n\n**_Asset Quality_**\n\nThe Company’s strategy for credit risk management includes well‑defined, centralized credit policies; uniform underwriting criteria; and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all commercial and consumer credit exposures. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry, and client level; regular credit examinations; and management reviews of loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality. The Company strives to identify potential problem loans early, take necessary charge‑offs promptly, and maintain adequate reserve levels for credit losses inherent in the portfolio. Management performs ongoing, internal reviews of any problem credits and continually assesses the adequacy of the allowance. The Company utilizes an internal lending division, Special Credit Services, to develop and implement strategies for the management of individual nonperforming loans.\n\n**_Credit Quality Indicators_**\n\nLoans are assigned a risk rating and grouped into categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt, such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The risk ratings are aligned to pass and criticized categories. The criticized categories include special mention, substandard, and doubtful risk ratings. See “NOTE 5 Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses” of the consolidated financial statements for a definition of each of the risk ratings.\n\nThe table below presents criticized loans outstanding by loan portfolio segment as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\n**September 30,** |  **December 31,**  \n---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Commercial**  \nCommercial and industrial | $ | 34,006 | $ | 29,840  \nCommercial real estate  \nConstruction, land and development | 25,005 | 20,667  \nMultifamily | 13,109 | 310  \nNon-owner occupied | 24,210 | 1,018  \nOwner occupied | 12,993 | 7,842  \nTotal commercial real estate | 75,317 | 29,837  \nAgricultural  \nLand | 2,470 | —  \nProduction | 1,335 | —  \nTotal agricultural | 3,805 | —  \nTotal commercial | 113,128 | 59,677  \n**Consumer**  \nResidential real estate  \nFirst lien | 1,948 | 105  \nConstruction | 4,680 | —  \nHELOC | 1,488 | —  \nJunior lien | 3,751 | 1,781  \nTotal residential real estate | 11,867 | 1,886  \nOther consumer | 290 | —  \nTotal consumer | 12,157 | 1,886  \nTotal loans | $ | 125,285 | $ | 61,563  \nCriticized loans as a percent of total loans | 4.13 | % | 2.23 | %  \n  \nThe following table presents information regarding nonperforming assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\n**September 30,** |  **December 31,**  \n---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNonaccrual loans | $ | 48,026 | $ | 8,596  \nAccruing loans 90+ days past due | — | 139  \nTotal nonperforming loans | 48,026 | 8,735  \nOREO and repossessed assets | — | 32  \nTotal nonperforming assets | 48,026 | 8,767  \nTotal restructured accruing loans | — | —  \nTotal nonperforming assets and restructured accruing loans | $ | 48,026 | $ | 8,767  \nNonperforming loans to total loans | 1.58 | % | 0.32 | %  \nNonperforming assets to total assets | 1.18 | % | 0.22 | %  \nACL on loans to nonperforming loans | 82 | % | 410 | %  \n  \n$25.0 million of the increase in nonaccrual loans was driven by one construction, land and development loan moving to nonaccrual status in the second quarter of 2024 and an additional advance on the same loan in the third quarter of 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, management elected to make protective advances in order for construction to continue on that project. Management is actively working with the borrower on strategies to complete construction, preserve value and support repayment of the loan. A large RRE relationship and one non-owner occupied CRE loan moving to nonaccrual status also contributed $13.6 million to the increase in nonaccrual loans during the third quarter of 2024.\n\n56 \n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\nInterest income lost on nonaccrual loans approximated $2.8 million and $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There was no interest income included in net interest income related to nonaccrual loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\n**_Allowance for Credit Losses_**\n\nThe allowance for credit losses, or ACL, on loans is maintained at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb expected losses in the loan portfolio over the remaining estimated life of loans in the portfolio. Under the Current Expected Credit Loss accounting standard, the ACL is a valuation estimated at each balance sheet date and deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans held for investment to present the net amount expected to be collected. These evaluations are inherently subjective as they require management to make material estimates, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by actual charge‑offs, net of recoveries.\n\nManagement estimates the ACL using relevant information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical loss experience provides the basis for estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in the current loan-specific risk characteristics such as different underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or life of the loan, as well as changes in environmental conditions, levels of economic activity, unemployment rates, property values and other relevant factors. The calculation also contemplates that the Company may not be able to make or obtain such forecasts for the entire life of the financial assets and requires a reversion to historical loss information.\n\nLoans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not also included in the collective evaluation. The ACL on individually evaluated loans is recognized on the basis of the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate, the fair value of collateral adjusted of estimated costs to sell, or observable market price as of the relevant date.\n\nThe following table presents information concerning the components of the ACL for the periods presented:\n\n**At or

credit, and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded. An ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures is measured using similar internal and external assumptions as the ACL on loans. This allowance is located in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The ACL for unfunded commitments was $7.4 million and $5.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n**_Deposits_**\n\nDeposit inflows and outflows are influenced by prevailing market interest rates, competition, local and economic conditions, and fluctuations in the Company’s customers’ own liquidity needs and may also be influenced by recent developments in the financial services industry, including the large-scale deposit withdrawals over a short period of time that resulted in recent bank failures.\n\nTotal deposits were $3.3 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $227.9 million, or 7.4%, from December 31, 2023. Interest-bearing deposits increased $300.4 million during this period, while noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $67.9 million. The increase in total deposits was due to both expanded and new commercial deposit relationships, along with time deposit and synergistic deposit growth. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased from 23.5% of total deposits as of December 31, 2023 to 19.8% as of September 30, 2024, as higher yields on interest-bearing accounts and other investment alternatives, such as U.S. treasuries, attracted such funds. Time deposit balances increased as higher short-term CD rates attracted both existing non-maturity deposits as well as new deposits to the Company.\n\nThe following table presents the composition of the Company’s deposit portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\n**September 30, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \n**Percent of** |  **Percent of** |  **Change**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **Balance** |  **Portfolio** |  **Balance** |  **Portfolio** |  **Amount** |  **Percent**  \nNoninterest-bearing demand | $ | 657,547 | 19.8 | % | $ | 728,082 | 23.5 | % | $ | (70,535 | ) | (9.7 | )%  \nInterest-bearing demand | 1,034,694 | 31.1 | 840,711 | 27.2 | 193,983 | 23.1  \nMoney market and savings (1) | 1,142,862 | 34.4 | 1,115,256 | 36.0 | 27,606 | 2.5  \nTime deposits | 488,447 | 14.7 | 411,562 | 13.3 | 76,885 | 18.7  \nTotal deposits | $ | 3,323,550 | 100.0 | % | $ | 3,095,611 | 100.0 | % | $ | 227,939 | 7.4 | %  \n(1) |  Money market and savings deposits include health savings account deposits of $186.1 million and $176.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe following table presents the average balances and rates of the Company’s deposit portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\n**Three months ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**Average** |  **Average** |  **Average** |  **Average**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **Balance** |  **Rate** |  **Balance** |  **Rate**  \nNoninterest-bearing demand | $ | 656,553 | — | % | $ | 743,253 | — | %  \nInterest-bearing demand | 944,143 | 2.31 | 757,995 | 1.34  \nMoney market and savings | 1,160,391 | 3.82 | 1,127,630 | 3.20  \nTime deposits | 458,545 | 4.46 | 276,797 | 3.94  \nTotal deposits | $ | 3,219,632 | 2.75 | % | $ | 2,905,675 | 1.97 | %  \n  \n60 \n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\nThe following table presents the composition of the Company’s deposit portfolio by client segment as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\n**September 30, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \n**Percent of** |  **Percent of** |  **Change**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **Balance** |  **Portfolio** |  **Balance** |  **Portfolio** |  **Amount** |  **Percent**  \nCommercial | $ | 1,289,693 | 38.8 | % | $ | 1,128,152 | 36.4 | % | $ | 161,541 | 14.3 | %  \nConsumer | 927,472 | 27.9 | 921,650 | 29.8 | 5,822 | 0.6  \nPublic (1) | 185,776 | 5.6 | 194,265 | 6.3 | (8,489 | ) | (4.4 | )  \nSynergistic (2)  \nRetirement and benefit services (3) | 640,571 | 19.3 | 598,160 | 19.3 | 42,411 | 7.1  \nWealth (4) | 280,038 | 8.4 | 253,384 | 8.2 | 26,654 | 10.5  \nTotal synergistic | 920,609 | 27.7 | 851,544 | 27.5 | 69,065 | 18  \nTotal deposits | $ | 3,323,550 | 100.0 | % | $ | 3,095,611 | 100.0 | % | $ | 227,939 | 7.4 | %  \n(1) |  Public deposits primarily represent municipalities, school districts, and other governmental entities that receive public funding.  \n---|---  \n(2) | Synergistic deposits represent the on-balance sheet money market balances that Alerus Retirement and Benefit Services and Alerus Wealth clients hold in proprietary Alerus money market products.  \n(3) | $337.7 million and $288.9 million of retirement and benefit services synergistic deposits were indexed as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.  \n(4) | $280.0 million and $253.4 million of wealth synergistic deposits were indexed as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.   \n  \nThe following table presents the contractual maturity of time deposits, including certificate of deposit account registry services and IRA deposits of $250,000 and over, that were outstanding as of September 30, 2024:\n\n**September 30,**  \n---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **2024**  \nMaturing in:  \n3 months or less | $ | 52,716  \n3 months to 6 months | 94,957  \n6 months to 1 year | 18,627  \n1 year or greater | 4,554  \nTotal | $ | 170,854  \n  \nThe Company’s total uninsured deposits, which are amounts of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit, currently $250,000, were approximately $1.3 billion at September 30, 2024, and approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2023.

Tangible common equity to tangible assets, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased to 8.11% as of September 30, 2024, from 7.94% as of December 31, 2023. Common equity tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets decreased to 11.12% as of September 30, 2024, from 11.82% as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company strives to maintain an adequate capital base to support the Company’s activities in a safe and sound manner while at the same time attempting to maximize stockholder value. Capital adequacy is assessed against the risk inherent in the Company’s balance sheet, recognizing that unexpected loss is the common denominator of risk, and that common equity has the greatest capacity to absorb unexpected loss.\n\nThe Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements both at the Company and at the Bank level. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on the Company’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, specific capital guidelines must be met that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting policies. The Company has consistently maintained regulatory capital ratios at or above the well-capitalized standards.\n\n61 \n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company met all the capital adequacy requirements to which the Company was subject. The table below presents the Company’s and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios and the Company’s tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\n**September 30,** |  **December 31,**  \n---|---  \n**Capital Ratios** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n_Alerus Financial Corporation Consolidated_  \nCommon equity tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets | 11.12 | % | 11.82 | %  \nTier 1 capital to risk weighted assets | 11.38 | % | 12.10 | %  \nTotal capital to risk weighted assets | 14.04 | % | 14.76 | %  \nTier 1 capital to average assets | 9.30 | % | 10.57 | %  \nTangible common equity to tangible assets (1) | 8.11 | % | 7.94 | %  \n_Alerus Financial, National Association_  \nCommon equity tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets | 10.73 | % | 11.40 | %  \nTier 1 capital to risk weighted assets | 10.73 | % | 11.40 | %  \nTotal capital to risk weighted assets | 11.98 | % | 12.51 | %  \nTier 1 capital to average assets | 8.90 | % | 9.92 | %  \n(1) |  Represents a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP to GAAP Reconciliations and Calculation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”  \n---|---  \n  \nThe regulatory capital ratios for the Company and the Bank, as of September 30, 2024, as shown in the above table, were at levels above the regulatory minimums to be considered “well capitalized.” See “NOTE 20 Regulatory Matters” of the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\n**_Off_** ‑** _Balance Sheet Arrangements_**\n\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off‑balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of the Company’s customers. These financial instruments consist primarily of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers, generally having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require payment of a fee. These commitments consist principally of unused commercial and consumer credit lines. Standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of an underlying contract with a third party. The credit risks associated with commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are essentially the same as that involved with extending loans to customers and are subject to normal credit policies. Collateral may be required based on management’s assessment of the customer’s creditworthiness. The fair value of these commitments is considered immaterial for disclosure purposes.\n\nA summary of the contractual amounts of the Company’s exposure to off‑balance sheet agreements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was as follows:\n\n**September 30,** |  **December 31,**  \n---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nCommitments to extend credit | $ | 927,235 | $ | 942,413  \nStandby letters of credit | 11,231 | 10,045  \nTotal | $ | 938,466 | $ | 952,458  \n  \n**_Liquidity_**\n\nLiquidity management is the process by which the Company manages the flow of funds necessary to meet the Company’s financial commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost and to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities. These financial commitments include withdrawals by depositors, credit commitments to borrowers, expenses of the Company’s operations, and capital expenditures. Liquidity is monitored and closely managed by the Company’s asset and liability committee, or the ALCO, a group of senior officers from the finance, enterprise risk management, deposit, investment, treasury, and lending areas. It is the ALCO’s responsibility to ensure the Company has the necessary level of funds available for normal operations as well as maintain a contingency funding policy to ensure that potential liquidity stress events are planned for, quickly identified, and that management has plans in place to respond. The ALCO has created policies which establish limits and require measurements to monitor liquidity trends, including modeling and management reporting that identifies the amounts and costs of all available funding sources.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had on balance sheet liquidity of $424.8 million, compared to $668.2 million as of December 31, 2023. On balance sheet liquidity includes cash and cash equivalents, federal funds sold, unencumbered securities available‑for‑sale, and over collateralized securities pledging positions available-for-sale.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had off balance sheet liquidity of $1.8 billion, compared to $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2023. Off balance sheet liquidity includes FHLB borrowing capacity, federal funds lines, and brokered deposit capacity. There were no brokered deposits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Bank is a member of the FHLB, which provides short‑ and long‑term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate related assets and other select collateral, most typically in the form of debt securities. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $44.7 million in federal funds purchased and $200.0 million in short-term borrowings from the FHLB. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $1.1 billion of collateral pledged to the FHLB and, based on this collateral, the Company was eligible to borrow up to an additional $851.4 million from the FHLB. In addition, the Company can borrow up to $107.0 million through the unsecured lines of credit the Company has established with four other correspondent banks.\n\n62 \n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\nIn addition, because the Bank is “well capitalized,” the Company can accept wholesale deposits up to 20.0% of total assets based on current policy limits, or $816.9 million, as of September 30, 2024. Management believed that the Company had adequate resources to fund all of the Company’s commitments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company’s primary sources of liquidity include liquid assets, as well as unencumbered securities that can be used to collateralize additional funding.\n\nThough remote, the possibility of a funding crisis exists at all financial institutions. The economic impact of the recent rise in inflation and rising interest rates could place increased demand on the Company’s liquidity if the Company experiences significant credit deterioration and as the Company meets borrowers’ needs. Accordingly, management has addressed this issue by formulating a liquidity contingency plan, which has been reviewed and approved by both the Bank’s Board of Directors and the ALCO. The plan addresses the actions that the Company would take in response to both a short‑term and long‑term funding crisis.\n\nA short‑term funding crisis would most likely result from a shock to the financial system, either internal or external, which disrupts orderly short‑term funding operations. Such a crisis would likely be temporary in nature and would not involve a change in credit ratings. A long‑term funding crisis would most likely be the result of both external and internal factors and would most likely result in drastic credit deterioration. Management believes that both potential circumstances have been fully addressed through detailed action plans and the establishment of trigger points for monitoring such events.\n\n**[](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_ \"qqdmr\")ITEM** **3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK**\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and equity value arising from changes in market interest rates and arises in the normal course of business to the extent that there is a divergence between the amount of interest earning assets and the amount of interest‑bearing liabilities that are prepaid/withdrawn, re‑price, or mature in specified periods. The Company seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and equity while managing volatility arising from shifts in market interest rates. The ALCO oversees market risk management, monitoring risk measures, limits, and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital. The Bank’s Board of Directors approves policy limits with respect to interest rate risk.\n\n**_Interest Rate Risk_**\n\nInterest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities. Effective interest rate risk management begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate interest rate risk position given business activities, management objectives, market expectations and ALCO policy limits and guidelines.\n\nInterest rate risk can come in a variety of forms, including repricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and option risk. Repricing risk is the risk of adverse consequences from a change in interest rates that arises because of differences in the timing of when those interest rate changes impact the Company’s assets and liabilities. Basis risk is the risk of adverse consequence resulting from unequal change in the spread between two or more rates for different instruments with the same maturity. Yield curve risk is the risk of adverse consequences resulting from unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different maturities for the same or different instruments. Option risk in financial instruments arises from embedded options such as options provided to borrowers to make unscheduled loan prepayments, options provided to debt issuers to exercise call options prior to maturity, and depositor options to make withdrawals and early redemptions.\n\nManagement regularly reviews the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates. Among the factors considered are changes in the mix of interest earning assets and interest‑bearing liabilities, interest rate spreads and repricing periods. The ALCO reviews, on at least a quarterly basis, the interest rate risk position.\n\nThe interest‑rate risk position is measured and monitored at the Bank using net interest income simulation models and economic value of equity sensitivity analysis that capture both short‑term and long‑term interest‑rate risk exposure.\n\nModeling the sensitivity of net interest income and the economic value of equity to changes in market interest rates is highly dependent on numerous assumptions incorporated into the modeling process. The models used for these measurements rely on estimates of the potential impact that changes in interest rates may have on the value and prepayment speeds on all components of the Company’s loan portfolio, investment portfolio, as well as embedded options and cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The balance sheet composition and size are assumed to remain static in the simulation modeling process. The analysis provides a framework as to what the Company’s overall sensitivity position is as of the Company’s most recent reported position and the impact that potential changes in interest rates may have on net interest income and the economic value of the Company’s equity.\n\nNet interest income simulation involves forecasting net interest income under a variety of interest rate scenarios including instantaneous shocks.\n\nThe estimated impact on the Company’s net interest income as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, assuming immediate parallel moves in interest rates, is presented in the table below:\n\n**September 30, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \n**Following** |  **Following** |  **Following** |  **Following**  \n**12 months** |  **24 months** |  **12 months** |  **24 months**  \n+400 basis points | −2.4 | % | 10.1 | % | 1.0 | % | 2.4 | %  \n+300 basis points | −1.8 | % | 7.4 | % | 0.5 | % | 1.4 | %  \n+200 basis points | −0.9 | % | 5.5 | % | 0.3 | % | 0.9 | %  \n+100 basis points | −0.3 | % | 3.1 | % | 0.4 | % | 0.9 | %  \n−100 basis points | 0.8 | % | −2.7 | % | −1.0 | % | −1.7 | %  \n−200 basis points | 2.1 | % | −5.0 | % | −2.3 | % | −4.1 | %  \n−300 basis points | 3.5 | % | −7.4 | % | −4.1 | % | −7.2 | %  \n−400 basis points | 8.9 | % | −2.1 | % | −5.0 | % | −7.6 | %  \n  \n63 \n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\nManagement strategies may impact future reporting periods, as actual results may differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, the difference between actual experience and the characteristics assumed, as well as changes in market conditions. Market-based prepayment speeds are factored into the analysis for loan and securities portfolios. Rate sensitivity for transactional deposit accounts is modeled based on both historical experience and external industry studies.\n\nManagement uses an economic value of equity sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of interest rate changes on long‑term cash flows, income, and capital. Economic value of equity is based on discounting the cash flows for all balance sheet instruments under different interest rate scenarios. Deposit premiums are based on external industry studies and utilizing historical experience.\n\nThe table below presents the change in the economic value of equity as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, assuming immediate parallel shifts in interest rates:\n\n**September 30,** |  **December 31,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n+400 basis points | −6.1 | % | −15.5 | %  \n+300 basis points | −5.0 | % | −12.6 | %  \n+200 basis points | −2.1 | % | −7.7 | %  \n+100 basis points | −0.6 | % | −3.1 | %  \n−100 basis points | −0.8 | % | 1.6 | %  \n−200 basis points | −3.0 | % | 2.0 | %  \n−300 basis points | −8.6 | % | −0.3 | %  \n−400 basis points | −14.6 | % | −5.6 | %  \n  \n**_Operational Risk_**\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss due to human behavior, inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, and security risks. Management continuously strives to strengthen its system of internal controls, enterprise risk management, operating processes and employee awareness to assess the impact on earnings and capital and to improve the oversight of the Company’s operational risk.\n\n**_Compliance Risk_**\n\nCompliance risk represents the risk of regulatory sanctions, reputational impact or financial loss resulting from failure to comply with rules and regulations issued by the various banking agencies and standards of good banking practice. Activities which may expose the Company to compliance risk include, but are not limited to, those dealing with the prevention of money laundering, privacy and data protection, community reinvestment initiatives, fair lending challenges resulting from the expansion of the Company’s banking center network, employment and tax matters.\n\n**_Strategic and/or Reputation Risk_**\n\nStrategic and/or reputation risk represents the risk of loss due to impairment of reputation, failure to fully develop and execute business plans, failure to assess current and new opportunities in business, markets and products, and any other event not identified in the defined risk types mentioned previously. Mitigation of the various risk elements that represent strategic and/or reputation risk is achieved through initiatives to help management better understand and report on various risks, including those related to the development of new products and business initiatives.\n\n**[](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_ \"cps\")ITEM** **4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES**\n\n**_Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures_**\n\nThe Company’s management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, and the Chief Accounting Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rule 13a‑15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the President and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Accounting Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its President and Chief Executive Officer, its Chief Financial Officer and its Chief Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n**_Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting_**\n\nThere have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a‑15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\n64 \n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\n**[](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_ \"partii\")PART** **II** —**OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**[](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_ \"legal\")Item** **1** –**Legal Proceedings**\n\nThere are no material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business of the Company or its subsidiaries, to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries are a party or to which the Company’s property is the subject.\n\n**[](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_ \"risks\")Item** **1A** –**Risk Factors**\n\nOther than as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 8, 2024.\n\n**Risks Related to the Merger**\n\n**_Litigation May Be Filed Against the Company (directly or as successor by merger to HMNF) (or the Company’_**** _s or HMNF’s Boards of Directors) that Could Result in the Payment of Damages Following Consummation of the Merger._**\n\nIt is possible that, in connection with the merger of HMNF with and into the Company, stockholders may file putative class action lawsuits against the Company directly or against the Company as successor by merger to HMNF (or the Company’s or HMNF’s boards of directors). One purported stockholders of the Company, and eight purported stockholders of HMNF, sent demand letters to the companies prior to the closing of the merger, alleging that the joint proxy statement/prospectus filed by the Company omitted certain material information regarding the merger and threatening litigation. Although the transaction has closed, these stockholders could still pursue litigation against the Company directly against the Company as successor by merger to HMNF to seek financial damages. The outcome of any such litigation is uncertain. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that results from these lawsuits, including any cost associated with the indemnification of directors and officers of each company, may adversely affect the combined company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the market price of the stock of the Company.\n\n**_The Company May Fail to Realize the Anticipated Benefits of the Merger._**\n\nThe merger of HMNF with and into the Company closed on October 9, 2024. The success of the merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend on, among other things, the Company’s ability to combine the businesses of the Company and HMNF in a manner that permits growth opportunities, including, among other things, enhanced revenues and revenue synergies, an expanded market reach and operating efficiencies, and does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of the Company or HMNF nor result in decreased revenues due to any loss of customers. If the Company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results, prospects and stock price as the resulting company of the merger.\n\n65 \n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_toc)\n\n**[](#ALRS20240930_10Q_HTM_ \"uses\")Item** **2** –**Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds**\n\n**Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities**\n\nNone.\n\n**Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities**\n\nThe following table presents information related to repurchases of shares of the Company’s common stock for each calendar month in the third quarter of 2024:\n\n**Total Number of** |  **Maximum Number of**  \n---|---  \n**Total Number** |  **Average** |  **Shares Purchased as** |  **Shares that May**  \n**of Shares** |  **Price Paid** |  **Part of Publicly** |  **Yet be Purchased**  \n_(dollars in thousands, except per share data)_ |  **Purchased (1)** |  **per Share** |  **Announced Plans** |  **Under the Plan(2)**  \nJuly 1-31, 2024 | 3,227 | $ | 19.24 | — | 1,000,000  \nAugust 1-31, 2024 | 530 | 20.82 | — | 1,000,000  \nSeptember 1-30, 2024 | 128 | 21.54 | — | 1,000,000  \nTotal | 3,885 | $ | 19.53 | — | 1,000,000  \n(1) |  Represents shares of the Company’s common stock surrendered by employees to the Company to pay withholding taxes on the vesting of restricted stock awards.  \n---|---  \n(2) |  On December 12, 2023, the Board approved a stock repurchase program, or the Program, which authorized the Company to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of its common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions.

Forward-looking statements include, without\nlimitation, statements concerning plans, estimates, calculations, forecasts and projections with respect to the anticipated\nfuture performance of Alerus Financial Corporation, or the Company. These statements are often, but not always,\nidentified by words such as “may”, “might”, “should”, “could”, “predict”, “potential”, “believe”, “expect”, “continue”,\n“will”, “anticipate”, “seek”, “estimate”, “intend”, “plan”, “projection”, “would”, “annualized”, “target” and “outlook”,\nor the negative version of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. Examples of\nforward-looking statements include, among others, statements the Company makes regarding projected growth,\nanticipated future financial performance, financial condition, credit quality and management’s long-term performance\ngoals and the future plans and prospects of Alerus Financial Corporation.\nForward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance.

BUSINESS\nCompany Overview and History\nAlerus Financial Corporation, or the Company, is a diversified financial services company headquartered in\nGrand Forks, North Dakota. Through the Company’s subsidiary, Alerus Financial, National Association, or the Bank,\nthe Company provides innovative and comprehensive financial solutions to businesses and consumers through four\ndistinct business segments—banking, retirement and benefit services, wealth management, and mortgage. These\nsolutions are delivered through a relationship oriented primary point of contact along with responsive and client friendly\ntechnology.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $3.9 billion of total assets, $2.8 billion of total loans, $3.1 billion\nof total deposits, $369.1 million of stockholders’ equity, $36.7 billion of assets under administration/management in the\nCompany’s retirement and benefit services segment, and $4.0 billion of assets under administration/management in the\nCompany’s wealth management segment. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had $364.1 million of\nmortgage originations.\nThe Company’s business model produces strong financial performance and a diversified revenue stream, which\nhas helped the Company establish a brand and culture yielding both a loyal client base and passionate and dedicated\nemployees. The Company believes its client first and advice-based philosophy, diversified business model and history of\nhigh performance and growth distinguishes the Company from other financial service providers. The Company generates\nits revenues from both net interest income and noninterest income. Net interest income is derived from offering the\nCompany’s traditional banking products and services. Noninterest income is driven primarily by the Company’s\nretirement and benefit services, wealth management, and mortgage business segments. The remainder of revenue\nconsists of net interest income, which derives from offering the Company’s traditional banking products and services.\nThe Company’s operations date back to 1879, when it was originally founded as the Bank of Grand Forks, one\nof the first banks chartered in the Dakota Territory. In 2000, the Company changed its name to Alerus Financial\nCorporation, reflecting the Company’s evolution from a traditional community bank to a high value financial services\ncompany focused on serving the needs of businesses and consumers who desire comprehensive financial solutions\ndelivered through relationship-based advice and service. Since this rebranding, the Company has experienced significant\ngrowth, both organically and through a series of strategic acquisitions. This growth has allowed the Company to build a\ndiversified franchise and expand its geographic footprint into growing metropolitan areas. The Company believes these\ninitiatives have transformed itself into a high tech, high touch client service provider, increased earnings and allowed the\nCompany to return more value to stockholders.\n5\nThe Company’s Business Model and Products and Services\nGeneral\nThe Company’s business model is client centric, with a focus on offering a diversified range of solutions to\nclients who desire an advice-based relationship, enabling the Company to become the preferred financial services\nprovider for clients. Through this approach, instead of focusing on the broader population, the Company targets specific\nbusiness and consumer segments that the Company believes it can serve better than its competitors and that have\nmeaningful growth potential. By offering sound financial advice and a long-term partnership, the Company believes it\naligns best with clients who are achievement oriented in their purpose and will allow the Company to play an active role\nin their success at all stages of their businesses and lives. The Company classifies its consumer clients based on their\nfinancial needs and goals, aligning best with those clients with complex situations. The Company’s business clients are\nclassified by industry, with a focus on specific high priority industries and client types, including professional services,\nfinance and insurance, wholesale, small business, construction, retail, and manufacturers. The Company targets\nbusinesses with sales between $2.0 million and $100.0 million.\nThe Company’s commitment to delivering diversified solutions is driven by the Company’s “One Alerus”\ninitiative, launched in 2017, which enables the Company to bring all of its product and service offerings to clients in a\ncohesive and seamless manner. Underlying the One Alerus initiative is the Company’s strategy of serving clients\nthrough a combination of technology and skilled advisors—a “high tech, high touch” approach that the Company\nbelieves clients demand and deserve. One Alerus lays the strategic foundation for current and future technology\ninvestments and the synergistic growth strategies of a diversified financial services firm. It also brings together the\nCompany’s product and service offerings in a unified way, which the Company believes differentiates itself from\ncompetitors and allows the Company to impact clients more meaningfully and generate long term value for the\nCompany. The primary components of One Alerus are:\n the Company puts the client first in every decision it makes;\n the Company provides comprehensive products and services, including banking, mortgage, wealth\nmanagement, and retirement and benefits;\n the Company’s diverse business model providing revenue funding and growth opportunities;\n each client is paired with a primary point of contact to help with individual needs and integrate specialists\nwhen needed;\n proactively invest in technology to integrate all business lines and enhance client engagement; and\n the Company consistently seeks new ways to improve the client experience and enhance efficiencies to\nbuild scalability.\nThrough One Alerus, the Company strives to provide each client with a primary point of contact—a trusted\nadvisor—who takes the time to develop an in depth understanding of the client’s needs and goals. The Company’s\nadvisors work holistically with clients in a guidance-based manner to proactively help them with their financial\ndecisions. The Company’s products and services include traditional bank offerings such as checking accounts, debit\ncards, savings accounts, personal and business loans, credit cards, online banking, mobile banking / wallet, private\nbanking, deposit and payment solutions, and mortgages, as well as fee income services such as individual retirement\naccounts, or IRAs, 401(k) rollovers, retirement planning, employer sponsored plans, employee stock ownership plans,\nhealth savings account, or HSA, flex spending account, or FSA, administration and government health insurance\nprogram services, and wealth management services such as advisory, investment management, and trust and fiduciary\nservices. The advisor is equipped to tailor this diverse set of products and services to each client’s unique goals and is\nempowered to reach across the Company’s organization to bring the client in contact with product specialists as needed.\nOne Alerus bridges the gaps between the Company’s business units with a focus on client advocacy. The Company\n6\nbelieves the One Alerus initiative will enable the Company to achieve future organic growth by leveraging its existing\nclient base and help continue to provide strong returns to the Company’s stockholders.\nThe trusted advisor relationship is supported and enhanced through an integrated client access portal called “My\nAlerus.” By collaborating with a key technology partner, the Company has integrated the diverse client applications of\nthe Company’s full product suite into a unified system and layered in new technology to bring a client’s entire financial\npicture into one view. For example, a client who has multiple products with the Company, such as banking accounts, a\nmortgage, wealth management accounts, a retirement account, and a health benefit account, can now access all of these\naccounts online and effect transactions via one, single login through My Alerus. Instead of being forced to use different\nusernames and passwords for each system, the Company has created a single login dashboard to access the most used\ninformation on client accounts and coupled that with the ability to link into more detailed information within each\ntransaction system (banking, retirement, and benefits, wealth management and mortgage). The Company’s clients can\nfurther personalize their dashboard by integrating or linking financial accounts held at other institutions into My Alerus.\nOnce the Company’s clients have integrated or linked all of their financial information, the data can be used to create a\ncustom financial fitness score to help clients save for emergencies, plan for retirement, manage their debt, optimize\nhealth savings and protect them from unexpected events with insurance.\nOn July 1, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of MPB BHC, Inc., the holding company of Metro\nPhoenix Bank. The primary reasons for the acquisition were to expand the Company’s business in the Phoenix-Mesa-\nScottsdale metropolitan statistical area, or Phoenix MSA, and grow the size of the Company’s business. As consideration\nfor the merger, the Company issued $64.0 million of its common stock (valued at $23.81 per share as of July 1, 2022) in\na stock-for-stock transaction. As a result of the acquisition, the Company acquired $270.4 million in loans and $353.7\nmillion in deposits from Metro Phoenix Bank.\nBanking\nLending. Through the Company’s relationship-oriented lending approach, the Company’s strategy is to offer a\nbroad range of customized commercial and consumer lending products for the personal investment and business needs of\nthe Company’s clients. The Company’s commercial lending products include commercial loans, business term loans and\nlines of credit for a diversified mix of small and midsized businesses. The Company offers both owner occupied and\nnon-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, as well as construction and land development loans. The Company’s\nconsumer lending products include residential first mortgage loans. In addition to originating these loans for the\nCompany’s own portfolio, it originates and sells, primarily servicing released, whole loans in the secondary market. The\nCompany’s mortgage loan sales activities are primarily directed at originating single family mortgages, which generally\nconform to Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation guidelines and are\ndelivered to the investor shortly after funding. Additionally, the Company offers installment loans and lines of credit,\ntypically to facilitate investment opportunities for consumer clients whose financial characteristics support the request.\nThe Company also provides clients loans collateralized by cash and marketable securities.\nThe Company’s loan portfolio includes commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans,\nconsumer loans, which include residential real estate loans, indirect auto loans and other consumer loans, and a small\namount of agricultural loans. The principal risk associated with each category of loans the Company makes is the\ncreditworthiness of the borrower. Borrower creditworthiness is affected by general economic conditions and the\nattributes of the borrower and the borrower’s market or industry. The Company underwrites for strong cash flow,\nmultiple sources of repayment, adequate collateral, borrower experience and backup guarantors. Attributes of the\nrelevant business market or industry include the competitive environment, client and supplier availability, the threat of\nsubstitutes, and barriers to entry and exit.\nDeposits. The Company provides a broad range of deposit products and services, including demand deposits,\ninterest-bearing transaction accounts, money market accounts, time and savings deposits, and certificates of deposit.\nCore deposits, which consist of noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing checking accounts, certificates of deposit\nless than $250,000, and money market accounts, provide the Company’s major source of funds from individuals,\nbusinesses and local governments. As of December 31, 2023, core deposits totaled $3.0 billion or 96.1% of the\nCompany’s total deposits. The Company’s deposit portfolio includes synergistic deposits from the retirement and\n7\nbenefits services and wealth management segments. As of December 31, 2023, these synergistic deposits totaled $851.5\nmillion. The Company also offers an HSA deposit program to attract low cost deposits. As of December 31, 2023, the\nCompany had $176.7 million of HSA deposits which are included in the synergistic deposit total.\nThe Company offers a range of treasury management products, including electronic receivables management,\nremote deposit capture, cash vault services, merchant services, and other cash management services. Deposit flows are\nsignificantly influenced by general and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, internal pricing\ndecisions and competition. The Company’s deposits are primarily obtained from depositors located in the Company’s\ngeographic footprint, and the Company believes that it has attractive opportunities to capture additional deposits in the\nCompany’s markets. In addition, the Company has created a National Market to focus on growing the synergistic\ndeposits from the retirement and benefits services and wealth management segments. In order to attract and retain\ndeposits, the Company relies on providing quality service, offering a suite of consumer and commercial products and\nservices and introducing new products and services that meet the Company’s clients’ needs as they evolve.\nRetirement and Benefit Services\nThe Company’s retirement and benefit services business offers retirement plan administration and investment\nadvisory services, employee stock ownership plan, or ESOP, administration, fiduciary services, HSA and other benefit\nservices to clients on a nationwide basis. A breakdown of these services is as follows:\n Advisory. The Company provides investment fiduciary services to retirement plans.\n Retirement. The Company provides recordkeeping and administration services to qualified retirement\nplans.\n ESOP Administration. The Company provides recordkeeping and administration services to employee\nstock ownership plans.\n Health and Welfare. The Company provides HSA, FSA, and government health insurance program\nrecordkeeping and administration services to employers.\nWealth Management\nThe Company’s wealth management division provides fiduciary services to consumer and commercial clients.\nThese services include financial planning, investment management, personal and corporate trust services, estate\nadministration, and custody services. In addition, the wealth management division offers brokerage services to\ncompliment the unique needs of its clients. The Company’s investment management services offer two unique and\nproprietary strategies called Dimension and Blueprint, which are primarily targeted toward IRAs, and agency account\nrelationships. A Dimension account is a proprietary, separately managed account designed for individual investors,\nfoundations, endowments and institutions with assets typically greater than $500 thousand. Dimension accounts use\nactively managed portfolios consisting of individual securities, mutual funds, and exchange traded funds selected and\nmonitored by a centralized team of investment professionals. A Blueprint account uses a series of models that are\ndesigned to help investors gain exposure to a diversified, risk-based asset allocation. Portfolios in these accounts are\ncomprised of mutual funds run by consistent, low-cost fund managers, with the Bank conducting initial and ongoing\nfund monitoring of the model allocations and rebalancing the portfolios on a regular basis.\nMortgage\nThe Company’s mortgage business offers first and second mortgage loans through a centralized mortgage unit\nlocated in Minneapolis, Minnesota, as well as through the Company’s banking office locations. These loans typically\nenable borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes, most of which serve as the primary residence of the owner. In\n2023, approximately 97.0% of the loans made by the mortgage division were for the purchase of a residential property,\ncompared to 3.0% for the refinance of an existing mortgage. The Company sources most residential mortgage loans from\nthe Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington metropolitan statistical area, or the Twin Cities MSA, and for the year ended\n8\nDecember 31, 2023, approximately 85.6% of the total mortgage loans were attributable to that market, compared to\n9.4% attributable to the North Dakota market and 5.0% attributable to the Phoenix MSA. The Company believes there is\nan opportunity to expand the mortgage loan pipeline in these other markets, especially in the Phoenix MSA. Although\nthe Company originates loans for its own portfolio, the Company also conducts mortgage banking activities in which it\noriginates and sells, servicing released, whole loans in the secondary market. Typically, loans with a fixed interest rate of\ngreater than 10 years are available-for-sale and sold on the secondary market. The Company’s mortgage banking loan\nsales activities are primarily directed at originating single family mortgages that are priced and underwritten to conform\nto previously agreed criteria before loan funding and are delivered to the investor shortly after funding. The level of\nfuture loan originations, loan sales, and loan repayments depends on overall credit availability, the interest rate\nenvironment, the strength of the general economy, local real estate markets and the housing industry, and conditions in\nthe secondary loan sale market. The amount of gain or loss on the sale of loans is primarily driven by market conditions\nand changes in interest rates, as well as the Company’s pricing and asset liability management strategies. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company had mortgage loans held for sale of $11.5 million from the residential mortgage loans\noriginated. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company’s mortgage segment originated $364.1 million of\nmortgage loans.\nThe Company’s Banking Market Areas\nThe Company’s primary banking market areas are the states of North Dakota, Minnesota, specifically, the Twin\nCities MSA, and Arizona, specifically, the Phoenix MSA. In addition to offices located in the Company’s banking\nmarkets, the retirement and benefit services business administers plans in all 50 states through offices located in\nColorado, Michigan, and Minnesota.\nNorth Dakota\nThe Company’s corporate headquarters, which is a full-service banking office located at 401 Demers Avenue,\nGrand Forks, North Dakota 58201, primarily serves the eastern North Dakota market along with two other full-service\nbanking offices located in Grand Forks, North Dakota, three full-service banking offices located in Fargo and West\nFargo, North Dakota, and one full-service banking office located in Northwood, North Dakota. The Company believes\nthis market is rich in low-cost, core deposits and is strengthened by the Bakken Oil region. The Company can use these\nlow-cost, core deposits to fund loans in higher-growth metropolitan markets.\nThe State of North Dakota also features one of the only state-owned banks in the nation, the Bank of North\nDakota, which offers services, many of which are similar to those offered by a correspondent bank, only to banks like\nthe Company that are headquartered in the state. The Bank of North Dakota expands the Company’s lending capacity by\npurchasing participations from the Bank. In addition, the Bank of North Dakota offers the Company additional financing\noptions such as bank stock loans, lines of credit and subordinated debt at competitive rates. Finally, the Bank of North\nDakota enables state banks to take deposits and manage funds for municipal and county governments without meeting\ncollateral requirements, which are waived by a letter of credit from the Bank of North Dakota.\nMinnesota\nThe Company serves the Minnesota market through six full-service banking offices all located in the Twin\nCities MSA. The Twin Cities MSA had total deposits of $237.6 billion as of June 30, 2023, and ranks as the 14th largest\nmetropolitan statistical area in the United States in total deposits, based on FDIC data. The Twin Cities MSA is defined\nby attractive market demographics, including strong household incomes, dense populations, low unemployment, and the\npresence of a diverse group of large and small national and international businesses making the Twin Cities MSA one of\nthe most economically vibrant and diverse markets in the country.\nArizona\nThe Company serves the Arizona market through full-service banking offices located in Phoenix and\nScottsdale, Arizona. The Phoenix MSA had total deposits of $167.2 billion as of June 30, 2023, and ranks as the\n20th largest metropolitan statistical area in the United States in total deposits, based on FDIC data. The Phoenix MSA is\n9\ndefined by attractive market demographics, including a large number of high-net-worth households, dense populations,\nlow unemployment, and the presence of a diverse group of small-to-medium sized businesses.\nThe Company’s National Market\nThe Company’s retirement and benefit services business serves clients in all 50 states. It offers retirement and\nbenefit services at all of the Company’s banking offices located in the three primary market areas. In addition, the\nCompany operates one retirement and benefits services office in Minnesota, one in Colorado and one in Michigan. In\naddition, the Company’s National Market President oversees the development of the national market’s client base.\nRetirement and benefit services assets under administration/management, wealth management assets under\nadministration/management, and loans attributable to the National Market were $28.3 billion, $480.2 million, and $8.4\nmillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023, representing approximately 77.1%, 15.2%, and 0.3%, respectively of\ntotal retirement and benefit services assets under administration/management, wealth management assets under\nadministration/management, and loans as of that date.\nCompetition\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive, and the Company competes in a number of areas,\nincluding commercial and consumer banking, residential mortgages, wealth advisory, investment management, trust, and\nrecord-keeping among others. The Company competes with other bank and nonbank institutions located within the\nCompany’s market areas, along with competitors situated regionally, nationally, and others with only an online presence.\nThese include large banks and other financial intermediaries, such as consumer finance companies, brokerage firms,\nmortgage banking companies, business leasing and finance companies, credit unions, Fintech companies and digital\nasset service providers, all actively engaged in providing various types of loans and other financial services. The\nCompany also faces growing competition from online businesses with few or no physical locations, including online\nbanks, lenders and consumer and commercial lending platforms, as well as automated retirement and investment services\nproviders. Competition involves efforts to retain current clients, obtain new loans, deposits, and advisory services,\nincrease the scope and type of services offered, and offer competitive interest rates paid on deposits, charged on loans, or\ncharged for advisory services. The Company believes its integrated and high-touch service offering, along with its\nsophisticated relationship-oriented approach sets the Company apart from competitors.\nHuman Capital Resources\nThe Company and its subsidiaries employed a total of 754 employees as of December 31, 2023, of which\napproximately:\n 709 are full-time employees; and\n 45 are part-time employees.\nThe Company’s workforce further breaks down into the following categories:\n gender: male 269, female 485; and\n ethnicity: 624 white, 130 identify as either Native American Indian, Asian, African American,\nHispanic, Latino, or not specified.\nThe Company has four operating segments with the following employees:\n Banking: 246 employees;\n Mortgage: 47 employees;\n10\n Retirement and Benefits: 243 employees; and\n Wealth Management: 56 employees.\nThe staff and support divisions include:\n Client Service Center: 39 employees; and\n Human Resources, Information Technology, Marketing, Audit, Legal, Compliance, and the Executives\nstaff areas: 123 employees.\nBanking is a people- and relationship-driven business and the Company’s employees are vital to the Company’s\nsuccess in the financial services industry. In short, the Company’s long-term success depends on the Company’s ability\nto attract and retain top performers in every aspect of the Company’s business. The Company believes a diverse\nworkforce better enables the Company to understand its client base, and to help its clients meet their own goals and\nexpectations.\nThe Company’s culture is underpinned by its core values: Do the Right Thing (lead with integrity and provide\nvalued advice and guidance), Passion for Excellence (act with accountability and a sense of urgency to best serve clients\nand achieve exceptional results), Success is Never Final (embrace opportunities to adapt and grow with our industry and\nour clients), and One Alerus (working together to provide purpose-driven products and services for our clients).\nThe Company’s Talent Management Program is built on the foundation of Alerus leadership essentials, which\ninclude 12 competencies, divided into four elements of success: Charting the Course, Achieving Results, Leading\nPeople, and Managing Self. Through this program the Company builds on strengths with continuous, real-time coaching\nand evaluation in areas of development, all aligned with the Company’s goals and strategies.\nThe development, attraction and retention of employees is a critical success factor for the Company for\nsuccession planning and sustaining its core values. To support the advancement of the Company’s employees, it offers\ntraining and development programs encouraging advancement from within and continues to fill its team with strong and\nexperienced management talent. The Company leverages both formal and informal programs to identify, foster, and\nretain top talent at both the corporate and operating unit level.

Manager Connection\nprovides managers across the Company an opportunity to learn together and share best practices for developing and\nleading teams.\nThe Company’s compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of its employees with the\nCompany’s performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve\nsuperior results. The structure of the Company’s compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term\nand long-term performance. Specifically, the Company compensates most of its employees through a combination of\nbase salary, sales incentive programs, an annual performance bonus program tied to company success measures and a\nlong-term equity program tied to Company long-term performance. Each element of compensation is designed to\nachieve a compensation package that is competitive in the Company’s markets and within the Company’s industry. The\nCompany hired compensation consultants FW Cook to perform compensation analysis and benchmarking compared to\nthe peer group for executive compensation plans. For all other areas, the Company hired McLagan a division of Aon, to\nprovide benchmarking and analysis for base salary structures and sales incentive programs.\nThe Company’s benefits package provides employees medical, dental, vision, life, disability and accidental\ndeath insurance and paid time off benefits. The Company also provides its employees with retirement benefits designed\nto assist employees with planning for and securing appropriate levels of income during retirement. The Company\nbelieves these plans help attract and retain quality employees by offering benefits comparative with those offered by\ncompetitors.\n11\nThe Company provides policies and training on ethical conduct.

The Company’s website address is\nwww.alerus.com. The information contained on the Company’s website is not a part of, or incorporated by reference\ninto, this report. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other\ninformation regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, as the Company does. The website is www.sec.gov.\nThe Company provides access to its SEC filings for viewing or downloading free of charge through its website at\nwww.alerus.com. After accessing the website, the filings are available upon selecting “Investor Relations” and “SEC\nFilings.” Reports available include the Company’s proxy statements, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on\nForm 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after the\ndocuments and reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\nGeneral\nAlerus Financial Corporation, a financial holding company, and its subsidiary, Alerus Financial, N.A., a\nnational banking association, are extensively regulated under federal law. As a result, the Company’s growth and\nearnings performance may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by\nthe requirements of applicable statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including\nthe Company’s primary regulator, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or Federal Reserve, and the\nBank’s primary regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or OCC, as well as the FDIC, as the insurer of\nthe Company’s deposits, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, as the regulator of consumer financial\nservices and their providers. Furthermore, taxation laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing\nauthorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, securities laws\nadministered by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and state securities authorities, and anti-money\nlaundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or Treasury, have an impact on the Company’s\nbusiness. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and accounting rules are significant to the\nCompany’s operations and results.\nFederal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on\nthe operations of FDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies and affiliates that is intended primarily for the\nprotection of the FDIC-insured deposits and depositors of banks, rather than stockholders. These federal and state laws,\nand the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of the\nCompany’s business; the kinds and amounts of investments the Company may make; required capital levels relative to\nthe Company’s assets; the nature and amount of collateral for loans; the establishment of branches; the Company’s\nability to merge, consolidate and acquire; dealings with insiders and affiliates; and the Company’s payment of dividends.\nIn reaction to the global financial crisis and particularly following passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act of 2010, or Dodd-Frank Act, the Company experienced heightened regulatory requirements\nand scrutiny. Although the reforms primarily targeted systemically important financial service providers, their influence\nfiltered down in varying degrees to community banks over time and caused the Company’s compliance and risk\nmanagement processes, and the costs thereof, to increase. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer\nProtection Act of 2018, or Regulatory Relief Act, eliminated questions about the applicability of certain Dodd-Frank Act\nreforms to community bank systems, including relieving the Company of any requirement to engage in mandatory stress\ntests, maintain a risk committee or comply with the Volcker Rule’s complicated prohibitions on proprietary trading and\nownership of private funds. The Company believes these reforms have been favorable to operations.\n12\nThe supervisory framework for U.S. banking organizations subjects banks and bank holding companies to\nregular examination by their respective regulatory agencies, which results in examination reports and ratings that are not\npublicly available and that can impact the conduct and growth of their business. These examinations consider not only\ncompliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and\nperformance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to\nimpose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other\nthings, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with\nlaws and regulations.\nThe following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to\nthe Company and the Bank. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor\ndoes it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by\nreference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision.\nThe Role of Capital\nRegulatory capital represents the net assets of a banking organization available to absorb losses. Because of the\nrisks attendant to their business, FDIC-insured institutions generally are required to hold more capital than other\nbusinesses, which directly affects the Company’s earnings capabilities. Although capital has historically been one of the\nkey measures of the financial health of both bank holding companies and banks, its role became fundamentally more\nimportant in the wake of the global financial crisis, as the banking regulators recognized that the amount and quality of\ncapital held by banks prior to the crisis was insufficient to absorb losses during periods of severe stress.\nCapital Levels. Banks have been required to hold minimum levels of capital based on guidelines established by\nthe bank regulatory agencies since 1983. The minimums have been expressed in terms of ratios of “capital” divided by\n“total assets.” The capital guidelines for U.S. banks beginning in 1989 have been based upon international capital\naccords (known as “Basel” rules) adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a committee of central\nbanks and bank supervisors that acts as the primary global standard-setter for prudential regulation, as implemented by\nthe U.S. bank regulatory agencies on an interagency basis. The accords recognized that bank assets for the purpose of the\ncapital ratio calculations needed to be risk weighted (the theory being that riskier assets should require more capital) and\nthat off-balance sheet exposures needed to be factored in the calculations. Following the global financial crisis, the\nGroup of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision,\nannounced agreement on a strengthened set of capital requirements for banking organizations around the world, known\nas Basel III, to address deficiencies recognized in connection with the global financial crisis.\nThe Basel III Rule. The United States bank regulatory agencies adopted the Basel III regulatory capital\nreforms, and, at the same time, effected changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act, in regulations that were effective (with\ncertain phase-ins) in 2015. Basel III established capital standards for banks and bank holding companies that are\nmeaningfully more stringent than those in place previously: it increased the required quantity and quality of capital; and\nit required a more complex, detailed and calibrated assessment of risk in the calculation of risk weightings. The Basel III\nRule is applicable to all banking organizations that are subject to minimum capital requirements, including federal and\nstate banks and savings and loan associations, as well as to most bank and savings and loan holding companies. The\nCompany and the Bank are each subject to the Basel III Rule.\nNot only did Basel III increase most of the required minimum capital ratios in effect prior to January 1, 2015,\nbut, in requiring that forms of capital be of higher quality to absorb loss, it introduced the concept of Common Equity\nTier 1 Capital, which consists primarily of common stock, related surplus (net of Treasury stock), retained earnings, and\nCommon Equity Tier 1 minority interests subject to certain regulatory adjustments. The Basel III Rule also changed the\ndefinition of capital by establishing more stringent criteria that instruments must meet to be considered Additional Tier 1\nCapital (primarily non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock that meets certain requirements) and Tier 2 Capital\n(primarily other types of preferred stock and subordinated debt, subject to limitations). The Basel III Rule also\nconstrained the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, and deferred tax assets in capital and required\ndeductions from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital if such assets exceeded a percentage of a banking institution’s\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital.\n13\nThe Basel III Rule requires minimum capital ratios as follows:\n A ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets;\n A ratio of Tier 1 Capital equal to 6% of risk-weighted assets;\n A continuation of the minimum required amount of Total Capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) at 8% of risk-\nweighted assets; and\n A leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total quarterly average assets equal to 4% in all circumstances.\nIn addition, institutions that want to make capital distributions (including for dividends and repurchases of\nstock) and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction must also maintain 2.5% in Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital attributable to a capital conservation buffer. The purpose of the conservation buffer is to ensure\nthat banking institutions maintain a buffer of capital that can be used to absorb losses during periods of financial and\neconomic stress. Factoring in the conservation buffer increases the minimum ratios depicted above to 7% for Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital, 8.5% for Tier 1 Capital and 10.5% for Total Capital.\nWell-Capitalized Requirements. The ratios described above are minimum standards for banking organizations\nto be considered “adequately capitalized.” Bank regulatory agencies uniformly encourage banks to hold more capital and\nbe “well-capitalized” and, to that end, federal law and regulations provide various incentives for banking organizations\nto maintain regulatory capital at levels in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. For example, a banking\norganization that is well-capitalized may: (i) qualify for exemptions from prior notice or application requirements\notherwise applicable to certain types of activities; (ii) qualify for expedited processing of other required notices or\napplications; and (iii) accept, roll-over or renew brokered deposits. Higher capital levels could also be required if\nwarranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual banking organizations. For example, the Federal\nReserve’s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of, among\nother things, interest rate risk, or the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading\nactivities. Further, any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth would be expected to\nmaintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions (i.e., Tier 1 Capital less all intangible assets), well above the\nminimum levels.\nUnder the capital regulations of the Federal Reserve for the Company and the OCC for the Bank, in order to be\nwell capitalized, the Company must maintain:\n A Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio to risk-weighted assets of 6.5% or more;\n A ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8% or more;\n A ratio of Total Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 10% or more; and\n A leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total adjusted average quarterly assets of 5% or greater.\nIt is possible under the Basel III Rule to be well-capitalized while remaining out of compliance with the capital\nconservation buffer discussed above.\nAs of December 31, 2023: (i) the Bank was not subject to a directive from the OCC to increase its capital and\n(ii) the Bank was well-capitalized, as defined by OCC regulations. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had\nregulatory capital in excess of the Federal Reserve’s requirements and met the Basel III Rule requirements to be well-\ncapitalized. The Company also remains in compliance with the capital conservation buffer of 2.5 % as of December 31,\n2023.\n14\nPrompt Corrective Action. The concept of being “well-capitalized” is part of a regulatory regime that provides\nthe federal banking regulators with broad power to take “prompt corrective action” to resolve the problems of depository\ninstitutions based on the capital level of each particular institution. The extent of the regulators’ powers depends on\nwhether the institution in question is “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or\n“critically undercapitalized,” in each case as defined by regulation. Depending upon the capital category to which an\ninstitution is assigned, the regulators’ corrective powers include: (i) requiring the institution to submit a capital\nrestoration plan; (ii) limiting the institution’s asset growth and restricting its activities; (iii) requiring the institution to\nissue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to sell itself; (iv) restricting transactions between the\ninstitution and its affiliates; (v) restricting the interest rate that the institution may pay on deposits; (vi) ordering a new\nelection of directors of the institution; (vii) requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; (viii)\nprohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; (ix) requiring the institution to divest\ncertain subsidiaries; (x) prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and (xi) ultimately,\nappointing a receiver for the institution.\nCommunity Bank Capital Simplification. Community banks have long raised concerns with bank regulators\nabout the regulatory burden, complexity, and costs associated with certain provisions of the Basel III Rule. In response,\nCongress provided an “off-ramp” for institutions, like us, with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. Section\n201 of the Regulatory Relief Act instructed the federal banking regulators to establish a single “Community Bank\nLeverage Ratio”, or CBLR, of between 8 and 10%. Under the final rule, a community banking organization is eligible to\nelect the new framework if it has: less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, limited amounts of certain assets and\noff-balance sheet exposures, and a CBLR greater than 9%. The Company has not elected to use the CBLR framework at\nthis time.\nSupervision and Regulation of the Company\nGeneral. The Company, as the sole stockholder of the Bank, is a bank holding company that has elected\nfinancial holding company status. As a bank holding company, the Company is registered with, and subject to\nregulation, supervision and enforcement by, the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as\namended, or the BHCA. The Company is legally obligated to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the\nBank and to commit resources to support the Bank in circumstances where the Company might not otherwise do so.\nUnder the BHCA, the Company is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve and are required to file with\nthe Federal Reserve periodic reports of the Company’s operations and such additional information regarding the\nCompany and the Bank as the Federal Reserve may require.\nAcquisitions and Activities/ Financial Holding Company Election. The primary purpose of a bank holding\ncompany is to control and manage banks. The BHCA generally requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for\nany merger involving a bank holding company or any acquisition by a bank holding company of another bank or bank\nholding company. Subject to certain conditions (including deposit concentration limits established by the BHCA), the\nFederal Reserve may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the United States. In\napproving interstate acquisitions, the Federal Reserve is required to give effect to applicable state law limitations on the\naggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its FDIC-insured institution\naffiliates in the state in which the target bank is located (provided that those limits do not discriminate against out-of-\nstate institutions or their holding companies) and state laws that require that the target bank have been in existence for a\nminimum period of time (not to exceed five years) before being acquired by an out-of-state bank holding company.\nFurthermore, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies must be well-capitalized and well-\nmanaged in order to effect interstate mergers or acquisitions. For a discussion of the capital requirements, see “—The\nRole of Capital” above.\nThe BHCA generally prohibits the Company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more\nthan 5% of a class of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than\nthat of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries. This general\nprohibition is subject to a number of exceptions. The principal exception allows bank holding companies to engage in,\nand to own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the Federal Reserve prior to November 11,\n1999 to be “so closely related to banking ... as to be a proper incident thereto.” This authority permits the Company to\n15\nengage in a variety of banking-related businesses, including the ownership and operation of a savings association, or any\nentity engaged in consumer finance, equipment leasing, the operation of a computer service bureau (including software\ndevelopment) and mortgage banking and brokerage services. The BHCA does not place territorial restrictions on the\ndomestic activities of nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies.\nAdditionally, bank holding companies that meet certain eligibility requirements prescribed by the BHCA and\nelect to operate as financial holding companies may engage in, or own shares in companies engaged in, a wider range of\nnonbanking activities, including securities and insurance underwriting and sales, merchant banking and any other\nactivity that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines by regulation or order is\nfinancial in nature or incidental to any such financial activity or that the Federal Reserve determines by order to be\ncomplementary to any such financial activity, as long as the activity does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or\nsoundness of FDIC-insured institutions or the financial system generally. The Company has elected to operate as a\nfinancial holding company. In order to maintain the Company’s status as a financial holding company, both the\nCompany and the Bank must be well-capitalized, well-managed, and the Bank must have at least a satisfactory CRA\nrating. If the Federal Reserve determines that either the Company or the Bank is not well-capitalized or well-managed,\nthe Federal Reserve will provide a period of time in which to achieve compliance, but during the period of\nnoncompliance, the Federal Reserve may place any limitations on the Company that it deems appropriate. Furthermore,\nif non-compliance is based on the failure of the Bank to achieve a satisfactory CRA rating, the Company would not be\nable to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities.\nChange in Control. Federal law prohibits any person or company from acquiring “control” of an FDIC-insured\ndepository institution or its holding company without prior notice to the appropriate federal bank regulator. “Control” is\nconclusively presumed to exist upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a bank or\nbank holding company, but may arise under certain circumstances between 10% and 24.99% ownership.\nCapital Requirements. The Company is subject to the complex consolidated capital requirements of the Basel\nIII Rule, see “—the Role of Capital” above.\nDividend Payments. The Company’s ability to pay dividends to stockholders may be affected by both general\ncorporate law considerations and policies of the Federal Reserve applicable to bank holding companies. As a Delaware\ncorporation, the Company is subject to the limitations of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL. The\nDGCL allows the Company to pay dividends only out of its surplus (as defined and computed in accordance with the\nprovisions of the DGCL) or if the Company has no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the\ndividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year.\nAs a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the Board of Directors of a bank holding company\nshould eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends to stockholders if: (i) the company’s net income available to\nstockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund\nthe dividends; (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall\ncurrent and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its\nminimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. The Federal Reserve also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding\ncompanies and their nonbank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or\nviolations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of\ndividends by banks and bank holding companies. In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom\nto pay unrestricted dividends will have to maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to the capital\nconservation buffer. See “—The Role of Capital” above.\nMonetary Policy. The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has a significant effect on the operating results of\nfinancial or bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, which was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Among\nthe tools available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open market transactions in U.S. government\nsecurities and changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings. These means are used in varying combinations to\ninfluence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates\ncharged on loans or paid on deposits.\n16\nFederal Securities Regulation. The Company’s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Consequently, the Company is subject to the information,\nproxy solicitation, insider trading and other restrictions and requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act.\nCorporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act addressed many investor protection, corporate governance and\nexecutive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. It increased stockholder influence\nover boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a nonbinding vote on executive compensation and\nso-called “golden parachute” payments, and authorizing the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to\nnominate and solicit voters for their own candidates using a company’s proxy materials. The legislation also directed the\nFederal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of bank holding companies,\nregardless of whether such companies are publicly traded.\nSupervision and Regulation of the Bank\nGeneral. The Bank is a national bank, chartered by the OCC under the National Bank Act. The deposit\naccounts of the Bank are insured by the deposit insurance fund, or DIF, to the maximum extent provided under federal\nlaw and FDIC regulations, currently $250,000 per insured depositor category, and the Bank is a member of the Federal\nReserve System. As a national bank, the Bank is subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement\nrequirements of the OCC, the chartering authority for national banks. The Company’s defined business lines of Banking,\nMortgage, Retirement and Benefits and Wealth Management are each subject to that authority. The FDIC, as\nadministrator of the DIF, also has regulatory authority over the Bank.\nSupervision of Business Segments. As a national bank, the Bank is subject to examination and enforcement by\nthe OCC. The OCC examines the Bank’s Banking and Mortgage business segments as part of its safety and soundness\nexaminations, which consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset\nquality (with rigorous loan portfolio reviews) and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and\nvarious other factors. Many of these subjects are discussed further below.\nThe Bank’s Retirement and Benefits and Wealth Management business segments are subject to separate\nexamination as trust activities (generally on the same cycle as safety and soundness examinations). The OCC’s trust\nexaminations evaluate compliance with applicable law, management ability, operations, internal controls, and auditing,\nearnings, compliance, and asset management. These business segments are subject to a multitude of state laws (trust law\nis a state concept) and federal laws to which the Bank and each individual account are subject. These include trust\ninvestment law, securities law, banking law, tax law, contract law, anti-money laundering requirements, environmental\nlaw, consumer protection law, criminal law, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control\nlaws and regulations. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA, and the Internal Revenue Code\nare the primary sources of law governing the structure, administration, and operation of employee benefit plans. The\nU.S. Department of Labor is primarily responsible for administering and enforcing ERISA.\nThe OCC has broad enforcement authority to impose penalties, restrictions and limitations on the Bank where it\ndetermines, among other things, that the Bank’s operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or\nare otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations.\nDeposit Insurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium\nassessments to the FDIC. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system whereby FDIC-insured institutions pay\ninsurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification. For institutions like the Bank that are not considered large\nand highly complex banking organizations, assessments are now based on examination ratings and financial ratios. The\ntotal base assessment rates currently range from 2.5 basis points to 32 basis points. At least semi-annually, the FDIC\nupdates its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, increases or decreases the assessment rates, following\nnotice and comment on proposed rulemaking.\nFor this purpose, the reserve ratio is the DIF balance divided by estimated insured deposits. In response to the\nglobal financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated\namount of total insured deposits. In its semiannual update in June 2022, the FDIC projected that the reserve ratio was at\n17\nrisk of not reaching the statutory minimum of 1.35 % by September 30, 2028, the statutory deadline. Based on this\nupdate, the FDIC approved an increase in the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules by two basis\npoints, applicable to all insured depository institutions. The increase was effective on January 1, 2023, applicable to the\nfirst quarterly assessment period of the 2023 assessment (January 1 through March 31, 2023).\nIn addition, because the total cost of the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic\nBank was approximately $16.3 billion, the FDIC adopted a special assessment for banks having deposits above $5\nbillion, at an annual rate of 13.4 basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2024 (January 1\nthrough March 31, 2024) with an invoice payment date of June 28, 2024, and will continue to collect special assessments\nfor an anticipated total of eight quarterly assessment periods. The base for the special assessment is equal to an insured\ndepository institution’s estimated uninsured deposits for the December 31, 2022 reporting period, adjusted to exclude the\nfirst $5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits.\nSupervisory Assessments. National banks are required to pay supervisory assessments to the OCC to fund the\noperations of the OCC. The amount of the assessment is calculated using a formula that considers the bank’s size and its\nsupervisory condition. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Bank paid supervisory assessments to the OCC\ntotaling $431 thousand.\nCapital Requirements. Banks are generally required to maintain capital levels in excess of other businesses. For\na discussion of capital requirements, see “—The Role of Capital” above.\nLiquidity Requirements. Liquidity is a measure of the ability and ease with which bank assets may be\nconverted to meet financial obligations such as deposits or other funding sources. Banks are required to implement\nliquidity risk management frameworks that ensure they maintain sufficient liquidity, including a cushion of\nunencumbered, high quality liquid assets, to withstand a range of stress events. The level and speed of deposit outflows\ncontributing to the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank in the first half of 2023 was\nunprecedented and contributed to acute liquidity and funding strain. These events have further underscored the\nimportance of liquidity risk management and contingency funding planning by insured depository institutions like the\nBank.\nThe primary roles of liquidity risk management are to: (i) prospectively assess the need for funds to meet\nfinancial obligations and (ii) ensure the availability of cash or collateral to fulfill those needs at the appropriate time by\ncoordinating the various sources of funds available to the institution under normal and stressed conditions. Basel III\nincludes a liquidity framework that requires the largest insured institutions to measure their liquidity against specific\nliquidity tests. One test, referred to as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, or LCR, is designed to ensure that the banking\nentity has an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets that can be converted easily and immediately in\nprivate markets into cash to meet liquidity needs for a 30-calendar day liquidity stress scenario. The other test, known as\nthe Net Stable Funding Ratio, or NSFR, is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and\nactivities of FDIC-insured institutions over a one-year horizon. These tests provide an incentive for banks and holding\ncompanies to increase their holdings in Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets, increase\nthe use of long-term debt as a funding source and rely on stable funding like core deposits (in lieu of brokered deposits).\nAlthough these tests do not, and will not, apply to the Bank, the Company continues to review its liquidity risk\nmanagement policies in light of regulatory requirements and industry developments.\nDividend Payments. The primary source of funds for the Company is dividends from the Bank. Under the\nNational Bank Act, a national bank may pay dividends out of its undivided profits in such amounts and at such times as\nthe bank’s Board of Directors deems prudent. Without OCC approval, however, a national bank may not pay dividends\nin any calendar year that, in the aggregate, exceed that bank’s year-to-date income plus the bank’s retained net income\nfor the two preceding years. The payment of dividends by any FDIC-insured institution is affected by the requirement to\nmaintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and an FDIC-insured\ninstitution generally is prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the institution would be\nundercapitalized. As described above, the Bank exceeded its capital requirements under applicable guidelines as of\nDecember 31, 2023. Notwithstanding the availability of funds for dividends, however, the OCC may prohibit the\n18\npayment of dividends by the Bank if it determines such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. In\naddition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom to pay dividends have to maintain 2.5% in Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital attributable to the capital conservation buffer. See “—The Role of Capital” above.\nInsider Transactions. The Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on “covered\ntransactions” between the Bank and its “affiliates.” The Company is an affiliate of the Bank for purposes of these\nrestrictions, and covered transactions subject to the restrictions include extensions of credit to the Company, investments\nin the stock or other securities of the Company and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of the Company as\ncollateral for loans made by the Bank. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced the requirements for certain transactions with\naffiliates, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and an increase in the amount of time for\nwhich collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained.\nCertain limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by the Bank to its\ndirectors and officers, to directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries, to principal stockholders of the\nCompany and to “related interests” of such directors, officers and principal stockholders. In addition, federal law and\nregulations may affect the terms on which any person who is a director or officer of the Company or the Bank, or a\nprincipal stockholder of the Company, may obtain credit from banks with which the Bank maintains a correspondent\nrelationship.\nSafety and Soundness Standards/Risk Management. FDIC-insured institutions are expected to operate in a\nsafe and sound manner. The federal banking agencies have adopted operational and managerial standards to promote the\nsafety and soundness of such institutions that address internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan\ndocumentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality\nand earnings.\nIn general, the safety and soundness standards prescribe the goals to be achieved in each area, and each\ninstitution is responsible for establishing its own procedures to achieve those goals. If an institution fails to operate in a\nsafe and sound manner, the FDIC-insured institution’s primary federal regulator may require the institution to submit a\nplan for achieving and maintaining compliance. If an FDIC-insured institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance\nplan, or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan that has been accepted by its primary federal\nregulator, the regulator is required to issue an order directing the institution to cure the deficiency. Until the deficiency\ncited in the regulator’s order is cured, the regulator may restrict the FDIC-insured institution’s rate of growth, require the\nFDIC-insured institution to increase its capital, restrict the rates that the institution pays on deposits or require the\ninstitution to take any action that the regulator deems appropriate under the circumstances. Operating in an unsafe or\nunsound manner will also constitute grounds for other enforcement action by the federal bank regulatory agencies,\nincluding cease and desist orders and civil money penalty assessments.\nDuring the past decade, the bank regulatory agencies have increasingly emphasized the importance of sound\nrisk management processes and strong internal controls when evaluating the activities of the FDIC-insured institutions\nthat they supervise. Properly managing risks has been identified as critical to the conduct of safe and sound banking\nactivities and has become even more important as new technologies, product innovation, and the size and speed of\nfinancial transactions have changed the nature of banking markets. The agencies have identified a spectrum of risks\nfacing a banking institution including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal and reputational risk.\nThe key risk themes identified for 2023 are discussed under Item 1A - Risk Factors. The Bank is expected to have active\nboard and senior management oversight; adequate policies, procedures and limits; adequate risk measurement,\nmonitoring and management information systems; and comprehensive internal controls.\nPrivacy and Cybersecurity. The Bank is subject to many U.S. federal and state laws and regulations governing\nrequirements for maintaining policies and procedures to protect non-public confidential information of their customers.\nThese laws require the Bank to periodically disclose its privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such\ninformation and permit consumers to opt out of their ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under\ncertain circumstances. They also impact the Bank’s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates\nfor marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. In addition, as a part of its\noperational risk mitigation, the Bank is required to implement a comprehensive information security program that\n19\nincludes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records\nand information and to require the same of its service providers. These security and privacy policies and procedures are\nin effect across all business lines and geographic locations.\nBranching Authority. National banks headquartered in North Dakota, such as the Bank, have the same\nbranching rights in North Dakota as banks chartered under North Dakota law, subject to OCC approval. North Dakota\nlaw grants North Dakota-chartered banks the authority to establish branches anywhere in the State of North Dakota,\nsubject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals. The Dodd-Frank Act permits well-capitalized and well-managed\nbanks to establish new branches across state lines without legal impediments. However, while Federal law permits state\nand national banks to merge with banks in other states, such mergers are subject to: (i) regulatory approval; (ii) federal\nand state deposit concentration limits; and (iii) state law limitations requiring the merging bank to have been in existence\nfor a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) prior to the merger.\nFinancial Subsidiaries. Under federal law and OCC regulations, national banks are authorized to engage,\nthrough “financial subsidiaries,” in any activity that is permissible for a financial holding company and any activity that\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Federal Reserve, determines is financial in nature or incidental to\nany such financial activity, except (i) insurance underwriting, (ii) real estate development or real estate investment\nactivities (unless otherwise permitted by law), (iii) insurance company portfolio investments and (iv) merchant banking.\nThe authority of a national bank to invest in a financial subsidiary is subject to a number of conditions, including, among\nother things, requirements that the bank must be well-managed and well-capitalized (after deducting from capital the\nbank’s outstanding investments in financial subsidiaries). The Bank has not applied for approval to establish any\nfinancial subsidiaries.\nFederal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB, which serves as a central credit\nfacility for its members. The FHLB is funded primarily from proceeds from the sale of obligations of the FHLB system.\nIt makes loans to member banks in the form of FHLB advances. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully\ncollateralized as determined by the FHLB.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act Requirements. The CRA requires the Bank to have a continuing and affirmative\nobligation in a safe and sound manner to help meet the credit needs of the entire community, including low- and\nmoderate-income neighborhoods. Federal regulators regularly assess the Bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of its\ncommunities. Applications for acquisitions would be affected by the evaluation of the Bank’s effectiveness in meeting\nits CRA requirements.\nOn October 24, 2023, the bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to strengthen and modernize the CRA\nregulations (the “CRA Rule”). The CRA Rule is designed to update how CRA activities qualify for consideration, where\nCRA activities are considered, and how CRA activities are evaluated. More specifically, the bank regulatory agencies\ndescribed the goals of the CRA Rule as follows: (i) to expand access to credit, investment, and basic banking services in\nlow and moderate income communities; (ii) to adapt to changes in the banking industry, including mobile and internet\nbanking by modernizing assessment areas while maintaining a focus on branch based areas; (iii) to provide greater\nclarity, consistency, and transparency in the application of the regulations through the use of standardized metrics as part\nof CRA evaluation and clarifying eligible CRA activities focused on low and moderate income communities and\nunderserved rural communities; (iv) to tailor CRA rules and data collection to bank size and business model; and (v) to\nmaintain a unified approach among the regulators. Management of the Bank is assessing the impact of the CRA Rule on\nits CRA lending and investment activities in its markets.\nAnti-Money Laundering. The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) is the common name for a series of laws and\nregulations enacted in the United States to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism. They are designed\nto deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the U.S. financial system and have significant implications\nfor FDIC-insured institutions and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The so-called Anti-Money\nLaundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (“AML/CFT”) regime under the BSA provides a foundation to\npromote financial transparency and deter and detect those who seek to misuse the U.S. financial system to launder\ncriminal proceeds, finance terrorist acts or move funds for other illicit purposes.\n20\nThe laws mandate financial services companies to have policies and procedures with respect to measures\ndesigned to address: (i) customer identification programs; (ii) money laundering; (iii) terrorist financing; (iv) identifying\nand reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions; (v) currency crimes; and (vi) cooperation between FDIC-\ninsured institutions and law enforcement authorities.\nConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate. Concentration risk exists when FDIC-insured institutions deploy\ntoo many assets to any one industry or segment. A concentration in commercial real estate, or CRE, is one example of\nregulatory concern. The interagency Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management\nPractices guidance, or CRE Guidance, provides supervisory criteria, including the following numerical indicators, to\nassist bank examiners in identifying banks with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that\nmay warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: (i) CRE loans exceeding 300% of capital and increasing 50% or more in the\npreceding three years; or (ii) construction and land development loans exceeding 100% of capital. The CRE Guidance\ndoes not limit banks’ levels of CRE lending activities, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management\npractices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentrations. On\nDecember 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies issued a statement to reinforce prudent risk-management practices\nrelated to CRE lending, having observed substantial growth in many CRE asset and lending markets, increased\ncompetitive pressures, rising CRE concentrations in banks, and an easing of CRE underwriting standards. The federal\nbank agencies reminded FDIC-insured institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise prudent risk-\nmanagement practices to identify, measure, monitor, and manage the risks arising from CRE lending. In addition, FDIC-\ninsured institutions must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentration risk.\nBased on the Bank’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2023, the Company did not exceed the guidelines for\nCRE lending.\nConsumer Financial Services. The historical structure of federal consumer protection regulation applicable to\nall providers of consumer financial products and services changed significantly on July 21, 2011, when the CFPB\ncommenced operations to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority\nfor a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all providers of consumer products and services, including the\nBank, as well as the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB has examination\nand enforcement authority over providers with more than $10 billion in assets. FDIC-insured institutions with $10 billion\nor less in assets, like the Bank, continue to be examined by their applicable bank regulators.\nBecause abuses in connection with residential mortgages were a significant factor contributing to the global\nfinancial crisis, many rules issued by the CFPB, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act addressed mortgage and mortgage-\nrelated products, their underwriting, origination, servicing and sales. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded\nunderwriting requirements applicable to loans secured by 1-4 family residential real property and augmented federal law\ncombating predatory lending practices. In addition to numerous disclosure requirements, the Dodd-Frank Act and the\nCFPB’s enabling rules imposed new standards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders, including banks and savings\nassociations, in an effort to strongly encourage lenders to verify a borrower’s ability to repay, while also establishing a\npresumption of compliance for certain “qualified mortgages.” The CFPB’s rules have not had a significant impact on the\nBank’s operations, except for higher compliance costs.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in the Company’s common stock involves a high degree of risk. The material risks and uncertainties\nthat management believes affect the Company are described below. Before you decide to invest, you should carefully\nreview and consider the risks described below, together with all other information included in this report and other\ndocuments the Company files with the SEC. Any of the following risks, as well as risks that the Company does not know\nor currently deem immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and growth prospects.\n21\nSummary\nThis is a summary of some of the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affects the\nCompany. The list is not exhaustive but provides a high-level summary of some of the material risks that are further\ndescribed in this Item 1A. The Company encourages you to read Item 1A in its entirety.\nMarket and Interest Rate Risks\n Interest rate risks associated with the Company’s business;\n fluctuations in the values of the securities held in the Company’s securities portfolio; and\n governmental monetary, trade and fiscal policies.\nCredit Risks\n The Company’s ability to successfully manage credit risk, including in the commercial real estate portfolio,\nand maintain an adequate level of allowance for credit losses;\n new or revised accounting standards;\n business and economic conditions in the Company’s market areas;\n the overall health of the local and national real estate market;\n concentrations within the Company’s loan portfolio; and\n the level of nonperforming assets on the Company’s balance sheet.\nOperational, Strategic and Reputational Risks\n The impact of economic or market conditions on the Company’s fee-based services;\n the Company’s ability to implement organic and strategic acquisition growth strategies;\n potential impairment to the goodwill the Company recorded in connection with the Company’s past\nacquisitions;\n the Company’s ability to continue to grow retirement and benefit services business;\n the Company’s ability to continue to originate a sufficient volume of residential mortgages to make the\nmortgage division profitable;\n the occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of the Company’s information security controls\nor cybersecurity-related incidents, including those employing artificial intelligence;\n interruptions involving the Company’s information technology and telecommunications systems or third-\nparty services;\n potential losses incurred in connection with mortgage loan repurchases;\n22\n the composition of the Company’s executive management team and the Company’s ability to attract and\nretain key personnel;\n labor shortages;\n any material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting; and\n severe weather, natural disasters, effects of climate change, widespread disease or pandemics, acts of war\nor terrorism, civil unrest or other adverse external events.\nLiquidity and Funding Risks\n The Company’s ability to successfully manage liquidity risk, including the Company’s need to access\nhigher cost sources of funds such as fed funds purchased and short-term borrowings;\n concentrations of large depositors who may have deposits above the FDIC insurance limit; and\n the Company’s dependence on dividends from the Bank.\nLegal, Accounting and Compliance Risks\n The effectiveness of the Company’s risk management framework;\n the commencement and outcome of litigation and other legal proceedings and regulatory actions against the\nCompany or to which the Company may become subject;\n the extensive regulatory framework that applies to us; and\n the impact of recent and future legislative and regulatory changes.\nMarket and Interest Rate Risks\nThe Company’s business is subject to interest rate risk, and fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect the\nCompany’s earnings.\nFluctuations in interest rates may negatively affect the Company’s business and may weaken demand for some\nof the Company’s products. The Company’s earnings and cash flows are dependent, in part, on net interest income,\nwhich is the difference between the interest income that the Company earns on interest earning assets, such as loans and\ninvestment securities, and the interest expense that the Company pays on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and\nborrowings. Changes in interest rates might also impact the values of equity and debt securities under management and\nadministration by the retirement and benefit services and wealth management businesses which may have a negative\nimpact on the Company’s fee income. Additionally, changes in interest rates also affect the Company’s ability to fund\noperations with client deposits and the fair value of securities in the Company’s investment portfolio. Therefore, any\nchange in general market interest rates, including changes in federal fiscal and monetary policies, could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIt is currently expected that during 2024, and perhaps beyond, the Federal Open Market Committee of the\nFederal Reserve, or FOMC, will continue to monitor interest rates, in part to reduce the rate of inflation to its preferred\nlevel. In 2023, the FOMC increased at various dates throughout the year the target range for the federal funds rate from\n4.25% to 4.50% to a range of 5.25% to 5.50%. All of these increases were expressly made in response to inflationary\npressures. If the FOMC further increases the targeted federal funds rates, overall interest rates likely will rise, which may\nnegatively impact the entire national economy. In addition, the Company’s net interest income could be adversely\naffected if the rates the Company pays on deposits and borrowings increase more rapidly than the rates the Company\n23\nearns on loans and other assets. Rising interest rates also may reduce the demand for loans and the value of fixed-rate\ninvestment securities. These effects from interest rate changes or from other sustained economic stress or a recession,\namong other matters, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, liquidity, and\nresults of operations.\nThe Company’s interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may react in different degrees to changes\nin market interest rates. Interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate prior to changes in broader\nmarket interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind. The result of these changes to\nrates may cause differing spreads on interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The Company cannot control\nor accurately predict changes in market rates of interest. As a result of the recent interest rate increases, the Company has\nexperienced net interest margin compression as the Company’s interest-earning assets have repriced slower than the\nCompany’s interest-bearing liabilities, which has had a material adverse effect on the Company’s net interest income and\nresults of operations.\nIn addition, the Company could be prevented from increasing the interest rates charged on loans or from\nmaintaining the interest rates offered on deposits and money market savings accounts due to “price” competition from\nother banks and financial institutions with which the Company competes. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had\n$728.1 million of non-maturity, noninterest bearing deposit accounts and $2.0 billion of non-maturity interest bearing\ndeposit accounts. Interest rates for interest-bearing accounts have, throughout 2023, increased in response to a series of\nincreases made by the Federal Reserve in the targeted fed funds rate and market competition. The Company does not\nknow what market rates will be throughout 2024. In 2023, the Company has offered higher interest rates to maintain\ncurrent clients or attract new clients, and as a result, interest expense has increased in recent periods and may increase\nfurther, perhaps materially. If the Company fails to offer interest at a sufficient level to keep these non-maturity deposits,\ncore deposits may be reduced, which would require the Company to obtain funding in other ways or risk slowing future\nasset growth.\nThe Company could recognize losses on securities held in the Company’s securities portfolio, particularly if interest\nrates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the Company’s securities portfolio was approximately $745.4\nmillion, or 19.1% of total assets. Factors beyond the Company’s control can significantly influence and cause potential\nadverse changes to the fair value of securities in the Company’s portfolio. For example, fixed-rate securities acquired by\nthe Company are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but\nare not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities or the Company’s own analysis of the value of the\nsecurities, defaults by the issuers or individual mortgagors with respect to the underlying securities and instability in the\ncredit markets. Any of the foregoing factors, as well as changing economic and market conditions or other factors, could\ncause write-downs and realized or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and\ngrowth prospects. The process for determining whether a write-down is required usually requires complex, subjective\njudgments, which could subsequently prove to have been wrong, about the future financial performance and liquidity of\nthe issuer, the fair value of any collateral underlying the security and whether and the extent to which the principal and\ninterest on the security will ultimately be paid in accordance with its payment terms.\nA large percentage of the Company’s investment securities classified as available-for-sale has fixed interest\nrates. As is the case with many financial institutions, the Company’s emphasis on increasing the development of core\ndeposits, those with no stated maturity date, has resulted in the Company’s interest-bearing liabilities having a shorter\nduration than interest-earning assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because interest rates\nchange over time. As interest rates have increased, the Company’s cost of funds has increased more rapidly than the\nyields on a substantial portion of the Company’s interest-earning assets. In addition, the market value of the Company’s\nfixed-rate assets, for example, investment securities, has declined in recent periods. In line with the foregoing, the\nCompany has experienced and may continue to experience an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities primarily\ndue to raising the rates the Company pays on some of its deposit products to stay competitive within the Company’s\nmarket and an increase in borrowing costs from increases in the federal funds rate.\n24\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had $139.1 million of unrealized losses in its securities portfolio. If the\nCompany is forced to liquidate any of those investments prior to maturity, including because of a lack of liquidity, it\nwould recognize as a charge to earnings the losses attributable to those securities. The Company’s securities portfolio\nhas a weighted average effective duration of 5.0 years, so the Company expects an increase in realized losses if interest\nrates remain elevated or continue to increase in 2024.\nMonetary policies of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of\noperations.\nIn the current environment, economic and business conditions are significantly affected by U.S. monetary\npolicy, particularly the actions of the Federal Reserve in its effort to fight elevated levels of inflation. The Federal\nReserve is mandated to pursue the goals of maximum employment and price stability and, throughout 2022 and 2023,\nmade a series of significant increases to the target Federal Funds rate as part of an effort to combat elevated levels of\ninflation affecting the U.S. economy. This has helped drive a significant increase in prevailing interest rates, however it\nhas had a negative effect on the Company’s net interest income and has harmed the value of the Company’s securities\nportfolio, which had $98.0 million in unrealized losses in available-for-sale investment securities at December 31, 2023.\nThis decline in value has negatively affected the Company’s tangible book value. Higher interest rates can also\nnegatively affect the Company’s customers’ businesses and financial condition, and the value of collateral securing loans\nin the Company’s portfolio.\nGiven the complex factors affecting the strength of the U.S. economy, including uncertainties regarding the\npersistence of inflation, geopolitical developments such as the ongoing conflicts between Israel and Palestine and\nbetween Russia and Ukraine and resulting disruptions in the global energy market, and tight labor market conditions and\nsupply chain issues, there is a meaningful risk that the Federal Reserve and other central banks may raise interest rates\ntoo much, thereby limiting economic growth and potentially causing an economic recession or other political\ninstability. As noted above, this could decrease loan demand, harm the credit characteristics of the Company’s existing\nloan portfolio and decrease the value of collateral securing loans in the portfolio.\nThe Company cannot guarantee that its stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance\nlong-term stockholder value.\nOn December 12, 2023, the Company’s board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program, which\nbecame effective on February 18, 2024, and which authorizes the Company to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of its\ncommon stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions. The new stock repurchase program replaced and superseded\nthe previous 770,000 share stock repurchase program, under which approximately 413,526 shares remained. The new\nstock repurchase program will expire on February 18, 2027. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to\nrepurchase any shares of its common stock, and other than repurchases that have been completed to date, there is no\nassurance that the Company will do so or that the Company will repurchase shares at favorable prices. The repurchase\nprogram may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even if fully implemented, the repurchase program may not\nenhance long-term stockholder value.\nCredit Risks\nThe Company’s business depends on its ability to manage credit risk.\nAs a bank, the Company’s business requires it to manage credit risk; however, default risk may arise from\nevents or circumstances that are difficult to detect, such as fraud, or difficult to predict, such as catastrophic events\naffecting certain industries. As a lender, the Company is exposed to the risk that its borrowers will be unable to repay\ntheir loans according to their terms, and that the collateral securing repayment of their loans, if any, may not be sufficient\nto ensure repayment. In addition, there are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks with respect to the period of\ntime over which the loan may be repaid, proper loan underwriting, changes in economic and industry conditions, and\ninherent in dealing with individual borrowers, including the risk that a borrower may not provide information to the\nCompany about its business in a timely manner, or may present inaccurate or incomplete information to the Company, as\nwell as risks relating to the value of collateral. To manage credit risk, the Company must, among other actions, maintain\n25\ndisciplined and prudent underwriting standards and ensure that the Company’s bankers follow those standards. The\nweakening of these standards for any reason, such as an attempt to attract higher yielding loans, a lack of discipline or\ndiligence by the Company’s employees in underwriting and monitoring loans, or the Company’s inability to adequately\nadapt policies and procedures to changes in economic, or any other conditions affecting borrowers and the quality of the\nCompany’s loan portfolio, may result in loan defaults, foreclosures, and charge-offs and may necessitate that the\nCompany significantly increases the allowance for credit losses, each of which could adversely affect net income. As a\nresult, the Company’s inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nThe Company’s allowance for credit losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb potential losses in its loan portfolio.\nThe Company establishes and maintains its allowance for credit losses at a level that management considers\nadequate to absorb current expected credit losses based on an analysis of the Company’s loan portfolio and current\nmarket environment. The allowance for credit losses represents the Company’s estimate of expected losses in the\nportfolio at each balance sheet date and is based upon relevant information available at such time. The allowance\ncontains provisions for expected losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships, as well as\nexpected losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are not specifically identified. Additions to the allowance for credit\nlosses, which are charged to earnings through the provision for credit losses, are determined based on a variety of\nfactors, including an analysis of the loan portfolio, historical loss experience and an evaluation of current economic\nconditions in the Company’s market area. The actual amount of credit losses is affected by, among other things, changes\nin economic, operating, and other conditions within the Company’s markets, which may be beyond the Company’s\ncontrol, and such losses may exceed current estimates.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.30%,\nand as a percentage of total nonperforming loans was 410.3%. Although management believes that the allowance for\ncredit losses was adequate on such date to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible, losses\nin excess of the existing allowance will reduce net income and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. The Company may also be required to take\nadditional provisions for loan losses in the future to further supplement the allowance for credit losses, either due to\nmanagement’s assessment that the allowance is inadequate or as required by the Company’s banking regulators. The\nCompany’s banking regulators periodically review the Company’s allowance for credit losses and the value attributed to\nnonaccrual loans or to real estate acquired through foreclosure and may require the Company to adjust its determination\nof the value for these items. These adjustments may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nA decline in the business and economic conditions in the Company’s market areas could have a material adverse\neffect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company’s business activities and credit exposure, including real estate collateral for many of its loans, are\nconcentrated in North Dakota, Minnesota and Arizona, although the Company also pursues business opportunities\nnationally. As of December 31, 2023, 89.4% of the loans in the Company’s loan portfolio were made to borrowers who\nlive in or conduct business in those states. This concentration imposes risks from lack of geographic diversification.\nWeak economic conditions in North Dakota, Minnesota or Arizona may affect the Company’s business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and growth prospects, where adverse economic developments, among other things, could\naffect the volume of loan originations, increase the level of nonperforming assets, increase the rate of foreclosure losses\non loans and reduce the value of the Company’s loans and loan servicing portfolio. Weak economic conditions are\ncharacterized by, among other indicators, state and local government deficits, deflation, elevated levels of\nunemployment, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, increased delinquencies on mortgage, consumer and\ncommercial loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity.\nAny regional or local economic downturn that affects North Dakota, Minnesota or Arizona or existing or prospective\nborrowers or property values in such areas may affect the Company and the Company’s profitability more significantly\nand more adversely than the Company’s competitors whose operations are less geographically concentrated. Further, a\ngeneral economic slowdown could decrease the value of the assets under administration, or AUA, and assets under\nmanagement, or AUM, of the Company’s retirement and benefit services and wealth management businesses resulting in\n26\nlower fee income, and clients could potentially seek alternative investment opportunities with other providers, which\ncould also result in lower fee income to us. The Company’s business is also significantly affected by monetary, trade and\nother regulatory policies of the U.S. federal government, its agencies and government-sponsored entities. Changes in any\nof these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond the Company’s control,\nare difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of\noperations and growth prospects.\nContinued elevated levels of inflation could adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition, results of\noperations and growth prospects.\nThe United States has recently experienced elevated levels of inflation, with the consumer price index climbing\napproximately 3.4% in 2023. Continued elevated levels of inflation could have complex effects on the Company’s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition, some of which could be materially adverse. For example, while\nthe Company generally expects any inflation-related increases in the Company’s interest expense to be offset by\nincreases in interest income, inflation-driven increases in the Company’s levels of noninterest expense could negatively\nimpact results of operations. Continued elevated levels of inflation could also cause increased volatility and uncertainty\nin the business environment, which could adversely affect loan demand and the Company’s clients’ ability to repay\nindebtedness. It is possible that governmental responses to the current inflation environment, such as changes to\nmonetary and fiscal policy that are too strict, or the imposition or threatened imposition of price controls, could\nadversely affect the Company’s business. The duration and severity of the current inflationary period cannot be\nestimated with precision.\nBecause a significant portion of the Company’s loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans, negative changes in\nthe economy affecting real estate values and liquidity, as well as environmental factors, could impair the value of\ncollateral securing the Company’s real estate loans and result in loan and other losses.\nAt December 31, 2023, approximately 77.5% of the Company’s total loan portfolio was comprised of loans\nwith real estate as a primary component of collateral. The repayment of such loans is highly dependent on the ability of\nthe borrowers to meet their loan repayment obligations to us, which can be adversely affected by economic downturns\nthat can lead to (i) declines in the rents or decreases in occupancy and, therefore, in the cash flows generated by those\nreal properties on which the borrowers depend to fund their loan payments to us, (ii) decreases in the values of those real\nproperties, which make it more difficult for the borrowers to sell those real properties for amounts sufficient to repay\ntheir loans in full, and (iii) job losses of residential home buyers, which makes it more difficult for these borrowers to\nfund their loan payments. As a result, adverse developments affecting real estate values in the Company’s market areas\ncould increase the credit risk associated with the Company’s real estate loan portfolio. The market value of real estate\ncan fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of interest rates and market conditions in the area in which\nthe real estate is located and some of these values have been negatively affected by the recent rise in prevailing interest\nrates. Adverse changes affecting real estate values, including decreases in office occupancy due to the shift to remote\nworking environments following the COVID-19 pandemic, and the liquidity of real estate in one or more of the\nCompany’s markets could increase the credit risk associated with the Company’s loan portfolio, significantly impair the\nvalue of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect the Company’s ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure\nwithout a loss or additional losses or the Company’s ability to sell those loans on the secondary market. Such declines\nand losses would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations\nand growth prospects. If real estate values decline, it is also more likely that the Company would be required to increase\nthe Company’s allowance for credit losses, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, adverse weather events, including tornados,\nwildfires, flooding, and mudslides, can cause damage to the property pledged as collateral on loans, which could result\nin additional losses upon a foreclosure.\nIn addition, if hazardous or toxic substances are found on properties pledged as collateral, the value of the real\nestate could be impaired. If the Company forecloses on and takes title to such properties, the Company may be liable for\nremediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require the Company to\nincur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property’s value or limit\nthe Company’s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or\n27\nenforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the Company’s exposure to environmental liability. The\nremediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nMany of the Company’s loans are to commercial borrowers, which have a higher degree of risk than other types of\nloans.\nCommercial and industrial loans represented 21.7% of the Company’s total loan portfolio at December 31,\n2023. These loans are often larger and involve greater risks than other types of lending. Because payments on such loans\nare often dependent on the successful operation of the business involved, repayment of such loans is often more sensitive\nthan other types of loans to the general business climate and economy. Accordingly, a challenging business and\neconomic environment generally, or in certain industries, may increase the Company’s risk related to commercial loans.\nIn the current economic environment, the cumulative effects of rising inflation, labor shortages and supply chain\nconstraints and the threat of a recession may adversely affect commercial and industrial loans, especially if general\neconomic conditions worsen. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrowers’\nability to make repayment from their employment and other income and which are secured by real property whose value\ntends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial loans typically are made on the basis of the borrowers’ ability to make\nrepayment from the cash flow of the commercial venture. The Company’s commercial and industrial loans are primarily\nmade based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the collateral underlying the loans. Most\noften, this collateral consists of accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Inventory and equipment may depreciate\nover time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. If the cash flow\nfrom business operations is reduced, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Due to the larger average\nsize of each commercial loan as compared with other loans such as residential loans, as well as collateral that is\ngenerally less readily-marketable, losses incurred on a small number of commercial loans could have a material adverse\neffect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company’s loan portfolio has a large concentration of commercial real estate loans, which involve risks specific\nto real estate values and the health of the real estate market generally.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $1.3 billion of commercial real estate loans, consisting of\n$569.4 million of non-owner occupied loans, $271.6 million of owner occupied loans, $245.1 million of loans secured\nby multifamily residential properties, $124.0 million of construction and land development loans and $40.1 million of\nloans secured by farmland. Commercial real estate loans represented 45.3% of the Company’s total loan portfolio and\n353.4% of the Bank’s total capital at December 31, 2023. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a\nshort period of time as a result of interest rates and market conditions in the area in which the real estate is located and\nsome of these values have been negatively affected by the recent rise in prevailing interest rates. Adverse developments\naffecting real estate values in the Company’s market areas could increase the credit risk associated with the Company’s\nloan portfolio. Additionally, the repayment of commercial real estate loans generally is dependent, in large part, on\nsufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic events,\nincluding decreases in office occupancy due to the shift to remote working environments following the COVID-19\npandemic, or governmental regulations outside of the control of the borrower or lender could negatively impact the\nfuture cash flow and market values of the affected properties. If the loans that are collateralized by real estate become\ntroubled during a time when market conditions are declining or have declined, then the Company may not be able to\nrealize the full value of the collateral that the Company anticipated at the time of originating the loan, which could force\nthe Company to take charge-offs or require the Company to increase the Company’s provision for loan losses, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth\nprospects.\nConstruction and land development loans are based upon estimates of costs and values associated with the complete\nproject. These estimates may be inaccurate, and the Company may be exposed to significant losses on loans for these\nprojects.\nConstruction and land development loans comprised approximately 4.5% of the Company’s total loan portfolio\nas of December 31, 2023. Such lending involves additional risks because funds are advanced upon the security of the\n28\nproject, which is of uncertain value prior to its completion, and costs may exceed realizable values in declining real\nestate markets. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs and the realizable market value of\nthe completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to accurately\nevaluate the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. As a result, construction and\nland development loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the\nsuccess of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property, rather than the ability of the\nborrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If the Company’s appraisal of the value of the completed project\nproves to be overstated or market values or rental rates decline, the Company may have inadequate security for the\nrepayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project. If the Company is forced to foreclose on a project\nprior to or at completion due to a default, the Company may not be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and\naccrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs. In addition, the Company may be required\nto fund additional amounts to complete the project and may have to hold the property for an unspecified period of time\nwhile the Company attempts to dispose of it.\nThe Company’s concentration of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans may result in lower yields and\nprofitability.\nOne-to-four family residential mortgage loans comprised $726.9 million and $679.6 million, or 26.3% and\n27.8%, of the Company’s loan portfolio at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These loans are secured primarily\nby properties located in the states of Minnesota, North Dakota and Arizona. These loans generally have lower yields\nrelative to other loan categories within the Company’s loan portfolio. While these loans may possess higher yields than\ninvestment securities, their repayment characteristics are not as well defined, and they generally possess a higher degree\nof interest rate risk versus other loans and investment securities within the Company’s portfolio. This increased interest\nrate risk is due to the repayment and prepayment options inherent in residential mortgage loans which are exercised by\nborrowers based upon the overall level of interest rates. These residential mortgage loans are generally made on the basis\nof the borrower’s ability to make repayments from his or her employment and the value of the property securing the\nloan. Thus, as a result, repayment of these loans is also subject to general economic and employment conditions within\nthe communities and surrounding areas where the property is located.\nA decline in residential real estate market prices or home sales has the potential to adversely affect the\nCompany’s one-to-four family residential mortgage portfolio in several ways, such as a decrease in collateral values and\nan increase in non-performing loans, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nNonperforming assets take significant time and resources to resolve and adversely affect the Company’s net interest\nincome.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s nonperforming loans (which consist of nonaccrual loans and loans\npast due 90 days or more) totaled $8.7 million, or 0.32% of the Company’s total loan portfolio, and the Company’s\nnonperforming assets (which consist of nonperforming loans, foreclosed assets and other real estate owned) totaled\n$8.8 million, or 0.32% of total assets. In addition, the Company had $3.4 million of accruing loans that were 31-89 days\ndelinquent as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Company’s nonperforming assets adversely affect net interest income in various ways. The Company does\nnot record interest income on nonaccrual loans or foreclosed assets, thereby adversely affecting net income and returns\non assets and equity. When the Company takes collateral in foreclosure and similar proceedings, the Company is\nrequired to mark the collateral to its then-fair market value, which may result in a loss. These nonperforming loans and\nforeclosed assets also increase the Company’s risk profile and the level of capital the Company’s regulators believe is\nappropriate for the Company to maintain in light of such risks. The resolution of nonperforming assets requires\nsignificant time commitments from management, which increases the Company’s loan administration costs and\nadversely affects its efficiency ratio and can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities, and may\nalso involve additional financial resources. If the Company experiences increases in nonperforming loans and\nnonperforming assets, net interest income may be negatively impacted and the Company’s loan administration costs\n29\ncould increase, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company’s high concentration of large loans to certain borrowers may increase the Company’s credit risk.\nThe Company has developed relationships with certain individuals and businesses that have resulted in a\nconcentration of large loans to a small number of borrowers. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s 10 largest\nborrowing relationships accounted for approximately 6.1% of the total loan portfolio. The Company has established an\ninformal, internal limit on loans to one borrower, principal or guarantor, but the Company may, under certain\ncircumstances, consider going above this internal limit in situations where management’s understanding of the industry,\nthe borrower’s business and the credit quality of the borrower are commensurate with the increased size of the loan.\nAlong with other risks inherent in these loans, such as the deterioration of the underlying businesses or property securing\nthese loans, this high concentration of borrowers presents a risk to the Company’s lending operations. If any one of these\nborrowers becomes unable to repay its loan obligations as a result of business, economic or market conditions, or\npersonal circumstances, such as divorce or death, the Company’s nonaccruing loans and the Company’s provision for\nloan losses could increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe small to midsized businesses that the Company lends to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business\ndevelopments, which may impair their ability to repay their loans.\nThe Company lends to small to midsized businesses, which generally have fewer financial resources in terms of\ncapital or borrowing capacity than larger entities, frequently have smaller market share than their competition, may be\nmore vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may\nexperience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair their ability to repay their loans. In\naddition, the success of a small and midsized business often depends on the management talents and efforts of a small\nnumber of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have a material adverse\nimpact on the business and its ability to repay its loan. If general economic conditions negatively impact the markets in\nwhich the Company operates and small to midsized businesses are adversely affected or the Company’s borrowers are\notherwise affected by adverse business developments, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations\nand growth prospects may be materially adversely affected.\nReal estate market volatility and future changes in the Company’s disposition strategies could result in net proceeds\nthat differ significantly from the Company’s foreclosed asset fair value appraisals.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had no foreclosed assets, which typically consist of properties that the\nCompany obtains through foreclosure. Assets acquired through loan foreclosure are included in other assets and are\ninitially recorded at estimated fair value less estimated selling costs. The estimated fair value of foreclosed assets is\nevaluated regularly and any decreases in value along with holding costs, such as taxes, insurance and utilities, are\nreported in noninterest expense.\nIn response to market conditions and other economic factors, the Company may utilize alternative sale\nstrategies other than orderly disposition as part of the Company’s foreclosed asset disposition strategy, such as\nimmediate liquidation sales. In this event, as a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and\nthe variables involved in different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized from such sales transactions could\ndiffer significantly from appraisals, comparable sales and other estimates used to determine the fair value of the\nCompany’s foreclosed assets.\nThe Company’s exposure to home equity lines of credit may increase the potential for loss.\nThe Company’s mortgage loan portfolio consists, in part, of home equity lines of credit. A large portion of\nhome equity lines of credit are originated in conjunction with the origination of first mortgage loans eligible for sale in\nthe secondary market, which the Company typically does not service if the loan is sold. By not servicing the first\nmortgage loans, the Company is unable to track the delinquency status which may indicate whether such loans are at risk\n30\nof foreclosure by others. In addition, home equity lines of credit are initially offered as “revolving” lines of credit\nwhereby the borrowers are only required to make scheduled interest payments during the initial terms of the loans, which\nis generally five or ten years. Thereafter, the borrowers no longer have the ability to make principal draws from the lines\nand the loans convert to a fully-amortizing basis, requiring scheduled principal and interest payments sufficient to repay\nthe loans within a certain period of time, which is generally 15 or 20 years. The conversion of a home equity line of\ncredit to a fully amortizing basis presents an increased level of default risk to the Company since the borrower no longer\nhas the ability to make principal draws on the line, and the amount of the required monthly payment could substantially\nincrease to provide for scheduled repayment of principal and interest. As of December 31, 2023, the unfunded\ncommitment related to home equity lines of credit was $216.1 million.\nOperational, Strategic and Reputational Risks\nNoninterest income represents a significant portion of the Company’s total revenue and may be negatively impacted\nby changes in economic or market conditions and competition.\nA significant portion of the Company’s revenue results from fee-based services provided by the retirement and\nbenefit services business. This contrasts with many other community and regional banks that rely more heavily on\ninterest-based sources of revenue, such as loans and investment securities. For the year ended December 31, 2023,\nnoninterest income represented approximately 47.7% of the Company’s total revenue, which includes net interest\nincome and noninterest income, a significant portion of which is derived from the Company’s retirement and benefit\nservices business. This fee income business presents special risks not borne by other institutions that focus exclusively\non banking. The level of these fees is influenced by several factors, including the number of plans and participants the\nCompany provides retirement, advisory and other services for, the level of transactions within the plans, and the asset\nvalues of the plans whose fees are earned based on the level of assets in the plans. If the Company is unable to maintain\nthe Company’s number of plans, participants and AUA and AUM at historical or greater levels, the Company’s fee\nincome derived from this business may decline. For example, in a typical year the Company expects to experience\noutflows in AUA and AUM due to withdrawals, client turnover, plan terminations, mergers and acquisition activity. In\n2023, the Company experienced outflows of $4.8 billion in the Company’s retirement and benefit services division\npartially offset by inflows of $4.5 billion.\nIn addition, economic, market or other factors that reduce the level or rates of savings in or with the Company’s\nclients, either through reductions in financial asset valuations or through changes in investor preferences, could\nmaterially reduce the Company’s fee revenue. The financial markets and businesses operating in the securities industry\nare highly volatile (meaning that performance results can vary greatly within short periods of time) and are directly\naffected by, among other factors, domestic and foreign economic conditions and general trends in business and finance,\nall of which are beyond the Company’s control. the Company cannot assure you that broad market performance will be\nfavorable in the future. Declines in the financial markets or a lack of sustained growth may result in a corresponding\ndecline in the Company’s performance and may adversely affect the value of the assets that the Company manages. A\ngeneral economic slowdown could decrease the value of the AUA and AUM in the Company’s retirement and benefit\nservices and wealth management businesses and result in clients potentially seeking alternative investment opportunities\nwith other providers, which could result in lower fee income to the Company.\nEven when economic and market conditions are generally favorable, the Company’s investment performance\nmay be adversely affected by the investment style of the Company’s asset managers and the particular investments that\nthey make. To the extent the Company’s future investment performance is perceived to be poor in either relative or\nabsolute terms, the revenues and profitability of the Company’s wealth management business will likely be reduced and\nthe Company’s ability to attract new clients will likely be impaired. In addition, the Company’s management contracts\ngenerally provide for fee payments for wealth management and trust services based on the market value of AUM.\nBecause most contracts provide for a fee based on market values of securities, fluctuations in the underlying securities\nvalues may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s revenue. Fee compression due to competitive pressures has\nresulted in and continues to result in significant pressure to reduce the fees the Company charges for the Company’s\nservices in both the retirement and benefit services and wealth management businesses.\n31\nThe Company may not be successful in implementing the Company’s organic growth strategy, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nPart of the Company’s business strategy is to focus on organic growth, which includes leveraging the\nCompany’s business lines across the Company’s entire client base, enhancing brand awareness and building the\nCompany’s infrastructure. The success of the Company’s organic growth strategy depends on the Company’s ability to\nincrease loans, deposits, AUM and AUA at acceptable risk levels without incurring offsetting increases in noninterest\nexpense. The Company may not be successful in generating organic growth if the Company fails to effectively execute\nthe Company’s integrated One Alerus strategy, or as a result of other factors, including delays in introducing and\nimplementing new products and services and other impediments resulting from regulatory oversight or lack of qualified\npersonnel at the Company’s office locations. In addition, the success of the Company’s organic growth strategy will\ndepend on maintaining sufficient regulatory capital levels and on favorable economic conditions in the Company’s\nprimary market areas. Failure to adequately manage the risks associated with the Company’s anticipated organic growth\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth\nprospects.\nIn addition to the Company’s organic growth strategy, it intends to expand business by acquiring other banks and\nfinancial services companies, but may not be successful in doing so, either because of an inability to find suitable\nacquisition candidates, constrained capital resources or otherwise.\nWhile a key element of the Company’s business strategy is to grow the Company’s banking franchise and\nincrease the Company’s market share through organic growth, the Company intends to take advantage of opportunities\nto acquire other banks and financial services companies, including wealth management and retirement administration\nbusinesses, as such opportunities present themselves. For example, in the third quarter of 2022, the Company completed\nthe acquisition of MPB BHC, Inc., holding company for Metro Phoenix Bank in Phoenix, Arizona. Although the\nCompany intends to continue to grow its business through organic growth and strategic acquisitions, because certain of\nthe Company’s market areas are comprised of mature, rural communities with limited population growth, the Company\nanticipates that much of its future growth will be dependent on the Company’s ability to successfully implement the\nCompany’s acquisition growth strategy. However, the Company may not be able to identify suitable acquisition targets,\nor may not succeed in seizing such opportunities when they arise or in integrating any such banks or financial service\ncompanies within the Company’s existing business framework following acquisition. In addition, even if suitable targets\nare identified, the Company expects to compete for such businesses with other potential bidders, many of which may\nhave greater financial resources than the Company, which may adversely affect the Company’s ability to make\nacquisitions at attractive prices. The Company’s ability to execute on acquisition opportunities may require the Company\nto raise additional capital and to increase the Company’s capital position to support the growth of the Company’s\nfranchise. It will also depend on market conditions over which the Company has no control. Moreover, certain\nacquisitions may require the approval of the Company’s bank regulators, and the Company may not be able to obtain\nsuch approvals on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIf the Company pursues additional strategic acquisitions, it may expose the Company to financial, execution and\noperational risks that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of\noperations and growth prospects.\nSince 2000, the Company has experienced significant growth, both organically and through acquisitions of\nbanks and other financial service providers, including wealth management and retirement administration businesses. The\nCompany plans to continue to grow its business by executing additional strategic acquisitions of all or parts of other\nbanks or financial institutions or through the hiring of teams of employees that fit within the Company’s overall strategy\nand that the Company believes make financial and strategic sense. These acquisitions may result in the Company\nentering new markets.\nIf the Company grows through acquisitions, it may expose the Company to financial, execution and operational\nrisks that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations and\n32\ngrowth prospects. Acquiring other banks and financial service providers involve risks commonly associated with\nacquisitions, including:\n Potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the banks and businesses the Company acquires;\n exposure to potential asset and credit quality issues of the acquired bank or related business;\n difficulty and expense of integrating the operations, culture and personnel of banks and businesses the\nCompany acquires, including higher than expected deposit attrition;\n potential disruption to the Company’s business;\n potential restrictions on the Company’s business resulting from the regulatory approval process;\n an inability to realize the expected revenue increases, costs savings, market presence or other anticipated\nbenefits;\n potential diversion of the Company’s management’s time and attention; and\n the possible loss of key employees and clients of the banks and businesses the Company acquires.\nIn addition to the foregoing, the Company may face additional risks in acquisitions to the extent the Company\nacquires new lines of business or new products, or enter new geographic areas, in which the Company has little or no\ncurrent experience, especially if the Company loses key employees of the acquired operations. If the Company hires a\nnew team of employees, the Company may incur additional expenses relating to their compensation without any\nguarantee that such new team will be successful in generating new business. In addition, if the Company later determines\nthat the value of an acquired business has decreased and that the related goodwill is impaired, an impairment of goodwill\ncharge to earnings would be recognized.\nAcquisitions involve inherent uncertainty and the Company cannot assure you that it will be successful in\novercoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. The Company’s inability to\novercome risks associated with acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company’s retirement and benefit services business relies on acquisitions to maintain and grow the Company’s\nAUA and AUM.\nIn 2023, the Company’s retirement and benefit services business experienced outflows of AUA and AUM of\n$4.8 billion, due to withdrawals, client turnover, plan terminations, and mergers and acquisition activity. the Company\nbelieves this level of runoff is typical in the industry. To maintain and grow this business, the Company believes it needs\nto be an active acquirer and seek to complete acquisitions of retirement administration providers if the Company is able\nto find quality acquisition opportunities. If the Company is unable to source a pipeline of potential acquisitions of\ncompanies that it determines are a good strategic fit for the Company, the Company’s retirement and benefit services\nbusiness may fail to grow or even shrink, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf the Company is unable to continue to originate residential real estate loans and sell them into the secondary\nmarket for a profit, the Company’s noninterest income could decrease.\nThe Company derives a portion of its noninterest income from the origination of residential real estate loans\nand the subsequent sale of such loans into the secondary market. If the Company is unable to continue to originate and\nsell residential real estate loans at historical or greater levels, the Company’s residential real estate loan volume would\ndecrease, which could decrease the Company’s earnings. A rising interest rate environment, general economic\n33\nconditions, market volatility or other factors beyond the Company’s control could adversely affect the Company’s ability\nto originate residential real estate loans. Mortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of\nmortgage interest rates and real estate and refinancing activity. In a lower interest rate environment, the demand for\nmortgage loans and refinancing activity will tend to increase. This has the effect of increasing fee income but could\nadversely impact the estimated fair value of the Company’s mortgage servicing rights as the rate of loan prepayments\nincrease. In a higher interest rate environment, the demand for mortgage loans and refinancing activity will generally be\nlower. This has the effect of decreasing fee income opportunities. As a result of the current rising interest rate\nenvironment, the Company saw continued lower demand for mortgage loans and refinancing activity in 2023. In 2023,\nthe Company originated $364.1 million of mortgage loans, compared to $812.3 million in 2022. The Company expects\nthis trend to continue in 2024.\nThe financial services industry is experiencing an increase in regulatory and compliance requirements related to\nmortgage loan originations necessitating technology upgrades and other changes. If new regulations continue to increase\nand the Company is unable to make technology upgrades, the Company’s ability to originate mortgage loans will be\nreduced or eliminated. Additionally, the Company sells a large portion of its residential real estate loans to third party\ninvestors, and rising interest rates could negatively affect the Company’s ability to generate suitable profits on the sale of\nsuch loans. If interest rates increase after the Company originates the loans, the Company’s ability to market those loans\nis impaired as the profitability on the loans decreases. These fluctuations can have an adverse effect on the revenue the\nCompany generates from residential real estate loans and in certain instances, could result in a loss on the sale of the\nloans.\nIn addition, a prolonged period of illiquidity in the secondary mortgage market, coupled with an increase in\ninterest rates, could reduce the demand for residential mortgage loans and increase investor yield requirements for those\nloans. As a result, the Company may be at higher risk of retaining a larger portion of mortgage loans than in other\nenvironments until they are sold to investors. Any reduction of loan production volumes could have a material adverse\neffect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of the Company’s information security controls or\ncybersecurity related incidents could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and growth prospects.\nAs a financial institution, the Company is susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and\ncybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against the Company, its clients or third parties with whom the\nCompany interacts, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to the Company or its clients, disclosure or\nmisuse of the Company’s information or its client information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against the\nCompany’s clients, litigation or damage to the Company’s reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms,\nincluding check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Information\nsecurity breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by\nthe Company or its clients, denial or degradation of service attacks and malware or other cyber-attacks.\nIn recent periods, there continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-\nattacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals\ntargeting commercial bank accounts and as a result of increasingly sophisticated methods of conducting cyber attacks,\nincluding those employing artificial intelligence. Consistent with industry trends, the Company has also experienced an\nincrease in attempted electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cybersecurity related incidents in recent\nperiods. Moreover, in recent periods, several large corporations, including retail companies, financial institutions and\nthird party vendors specializing in providing services to financial institutions, including MOVEit and First American\nFinancial, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only confidential and proprietary corporate\ninformation, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their clients and employees and subjecting\nthem to potential fraudulent activity. The Company is not aware of having experienced any misappropriation, loss or\nother unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information having a material impact on the\nCompany as a result of a direct cyber security breach or other act on the Bank; however, some of the Company’s clients\nand third party vendors may have been affected by such breaches, which could increase their risks of identity theft and\nother fraudulent activity that could involve client accounts at the Bank.\n34\nInformation pertaining to the Company and its clients is maintained, and transactions are executed, on networks\nand systems maintained by the Company and certain third-party partners, such as the Company’s online banking, mobile\nbanking, record-keeping or accounting systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as\nwell as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect the Company and the Company’s clients\nagainst fraud and security breaches and to maintain the confidence of the Company’s clients. Breaches of information\nsecurity also may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to the Company’s systems or the\nconfidential information of the Company’s clients, including employees. In addition, increases in criminal activity levels\nand sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third party technologies\n(including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the\ntechnology, processes and controls that the Company uses to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us,\nthe Company’s clients and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by the Company’s clients to access\nthe Company’s systems. The Company’s third party partners’ inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate,\nbreaches of security could result in a number of negative events, including losses to the Company or its clients, loss of\nbusiness or clients, damage to the Company’s reputation, the incurrence of additional expenses, disruption to the\nCompany’s business, additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties or the Company’s exposure to civil litigation and\npossible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIssues with the use of artificial intelligence in our marketplace may result in reputational harm or liability, or could\notherwise adversely affect the Company’s business.\nArtificial intelligence, including generative artificial intelligence, is or may be enabled by or integrated into the\nCompany’s products or those developed by its third party partners. As with many developing technologies, artificial\nintelligence presents risks and challenges that could affect its further development, adoption, and use, and therefore our\nbusiness. Artificial intelligence algorithms may be flawed, for example datasets may contain biased information or\notherwise be insufficient, and inappropriate or controversial data practices could impair the acceptance of artificial\nintelligence solutions and result in burdensome new regulations. If the analyses of those products incorporating artificial\nintelligence assist in producing for the Company or its third party partners are deficient, biased or inaccurate, the\nCompany could be subject to competitive harm, potential legal liability and brand or reputational harm. The use of\nartificial intelligence may also present ethical issues. If the Company or its third party partners offer artificial\nintelligence enabled products that are controversial because of their purported or real impact on human rights, privacy, or\nother issues, the Company may experience competitive harm, potential legal liability and brand or reputational harm. In\naddition, the Company expects that governments will continue to assess and implement new laws and regulations\nconcerning the use of artificial intelligence, which may affect or impair the usability or efficiency of products and\nservices and those developed by the Company’s third party partners.\nThe Company depends on information technology and telecommunications systems, and any systems failures,\ninterruptions or data breaches involving these systems could adversely affect the Company’s operations and financial\ncondition.\nThe Company’s business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of its information\ntechnology and telecommunications systems, third party servicers, accounting systems, mobile and online banking\nplatforms and financial intermediaries. The risks resulting from use of these systems result from a variety of factors, both\ninternal and external. The Company is vulnerable to the impact of failures of its systems to operate as needed or\nintended. Such failures could include those resulting from human error, unexpected transaction volumes, intentional\nattacks or overall design or performance issues.\nThe Company outsources to third parties many of its major systems, such as data processing and mobile and\nonline banking. In addition, the Company partners with a leading financial technology company to create an online\naccount portal that integrates the Company’s diverse product applications into a user-friendly experience for the\nCompany’s consumer clients. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service\nagreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt the Company’s operations. Because the Company’s\ninformation technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems, the Company\n35\ncould experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or\nexperience interruptions. A system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of the Company’s ability to\nprocess loans or gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise the Company’s ability to operate effectively,\nresult in potential noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations, damage the Company’s reputation, result in a loss\nof client business or subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which\ncould have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In\naddition, failures of third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or fraud or misconduct on the part of\nemployees of any of these third parties, could disrupt the Company’s operations or adversely affect its reputation.\nIt may be difficult for the Company to replace some of its third-party vendors, particularly vendors providing\nthe Company’s core banking and information services, in a timely manner if they are unwilling or unable to provide the\nCompany with these services in the future for any reason and even if the Company is able to replace them, it may be at\nhigher cost or result in the loss of clients. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company’s operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of information and\nthe monitoring of a large number of transactions on a minute-by-minute basis, and even a short interruption in service\ncould have significant consequences. The Company also interacts with and relies on retailers, for whom the Company\nprocesses transactions, as well as financial counterparties and regulators. Each of these third parties may be targets of the\nsame types of fraudulent activity, computer break-ins and other cybersecurity breaches described above, including those\nemploying artificial intelligence, and the cybersecurity measures that they maintain to mitigate the risk of such activity\nmay be different than the Company’s own and may be inadequate.\nBecause financial entities and technology systems are becoming more interdependent and complex, a cyber\nincident, information breach or loss, or technology failure that compromises the systems or data of one or more financial\nentities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including ourselves. As a result of\nthe foregoing, the Company’s ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to the\nCompany or to third parties with whom the Company interacts.\nA transition away from LIBOR as a reference rate for financial contracts could negatively affect the Company’s\nincome and expenses and the value of various financial contracts.\nLIBOR represented the interest rate at which banks offer to lend funds to one another in the international\ninterbank market for short-term loans. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no\nlonger persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR rates after 2021. U.S. Regulators issued\nguidance to urge market participants to address their LIBOR exposures and transition to robust and sustainable\nalternative rates and the Alternative Reference Rate Committee proposed that SOFR is the rate that represents best\npractice as the alternative to U.S. dollar-LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently\nindexed to LIBOR, but has also advised participants to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of any alternative reference\nrates being considered for use. Contracts linked to LIBOR are vast in number and value, are intertwined with numerous\nfinancial products and services, and have diverse parties.\nThe end date for LIBOR was June 30, 2023. The Company actively worked to plan for the transition away from\nLIBOR, but the transition is both complex and challenging and the downstream effect of unwinding or transitioning such\ncontracts may yet cause instability and negatively impact on financial markets and individual institutions. If the\nCompany or other market participants have failed to implement alternative rates other than LIBOR, it could have an\nadverse effect on the Company and the financial system as a whole.\n36\nPotential losses incurred in connection with possible repurchases and indemnification payments related to mortgages\nthat the Company has sold into the secondary market may require the Company to increase its financial statement\nreserves in the future.\nThe Company engages in the origination and sale of residential real estate loans into the secondary market. In\nconnection with such sales, the Company makes certain representations and warranties, which, if breached, may require\nthe Company to repurchase such loans or indemnify the purchasers of such loans for actual losses incurred in respect of\nsuch loans. These representations and warranties vary based on the nature of the transaction and the purchaser’s or\ninsurer’s requirements but generally pertain to the ownership of the mortgage loan, the real property securing the loan\nand compliance with applicable laws and applicable lender and government-sponsored entity underwriting guidelines in\nconnection with the origination of the loan. While the Company believes its mortgage lending practices and standards to\nbe adequate, the Company may receive repurchase or indemnification requests in the future, which could be material in\nvolume. If that were to happen, the Company could incur losses in connection with loan repurchases and indemnification\nclaims, and any such losses might exceed the Company’s financial statement reserves, requiring the Company to\nincrease such reserves. In that event, any losses the Company might have to recognize and any increases the Company\nmight have to make to the Company’s reserves could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business,\nfinancial position, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company is highly dependent on its executive management team, and the loss of any of the Company’s senior\nexecutive officers or other key employees, or the Company’s inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, could\nharm the Company’s ability to implement its strategic plan and impair the Company’s relationships with clients.\nThe Company’s success is dependent, to a large degree, upon the continued service and skills of the Company’s\nexecutive management team, which consists of Katie Lorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; Alan Villalon,\nChief Financial Officer; Jim Collins, Chief Banking and Revenue Officer; Missy Keney, Chief Engagement Officer; Jon\nHendry, Chief Technology Officer; Karin Taylor, Chief Risk and Operations Officer; and Forrest Wilson, Chief\nRetirement Services Officer. The Company’s business and growth strategies are built primarily upon its ability to retain\nemployees with experience and business relationships within the Company’s market areas. The loss of any of the\nmembers of the Company’s executive management team or any of the Company’s other key personnel, including client\nadvisors, could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business and growth because of their skills, years of industry\nexperience, knowledge of the Company’s market areas, the difficulty of finding qualified replacement personnel and any\ndifficulties associated with transitioning of responsibilities to any new members of the executive management team. As\nsuch, the Company needs to continue to attract and retain key personnel and to recruit qualified individuals who fit the\nCompany’s culture to succeed existing key personnel and ensure the continued growth and successful operation of the\nCompany’s business. Leadership changes may occur from time to time, and the Company cannot predict whether\nsignificant retirements or resignations will occur or whether the Company will be able to recruit additional qualified\npersonnel.\nCompetition for senior executives and skilled personnel in the financial services industry is intense, which\nmeans the cost of hiring, incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase. In addition, the\nCompany’s ability to effectively compete for senior executives and other qualified personnel by offering competitive\ncompensation and benefit arrangements may be restricted by our financial condition, and by applicable banking laws and\nregulations. The loss of the services of any senior executive or other key personnel, the inability to recruit and retain\nqualified personnel in the future or the failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company’s ability to retain and recruit employees is critical to the success of its business strategy and any failure\nto do so could impair the Company’s customer relationships and adversely affect its business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company’s ability to retain and grow its loans, deposits and fee income depends upon the business\ngeneration capabilities, reputation and relationship management skills of the Company’s employees. If the Company\nloses the services of any of its employees, including successful employees employed by banks or other businesses that\nthe Company may acquire, to a new or existing competitor or otherwise, the Company may not be able to retain valuable\n37\nrelationships and some of its customers could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of the Company’s\nservices.\nThe Company’s success and growth strategy also depends on its continued ability to attract and retain\nexperienced employees for all of the Company’s business lines. The Company may face difficulties in recruiting and\nretaining personnel of its desired caliber, including as a result of competition from other financial institutions.\nCompetition for high quality personnel is strong and the Company may not be successful in attracting or retaining the\npersonnel it requires. In particular, many of the Company’s competitors are significantly larger with greater financial\nresources and may be able to offer more attractive compensation packages and broader career opportunities.\nAdditionally, the Company may incur significant expenses and expend significant time and resources on training,\nintegration, and business development before the Company is able to determine whether a new employee will be\nprofitable or effective in their role. If the Company is unable to attract and retain a successful customer development and\nmanagement team or if the Company’s customer development and management team fails to meet its expectations in\nterms of customer relationships and profitability, the Company may be unable to execute its business strategy and its\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects may be negatively affected.\nThe Company’s ability to maintain its reputation is critical to the success of the Company’s business, and the failure\nto do so may materially adversely affect its business and the value of the Company’s stock.\nThe Company relies, in part, on its reputation to attract clients and retain client relationships. Damage to the\nCompany’s reputation could undermine the confidence of its current and potential clients in the Company’s ability to\nprovide high-quality financial services. Such damage could also impair the confidence of the Company’s counterparties\nand vendors and ultimately affect its ability to effect transactions. In particular, the Company’s ability to attract and\nretain clients and employees could be adversely affected to the extent its reputation is damaged. The Company’s actual\nor perceived failure to address various issues could give rise to reputational risk that could cause harm to the Company\nand its business prospects. These issues include, but are not limited to, legal and regulatory requirements; privacy; client\nand other third-party fraud; properly maintaining and safeguarding client and employee personal information; money\nlaundering; illegal or fraudulent sales practices; ethical issues; appropriately addressing potential conflicts of interest;\nand the proper identification and disclosure of the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity, and market risks inherent in the\nCompany’s products. Failure to appropriately address any of these issues could also give rise to additional regulatory\nrestrictions, reputational harm and legal risks, which could, among other consequences, increase the size and number of\nlitigation claims and damages asserted or subject the Company to enforcement actions, fines, and penalties and cause the\nCompany to incur related costs and expenses. In addition, the Company’s businesses are dependent on the integrity of its\nrelationships, asset managers and other employees. If a relationship manager, asset manager or other employee were to\nmisappropriate any client funds or client information, the reputation of the Company’s businesses could be negatively\naffected, which may result in the loss of accounts and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nMaintenance of the Company’s reputation depends not only on its success in maintaining the Company’s\nservice-focused culture and controlling and mitigating the various risks described in this report, but also on the\nCompany’s success in identifying and appropriately addressing issues that may arise in the areas described above.\nMaintaining the Company’s reputation also depends on its ability to successfully prevent third parties from infringing on\nthe “Alerus” brand and associated trademarks and the Company’s other intellectual property. Defense of the Company’s\nreputation, trademarks and other intellectual property, including through litigation, could result in costs that could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nLabor shortages and a failure to attract and retain qualified employees could negatively impact the Company’s\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nA number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to the Company or increase labor costs,\nincluding high employment levels and decreased labor force size and participation rates in recent periods. Although the\nCompany has not experienced any material labor shortage to date, the Company continues to observe an overall\ntightening of and increase in competition in local labor markets. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates\nwithin the Company’s employee base could lead to increased costs, such as increased compensation expense to attract\n38\nand retain employees, as well as decreased efficiency. In addition, if the Company is unable to hire and retain employees\ncapable of performing at a high-level, or if mitigation measures the Company takes to respond to a decrease in labor\navailability have unintended negative effects, the Company’s business could be adversely affected. An overall labor\nshortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation, caused by general macroeconomic factors, could\nhave a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth\nprospects.\nThe Company’s use of third-party vendors and its other ongoing third-party business relationships is subject to\nincreasing regulatory requirements and attention.\nThe Company’s use of third party vendors, including the financial technology company it partners with to\ncreate a customer portal, for certain information systems is subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements\nand attention by the Company’s federal bank regulators. Recent regulations require the Company to enhance its due\ndiligence, ongoing monitoring and control over the Company’s third-party vendors and other ongoing third party\nbusiness relationships. In certain cases, the Company may be required to renegotiate the Company’s agreements with\nthese vendors to meet these enhanced requirements, which could increase costs. The Company expects that regulators\nwill hold the Company responsible for deficiencies in oversight and control of its third party relationships and in the\nperformance of the parties with which the Company has these relationships. As a result, if the Company’s regulators\nconclude that it has not exercised adequate oversight and control over the Company’s third party vendors or other\nongoing third party business relationships or that such third parties have not performed appropriately, the Company\ncould be subject to enforcement actions, including civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or\nfines, as well as requirements for client remediation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company has a continuing need for technological change, and it may not have the resources to effectively\nimplement new technology or it may experience operational challenges when implementing new technology.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new\ntechnology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving clients, the effective use of technology increases\nefficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. The Company’s future success will depend in part upon its,\nand its third party partners’, ability to address the needs of the Company’s clients by using technology to provide\nproducts and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in\noperations. The widespread adoption of new technologies, including mobile banking services, artificial intelligence,\ncryptocurrencies and payment systems, could require the Company in the future to make substantial expenditures to\nmodify or adapt the Company’s existing products and services as it grows and develops new products to satisfy the\nCompany’s customers’ expectations, remain competitive and comply with regulatory guidance. The Company may\nexperience operational challenges as it implements these new technology enhancements, which could result in the\nCompany not fully realizing the anticipated benefits from such new technology or require the Company to incur\nsignificant costs to remedy any such challenges in a timely manner.\nMany of the Company’s larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological\nimprovements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or superior products to those that the Company will be\nable to offer, which would put the Company at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, a risk exists that the Company\nwill not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing\nsuch products and services to the Company’s clients.\nIn addition, the implementation of technological changes and upgrades to maintain current systems and\nintegrate new ones may also cause service interruptions, transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and\nmay cause the Company to fail to comply with applicable laws. The Company expects that new technologies and\nbusiness processes applicable to the financial services industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies and\nbusiness processes may be better than those the Company currently uses. Because the pace of technological change is\nhigh and the Company’s industry is intensely competitive, it may not be able to sustain the Company’s investment in\nnew technology as critical systems and applications become obsolete or as better ones become available. A failure to\nsuccessfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry and failure to avoid\n39\ninterruptions, errors and delays could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company is subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee fraud and\ndata processing system failures and errors.\nEmployee errors and employee and customer misconduct could subject the Company to financial losses or\nregulatory sanctions and seriously harm the Company’s reputation. Misconduct by the Company’s employees could\ninclude hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of the Company’s\ncustomers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors or employee\nand customer misconduct, and the precautions the Company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective\nin all cases. Employee errors could also subject the Company to financial claims for negligence.\nThe Company maintains a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational\nrisks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. If the Company’s internal\ncontrols fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance\nlimits, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition results of operations and\ngrowth prospects.\nThe Company’s dividend policy may change.\nAlthough the Company has historically paid dividends to its stockholders and currently intends to maintain or\nincrease its dividend levels in future quarters, the Company has no obligation to continue doing so and may change the\nCompany’s dividend policy at any time without notice to the Company’s stockholders. Holders of the Company’s\ncommon stock are only entitled to receive such cash dividends as the Company’s Board of Directors, in its discretion,\nmay declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Further, consistent with the Company’s strategic plans,\ngrowth initiatives, capital availability, projected liquidity needs, and other factors, the Company has made, and will\ncontinue to make, capital management decisions and policies that could adversely impact the amount of dividends paid\nto the Company’s common stockholders.\nIn addition, the Company is a financial holding company, and the Company’s ability to declare and pay\ndividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve\nregarding capital adequacy and dividends. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank and financial holding\ncompanies should generally pay dividends on capital stock only out of earnings, and only if prospective earnings\nretention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs, asset quality and financial condition.\nThe Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries, including the Bank. The Company\nreceives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from the Bank, which it uses as the principal source of funds to\npay expenses. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank and certain of\nthe Company’s non-bank subsidiaries may pay the Company. Such limits are also tied to the earnings of the Company’s\nsubsidiaries. If the Bank does not receive regulatory approval or if its earnings are not sufficient to make dividend\npayments to the Company while maintaining adequate capital levels, the Company’s ability to pay its expenses and its\nbusiness, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.\nFuture issuances of common stock could result in dilution, which could cause the Company’s common stock price to\ndecline.\nThe Company is generally not restricted from issuing additional shares of stock, up to totals of 30,000,000\nshares of common stock and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized in the Company’s certificate of\nincorporation, which in each case could be increased by a vote of the holders of a majority of the Company’s shares of\ncommon stock. The Company may issue additional shares of common stock in the future pursuant to current or future\nequity compensation plans, upon conversions of preferred stock or debt, or in connection with future acquisitions or\nfinancings. If the Company chooses to raise capital by selling shares of common stock for any reason, the issuance\n40\nwould have a dilutive effect on the holders of the Company’s common stock and could have a material negative effect\non the market price of the Company’s common stock.\nThe Company may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to\nacquire the Company or could otherwise adversely affect holders of the Company’s common stock, which could\ndepress the price of the Company’s common stock.\nAlthough there are currently no shares of the Company’s preferred stock issued and outstanding, the\nCompany’s certificate of incorporation authorizes the Company to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of one or more series of\npreferred stock. The Company’s Board of Directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of\nany series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences over the\nCompany’s common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up, and other\nterms. If the Company issues preferred stock in the future that has preference over the Company’s common stock with\nrespect to payment of dividends or upon the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if the Company issues\npreferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the Company’s common stock, the rights of the holders\nof the Company’s common stock or the market price of the Company’s common stock could be adversely affected. In\naddition, the ability of the Company’s Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any action on the\npart of the Company’s stockholders may impede a takeover of the Company and prevent a transaction perceived to be\nfavorable to the Company’s stockholders.\nThe holders of the Company’s debt obligations and preferred stock, if any, will have priority over the Company’s\ncommon stock with respect to payment in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up and with respect to the\npayment of interest and dividends.\nIn any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Company’s common stock would rank junior\nin priority to all claims of debt holders against the Company and claims of all of the Company’s outstanding shares of\npreferred stock. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $50.0 million of subordinated notes payable and\n$9.0 million of junior subordinated debentures outstanding. The Company does not currently have any shares of\npreferred stock issued and outstanding. As a result, holders of the Company’s common stock will not be entitled to\nreceive any payment or other distribution of assets upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company until\nafter all of its obligations to debt holders have been satisfied and holders of senior equity securities, including any\npreferred shares, if any, have received any payment or distribution due to them.\nThe Company’s business and operations may be adversely affected in numerous and complex ways by weak economic\nconditions and global trade.\nThe Company’s businesses and operations, which primarily consist of lending money to clients in the form of\ncommercial and residential mortgage loans, borrowing money from clients in the form of deposits and savings accounts,\ninvesting in securities, and providing wealth management, trust and fiduciary and recordkeeping services, are sensitive\nto general business and economic conditions in the United States. If the United States economy weakens, the Company’s\ngrowth and profitability from the Company’s lending, deposit and investment operations could be constrained.\nUncertainty about the federal fiscal policymaking process, the medium- and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal\ngovernment, and future tax rates is a concern for businesses, consumers and investors in the United States. In addition,\neconomic conditions in foreign countries and weakening global trade due to increased anti-globalization sentiment and\nrecent tariff activity could affect the stability of global financial markets, which could hinder the economic growth of the\nUnited States. Weak economic conditions are characterized by deflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets,\na lack of liquidity or depressed prices in the secondary market for loans, increased delinquencies on mortgage, consumer\nand commercial loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial\nactivity. Further, a general economic slowdown could decrease the value of the Company’s AUA and AUM resulting in\nclients potentially seeking alternative investment opportunities with other providers, which could result in lower fee\nincome. All of these factors are detrimental to the Company’s business, and the interplay between these factors can be\ncomplex and unpredictable. Adverse economic conditions and government policy responses to such conditions could\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth\nprospects.\n41\nThe financial markets and the global economy may also be adversely affected by the current or anticipated\nimpact of military conflict, including the ongoing conflicts between Israel and Palestine and between Russia and\nUkraine, which is increasing volatility in commodity and energy prices, creating supply chain issues and causing\ninstability in financial markets. Sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries in response to such conflict\ncould further adversely impact the financial markets and the global economy, and any economic countermeasures by the\naffected countries or others could exacerbate market and economic instability. The specific consequences of these\nconflicts on the Company’s business are difficult to predict at this time, but in addition to inflationary pressures affecting\nthe Company’s operations and those of the Company’s customers and borrowers, the Company may also experience an\nincrease in cyberattacks against us, the Company’s customers and borrowers, service providers and other third parties.\nThe Company depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, and in evaluating and monitoring the\nCompany’s loan portfolio on an ongoing basis, the Company may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of\nclients and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. The Company\nmay also rely on representations of those clients or counterparties or of other third parties, such as independent auditors,\nas to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate, incomplete, fraudulent or misleading\nfinancial statements, credit reports or other financial or business information, or the failure to receive such information\non a timely basis, could result in loan losses, reputational damage or other effects that could have a material adverse\neffect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nNew lines of business, products, product enhancements or services may subject the Company to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, the Company may implement new lines of business or offer new products and product\nenhancements as well as new services within the Company’s existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and\nuncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances in which the markets are not fully developed. In\nimplementing, developing or marketing new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services, the Company\nmay invest significant time and resources, although the Company may not assign the appropriate level of resources or\nexpertise necessary to make these new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services successful or to\nrealize their expected benefits. Further, initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business,\nproducts, product enhancements or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove\nfeasible.\nExternal factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences,\nmay also affect the successful implementation of a new line of business or offerings of new products, product\nenhancements or services. Further, any new line of business, product, product enhancement or service or system\nconversion could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the Company’s system of internal controls. Failure to\nsuccessfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or offerings of new\nproducts, product enhancements or services could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company faces intense competition from other banks and financial services companies that could hurt its\nbusiness.\nThe Company operates in the highly competitive financial services industry and faces significant competition\nfor clients from financial institutions located both within and beyond the Company’s market areas. Overall, the\nCompany competes with national commercial banks, regional banks, private banks, mortgage companies, online lenders,\nsavings banks, credit unions, non-bank financial services companies, other financial institutions, including investment\nadvisory and wealth management firms, financial technology, or “Fintech,” companies and securities brokerage firms,\noperating within or near the areas the Company serves. Many of the Company’s non-bank competitors are not subject to\nthe same extensive regulations that govern the Company’s activities and may have greater flexibility in competing for\nbusiness. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and\ntechnological changes and continued consolidation.\n42\nWhile the Company does not offer products relating to digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins\nand other similar assets, there has been a significant increase in digital asset adoption globally over the past several\nyears. Certain characteristics of digital asset transactions, such as the speed with which such transactions can be\nconducted, the ability to transact without the involvement of regulated intermediaries, the ability to engage in\ntransactions across multiple jurisdictions, and the anonymous nature of the transactions, are appealing to certain\nconsumers notwithstanding the various risks posed by such transactions. Accordingly, digital asset service providers—\nwhich, at present are not subject to the same degree of scrutiny and oversight as banking organizations and other\nfinancial institutions—are becoming active competitors to more traditional financial institutions.\nThe process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as “disintermediation,” could result in the loss of fee\nincome, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from deposits. The loss of these\nrevenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. Potential partnerships with digital asset companies, moreover,\ncould also entail significant investment.\nIn the Company’s banking business, it may not be able to compete successfully with other financial institutions\nin the Company’s markets, particularly with larger financial institutions that have significantly greater resources than us,\nand the Company may have to pay higher interest rates to attract deposits, accept lower yields to attract loans and pay\nhigher wages for new employees, resulting in lower net interest margins and reduced profitability. In addition, increased\nlending activity of competing banks has also led to increased competitive pressures on loan rates and terms for high-\nquality credits.\nCompetition in the retirement and benefit services and wealth management businesses is especially strong in the\nCompany’s geographic market areas because there are numerous well-established, well-resourced, well-capitalized, and\nsuccessful investment management, wealth advisory and wealth management and trust firms in these areas. In addition,\nthe record-keeping and administration industry is dominated by a small number of larger institutions that may charge\nfees that are lower than the Company charges for similar services. The Company’s ability to successfully attract and\nretain retirement and benefit services and wealth management clients is dependent upon its ability to compete with\ncompetitors’ investment, advisory, fiduciary and recordkeeping products and services, levels of investment performance\nand marketing and distribution capabilities. If the Company is unable to compete effectively with other banking or other\nfinancial services businesses, it could find it more difficult to attract new and retain existing clients and the Company’s\nnoninterest income could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company originates, sells and services residential mortgage loans. The Company’s mortgage business\nfaces vigorous competition from banks and other financial institutions, including larger financial institutions and\nindependent mortgage companies. The Company’s mortgage business competes on a number of factors including\ncustomer service, quality, range of products and services offered, price, reputation, interest rates, closing process and\nduration, and loan origination fees. The ability to attract and retain skilled mortgage origination professionals is critical\nto the Company’s mortgage origination business. Changes in interest rates and pricing decisions by the Company’s loan\ncompetitors affect demand for the Company’s residential mortgage loan products, the revenue realized on the sale of\nloans and revenues received from servicing such loans for others, ultimately reducing the Company’s noninterest\nincome. In addition, if the Company is unable to attract and retain enough skilled employees, the Company’s mortgage\norigination volume may decline.\nThe Company’s business and operations may be adversely affected in numerous and complex ways by external\nbusiness disruptors in the financial services industry.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid change, as technology enables traditional banks to compete\nin new ways and non-traditional entrants to compete in certain segments of the banking market, in some cases with\nreduced regulation. As client preferences and expectations continue to evolve, technology has lowered barriers to entry\nand made it possible for banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet and for non-\nbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment\nsystems, online lending and low-cost investment advisory services. New entrants may use new technologies, advanced\n43\ndata and analytic tools, lower cost to serve, reduced regulatory burden or faster processes to challenge traditional banks.\nFor example, new business models have been observed in retail payments, consumer and commercial lending, foreign\nexchange and low-cost investment advisory services. While the Company closely monitors business disruptors and seek\nto adapt to changing technologies, matching the pace of innovation exhibited by new and differently situated competitors\nmay require the Company and policy-makers to adapt at a greater pace. Because the financial services industry is\nexperiencing rapid changes in technology, the Company’s future success will depend in part on its ability to address its\nclients’ needs by using technology. Client loyalty can be influenced by a competitor’s new products, especially offerings\nthat could provide cost savings or a higher return to the client.\nThe investment management contracts the Company has with its clients are terminable without cause and on\nrelatively short notice by the Company’s clients, which makes it vulnerable to short-term declines in the performance\nof the securities under the Company’s management.\nLike most investment advisory and wealth management businesses, the investment advisory contracts the\nCompany has with the Company’s clients are typically terminable by the client without cause upon less than 30 days’\nnotice. As a result, even short-term declines in the performance of the securities the Company manages, which can result\nfrom factors outside the Company’s control, such as adverse changes in market or economic conditions or the poor\nperformance of some of the investments the Company has recommended to the Company’s clients, could lead some of\nits clients to move assets under the Company’s management to other asset classes such as broad index funds or treasury\nsecurities, or to investment advisors which have investment product offerings or investment strategies different than\nours. Therefore, the Company’s operating results are heavily dependent on the financial performance of the Company’s\ninvestment portfolios and the investment strategies the Company employs in the Company’s investment advisory\nbusinesses and even short-term declines in the performance of the investment portfolios the Company manages for the\nCompany’s clients, whatever the cause, could result in a decline in AUM and a corresponding decline in investment\nmanagement fees, which would adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, pandemics, acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events could\nsignificantly impact the Company’s business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, effects of climate change, widespread disease or pandemics, acts of war or\nterrorism, civil unrest or other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Company’s ability to\nconduct business. In addition, such events could affect the stability of the Company’s deposit base, impair the ability of\nborrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage,\nresult in loss of revenue or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any of these events in the\nfuture could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and\ngrowth prospects.\nThe Company’s wealth management business is dependent on asset managers to produce investment returns and\nfinancial advisors to solicit and retain clients, and the loss of a key asset manager or financial advisor could adversely\naffect the Company’s wealth management business.\nThe Company relies on its asset managers to produce investment returns and financial advisors to advise clients\nof the Company’s wealth management business. The Company believes that investment performance is an important\nfactor for the growth of its AUM. Poor investment performance could impair the Company’s revenues and growth\nbecause existing clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products, which would result in lower\ninvestment management fees, or the Company’s ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish.\nThe market for asset managers and financial advisors is extremely competitive and is increasingly characterized\nby frequent movement of these types of employees among different firms. In addition, the Company’s asset managers\nand financial advisors often have regular direct contact with the Company’s clients, which can lead to a strong client\nrelationship based on the client’s trust in that individual manager or advisor. The loss of a key asset manager or financial\nadvisor could jeopardize the Company’s relationships with the Company’s clients and lead to the loss of client accounts.\nLosses of such accounts could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of\noperations and growth prospects.\n44\nThe Company may be adversely affected by the soundness of certain securities brokerage firms.\nThe Company’s client investment accounts are maintained under custodial arrangements with large, well\nestablished securities brokerage firms or bank institutions that provide custodial services, either directly or through\narrangements made by the Company with those firms. As a result, the performance of, or even rumors or questions about\nthe integrity or performance of, any of those firms could adversely affect the confidence of the Company’s clients in the\nservices provided by those firms or otherwise adversely impact their custodial holdings. Such an occurrence could\nnegatively impact the Company’s ability to retain existing or attract new clients and, as a result, could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nLiquidity and Funding Risks\nLiquidity risks could affect the Company’s operations and jeopardize its business, financial condition, results of\noperations and growth prospects.\nLiquidity is essential to the Company’s business. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to\nmeet its obligations, including financial commitments, as they come due and is inherent in the Company’s operations.\nAn inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans or investment securities, and from other\nsources could have a substantial negative effect on the Company’s liquidity.\nThe Company’s most important source of funds consists of the Company’s client deposits, which can decrease\nfor a variety of reasons, including when clients perceive alternative investments, such as bonds, treasuries or stocks, as\nproviding a better risk/return tradeoff. Total deposits increased in 2023, however, clients demanded higher interest rates\non deposit accounts to compete with higher yielding short-term investments available. The Company’s future growth\nwill largely depend on its ability to maintain and grow a strong deposit base and the Company’s ability to retain its\nlargest retirement and benefit services and wealth management clients, many of whom are also depositors. If clients,\nincluding the Company’s retirement and benefit services and wealth management clients, move money out of bank\ndeposits and into other investments, the Company could lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, which would require\nthe Company to seek other funding alternatives, including increasing the Company’s dependence on wholesale funding\nsources, in order to continue to grow, thereby increasing the Company’s funding costs and reducing net interest income\nand net income.\nAdditionally, uninsured deposits have historically been viewed by the FDIC as less stable than insured deposits.\nAccording to statements made by the FDIC staff and the leadership of the federal banking agencies, customers with\nlarger uninsured deposit account balances often are small- to mid-sized businesses that rely upon deposit funds for\npayment of operational expenses and, as a result, are more likely to closely monitor the financial condition and\nperformance of their depository institutions. As a result, in the event of financial distress, uninsured depositors\nhistorically have been more likely to withdraw their deposits. If a significant portion of our deposits were to be\nwithdrawn within a short period of time such that additional sources of funding would be required to meet withdrawal\ndemands, the Company may be unable to obtain funding at favorable terms, which may have an adverse effect on our net\ninterest margin. Moreover, obtaining adequate funding to meet our deposit obligations may be more challenging during\nperiods of higher prevailing interest rates, such as the present period. Our ability to attract depositors during a time of\nactual or perceived distress or instability in the marketplace may be limited. Further, interest rates paid for borrowings\ngenerally exceed the interest rates paid on deposits. This spread may be exacerbated by higher prevailing interest rates.\nIn addition, because our available for sale securities lose value when interest rates rise, after-tax proceeds resulting from\nthe sale of such assets may be diminished during periods when interest rates are elevated. Under such circumstances, we\nmay be required to access funding from sources such as the Federal Reserve’s discount window in order to manage our\nliquidity risk.\nThe Company also accesses collateralized public funds, which are bank deposits of state and local\nmunicipalities. These deposits are required to be secured by certain investment grade securities to ensure repayment,\nwhich reduces standby liquidity by restricting the potential liquidity of the pledged collateral. As of December 31, 2023,\nthe Company had pledged $250.0 million of investment securities for this purpose, which represented approximately\n31.8% of the Company’s total securities portfolio. If the Company is unable to pledge sufficient qualifying collateral to\n45\nsecure public funding, it may lose access to this source of liquidity that the Company has historically relied upon. In\naddition, the availability of and fluctuations in these funds depends on the individual municipality’s fiscal policies and\ncash flow needs.\nOther primary sources of funds consist of cash from operations, investment security maturities and sales and\nproceeds from the issuance and sale of the Company’s equity and debt securities to investors. Additional liquidity is\nprovided by the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve and the FHLB. The Federal Reserve established the Bank\nTerm Funding Program, or BTFP, on March 12, 2023, offering qualifying banks loans of up to one year in length\ncollateralized by qualifying assets, including U.S. securities valued at par, to serve as a source of additional liquidity\nagainst high-quality securities and reducing an institution’s need to quickly sell high-quality securities to meet liquidity\nneeds. The Federal Reserve has announced that it is ending the BTFP and will cease making new loans under this\nprogram on March 11, 2024. The Company may also borrow from third-party lenders from time to time. The Company’s\naccess to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize the Company’s activities or on terms that are\nacceptable to the Company could be impaired by factors that affect the Company directly or the financial services\nindustry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the\nprospects for the financial services industry. Economic conditions and a loss of confidence in financial institutions may\nincrease the Company’s cost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital, including inter-bank\nborrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the Federal Reserve. There is also the\npotential risk that collateral calls with respect to the Company’s repurchase agreements could reduce the Company’s\navailable liquidity. At December 31, 2023, the Company’s borrowed funds decreased to $314.2 million, compared to\n$378.1 million at December 31, 2022. The balance of borrowed funds as of December 31, 2023 included $200.0 million\nin FHLB advances and $114.2 million in federal funds purchased. Despite the decrease in borrowings, the Company’s\ncost of funds increased and in 2023, as compared to 2022 as a result of the increased interest rate environment.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact the Company’s ability to continue to implement its\nstrategic plan, including originating loans and investing in securities, or to fulfill obligations such as paying expenses,\nrepaying borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company may not be able to maintain a strong core deposit base or other low-cost funding sources.\nThe Company depends primarily on core deposits from its clients, which consist of noninterest bearing\ndeposits, interest bearing checking accounts, certificates of deposit less than $250,000 and money market savings\naccounts, as the Company’s primary source of funding for lending activities. The Company’s future growth will largely\ndepend on its ability to maintain and grow this strong, core deposit base and the Company’s ability to retain its\nretirement and benefit and wealth management clients, many of whom are also depositors. Deposit and account balances\ncan decrease when clients perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market or real estate, as providing a better\nrisk/return tradeoff. If clients, including the Company’s retirement and benefit and wealth management clients, move\nmoney out of bank deposits or money market accounts and into investments (or similar deposit products at other\ninstitutions that may provide a higher rate of return), the Company could lose a relatively low-cost source of funds,\nincreasing funding costs and reducing net interest income and net income.\nThe Company supplements its core deposit funding with non-core, short-term funding sources, including FHLB\nadvances and fed funds purchased. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $200.0 million FHLB advances and\n$114.2 million of fed funds purchased from the FHLB. The Company’s maximum borrowing capacity from the FHLB is\nbased on the amount of mortgage and commercial loans the Company can pledge. As of December 31, 2023, the\nCompany’s advances from the FHLB were collateralized by $970.4 million of real estate loans. If the Company is\nunable to pledge sufficient qualifying collateral to secure funding from the FHLB, it may lose access to this source of\nliquidity. If the Company is unable to access any of these types of funding sources or if its costs related to them\nincreases, the Company’s liquidity and ability to support demand for loans could be materially adversely affected.\n46\nThe Company’s high concentration of large depositors may increase its liquidity risk.\nThe Company has developed relationships with certain individuals and businesses that have resulted in a\nconcentration of large deposits from a small number of clients. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s 10 largest\ndepositor relationships accounted for approximately 8.7% of total deposits. This high concentration of depositors\npresents a risk to the Company’s liquidity if one or more of them decides to change its relationship with the Company\nand to withdraw all or a significant portion of their accounts, for example as a result of deposits above the FDIC\ninsurance limit. If such an event occurs, the Company may need to seek out alternative sources of funding that may not\nbe on the same terms as the deposits being replaced, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company’s liquidity is largely dependent on dividends from the Bank.\nThe Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank, and its other subsidiaries. A substantial\nportion of the Company’s cash flow, including cash flow to pay principal and interest on the Company’s debt, comes\nfrom dividends the Company receives from the Bank. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of\ndividends that the Bank may pay to the Company. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank had the capacity to pay the\nCompany a dividend of up to $61.3 million without the need to obtain prior regulatory approval. Also, the Company’s\nright to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior\nclaims of the subsidiary’s creditors. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, it may not be able\nto service its debt, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of\noperations and growth prospects.\nThe Company may need to raise additional capital in the future, and if it fails to maintain sufficient capital, whether\ndue to losses, an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, the Company’s business, financial condition, results\nof operations and growth prospects, as well as its ability to maintain regulatory compliance, would be adversely\naffected.\nThe Company faces significant capital and other regulatory requirements as a financial institution. The\nCompany may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to\nmeet the Company’s commitments and business needs, which could include the possibility of financing acquisitions. The\nCompany does not have any current plans, arrangements or understandings to make any additional acquisitions. In\naddition, the Company, on a consolidated basis, and the Bank, on a stand-alone basis, must meet certain regulatory\ncapital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. Regulatory capital requirements could increase from current\nlevels, which could require the Company to raise additional capital or contract the Company’s operations. The\nCompany’s ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a\nnumber of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and\ngovernmental activities, the Company’s credit ratings, its ability to maintain a listing on Nasdaq and its financial\ncondition and performance. In particular, if the Company needs to raise additional capital in the current interest rate\nenvironment, the Company believes the pricing and other terms investors may require in such an offering may not be\nattractive to the Company. If the Company fails to maintain an investment grade credit rating, it may adversely impact\nits ability to raise capital or incur additional debt. Accordingly, the Company cannot assure you that it will be able to\nraise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company fails to maintain capital to\nmeet regulatory requirements, or is unable to raise capital to meet its business needs, its business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and growth prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by changes in the actual or perceived soundness or condition of other\nfinancial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions that deal with each other are interconnected as a result of trading, investment,\nliquidity management, clearing, counterparty , reputational and other relationships. Concerns about, or a default by, one\ninstitution could lead to significant liquidity problems and losses or defaults by other institutions, as the commercial and\nfinancial soundness of many financial institutions is closely related as a result of these credit, trading, clearing and other\nrelationships. Even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of, or questions about, a counterparty may lead to market-wide\n47\nliquidity problems and losses or defaults by various institutions. For example, certain community banks experienced\ndeposit outflows following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank in 2023. This\nsystemic risk may adversely affect financial intermediaries with which the Company interacts on a daily basis or key\nfunding providers such as the FHLB, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s access to\nliquidity or otherwise have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and growth\nprospects.\nThe Company receives substantial deposits and AUM as a result of referrals by professionals, such as attorneys,\naccountants, and doctors, and such referrals are dependent upon the continued positive interaction with and\nfinancial health of those referral sources.\nMany of the Company’s deposit clients and clients of the Company’s wealth management business are\nindividuals involved in professional vocations, such as lawyers, accountants, and doctors. These clients are a significant\nsource of referrals for new clients in both the deposit and wealth management areas. If the Company fails to adequately\nserve these professional clients with its deposit services, lending, wealth management products and other services, this\nsource of referrals may diminish, which could have a negative impact on the Company’s financial results. Further, if the\neconomy in the geographic areas that the Company serves is negatively impacted, the amount of deposits and services\nthat these professional individuals will utilize and the number of referrals that they will make may decrease, which may\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth\nprospects.\nLegal, Accounting and Compliance Risks\nThe Company’s risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks or losses to the Company.\nThe Company’s risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is\ndesigned to manage the types of risk to which the Company is subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity,\ninterest rate and compliance. The Company’s framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that\ninvolve management assumptions and judgment. The Company’s risk management framework may not be effective\nunder all circumstances and it may not adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us. If the Company’s framework is not\neffective, it could suffer unexpected losses and the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and\ngrowth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. The Company may also be subject to potentially adverse\nregulatory consequences.\nThe Company’s accounting estimates and risk management processes and controls rely on analytical and forecasting\ntechniques and models and assumptions, which may not accurately predict future events.\nThe Company’s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to the way it records and reports its financial\ncondition and results of operations. The Company’s management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying\nmany of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with United States generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (“GAAP”) and reflect management’s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report the Company’s\nfinancial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to\napply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet which may result in\nthe Company’s reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies are critical to presenting the Company’s financial condition and results of\noperations. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are\nuncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or\nestimates. If the Company’s underlying assumptions or estimates prove to be incorrect, it could have a material adverse\neffect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company’s risk management processes, internal controls, disclosure controls and corporate governance\npolicies and procedures are based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable (not absolute)\nassurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the Company’s controls, processes\n48\nand procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls, processes and procedures could necessitate\nchanges in those controls, processes and procedures, which may increase the Company’s compliance costs, divert\nmanagement attention from its business or subject the Company to regulatory actions and increased regulatory scrutiny.\nAny of these could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations\nand growth prospects.\nChanges in accounting policies or standards could materially impact the Company’s financial statements.\nFrom time to time, FASB, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (or PCAOB) or the SEC, may\nchange the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s financial\nstatements. Such changes may result in the Company being subject to new or changing accounting and reporting\nstandards. In addition, the bodies that interpret the accounting standards (such as banking regulators or outside auditors)\nmay change their interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. In addition, trends in financial\nand business reporting, including environmental social and governance (ESG) related disclosures, could require the\nCompany to incur additional reporting expense. These changes may be beyond the Company’s control, can be hard to\npredict and can materially impact how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some\ncases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, or apply an existing standard\ndifferently, in each case resulting in the Company’s needing to revise or restate prior period financial statements.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention,\nwhich divert time and attention from the Company’s business operations.\nAs a public company, the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Exchange Act requires that the Company file annual,\nquarterly and current reports with respect to its business and financial condition with the SEC. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act\nrequires, among other things, that the Company establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for\nfinancial reporting. Compliance with these reporting requirements and other rules and regulations, including period\nrevisions to and additional rules and regulations, of the SEC could increase the Company’s legal and financial\ncompliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly, which could negatively affect the\nCompany’s efficiency ratio. Further, the need to maintain the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company\nmay divert management’s attention from implementing the Company’s strategic plan, which could prevent the Company\nfrom successfully implementing the Company’s growth initiatives and improving its business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nAs an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS\nAct, the Company is taking advantage of certain temporary exemptions from various reporting requirements, including\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in the Company’s periodic reports and proxy\nstatements and an exemption from the requirement to obtain an attestation from the Company’s auditors on\nmanagement’s assessment of its internal control over financial reporting. When these exemptions cease to apply, the\nCompany expects to incur additional expenses and devote increased management effort toward ensuring compliance\nwith them.\nThe financial reporting resources the Company has put in place may not be sufficient to ensure the accuracy of the\nadditional information the Company is required to disclose as a publicly listed company.\nAs a public company, the Company is subject to heightened financial reporting standards under GAAP and\nSEC rules, including more extensive levels of disclosure. Complying with these standards required enhancements to the\ndesign and operation of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as well as additional financial reporting\nand accounting staff with appropriate training and experience in GAAP and SEC rules and regulations.\nIf the Company is unable to meet the demands required of the Company as a public company, including the\nrequirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Company may be unable to report its financial results accurately, or report\nthem within the timeframes required by law or stock exchange regulations. Failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct, when and as applicable, could also potentially subject the Company to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or\n49\nother regulatory authorities. If material weaknesses or other deficiencies occur, the Company’s ability to report its\nfinancial results accurately and timely could be impaired, which could result in late filings of the Company’s annual and\nquarterly reports under the Exchange Act, restatements of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, a decline in\nthe Company’s stock price, suspension or delisting of the Company’s common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market,\nand could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and\ngrowth prospects. Even if the Company is able to report its financial statements accurately and in a timely manner, any\ndisclosure of material weaknesses in the Company’s future filings with the SEC could cause the Company’s reputation\nto be harmed and the Company’s stock price to decline significantly.\nThe Company did not engage its independent registered public accounting firm to perform an audit of its\ninternal control over financial reporting under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or\nPCAOB, as of any balance sheet date reported in the Company’s financial statements as of December 31, 2023. Had the\nCompany’s independent registered public accounting firm performed an audit of its internal control over financial\nreporting under the standards of PCAOB, material weaknesses may have been identified. The JOBS Act provides that,\nso long as the Company qualifies as an emerging growth company, it will be exempt from the provisions of\nSection 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley, which would require that the Company’s independent registered public accounting\nfirm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting under the standards\nof PCAOB. The Company may take advantage of this exemption so long as it qualifies as an emerging growth company.\nThe recent change in the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm could materially impact the\nCompany’s financial statements.\nOn December 1, 2022, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved the dismissal\nof CliftonLarsonAllen LLP (“CLA”), as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm because CLA\nindicated that it would not stand for reappointment following completion of the audit of the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements for the year-ending December 31, 2022. On December 1, 2022, the Audit Committee approved the\nappointment of RSM, LLP (“RSM”) to serve as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the\nyear ending December 31, 2023. RSM’s future audits of the Company’s financial statements may identify errors or\nomissions in the Company’s historical financial statements that were not previously identified and that could require the\nCompany to restate previously issued financial statements or materially impact how the Company reports its financial\ncondition and results of operations going forward. If the Company has to restate any historical financial statements it\ncould have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation and regulatory actions, including possible enforcement actions, could subject the Company to significant\nfines, penalties, judgments or other requirements resulting in increased expenses or restrictions on the Company’s\nbusiness activities.\nThe Company’s business is subject to increased litigation and regulatory risks because of a number of factors,\nincluding the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry and the focus of state and federal prosecutors on\nbanks and the financial services industry generally. This focus has only intensified since the financial crisis, with\nregulators and prosecutors focusing on a variety of financial institution practices and requirements, including foreclosure\npractices, compliance with applicable consumer protection laws, classification of “held for sale” assets and compliance\nwith anti-money laundering statutes, the Bank Secrecy Act and sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets\nControl of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or OFAC.\nIn the normal course of business, from time to time, the Company has in the past and may in the future be\nnamed as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in\nconnection with the Company’s current or prior business activities. Legal actions could include claims for substantial\ncompensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. The Company may also, from time\nto time, be the subject of subpoenas, requests for information, reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and\ninformal) by governmental agencies regarding the Company’s current or prior business activities. Any such legal or\nregulatory actions may subject the Company to substantial compensatory or punitive damages, significant fines,\npenalties, obligations to change the Company’s business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses,\ndiminished income and damage to the Company’s reputation. The Company’s involvement in any such matters, whether\n50\ntangential or otherwise and even if the matters are ultimately determined in the Company’s favor, could also cause\nsignificant harm to the Company’s reputation and divert management attention from the operation of the Company’s\nbusiness. Further, any settlement, consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal\nproceeding or investigation by government agencies may result in litigation, investigations or proceedings as other\nlitigants and government agencies begin independent reviews of the same activities. As a result, the outcome of legal and\nregulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of\noperations and growth prospects.\nMoreover, U.S. authorities have been increasingly focused on “conduct risk,” a term that is used to describe the\nrisks associated with behavior by employees and agents, including third-party vendors, that could harm clients,\nconsumers, investors or the markets, such as failures to safeguard consumers’ and investors’ personal information,\nfailures to identify and manage conflicts of interest and improperly creating, selling and marketing products and\nservices. In addition to increasing compliance risks, this focus on conduct risk could lead to more regulatory or other\nenforcement proceedings and litigation, including for practices which historically were acceptable but are now receiving\ngreater scrutiny. Further, while the Company takes numerous steps to prevent and detect conduct by employees and\nagents that could potentially harm clients, investors or the markets, such behavior may not always be deterred or\nprevented. Banking regulators have also focused on the overall culture of financial services firms. In addition to\nregulatory restrictions or structural changes that could result from perceived deficiencies in the Company’s culture, such\nfocus could also lead to additional regulatory proceedings.\nIf the goodwill that the Company recorded in connection with the Company’s recent acquisitions becomes impaired, it\ncould have a negative impact on its financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had goodwill of $46.8 million, or 12.7% of the Company’s total\nstockholders’ equity. The excess purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets from acquisitions, or goodwill,\nis evaluated for impairment at least annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more\nlikely than not that an impairment has occurred. In testing for impairment, the Company conducts a qualitative\nassessment, and the Company also estimates the fair value of net assets based on analyses of its market value, discounted\ncash flows and peer values. Consequently, the determination of the fair value of goodwill is sensitive to market-based\neconomics and other key assumptions. Variability in market conditions or in key assumptions could result in impairment\nof goodwill, which is recorded as a non-cash adjustment to income. An impairment of goodwill could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company is subject to extensive regulation, and the regulatory framework that applies to the Company, together\nwith any future legislative or regulatory changes, may significantly affect its operations.\nThe banking industry is extensively regulated and supervised under both federal and state laws and regulations\nthat are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, clients, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking\nsystem as a whole, not for the protection of the Company’s business or stockholders. The Company is subject to\nsupervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve, and the Bank is subject to supervision and regulation by the OCC and\nthe FDIC. The laws and regulations applicable to the Company govern a variety of matters, including permissible types,\namounts and terms of loans and investments the Company may make, the maximum interest rate that may be charged,\nthe amount of reserves the Company must hold against deposits the Company takes, the types of deposits the Company\nmay accept, maintenance of adequate capital and liquidity, changes in the control of the Company and its Bank,\nrestrictions on dividends and establishment of new offices. The Company must obtain approval from its regulators\nbefore engaging in certain activities, and there is the risk that such approvals may not be obtained, either in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Company’s regulators also have the ability to compel it to take certain actions, or restrict it from\ntaking certain actions entirely, such as actions that the Company’s regulators deem to constitute an unsafe or unsound\nbanking practice. The Company’s failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, or regulatory policies and\ninterpretations of such laws and regulations, could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties or\ndamage to the Company’s reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n51\nWhile the Company endeavors to maintain safe banking practices and controls beyond the regulatory\nrequirements applicable to the Company, its internal controls may not match those of larger banking institutions that are\nsubject to increased regulatory oversight.\nFinancial institutions generally have also been subjected to increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities,\nincluding in the wake of the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank in 2023. This\nincreased regulatory burden has resulted, and may continue to result in, increased costs of doing business, and may in the\nfuture, result in decreased revenues and net income, reduce the Company’s ability to compete effectively, to attract and\nretain clients, or make it less attractive for the Company to continue providing certain products and services. Any future\nchanges in federal and state laws and regulations, as well as the interpretation and implementation of such laws and\nregulations, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways, including those listed above or other ways\nthat could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and\ngrowth prospects. For example, in December 2019, the U.S. Congress enacted the Setting Every Community up for\nRetirement Enhancement, or SECURE Act. The SECURE Act made significant changes to provisions of existing law\ngoverning retirement plans and IRAs. Many of the provisions of the SECURE Act were effective on January 1, 2020,\nwhile other provisions are effective on later dates, including some that are not effective until action is taken to modify\nunderlying retirement plan documents. In addition, in December 2022, the U.S. Congress enacted the SECURE 2.0 Act\nof 2022, or SECURE 2.0, which built some of the provisions of the SECURE Act and made additional significant\nchanges to provisions of existing law governing retirement plans and IRAs. Many of the provisions of SECURE 2.0\nwere effective immediately upon passage of SECURE 2.0 while other provisions are effective on later dates. Some of\nthe changes in law made by the SECURE Act and SECURE 2.0 are complex and unclear in application. The Company\ncannot predict what impact the SECURE Act or SECURE 2.0 will ultimately have on the Company’s business.\nThere is uncertainty surrounding potential legal, regulatory and policy changes by new presidential administrations\nin the United States that may directly affect financial institutions and the global economy.\n2024 is a presidential election year. Changes in federal policy and at regulatory agencies occur over time\nthrough policy and personnel changes following elections, which lead to changes involving the level of oversight and\nfocus on the financial services industry. The nature, timing and economic and political effects of potential changes to the\ncurrent legal and regulatory framework affecting financial institutions remain highly uncertain. Uncertainty surrounding\nfuture changes may adversely affect our operating environment and therefore our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and growth prospects.\nThe Company’s retirement and benefit services and wealth management businesses are highly regulated, and the\nregulators have the ability to limit or restrict the Company’s activities and impose fines or suspensions on the conduct\nof the Company’s business.\nThe Company’s retirement and benefit services and wealth management businesses are highly regulated,\nprimarily at the federal level. The failure of any of the Company’s businesses that provide investment management or\nwealth management and trust services to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, suspensions of\nindividual employees or other sanctions. The Company is also subject to the provisions and regulations of the Employee\nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA, to the extent that the Company acts as a “fiduciary” under ERISA\nwith respect to certain of the Company’s clients. ERISA and the applicable provisions of the federal tax laws impose a\nnumber of duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of\neach ERISA plan which is a client, as well as certain transactions by the fiduciaries (and certain other related parties) to\nsuch plans. Changes in these laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company is currently subject to and may continue to be subject to claims and litigation relating to the\nCompany’s fiduciary responsibilities.\nSome of the services the Company provides, such as trust and investment services, require the Company to act\nas fiduciary for its clients and others. From time to time, third parties or government agencies make claims and take legal\n52\naction against the Company pertaining to the performance of its fiduciary responsibilities. For example, the Company\nrecently sold its ESOP fiduciary services business, but remains subject to a number of lawsuits that are typical in that\nindustry, one of which was brought by the United States Department of Labor, related to the Company ESOP’s fiduciary\nservices. If these claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, it may be exposed to\nsignificant financial liability or the Company’s reputation could be damaged. Either of these results may adversely\nimpact demand for the Company’s products and services or otherwise have a material adverse effect on its business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations, or changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations, may have\na material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company operates in an environment that imposes income taxes on its operations at both the federal and\nstate levels to varying degrees. The Company engages in certain strategies to minimize the impact of these taxes.\nConsequently, any change in tax laws or regulations, or new interpretation of an existing law or regulation, could\nsignificantly alter the effectiveness of these strategies.\nThe net deferred tax asset reported on the Company’s balance sheet generally represents the tax benefit of\nfuture deductions from taxable income for items that have already been recognized for financial reporting purposes. The\nbulk of these deferred tax assets consists of deferred loan loss deductions and deferred compensation deductions. The net\ndeferred tax asset is measured by applying currently-enacted income tax rates to the accounting period during which the\ntax benefit is expected to be realized. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s net deferred tax asset was $34.6 million.\nThe Company is subject to stringent capital requirements.\nBanking institutions are required to hold more capital as a percentage of assets than most industries. In the wake\nof the global financial crisis, the Company’s capital requirements increased, both in the amount of capital it must hold\nand in the quality of the capital to absorb losses. In addition, following the bank failures in 2023, federal bank regulatory\nagencies have begun to propose changes and potential increases in existing capital requirements. Holding high amounts\nof capital compresses the Company’s earnings and constrains growth. In addition, the failure to meet applicable\nregulatory capital requirements could result in one or more of the Company’s regulators placing limitations or conditions\non the Company’s activities, including its growth initiatives, or restricting the commencement of new activities, and\ncould affect client and investor confidence, its costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs and its ability to make\nacquisitions and result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations\nand growth prospects.\nFederal regulators periodically examine the Company’s business, and it may be required to remediate adverse\nexamination findings.\nThe Federal Reserve and the OCC periodically examine the Company, including its operations and its\ncompliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a banking agency were to determine that the\nCompany’s financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, asset concentrations, earnings prospects, management,\nliquidity, sensitivity to market risk or other aspects of any of the Company’s operations had become unsatisfactory, or\nthat the Company was in violation of any law or regulation, they may take a number of different remedial actions as they\ndeem appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin “unsafe or unsound” practices, to require affirmative action\nto correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially\nenforced, to direct an increase in the Company’s capital, to restrict the Company’s growth, to assess civil money\npenalties, to fine or remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there\nis an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate the Company’s deposit insurance and place the Company into\nreceivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory action against the Company could have a material adverse effect on its\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n53\nThe Company is subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment\nAct and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe CRA requires the Bank, consistent with safe and sound operations, to ascertain and meet the credit needs of\nits entire community, including low and moderate-income areas. The Company’s failure to comply with the CRA could,\namong other things, result in the denial or delay of certain corporate applications filed by us, including applications for\nbranch openings or relocations and applications to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking institution or\nholding company. In addition, the CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending\nlaws and regulations prohibit discriminatory lending practices by financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice,\nfederal banking agencies and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A\nsuccessful challenge to an institution’s compliance with fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety\nof sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions\nactivity, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also challenge an\ninstitution’s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. In addition, new regulations, increased\nregulatory reviews or changes in the structure of the secondary mortgage markets which the Company utilizes to sell\nmortgage loans may be introduced and may increase costs and make it more difficult to operate a residential mortgage\norigination business. Any of the actions described above could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nNoncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations could result in\nfines or sanctions against the Company.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to\ninstitute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and to file reports such as suspicious activity and\ncurrency transaction reports. The Company is required to comply with these and other anti-money laundering\nrequirements. The federal banking agencies and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network are authorized to impose\nsignificant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and have recently engaged in coordinated\nenforcement efforts against banks and other financial services providers with the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug\nEnforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. The Company is also subject to increased scrutiny of\ncompliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC. If the Company’s policies, procedures and systems are deemed\ndeficient or the policies, procedures and systems of any financial institution the Company acquires in the future are\ndeemed deficient, the Company would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include\nrestrictions on the Company’s ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with\ncertain aspects of the Company’s business plan, including any acquisitions.\nFailure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing\ncould also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nRegulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase the Company’s costs, affect\nor limit how the Company collects and use personal information and adversely affect its business opportunities.\nThe Company is subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including\nrequirements concerning security breach notification, and the Company could be negatively affected by these laws. For\nexample, the Company’s business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things (i) imposes\ncertain limitations on its ability to share nonpublic personal information about its clients with nonaffiliated third parties,\n(ii) requires that the Company provide certain disclosures to clients about the Company’s information collection, sharing\nand security practices and afford clients the right to “opt out” of any information sharing by the Company with\nnonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions) and (iii) requires that the Company develop, implement and maintain\na written comprehensive information security program containing appropriate safeguards based on the Company’s size\nand complexity, the nature and scope of the Company’s activities and the sensitivity of client information it processes, as\nwell as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various state and federal banking regulators and states have also\nenacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law\nenforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Moreover, legislators and regulators\n54\nin the United States are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws,\nincluding with respect to the use of artificial intelligence by financial institutions and their service providers, that\npotentially could have a significant impact on the Company’s current and planned privacy, data protection and\ninformation security-related practices, the Company’s collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer or\nemployee information and some of the Company’s current or planned business activities. This could also increase the\nCompany’s costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives. This\nincludes increased privacy-related enforcement activity at the federal level, by the Federal Trade Commission and the\nCFPB, as well as at the state level, such as with regard to mobile applications.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws (including those\nregarding security breach notification) affecting client or employee data to which the Company is subject could result in\nhigher compliance and technology costs and could restrict the Company’s ability to provide certain products and\nservices, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of\noperations and growth prospects. The Company’s failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information\nsecurity laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or governmental investigations or actions, litigation, fines,\nsanctions and damage to the Company’s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Federal Reserve may require the Company to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nAs a matter of policy, the Federal Reserve expects a financial holding company to act as a source of financial\nand managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. The Dodd-Frank\nAct codified the Federal Reserve’s policy on serving as a source of financial strength. Under the “source of strength”\ndoctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary\nbank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit\nresources to a subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the\nresources to provide it and therefore may be required to borrow the funds or raise capital. Any loans by a holding\ncompany to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such\nsubsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any\ncommitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank.\nMoreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment\nover the claims of the institution’s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any\nborrowing that must be done by the Company to make a required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive\nand could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and\ngrowth prospects.\nNew and future rulemaking by the CFPB and other regulators, as well as enforcement of existing consumer\nprotection laws, may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of\noperations and growth prospects.\nThe CFPB has the authority to implement and enforce a variety of existing federal consumer protection statutes\nand to issue new regulations but, with respect to institutions of the Company’s size, does not have primary examination\nand enforcement authority with respect to such laws and regulations. The authority to examine depository institutions\nwith $10.0 billion or less in assets, like us, for compliance with federal consumer laws remains largely with the\nCompany’s primary federal regulator, the OCC. However, the CFPB may participate in examinations of smaller\ninstitutions on a “sampling basis” and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary\nregulators. In some cases, regulators such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice also retain\ncertain rulemaking or enforcement authority, and the Company also remains subject to certain state consumer protection\nlaws. As an independent bureau within the Federal Reserve, the CFPB may impose requirements more severe than the\nprevious bank regulatory agencies. The CFPB has placed significant emphasis on consumer complaint management and\nhas established a public consumer complaint database to encourage consumers to file complaints they may have against\nfinancial institutions. The Company is expected to monitor and respond to these complaints, including those that the\nCompany deems frivolous, and doing so may require management to reallocate resources away from more profitable\nendeavors.\n55\nThe level of the Company’s commercial real estate portfolio may subject the Company to heightened regulatory\nscrutiny.\nThe federal banking regulators have issued the Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk\nManagement Practices guidance, or CRE Guidance, which provides supervisory criteria, including the following\nnumerical indicators, to assist bank examiners in identifying banks with potentially significant commercial real estate\nloan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: (i) commercial real estate loans exceeding 300% of\ncapital and increasing 50% or more in the preceding three years; or (ii) construction and land development loans\nexceeding 100% of capital. The CRE Guidance does not limit the Bank’s levels of commercial real estate lending\nactivities, but rather, guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are\ncommensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations. On December 18, 2015, the\nfederal banking agencies issued a statement to reinforce prudent risk-management practices related to CRE lending,\nhaving observed substantial growth in many CRE asset and lending markets, increased competitive pressures, rising\nCRE concentrations in banks, and an easing of CRE underwriting standards. The federal bank agencies reminded FDIC-\ninsured institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise prudent risk-management practices to identify,\nmeasure, monitor, and manage the risks arising from CRE lending. In addition, FDIC-insured institutions must maintain\ncapital commensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentration risk.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Bank did not exceed these guidelines.\nThe Company is an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act and because the Company\nhas decided to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting and other requirements applicable to\nemerging growth companies, the Company’s common stock could be less attractive to investors.\nFor as long as the Company remains an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, it will have the\noption to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting and other requirements that are applicable to other\npublic companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor\nattestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, being permitted to have an extended transition\nperiod for adopting any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the FASB or the SEC, reduced\ndisclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding\nadvisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously\napproved. The Company has elected to, and expect to continue to, take advantage of certain of these and other\nexemptions until it is no longer an emerging growth company. The Company will remain an emerging growth company\nuntil the earliest of (i) the end of the fiscal year during which the Company has total annual gross revenues of\n$1.235 billion or more, (ii) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of\ncommon equity securities under the Company’s registration statement on Form S-1, which was declared effective by the\nSEC on September 12, 2019, (iii) the date on which the Company has, during the previous three-year period, issued\nmore than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt and (iv) the end of the first fiscal year in which (A) the market value of\nthe Company’s equity securities that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30 of that year, (B) the\nCompany has been a public reporting company under the Exchange Act for at least twelve calendar months and (C) the\nCompany has filed at least one annual report on Form 10-K. The Company expects to no longer qualify as an emerging\ngrowth company as of December 31, 2024.\nBecause the Company has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting\nstandards for an emerging growth company, the Company’s financial statements may not be comparable to\ncompanies that comply with these accounting standards as of the public company effective dates.\nThe Company has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting\nstandards under Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act. This election allows the Company to delay the adoption of new\nor revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards\napply to private companies. As a result of this election, the Company’s financial statements may not be comparable to\ncompanies that comply with these accounting standards as of the public company effective dates. Because the\nCompany’s financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates,\ninvestors may have difficulty evaluating or comparing the Company’s business, financial results or prospects in\n56\ncomparison to other public companies, which may have a negative impact on the value and liquidity of the Company’s\ncommon stock. The Company cannot predict if investors will find its common stock less attractive because the Company\nplans to rely on this exemption. If some investors find the Company’s common stock less attractive as a result, there may\nbe a less active trading market for the Company’s common stock and the Company’s stock price may be more volatile.\nCertain banking laws and certain provisions of the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have an\nanti-takeover effect.\nProvisions of federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it difficult for a\nthird party to acquire the Company, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to the Company’s stockholders.\nIn general, acquisitions of 10% or more of any class of voting stock of a bank holding company or depository institution\ngenerally creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer “controls” the bank holding company or depository\ninstitution. Also, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before, among other\nthings, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank, including the\nBank.\nThere are also provisions in the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws that could have the effect of\ndelaying, deferring or discouraging another party from acquiring control of the Company, even if such acquisition would\nbe viewed by the Company’s stockholders to be in their best interests. These include supermajority stockholder voting\nthresholds and requirements relating to stockholder meetings and nominations or proposals. The Company is also subject\nto a statutory antitakeover provision included in the DGCL. In addition, the Company’s Board of Directors is authorized\nunder its certificate of incorporation to issue shares of preferred stock, and determine the rights, terms conditions and\nprivileges of such preferred stock, without stockholder approval. These provisions may effectively inhibit a non-\nnegotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the market price\nof the Company’s common stock.\nThe Company’s certificate of incorporation has an exclusive forum provision, which could limit a stockholder’s\nability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or other employees.\nThe Company’s certificate of incorporation has an exclusive forum provision providing that the Court of\nChancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding\nbrought on the Company’s behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty by any of the Company’s\ndirectors, officers, employees or agents; (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the DGCL, the Company’s\ncertificate of incorporation or the Company’s bylaws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal\naffairs doctrine. However, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to\nenforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the\nexclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or\nany other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, Section 22 of the Securities Act\ncreates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created\nby the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would\nenforce such a provision, and the Company’s stockholders will not be deemed to have waived its compliance with the\nfederal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThe Company’s stockholders approved this provision. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any\ninterest in any shares of the Company’s capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this\nprovision of the Company’s certificate of incorporation. The exclusive forum provision, if enforced, may limit a\nstockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or the\nCompany’s directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to\nfind the exclusive forum provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company may incur additional\ncosts associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n57\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 or other such laws could result in increased operating expenses as well\nas additional exposure to the risk of litigation by or on behalf of customers.\nIn June of 2018, the Governor of California signed into law The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or\nthe CCPA. This new law became effective on January 1, 2020 and provides consumers with expansive rights and control\nover their personal information, which is obtained by or shared with “covered businesses,” including for-profit\nbusinesses that conduct business in California and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds. The CCPA will\ngive consumers the right to request disclosure of information collected about them and whether that information has\nbeen sold or shared with others, the right to request deletion of personal information subject to certain exceptions, the\nright to opt out of the sale of the consumer’s personal information, and the right not to be discriminated against because\nof choices regarding the consumer’s personal information.\nThe CCPA provides for certain monetary penalties and for its enforcement by the California Attorney General\nor consumers whose rights under the law are not observed. It also provides for damages as well as injunctive or\ndeclaratory relief if there has been unauthorized access, theft, or disclosure of personal information due to failure to\nimplement reasonable security procedures. The Company continues to assess the potential impact of the CCPA on the\nCompany’s business, but it could result in increased operating expenses as well as additional exposure to the risk of\nlitigation by or on behalf of consumers. It is also possible that other states where the Company has customers could enact\nsimilar laws.\nClimate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may result in operational changes and expenditures\nthat could significantly impact the Company’s business.\nThe current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of\nthe global environment. As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased. In recent\nyears, governments across the world have entered into international agreements to attempt to reduce global temperatures,\nin part by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory\nagencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the\neffects of climate change. These agreements and measures may result in the imposition of taxes and fees, the required\npurchase of emission credits, and the implementation of significant operational changes, each of which may require the\nCompany to expend significant capital and incur compliance, operating, maintenance, and remediation costs. Consumers\nand businesses may also change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. The impact on the Company’s\ncustomers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on, or role in, carbon intensive\nactivities. The Company’s efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions, including by\nincreasing the Company’s business with climate-friendly companies, may not be effective in protecting the Company\nfrom the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior.\nGiven the lack of empirical data on the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change, it is difficult to\npredict how climate change may impact the Company’s financial condition and operations; however, as a banking\norganization, the physical effects of climate change may present certain unique risks. For example, weather disasters,\nshifts in local climates, and other disruptions related to climate change may adversely affect the value of real properties\nsecuring the Company’s loans, which could diminish the value of the Company’s loan portfolio. Such events may also\ncause reductions in regional and local economic activity that may have an adverse effect on the Company’s customers,\nwhich could limit the Company’s ability to raise and invest capital in these areas and communities.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nRisk Management and Strategy. The Company relies extensively on various information systems and other\nelectronic resources to operate its business. In addition, nearly all of the Company’s customers, service providers and other\nbusiness partners on whom the Company depends, including the providers of the Company’s online banking, mobile\n58\nbanking and accounting systems, use these systems and their own electronic information systems. Any of these systems\ncan be compromised, including by employees, customers and other individuals who are authorized to use them, and bad\nactors using sophisticated and constantly evolving set of software, tools and strategies to do so. The nature of the\nCompany’s business, as a financial services provider, and the Company’s relative size, make the Company and its business\npartners high-value targets for these bad actors to pursue. See “Item 1A. RISK FACTORS—Operational, Strategic and\nReputational Risks”.\nAccordingly, the Company has devoted significant resources to assessing, identifying and managing risks\nassociated with cybersecurity threats, as noted below:\n Identifying and assessing cybersecurity threats: The Company regularly evaluates its systems and data for\npotential vulnerabilities and analyzes the evolving cyber threat landscape, to ensure it proactively addresses\nrisks before they materialize. The Company employs monitoring tools that can detect and help respond to\ncybersecurity threats in real-time.\n Integration with Overall Risk Management: Cybersecurity risks are seamlessly integrated into the\nCompany’s broader risk management framework, ensuring a holistic view and prioritized mitigation\nstrategies.\n Management of Third-Party Risk: The Company’s comprehensive third-party management process\nincludes rigorous due diligence, oversight and identification of cybersecurity risks associated with vendors\nand service providers.\n Team: The Company has an internal cybersecurity team that is responsible for conducting regular\nassessments of its information systems, existing controls, vulnerabilities and potential improvements.\n Engagement of Expert Assistance: The Company leverages the expertise of independent consultants, legal\nadvisors, and audit firms to evaluate the effectiveness of our risk management systems and address potential\ncybersecurity incidents efficiently.\n Training: The Company conducts periodic cybersecurity training for its workforce.\nThis information security program is a key part of the Company’s overall risk management system, which is\nadministered by the Director of Information Security. The program includes administrative, technical and physical\nsafeguards to help protect the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. These security and privacy\npolicies and procedures are in effect across all of the Company’s businesses and geographic locations.\nFrom time-to-time, the Company has identified cybersecurity threats and cybersecurity incidents that require the\nCompany to make changes to its processes and to implement additional safeguards. While none of these identified threats\nor incidents have materially affected the Company, it is possible that threats and incidents the Company identifies in the\nfuture could have a material adverse effect on its business strategy, results of operations and financial condition.\nGovernance. The Company’s management team is responsible for the day-to-day management of cybersecurity\nrisks it faces, including the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer and Director of Information\nSecurity. The Company’s current Director of Information Security has over 28 years of experience. For the past 7 years,\nthe Company’s Director of Information Security has successfully managed teams, implementing and maintaining robust\ncybersecurity and data protection controls to safeguard the Company’s information assets. The Company’s Director of\nInformation Security reports directly to our Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, who possesses\nextensive expertise gained through over 39 years in various IT and leadership roles. This combined experience ensures\nexceptional guidance and oversight of our cybersecurity program.\nIn addition, the Company’s Board of Directors, both as a whole and through its Risk Committee (the “Risk\nCommittee”), is responsible for the oversight of risk management, including cybersecurity risks. In that role, the\n59\nCompany’s Board of Directors and the Risk Committee, with support from the Company’s cybersecurity advisors, are\nresponsible for ensuring that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate\nand functioning as designed. To carry out those duties, both the Company’s Board of Directors and the Risk Committee\nreceive quarterly reports from the Company’s management team regarding cybersecurity risks and the Company’s\nefforts to prevent, detect, mitigate and remediate any cybersecurity incidents.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nThe Company’s corporate headquarters are located at 401 Demers Avenue, Grand Forks, North Dakota 58201.\nIn addition to the Company’s corporate headquarters, which includes a full service banking office, the Company\noperates two other full-service banking office located in Grand Forks, North Dakota, three full-service banking offices\nlocated in Fargo and West Fargo, North Dakota, one full-service banking office located in Northwood, North Dakota, six\nfull-service banking offices located in the Twin Cities MSA, and two full-service banking office located in the Phoenix\nMSA. The Company offers retirement and benefits, wealth management and mortgage products and services at all of its\nfull-service banking offices. In addition, the Company operates one retirement and benefits services office in each of\nMinnesota, Colorado and Michigan. The Company has remodeled several locations to utilize the Company’s spaces in a\nmore efficient manner. As of December 31, 2023, seven of the Company’s office properties were owned and eleven of\nthe Company’s office properties were leased.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nNeither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party, and no property of these entities is subject, to any\nmaterial pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the Bank’s business.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER\nMATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information\nThe Company’s common stock trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq, under the symbol “ALRS”.\nStockholders\nAs of February 28, 2024, the Company had 227 holders of record of the Company’s common stock and an\nestimated 2,966 additional beneficial holders of the Company’s common stock whose stock was held in street name by\nbrokerages or fiduciaries.\n60\nStock Repurchase Plans\nThe following table presents information related to repurchases of the Company’s common stock for each\ncalendar month in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nTotal Number of Maximum Number of\nTotal Number Average Shares Purchased as Shares that May\nof Shares Price Paid Part of Publicly Yet be Purchased\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data) Purchased (1) per Share Announced Plans Under the Plan (2)\nOctober 1-31, 2023 71,700 $ 17.68 71,700 459,826\nNovember 1-30, 2023 46,300 17.59 46,300 413,526\nDecember 1-31, 2023 — — — 413,526\nTotal 118,000 $ 17.65 118,000 413,526\n(1) Shares repurchased by the Company included shares surrendered by employees to the Company to pay withholding taxes on the vesting of\nrestricted stock awards. There were no shares surrendered by employees to the Company to pay withholding taxes on vesting of restricted\nstock awards in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n(2) On February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a stock repurchase program, or the Existing Program, which\nauthorized the Company to repurchase up to 770,000 shares of its common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions. The Existing\nProgram was effective immediately and continued until February 18, 2024. On December 12, 2023, the Board approved a new stock\nrepurchase program, or the New Program, which authorizes the Company to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of its common stock, subject\nto certain limitations and conditions. The New Program became effective on February 18, 2024, and replaced the Existing Program. The\nNew Program will expire on February 18, 2027. Neither the Existing Program nor the New Program obligates the Company to repurchase\nany shares of its common stock and there is no assurance that the Company will do so. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, the\nCompany repurchased 118,000 shares of common stock under the Existing Program.\n61\nPerformance Graph\nThe following graph compares the percentage change in the cumulative stockholder return of the Company’s\ncommon stock for the period December 31, 2019, through December 31, 2023.

The Company’s dividend policy and\npractice may change in the future, however, and the Company’s Board of Directors may change or eliminate the\npayment of future dividends at its discretion, without notice to the Company’s stockholders. Any future determination to\npay dividends to holders of the Company’s common stock will depend on its results of operations, financial condition,\neconomic conditions, capital requirements, banking regulations, contractual restrictions and any other factors that the\nCompany’s Board of Directors may deem relevant.\n62\nDividend Restrictions\nAs a Delaware corporation, the Company is subject to certain restrictions on dividends under the DGCL. In\ngeneral, a Delaware corporation may only pay dividends either out of surplus (as defined and computed in accordance\nwith the provisions of the DGCL) or out of the current or the immediately preceding year’s net profits. Surplus is defined\nas the excess, if any, at any given time, of the total assets of a corporation over its total liabilities and statutory capital.\nThe value of a corporation’s assets can be measured in a number of ways and may not necessarily equal their book\nvalue.\nIn the first quarter of 2021, the Company issued subordinated debt to the Bank of North Dakota pursuant to a\nSubordinated Note Purchase Agreement, dated March 30, 2021 (the “Note Purchase Agreement”). Under the terms of\nthe Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement, if an event of default has occurred (as defined in the Subordinated Note\nPurchase Agreement), the Company cannot, subject to certain exceptions outlined in the Note Purchase Agreement, pay\nany dividends to its stockholders until such event of default or failure to comply with said covenants is cured, without\nthe prior written consent of the Bank of North Dakota.\nUnder the terms of the Company’s junior subordinated debentures issued to its two statutory trusts, the\nCompany is not permitted to pay dividends on its capital stock if an event of default occurs under the terms of the\ndebentures, the Company is otherwise in default with respect to the Company’s payment obligations or the Company has\nelected to defer interest payments on the debentures.\nIn addition, the Company is subject to certain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends as a result of\nbanking laws, regulations and policies. See “SUPERVISION AND REGULATION—Supervision and Regulation of the\nCompany—Dividend Payments.” Because the Company is a holding company and does not engage directly in business\nactivities of a material nature, the Company’s ability to pay dividends to its stockholders depends, in large part, upon its\nreceipt of dividends from the Bank, which is also subject to numerous limitations on the payment of dividends under\nfederal banking laws, regulations and policies. See “SUPERVISION AND REGULATION—Supervision and\nRegulation of the Bank—Dividend Payments.”\nUse of Proceeds\nNone.\nITEM 6. [RESERVED]\nNot applicable.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\nOF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be\nread in conjunction with the “Selected Financial Data” and the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements\nand related notes included elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis\ncontains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Certain risks, uncertainties and\nother factors, including but not limited to those set forth under “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements,” “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report, may cause actual results to differ materially from those\nprojected in the forward-looking statements. The Company assumes no obligation to update any of these\nforward-looking statements.\nOverview\nThe Company is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Grand Forks, North Dakota.\nThrough the Company’s subsidiary, Alerus Financial, National Association, the Company provides innovative and\ncomprehensive financial solutions to businesses and consumers through four distinct business lines—banking, retirement\n63\nand benefit services, wealth management and mortgage. These solutions are delivered through a relationship oriented\nprimary point of contact along with responsive and client friendly technology.\nThe Company’s primary banking market areas are the states of North Dakota, Minnesota, specifically, the Twin\nCities MSA, and Arizona, specifically, the Phoenix MSA. In addition to the Company’s offices located in the\nCompany’s banking markets, its retirement and benefit services business administers plans in all 50 states through\noffices located in Michigan, Minnesota and Colorado.\nThe Company’s business model produces strong financial performance and a diversified revenue stream, which\nhas helped the Company establish a brand and culture yielding both a loyal client base and passionate and dedicated\nemployees. The Company believes its client first and advice based philosophy, diversified business model and history of\nhigh performance and growth distinguishes the Company from other financial service providers. The Company generates\na majority of its overall revenue from noninterest income, which is driven primarily by the Company’s retirement and\nbenefit services, wealth management and mortgage business lines.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $3.9 billion of total assets, $2.8 billion of total loans, $3.1 billion\nof total deposits, $369.1 million of stockholders’ equity, $36.7 billion of AUA/AUM in the Company’s retirement and\nbenefit services segment, and $4.0 billion of AUA/AUM in the Company’s wealth management segment. For the year\nended December 31, 2023, the Company had $364.1 million of mortgage originations.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income represents interest income less interest expense. The Company generates interest income on\ninterest-earning assets, primarily loans and available-for-sale securities. The Company incurs interest expense on\ninterest-bearing liabilities, primarily interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. To evaluate net interest income, the\nCompany measures and monitors: (i) yields on loans, available-for-sale securities and other interest-earning assets;\n(ii) the costs of deposits and other funding sources; (iii) the rates incurred on borrowings and other interest-bearing\nliabilities; and (iv) the regulatory risk weighting associated with the assets. Interest income is primarily impacted by loan\ngrowth and loan repayments, along with changes in interest rates on the loans. Interest expense is primarily impacted by\nchanges in deposit balances along with the volume and type of interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is\nprimarily impacted by changes in market interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, and interest the Company earns on\ninterest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income primarily consists of the following:\n The Company’s retirement and benefit services business, which includes retirement plan administration,\nretirement plan investment advisory, HSA, ESOP administration and recordkeeping, and other benefit\nservices, is the Company’s largest source of noninterest income. Over half of the Company’s retirement\nand benefit services fees are transaction or participant-based fees and are impacted by the number of plans\nand participants. The remainder of noninterest income is based on the market value of the related AUA and\nAUM and impacted by the level of contributions, withdrawals, new business, lost business and fluctuation\nin market values.\n Wealth management includes personal trust, investment and brokerage services. The Company earns trust,\ninvestment, and IRA fees from managing assets, including corporate trusts, personal trusts, and separately\nmanaged accounts. Trust and investment management fees are primarily based on a tiered scale relative to\nthe market value of the AUM. Trust and investment management fees are primarily impacted by rates\ncharged and increases and decreases in AUM. AUM is primarily impacted by opening and closing of client\nadvisory and trust accounts, contributions and withdrawals, and the fluctuation in market values.\n64\n Mortgage noninterest income consists of gains on originating and selling mortgages and origination fees.\nMortgage gains are primarily impacted by the level of originations, amount of loans sold, the type of loans\nsold and market conditions.\n Service charges on deposit accounts are comprised of income generated through deposit account related\nservice charges such as: electronic transfer fees, treasury management fees, bill pay fees, and other banking\nfees. Banking fees are primarily impacted by the level of business activities and cash movement activities\nof the Company’s clients.\n Net gains (losses) on investment securities consists of the realized gains or losses related to the sale of\navailable-for-sale investment securities.\n Other noninterest income consists of debit card interchange income, income earned on the growth of the\ncash surrender value of life insurance policies the Company holds on to certain key employees, loan\nservicing income net of the related amortization, and any other income which does not fit within one of the\nspecific noninterest income lines described above. Other noninterest income is generally impacted by\nbusiness activities and level of transactions.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense is comprised primarily of the following:\n Compensation and employee taxes and benefits—include all forms of personnel related expenses including\nsalary, commissions, incentive compensation, payroll related taxes, stock-based compensation, benefit\nplans, health insurance, 401(k) plan match costs, ESOP and other benefit related expenses. Compensation\nand employee benefit costs are primarily impacted by changes in headcount and fluctuations in benefits\ncosts.\n Occupancy and equipment—costs related to owning and leasing the Company’s office space, depreciation\ncharges for the furniture, fixtures and equipment, amortization of leasehold improvements, utilities and\nother occupancy related expenses. Occupancy and equipment costs are primarily impacted by the number\nand size of the locations the Company occupies.\n Business services, software and technology—costs related to contracts with core system and third-party\ndata processing providers, software and information technology services to support office activities and\ninternal networks. The Company believes its technology spending enhances the efficiency of the\nCompany’s employees and enables the Company to provide outstanding service to its clients. Technology\nand information system costs are primarily impacted by the number of locations the Company occupies, the\nnumber of employees, clients and volume of transactions the Company has and the level of service the\nCompany requires from its third party technology vendors.\n Intangible amortization expense is the result of acquisitions of fee income and banking companies.\nIdentified intangible assets with definite lives consist of client relationship intangibles and are amortized on\na straight-line basis over the period representing the estimated remaining lives of the assets. The amount of\nexpense is impacted by the timing of acquisitions and the estimated remaining lives of the assets.\n Professional fees and assessments—costs related to legal, accounting, tax, consulting, personnel recruiting,\ndirectors fees, insurance and other outsourcing arrangements. Professional services costs are primarily\nimpacted by corporate activities requiring specialized services. FDIC insurance expense is also included in\nthis line and represents the assessments that the Company pays to the FDIC for deposit insurance.\n Other operational expenses—includes costs related to marketing, donations, promotions, and expenses\nassociated with office supplies, postage, travel expenses, meals and entertainment, dues and memberships,\n65\ncosts to maintain or prepare other real estate owned, or OREO, for sale, and other general corporate\nexpenses that do not fit within one of the specific noninterest expense lines described above. Other\noperational expenses are generally impacted by the Company’s business activities and needs.\nOperating Segments\nThe Company measures the overall profitability of business operations based on income before income tax. The\nCompany allocates costs to its segments, which consist primarily of compensation and overhead expense directly\nattributable to the products and services within banking, retirement and benefit services, wealth management, and\nmortgage. The Company measures the profitability of each segment based on the direct and indirect allocations of\nexpense as it believes it better approximates the contribution generated by the Company’s reportable operating segments.\nAll indirect overhead allocations to each segment are determined by management based on an annual review of\ndepartment expenses. Income tax expense is allocated to corporate administration. A description of each segment is\nprovided in Note 22 (Segment Reporting) of the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8\nof this Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAs a result of the complex and dynamic nature of the Company’s business, management must exercise\njudgment in selecting and applying the most appropriate accounting policies for its various areas of operations. The\npolicy decision process not only ensures compliance with current GAAP, but also reflects management’s discretion with\nregard to choosing the most suitable methodology for reporting the Company’s financial performance. It is\nmanagement’s opinion that the accounting estimates covering certain aspects of the business have more significance than\nothers due to the relative importance of those areas to overall performance, or the level of subjectivity in the selection\nprocess. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as disclosures of revenues and\nexpenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The most critical of the\naccounting policies is discussed below.\nAllowance for credit losses (“ACL”)— In 2023, the Company adopted the new accounting standard for credit\nlosses, ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on\nFinancial Instruments, as amended (“ASU 2016-13”). This new accounting standard, commonly referred to as “CECL,”\nsignificantly changed the Company’s methodology for accounting for reserves on loans, unfunded off balance sheet\ncredit exposures, including certain unfunded loan commitments and standby guarantees, as well as introduced the\nconsideration for an allowance on HTM investment securities. ASU 2016-13 replaced the “incurred loss” methodology\nused prior to 2023 to establish an allowance on loans and off-balance sheet credit exposures, with an “expected loss”\napproach. Under CECL, the ACL at each reporting period serves as our best estimate of projected credit losses over the\ncontractual life of certain assets, adjusted for expected prepayments, given an expectation of economic conditions and\nforecasts as of the valuation date.\nThe recorded ACL on loans and HTM investment securities is determined based on the amortized cost basis of\nthe assets and may be determined at various levels, including homogeneous loan pools, individual credits with unique\nrisk factors, and homogenous HTM investment securities pools, by credit rating. Since adoption of CECL in 2023, the\nCompany has used a discounted cash flow approach to calculate the ACL for each loan segment. Within the discounted\ncash flow model, a probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”) assumption is applied to calculate the\nexpected loss for each loan segment. PD is the probability the asset will default within a given timeframe and LGD is the\npercentage of the assets not expected to be collected due to default. PD and LGD data is derived using a combination of\nexternal data and internal historical default and loss experience.\nCECL may create more volatility in our ACL, particularly our ACL on loans and ACL on off balance sheet\ncredit exposures. Under CECL, our ACL may increase or decrease period to period based on many factors, including,\nbut not limited to: macroeconomic forecasts and conditions; a change in the prepayment speed assumption; an increase\nor decrease in loan balances, including changes to the Company’s loan portfolio mix; credit quality of the loan portfolio;\nand various qualitative factors outlined in ASU 2016-13.\n66\nASU 2016-13 also changed the Company’s methodology and accounting for credit losses within the investment\nportfolio designated as AFS. To the extent the fair value of a security designated as AFS is less than its amortized cost\nand the Company either intends to sell the security or it is more-likely-than-not the Company will be required to sell the\nsecurity before recovery of its amortized cost basis, then the investment is permanently impaired and the amortized cost\nbasis is written down to fair value and a corresponding impairment charge is recorded within the consolidated statements\nof income. If neither of the above is true, but the fair value of the investment is below its amortized cost basis at the\nreporting date, then an allowance is established on the AFS investment for the portion of the impairment that is due to\ncredit reasons (e.g. credit rating downgrades, past due receivables, and/or other macro- or micro-adverse trends). The\nallowance established on an AFS investment due to credit losses is limited to the amount the fair value of the investment\nis below its amortized cost basis as of the reporting date. If the fair value of the investment is below its amortized cost\nbasis for non-credit-related reasons (e.g. interest rate environment), then the impairment continues to be recognized\nwithin stockholders' equity through AOCI.\nACL on Loans. The Company considers the ACL on loans to be a critical accounting policy given the\nuncertainty in evaluating the allowance required to cover management’s estimate of all expected credit losses over the\nexpected contractual life of the loans in its portfolio. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is a key\nmanagement function that requires significant judgment and estimate by management about the effect of matters that are\ninherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the current loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may\nresult in significant changes in the allowance in future periods. While the Company’s current evaluation indicates that\nthe ACL on loans at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was appropriate, the allowance may need to be increased under\nadversely different conditions or assumptions.\nThe significant key assumptions used with the ACL on loans calculation at December 31, 2023 using the CECL\nmethodology, included:\n Macroeconomic factors (loss drivers): Macroeconomic factors are used within our discounted cash flow model\nto forecast the PD over the forecast period. As macroeconomic factors condition worsen, the PD increases, and\nthe corresponding LGD increases, resulting in an increase in the ACL on loans. The Company utilizes National\nunemployment, changes in National GDP, and changes in National Housing Price Index in estimation of the\nACL on loans. Macroeconomic factors used in the calculation of the ACL on loans may change from time to\ntime and in times of greater uncertainty. The Company may consider a range of possible forecasts and evaluate\nthe probability of each scenario.\n Forecast Period and Reversion speed: ASU 2016-13 requires a company to use a reasonable and supportable\nforecast period in developing the ACL, which represents the time period that management believes it can\nreasonably forecast the identified loss drivers. Generally, the forecast period management believes to be\nreasonable and supportable is set annually and validated through an assessment of economic leading indicators.\nIn periods of greater volatility and uncertainty, such as that seen across the global markets and economies,\nincluding the U.S., the Company may elect to use a shorter forecast period, whereas when markets, economies\nand various other factors are considered more stable and certain, the Company may elect to use a longer\nforecast period. Generally, the Company expects its forecast period to range from one to two years. Once the\nreasonable and supportable forecast period is determined, ASU 2016-13 requires a company to revert its loss\nexpectations to the long-run historical mean for the remainder of the contract life of the asset, adjusted for\nprepayments. In determining the length of time over which the reversion will take place (i.e. “reversion speed”),\nthe Company considers such factors such as, but not limited to, historical loan loss experience over previous\neconomic cycles, as well as where the Company believes it is within the current economic cycle. At December\n31, 2023, the Company used a one-year forecast period and one-year reversion period for each loan segment to\nmeasure the ACL on loans.\n Prepayment speeds: Prepayment speeds are determined for each loan segment utilizing the Company’s own\nhistorical loan data, as well as consideration of current environmental factors. The prepayment speed\nassumption is utilized with the discounted cash flow model (i.e. the CECL model) to forecast expected cash\nflows over the contractual life of the loan, adjusted for expected prepayments. A higher prepayment speed\nassumption will drive a lower ACL, and vice versa.\n67\n Qualitative factors: ASU 2016-13 requires companies to consider various qualitative factors that may impact\nexpected credit losses. The Company continues to consider qualitative factors in determining and arriving at our\nACL on loans each reporting period.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the recorded ACL on loans was $35.8 million and represented the Company’s best\nestimate of expected credit losses within the loan portfolio. However, the Company may adjust its assumptions to\naccount for differences between expected and actual losses each period. A future change of the Company’s assumptions\nwill likely alter the level of allowance required and may have a material impact on future results of operations and\nfinancial condition. The ACL is reviewed periodically within a calendar quarter to assess trends in the aforementioned\nkey assumptions, as well as asset quality within the loan portfolio, and the Company considers the impact of these trends\non the ACL and the Company's financial condition, if any. The ACL on loans is reviewed and approved on a quarterly\nbasis by the ACL Governance Committee, and later reviewed and ratified by the Bank's Board of Directors.\nRefer to “—Results of Operations—Provision for Credit Losses,” “—Financial Condition—Asset Quality,” and\nNote 6 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nACL on Off Balance Sheet Credit Exposures. The Company considers the ACL on off balance sheet credit\nexposures to be a critical accounting policy given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance required to\ncover management’s estimate of all expected credit losses on expected future loan fundings of, primarily, unfunded loan\ncommitments for those that are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The expected credit loss factor\ncalculated for each loan segment using the ACL on loans methodology described above, as well as within Note 1 of the\nconsolidated financial statements, is used to calculate the ACL on off balance sheet credit exposures for each applicable\nloan segment, and, thus, are subject to the same level of estimation risk and volatility previously described. In addition,\none other key assumption is used to derive the allowance on off balance sheet credit exposures and that is the expected\nfunding rate. The expected funding rate is derived using historical loan level data for credit line usage, and is applied to\ntotal off balance sheet credit exposures at each reporting date, excluding any that are unconditionally cancellable by the\nCompany, to determine the expected funding amount. As unfunded loan commitments are funded, the allowance\nmigrates from that provided for off balance sheet credit exposures to the ACL on loans. If the expected funding rate or\nany other key assumption used is not reasonable, then this could have an adverse impact on the total ACL upon funding.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the recorded ACL on off balance sheet credit exposures was $7.4 million and\npresented within accrued interest and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Increases (decreases) to the\nallowance are presented within provision (credit) for credit losses on the consolidated statements of income. The\nallowance at December 31, 2023, represented the Company’s best estimate, however, it may adjust assumptions to\naccount for differences between expected and actual losses from period to period. A future change to the Company’s\nassumptions will likely alter the level of allowance required and may have a material impact on future results of\noperations and financial condition.\nRefer to “—Results of Operations—Provision for Credit Losses,” “—Financial Condition—Asset Quality,” and\nNote 6 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nACL for HTM Debt Securities. The estimate of expected credit losses on the Company’s HTM investment\nportfolio utilizes external PD and LGD data by credit rating to determine a loss rate. Management may exercise\ndiscretion to make adjustments based on various environmental factors.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company held securities in its HTM portfolio with an amortized cost basis of\n$299.7 million that primarily consisted of MBS and CMO debt securities issued, municipal bonds or guaranteed by U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored agencies. Under ASU 2016-13 the Company has the ability to exclude certain securities when the\nhistorical credit loss information, adjusted for current conditions and forecasts, resulting in zero risk of nonpayment of\nthe amortized cost basis of the security. Management has evaluated and determined zero risk of nonpayment on all\nsecurities guaranteed by the U.S government agencies. At December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an ACL on HTM\ndebt securities of $213 thousand.\n68\nRefer to “—Financial Condition—Investments” and Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for further\ndiscussion.\nACL on AFS Debt Securities. The Company considers the ACL on AFS debt securities to be a critical accounting\npolicy given the size of the investment portfolio and level of estimation used to determine the allowance, as appropriate. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company's AFS portfolio was entirely made up of assets that are fair valued using level 2 valuation\ntechniques in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. The Company engages a third party pricing agency to assist\nwith the valuation of such debt securities and the assets are carried at fair value at each reporting period. An allowance is\nrecorded on an AFS debt security to the extent an event has occurred that suggests receipt of full contractual payments are at\nrisk. When such an event has been identified, a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the expected losses due to\ncredit risk, and an allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the debt security by the calculated expected loss\namount, limited to the amount by which the fair value of the debt security is below its amortized cost basis.\nAs further described within “—Financial Condition—Investments,” the Company's AFS portfolio, as of December\n31, 2023, primarily consisted of MBS and CMO debt securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies,\nand, thus, presenting little to no credit risk. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had not identified indications of credit risk\nand did not carry any allowance for credit losses on its AFS portfolio, nor did it record any permanent impairments during\n2023, 2022 or 2021.\nRefer to “—Financial Condition—Investments” and Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for further\ndiscussion.\nIntangible assets—As a result of acquisitions, the Company carries goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.\nGoodwill represents the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets at the acquisition date. Goodwill is\nevaluated at least annually or when business conditions suggest impairment may have occurred. Should impairment occur,\ngoodwill will be reduced to its revised carrying value through a charge to earnings. Core deposits and other identifiable\nintangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives. The determination of whether or not impairment\nexists is based upon discounted cash flow modeling techniques that require management to make estimates regarding the\namount and timing of expected future cash flows. It also requires them to select a discount rate that reflects the current return\nrequirements of the market in relation to present risk-free interest rates, required equity market premiums, and company-\nspecific performance and risk metrics, all of which are susceptible to change based on changes in economic and market\nconditions and other factors. Future events or changes in the estimates used to determine the carrying value of goodwill and\nidentifiable intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nFair value measurements—Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a\nliability, in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial\ninstrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices, or observable market inputs. For financial instruments\nthat are traded actively and have quoted market prices, or observable market inputs, there is minimal subjectivity involved in\nmeasuring fair value. However, when quoted market prices or observable market inputs are not fully available, significant\nmanagement judgement may be necessary to estimate fair value. In developing our fair value measurements, we maximize the\nuse of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nFinancial assets that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include investment securities, available-for-sale\nand derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, $495.2 million, or 12.7%, and $723.7 million, or\n19.1%, respectively, of the Company’s total assets consisted of financial assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and\nmost of these financial assets consisted of available-for-sale investment securities. The fair value of financial assets on a\nrecurring basis are classified in either Levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Financial liabilities that are recorded at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis are comprised of derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, $9.2 million\nand $6.3 million of derivative financial instruments, respectively, were classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy,\nrepresenting less than 1% of the Company’s total liabilities in those years.

These non-GAAP financial measures include the\nratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible common equity per share, return on average tangible\ncommon equity, net interest margin (tax-equivalent), the efficiency ratio, and the adjusted efficiency ratio. Management\nuses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of its performance, and believes financial analysts and others\nfrequently use these measures, and other similar measures, to evaluate capital adequacy. Management calculates:\n(i) tangible common equity as total common stockholders’ equity, less goodwill and other intangible assets; (ii) tangible\ncommon equity per share as tangible common equity divided by shares of common stock outstanding; (iii) tangible\nassets as total assets, less goodwill and other intangible assets; (iv) return on average tangible common equity as net\nincome adjusted for intangible amortization net of tax, divided by average tangible common equity; (v) net interest\nmargin (tax-equivalent) as net interest income plus a tax-equivalent adjustment, divided by average earning assets;\n(vi) efficiency ratio as noninterest expense less intangible amortization expense, divided by net interest income plus\nnoninterest income plus a tax-equivalent adjustment; and (vii) adjusted efficiency ratio as noninterest expense less\nintangible amortization expense, divided by net interest income plus noninterest income plus a tax-equivalent adjustment\nless net gains (losses) on investment securities.\nThe following tables present these non-GAAP financial measures along with the most directly comparable\nfinancial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP for the periods indicated.\nDecember 31, December 31, December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nTangible common equity to tangible assets\nTotal common stockholders’ equity $ 369,127 $ 356,872 $ 359,403\nLess: Goodwill 46,783 47,087 31,490\nLess: Other intangible assets 17,158 22,455 20,250\nTangible common equity (a) 305,186 287,330 307,663\nTotal assets 3,907,713 3,779,637 3,392,691\nLess: Goodwill 46,783 47,087 31,490\nLess: Other intangible assets 17,158 22,455 20,250\nTangible assets (b) 3,843,772 3,710,095 3,340,951\nTangible common equity to tangible assets (a)/(b) 7.94 % 7.74 % 9.21 %\nTangible book value per common share\nTotal common stockholders’ equity $ 369,127 $ 356,872 $ 359,403\nLess: Goodwill 46,783 47,087 31,490\nLess: Other intangible assets 17,158 22,455 20,250\nTangible common equity (c) 305,186 287,330 307,663\nTotal common shares issued and outstanding (d) 19,734 19,992 17,213\nTangible book value per common share (c)/(d) $ 15.46 $ 14.37 $ 17.87\n71\nDecember 31, December 31, December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nReturn on average tangible common equity\nNet income $ 11,696 $ 40,005 $ 52,681\nAdd: Intangible amortization expense (net of tax) 4,184 3,756 3,460\nNet income, excluding intangible amortization (e) 15,880 43,761 56,141\nAverage total equity 358,268 346,355 346,059\nLess: Average goodwill 46,959 39,415 30,385\nLess: Average other intangible assets (net of tax) 15,624 17,018 18,548\nAverage tangible common equity (f) 295,685 289,922 297,126\nReturn on average tangible common equity (e)/(f) 5.37 % 15.09 % 18.89 %\nEfficiency ratio\nNoninterest expense $ 150,157 $ 158,770 $ 168,909\nLess: Intangible amortization expense 5,296 4,754 4,380\nAdjusted noninterest expense (g) 144,861 154,016 164,529\nNet interest income 87,839 99,729 87,099\nNoninterest income 80,229 111,223 147,387\nTax-equivalent adjustment 671 429 492\nTotal tax-equivalent revenue (h) 168,739 211,381 234,978\nEfficiency ratio (g)/(h) 85.85 % 72.86 % 70.02 %\nAdjusted efficiency ratio\nNoninterest expense $ 150,157 $ 158,770 $ 168,909\nLess: Intangible amortization expense 5,296 4,754 4,380\nAdjusted noninterest expense (i) 144,861 154,016 164,529\nNet interest income 87,839 99,729 87,099\nNoninterest income 80,229 111,223 147,387\nTax-equivalent adjustment 671 429 492\nLess: Net gains (losses) on investment securities (24,643) — 125\nTotal tax-equivalent revenue (j) 193,382 211,381 234,853\nAdjusted efficiency ratio (i)/(j) 74.91 % 72.86 % 70.06 %\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion describes the consolidated operations and financial condition of the Company and the\nBank.

Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to results for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, can be found in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations of the Company’s 2022 annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 10, 2023.\nSummary\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $11.7 million, a decrease of $28.3 million, or 70.8%,\ncompared to $40.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.58 in\n2023, compared to $2.10 in 2022. Return on average total assets was 0.31% in 2023, compared to 1.14% for 2022. The\ndecrease in net income was primarily driven by a $31.0 million decrease in noninterest income and a $11.9 million\ndecrease in net interest income, partially offset by an $8.6 million decrease in noninterest expense. Noninterest income\ndecreased primarily due to a $24.6 million loss on investment securities as a result of a strategic balance sheet\nrepositioning in the fourth quarter, as well as an $8.5 million decrease in mortgage banking revenue, attributable to a\ndecrease in mortgage originations due to the impact of higher interest rates. The decrease in net interest income was due\nto heightened deposit competition, the impact of rising short-term interest rates on indexed money market deposits, and\nclients moving deposits out of noninterest bearing products into interest-bearing products. The decrease in noninterest\nexpense was primarily due to a $4.4 million decrease in compensation expense, driven by a decrease in mortgage\nincentives associated with the decrease in mortgage originations.\n72\nNet Interest Income—With Nontaxable Income Converted to Fully Taxable Equivalent, or FTE\nNet interest income totaled $87.8 million in 2023, a decrease of $11.9 million, or 11.90%, from 2022. Net\ninterest margin decreased 58 basis points to 2.46% in 2023, from the 3.04% reported in 2022. The decrease in net\ninterest margin was primarily a result of a $61.2 million increase in interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities,\npartially offset by a $49.3 million increase in interest income on interest earning assets. The increase in interest expense\nwas primarily driven by a 220 basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities due to increases\nin short-term interest rates and a highly competitive deposit environment. Additionally, the average balance of interest-\nbearing liabilities increased $411.6 million, driven by increased short-term borrowings to support loan growth, core\ndeposit growth, and deposit migration from noninterest bearing deposit accounts into interest bearing deposit accounts.\nThe increase in the interest income earned on interest bearing assets was driven by a 105 basis point increase in the\naverage rate earned on loans as well as a $475.6 million increase in the average balance of total loans from organic\ngrowth.\nThe following table sets forth information related to the Company’s average balance sheet, average yields on\nassets, and average rates of liabilities for the periods indicated. The Company derived these yields by dividing income or\nexpense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities. The Company derived average balances from\nthe daily balances throughout the periods indicated. Average loan balances include loans that have been placed on\nnonaccrual, while interest previously accrued on these loans is reversed against interest income. In these tables,\nadjustments are made to the yields on tax-exempt assets in order to present tax-exempt income and fully taxable income\non a comparable basis.\n73\nYear end e d Decemb er 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nInterest Average Interest Average Interest Average\nAverage Income/ Yield/ Average Income/ Yield/ Average Income/ Yield/\n(dollars in thousands) Balance Expense Rate Balance Expense Rate Balance Expense Rate\nInterest Earning Assets\nInterest-bearing deposits with banks $ 35,395 $ 1,202 3.40 % $ 58,149 $ 586 1.01 % 222,916 $ 322 0.14 %\nInvestment securities (1) 983,545 25,199 2.56 % 1,135,426 24,333 2.14 % 864,273 14,172 1.64 %\nFed funds sold — — — % 7,313 192 2.63 % — — — %\nLoans held for sale 13,217 721 5.46 % 24,497 855 3.49 % 65,968 1,494 2.26 %\nLoans\nCommercial:\nCommercial and industrial 558,458 36,986 6.62 % 507,040 26,004 5.13 % 579,002 28,445 4.91 %\nReal estate construction 99,315 7,607 7.66 % 63,296 3,300 5.21 % 41,751 1,712 4.10 %\nCommercial real estate 980,667 51,020 5.20 % 713,102 29,632 4.16 % 571,326 21,523 3.77 %\nTotal commercial 1,638,440 95,613 5.84 % 1,283,438 58,936 4.59 % 1,192,079 51,680 4.34 %\nConsumer\nResidential real estate first mortgage 706,626 27,240 3.85 % 587,443 20,573 3.50 % 477,621 16,575 3.47 %\nResidential real estate junior lien 154,036 11,639 7.56 % 136,483 7,222 5.29 % 131,412 6,093 4.64 %\nOther revolving and installment 35,971 2,179 6.06 % 52,071 2,525 4.85 % 57,574 2,537 4.41 %\nTotal consumer 896,633 41,058 4.58 % 775,997 30,320 3.91 % 666,607 25,205 3.78 %\nTotal loans (1) 2,535,073 136,671 5.39 % 2,059,435 89,256 4.33 % 1,858,686 76,885 4.14 %\nFederal Reserve/FHLB Stock 25,246 1,761 6.98 % 13,824 784 5.67 % 6,329 276 4.36 %\nTotal interest earning assets 3,592,476 165,554 4.61 % 3,298,644 116,006 3.52 % 3,018,172 93,149 3.09 %\nCash and due from banks 30,422 31,957 27,399\nAllowance for loan losses (35,883) (32,011) (34,054)\nLand, premises and equipment, net 17,510 17,429 19,081\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 5,624 3,626 4,997\nAccrued interest receivable 13,034 9,377 8,461\nBank-owned life insurance 33,059 33,573 32,760\nGoodwill 46,959 39,415 30,385\nOther intangible assets 19,777 21,542 23,479\nServicing rights 2,349 2,246 1,984\nDeferred income taxes, net 43,443 31,593 11,685\nOther assets 48,247 43,264 34,471\nNoninterest earning assets 224,541 202,011 160,648\nTotal assets $ 3,817,017 $ 3,500,655 $ 3,178,820\nInterest-Bearing Liabilities\nInterest-bearing demand deposits $ 768,238 $ 9,872 1.29 % $ 692,287 $ 1,516 0.22 % $ 697,276 $ 987 0.14 %\nMoney market and savings deposits 1,118,815 32,639 2.92 % 1,113,426 6,090 0.55 % 1,023,677 1,500 0.15 %\nTime deposits 303,746 10,876 3.58 % 221,997 1,563 0.70 % 215,624 1,174 0.54 %\nFed funds purchased 287,768 15,283 5.31 % 63,296 1,554 2.46 % 3 — — %\nShort-term borrowings 113,973 5,693 5.00 % 89,932 2,785 3.10 % — — — %\nLong-term debt 58,900 2,681 4.55 % 58,864 2,340 3.98 % 50,759 1,897 3.74 %\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 2,651,440 77,044 2.91 % 2,239,802 15,848 0.71 % 1,987,339 5,558 0.28 %\nNoninterest-Bearing Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity\nNoninterest-bearing deposits 737,365 851,821 784,998\nOther noninterest-bearing liabilities 69,944 62,677 60,424\nStockholders’ equity 358,268 346,355 346,059\nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 3,817,017 $ 3,500,655 $ 3,178,820\nNet interest income $ 88,510 $ 100,158 $ 87,591\nNet interest rate spread 1.70 % 2.81 % 2.81 %\nNet interest margin on FTE basis (1) 2.46 % 3.04 % 2.90 %\n(1) Fully tax-equivalent adjustment was calculated utilizing a marginal income tax rate of 21.0%.\n74\nInterest Rates and Operating Interest Differential\nIncreases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances\n(volume) of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates.

The increase in provision for credit losses is primarily a result of a change in forecasting\nassumptions brought about by the new methodology as well as strong loan growth and unfunded commitments.\n75\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table presents noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021\nY ear end ed De c ember 31 ,\n(dollars in thousands) %\n2023 2022 $ Change % Change 2022 2021 $ Change Change\nRetirement and benefit services $ 65,294 $ 67,135 $ (1,841) (2.7)% $ 67,135 $ 71,709 $ (4,574) (6.4)%\nWealth management 21,855 20,870 985 4.7 % 20,870 21,052 (182) (0.9)%\nMortgage banking 8,411 16,921 (8,510) (50.3)% 16,921 48,502 (31,581) (65.1)%\nService charges on deposit accounts 1,280 1,434 (154) (10.7)% 1,434 1,395 39 2.8 %\nNet gains (losses) on investment securities (24,643) — (24,643) 100.0 % — 125 (125) (100.0)%\nOther 8,032 4,863 3,169 65.2 % 4,863 4,604 259 5.6 %\nTotal noninterest income $ 80,229 $ 111,223 $ (30,994) (27.9)% $ 111,223 $ 147,387 $ (36,164) (24.5)%\nNoninterest income as a % of revenue 47.7 % 52.7 % 52.7 % 62.9 %\nTotal noninterest income decreased $31.0 million, or 27.9%, to $80.2 million in 2023, from $111.2 million for\n2022. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily driven by the previously announced balance sheet repositioning,\nas a result of which a $24.6 million loss on the sale of investment securities was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nMortgage banking revenue decreased $8.5 million in 2023 primarily as a result of a $448.2 million, or 55.2%, decrease\nin mortgage originations due to the impact of higher interest rates.\nNoninterest income as a percent of total operating revenue, which consists of net interest income plus\nnoninterest income, was 47.7% in 2023, down from 52.7% the prior year. The decrease in 2023 was due to a 27.9%\ndecrease in noninterest income and an 11.9% decrease in net interest income.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table presents noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nY ear en ded D ec ember 31 ,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 $ Change % Change 2022 2021 $ Change % Change\nCompensation $ 76,290 $ 80,656 $ (4,366) (5.4)% $ 80,656 $ 93,386 $ (12,730) (13.6)%\nEmployee taxes and benefits 20,051 21,915 (1,864) (8.5)% 21,915 22,033 (118) (0.5)%\nOccupancy and equipment expense 7,477 7,605 (128) (1.7)% 7,605 8,148 (543) (6.7)%\nBusiness services, software and technology\nexpense 21,053 19,487 1,566 8.0 % 19,487 20,486 (999) (4.9)%\nIntangible amortization expense 5,296 4,754 542 11.4 % 4,754 4,380 374 8.5 %\nProfessional fees and assessments 6,743 8,367 (1,624) (19.4)% 8,367 6,292 2,075 33.0 %\nMarketing and business development 3,027 3,254 (227) (7.0)% 3,254 3,182 72 2.3 %\nSupplies and postage 1,796 2,440 (644) (26.4)% 2,440 2,361 79 3.3 %\nTravel 1,189 1,182 7 0.6 % 1,182 442 740 167.4 %\nMortgage and lending expenses 1,902 2,183 (281) (12.9)% 2,183 4,250 (2,067) (48.6)%\nOther 5,333 6,927 (1,594) (23.0)% 6,927 3,949 2,978 75.4 %\nTotal noninterest expense $ 150,157 $ 158,770 $ (8,613) (5.4)% $ 158,770 $ 168,909 $ (10,139) (6.0)%\nTotal noninterest expense decreased $8.6 million, or 5.4%, to $150.2 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, from $158.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in noninterest expense\nwas primarily driven by a $4.4 million decrease in compensation expense, a $1.9 million decrease in employee taxes and\nbenefits expense, and a $1.6 million decrease in professional fees and assessments expense, partially offset by an\nincrease of $1.6 million in business services, software and technology expense. The decreases in compensation expense\nand employee taxes and benefits expenses were primarily driven by a decrease in mortgage incentives associated with\nthe decrease in mortgage originations, and decreased expenses related to group insurance. Professional fees and\nassessments expenses decreased due to merger related expenses associated with the acquisition of Metro Phoenix Bank\nin 2022, partially offset by an increase in FDIC assessments. Business services, software and technology expense\nincreased primarily due to higher contract renewals due to inflationary pressures and equipment purchases.\n76\nIncome Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized income tax expense of $4.2 million on\n$15.9 million of pre-tax income, resulting in an effective tax rate of 26.2%. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the\nCompany recognized an income tax expense of $12.2 million on $52.2 million of pre-tax income, resulting in an\neffective tax rate of 23.3%. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by items related to the acquisition\nof Metro Phoenix Bank in 2022 and an increase in state taxes driven by increased income earned in Minnesota and\nArizona.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company determined reportable segments based on the significance of the services offered, the\nsignificance of those services to the Company’s financial condition and operating results, and the Company’s regular\nreview of the operating results of those services. The Company has four operating segments—banking, retirement and\nbenefit services, wealth management, and mortgage. These segments are components for which financial information is\nprepared and evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.\nThe selected financial information presented for each segment sets forth net interest income, provision for loan\nlosses, noninterest income, and direct and indirect noninterest expense overhead allocations. Corporate administration\nincludes all remaining income and expenses not allocated to the four operating segments. Certain reclassification\nadjustments have been made between corporate administration and the various lines of business for consistency in\npresentation.\nFor additional financial information on the Company’s segments see Note 22 (Segment Reporting) of the\nCompany’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nBanking\nThe banking segment offers a complete line of loan, deposit, cash management, and treasury services through\n15 offices in North Dakota, Minnesota, and Arizona. These products and services are supported through various digital\napplications. The majority of the Company’s assets and liabilities are on the banking segment balance sheet.\nThe banking segment reported net income before taxes of $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a\ndecrease of $25.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by a $21.6\nmillion decrease in noninterest income and a $10.5 million decrease in net interest income, partially offset by a $8.8\nmillion decrease in noninterest expense. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company sold $171.8 million of\navailable-for-sale (AFS) securities in a balance sheet repositioning. The sale resulted in a one-time pre-tax net loss of\n$24.6 million. Proceeds from the sale were reinvested into loans to new and existing clients throughout the communities\nthe Company serves, in addition to paying down borrowings.\nRetirement and Benefit Services\nRetirement and benefit services provide the following services nationally: recordkeeping and administration\nservices to qualified retirement plans; ESOP recordkeeping and administration; investment fiduciary services to\nretirement plans; HSA, flex spending account, and government health insurance program recordkeeping and\nadministration services to employers. The division services approximately 8,300 retirement plans and more than 474,000\nplan participants. In addition, the division employs approximately 243 professionals, and operates within the Company’s\nbanking markets, as well as East Lansing, Michigan, and Lakewood, Colorado.\nThe retirement and benefit services segment reported net income before taxes of $14.7 million for the year\nended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $4.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Revenue of $65.3\nmillion, comprised of $23.1 million in asset-based revenue and $42.2 million in participant and transaction revenues,\ndecreased $1.8 million, or 2.7%, primarily due to the divestiture of the payroll services line of business.\n77\nThe following table presents changes in the combined AUA and AUM for the Company’s retirement and\nbenefit services segment for the periods presented.\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nAUA & AUM balance beginning of period $ 32,122,520 $ 36,732,938 $ 34,199,954\nAcquired assets — — —\nInflows (1) 4,548,845 5,735,604 5,589,925\nOutflows (2) (4,836,524) (7,512,492) (6,010,136)\nMarket impact (3) 4,847,584 (2,833,530) 2,953,195\nAUA & AUM balance end of period $ 36,682,425 $ 32,122,520 $ 36,732,938\nYield (4) 0.19 % 0.20 % 0.20 %\n(1) Inflows include new account assets, contributions, dividends and interest.\n(2) Outflows include closed account assets, withdrawals and client fees.\n(3) Market impact reflects gains and losses on portfolio investments.\n(4) Retirement and benefit services noninterest income divided by simple average ending balances.\nAUA and AUM for the retirement and benefit services segment was $36.7 billion at December 31, 2023, an\nincrease of $4.6 billion, or 14.2%, compared to the total at December 31, 2022.

In 2021, the Company transferred its portfolio of obligations of state and political agencies from\navailable-for-sale to held-to-maturity to protect capital and reduce volatility in other comprehensive income due to\nmarket value changes.\nAt December 31, 2023, total investment securities were $0.8 billion compared to $1.0 billion at\nDecember 31, 2022. Investment securities as a percentage of total assets were 20.1% and 27.5%, as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The decrease in investment securities was primarily due to a\nstrategic balance sheet repositioning in the fourth quarter, in which the Company sold $171.8 million of available-for-\nsale securities. Proceeds from the sale were reinvested into loans to new and existing clients in addition to paying down\nborrowings. Securities with a carrying value of $250.0 million were pledged at December 31, 2023, to secure public\ndeposits and for other purposes required or permitted by law.\nThe net pre-tax unrealized market value loss on the available-for-sale investment portfolio as of\nDecember 31, 2023 was $98.0 million, as compared to a $132.2 million loss as of December 31, 2022.

While\ncommercial loans are generally secured by the customer's assets including real property, inventory, accounts receivable,\noperating equipment, and other property and may also include personal guarantees of the owners and related parties, the\nprimary source of repayment of the loans is the ongoing cash flow from operations of the customer's business. In\naddition, revolving lines of credit are generally governed by a borrowing base. Inherent lending risks are monitored on a\ncontinuous basis through interim reporting, covenant testing and annual underwriting.\nCRE loans consist of term loans secured by a mortgage lien on the real property and includes both owner\noccupied CRE loans as well as non-owner-occupied loans. Non-owner occupied CRE loans consist of mortgage loans to\nfinance investments in real property that may include, but are not limited to, multi-family, industrial, office, retail and\n82\nother specific use properties as well as CRE construction loans that are offered to builders and developers generally\nwithin our geographical footprint. The primary risk characteristics in the non-owner-occupied portfolio include impacts\nof overall leasing rates, absorption timelines, levels of vacancy rates and operating expenses. The Company requires\ncollateral values in excess of the loan amounts, cash flows in excess of expected debt service requirements and equity\ninvestment in the project. The expected cash flows from all significant new or renewed income producing property\ncommitments are stress tested to reflect the risks in varying interest rates, vacancy rates and rental rates. Inherent lending\nrisks are monitored on a continuous basis through quarterly monitoring and our annual underwriting process,\nincorporating an analysis of cash flow, collateral, market conditions and guarantor liquidity, if applicable. CRE loan\npolicies are specific to individual product types and underwriting parameters vary depending on the risk profile of each\nasset class. CRE loan policies are reviewed no less than semi-annually by management and approved by the Bank’s\nBoard of Directors to ensure they align with current market conditions and the Bank’s moderate risk appetite.\nConstruction loans are monitored monthly and includes on-site inspections. Management reviews all construction loans\nquarterly to ensure projects are on time and within budget. CRE concentration limits have been established by product\ntype and are monitored quarterly by the Bank’s Credit Governance Committee and Bank Board of Directors.\nCRE loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The\nCompany does not monitor the CRE portfolio for attributes such as loan to value ratios, occupancy rates, and net\noperating income as these characteristics are assessed and evaluated on an individual loan basis. Portfolio stress testing\nis completed based on property type and takes into consideration changes to net operating income and capitalization\nrates. The Company does not have exposure to the office building sector in central business districts as the office\nportfolio is generally diversified in suburban markets with strong occupancy levels. As of December 31, 2023, at 202%,\nthe Company’s applicable investor commercial real estate loans, as a percentage of its risk-based capital, remained\nbelow the regulatory guideline limit of 300%. Construction loans at 31% were also below the regulatory guideline limit\nof 100%.\nThe following table presents the geographical markets of the collateral related to the non-owner occupied\ncommercial real estate loans for the periods presented:\nDecemb er 31 , 2023 Decemb er 31 , 2022\nPercent of Percent of\n(dollars in thousands) Balance Total Balance Total\nGeographical Market:\nMinnesota $ 394,754 48.5 % $ 257,844 41.1 %\nNorth Dakota 214,884 26.4 % 187,477 29.9 %\nArizona 139,450 17.1 % 143,483 22.8 %\nMissouri 15,969 2.0 % 15,963 2.5 %\nOregon 14,953 1.8 % — — %\nSouth Dakota 14,790 1.8 % 4,438 0.7 %\nOther 19,661 2.4 % 18,811 3.0 %\nTotal non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans $ 814,461 100.0 % $ 628,016 100.0 %\nThe Bank does not currently monitor owner occupied CRE loans based on geographical markets as the primary\nsource of repayment for these loans is predicated on the cash flow from the underlying operating entity. These loans are\ngenerally located within the Company’s geographical footprint.\nHighly competitive conditions continue to prevail in the small and middle market commercial segments in\nwhich the Company primarily operates. The Company maintains a commitment to generating growth in the Company’s\nbusiness portfolio in a manner that adheres to its twin goals of maintaining strong asset quality and producing profitable\nmargins. The Company continues to invest in additional personnel, technology, and business development resources to\nfurther strengthen its capabilities.\nResidential real estate loans represent loans to consumers for the purchase or refinance of a residence. These\nloans are generally financed over a 15- to 30-year term and, in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their\nprimary residence with both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate terms. Real estate construction loans are also offered to\nconsumers who wish to build their own homes and are often structured to be converted to permanent loans at the end of\n83\nthe construction phase, which is typically twelve months. Residential real estate loans also include home equity loans\nand lines of credit that are secured by a first- or second lien on the borrower’s residence. Home equity lines of credit\nconsist mainly of revolving lines of credit secured by residential real estate.\nConsumer loans include loans made to individuals not secured by real estate, including loans secured by\nautomobiles or watercraft, and personal unsecured loans.\nThe Company originates both fixed and adjustable rate residential real estate loans conforming to the\nunderwriting guidelines of the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation,\nas well as home equity loans and lines of credit that are secured by first or junior liens. Most of the Company’s fixed rate\nresidential loans, along with some of the Company’s adjustable rate mortgages are sold to other financial institutions\nwith which the Company has established a correspondent lending relationship.\nThe Company’s consumer mortgage loans have minimal direct exposure to subprime mortgages as the loans are\nunderwritten to conform to secondary market standards. Volume in this portion of the loan portfolio increased over the\nlast few years due to low long-term interest rates and comparatively stable real estate valuations in the Company’s\nprimary markets. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s consumer mortgage portfolio was $881.0 million, which\nwas a $51.0 million, or 9.4%, increase from $830.0 million as of December 31, 2022. Market interest rates, expected\nduration, and the Company’s overall interest rate sensitivity profile continue to be the most significant factors in\ndetermining whether the Company chooses to retain versus sell portions of new consumer mortgage originations.\n84\nThe following table shows the maturities and sensitivity to interest rates for the loan portfolio as of\nDecember 31, 2023:\nD ec e mber 31, 20 23\nAfter one After five\nOne year but within but within After\n(dollars in thousands) or less five years fifteen years fifteen years Total\nCommercial\nCommercial and industrial $ 127,510 $ 279,282 $ 191,529 $ — $ 598,321\nReal estate construction 9,694 101,803 10,346 2,191 124,034\nCommercial real estate 84,702 563,573 413,383 65,254 1,126,912\nTotal commercial 221,906 944,658 615,258 67,445 1,849,267\nConsumer\nResidential real estate first mortgage 5,267 30,295 45,545 645,772 726,879\nResidential real estate junior lien 7,746 22,153 33,039 91,196 154,134\nOther revolving and installment 7,743 18,787 2,773 — 29,303\nTotal consumer 20,756 71,235 81,357 736,968 910,316\nTotal loans $ 242,662 $ 1,015,893 $ 696,615 $ 804,413 $ 2,759,583\nLoans with fixed interest rates:\nCommercial\nCommercial and industrial $ 17,025 $ 218,174 $ 74,354 $ — $ 309,553\nReal estate construction 954 27,315 8,666 — 36,935\nCommercial real estate 65,203 386,005 276,182 22,547 749,937\nTotal commercial 83,182 631,494 359,202 22,547 1,096,425\nConsumer\nResidential real estate first mortgage 3,360 26,826 37,996 417,414 485,596\nResidential real estate junior lien 1,454 6,650 22,367 14,430 44,901\nOther revolving and installment 1,729 15,249 2,773 — 19,751\nTotal consumer 6,543 48,725 63,136 431,844 550,248\nTotal loans with fixed interest rates $ 89,725 $ 680,219 $ 422,338 $ 454,391 $ 1,646,673\nLoans with floating interest rates:\nCommercial\nCommercial and industrial $ 110,485 $ 61,108 $ 117,175 $ — $ 288,768\nReal estate construction 8,740 74,488 1,680 2,191 87,099\nCommercial real estate 19,499 177,568 137,201 42,707 376,975\nTotal commercial 138,724 313,164 256,056 44,898 752,842\nConsumer\nResidential real estate first mortgage 1,907 3,469 7,549 228,358 241,283\nResidential real estate junior lien 6,292 15,503 10,672 76,766 109,233\nOther revolving and installment 6,014 3,538 — — 9,552\nTotal consumer 14,213 22,510 18,221 305,124 360,068\nTotal loans with floating interest rates $ 152,937 $ 335,674 $ 274,277 $ 350,022 $ 1,112,910\nThe expected life of the Company’s loan portfolio will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers\nmay have the right to curtail or prepay their loans with or without penalties. Consequently, the table above includes\ninformation limited to contractual maturities of the underlying loans.\nAsset Quality\nThe Company’s strategy for credit risk management includes well-defined, centralized credit policies; uniform\nunderwriting criteria; and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all commercial and consumer credit\nexposures. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry, and client level; regular credit\nexaminations; and management reviews of loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality. The Company strives to\nidentify potential problem loans early, take necessary charge-offs promptly, and maintain adequate reserve levels for\ncredit losses inherent in the portfolio. Management performs ongoing, internal reviews of any problem credits and\ncontinually assesses the adequacy of the allowance. The Company utilized an internal lending division, Special Credit\nServices, to develop and implement strategies for the management of individual nonperforming loans.\n85\nCredit Quality Indicators\nLoans are assigned a risk rating and grouped into categories based on relevant information about the ability of\nborrowers to service their debt, such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit\ndocumentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The risk ratings are aligned to\npass and criticized categories. The criticized categories include special mention, substandard, and doubtful risk ratings.\nSee Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K for a definition of each of the risk ratings.\nThe table below represents criticized loans outstanding by loan portfolio segment as of December 31, 2023,\n2022, and 2021:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nCommercial\nCommercial and industrial $ 29,840 $ 25,182\nReal estate construction 20,667 262\nCommercial real estate 9,170 8,400\nTotal commercial 59,677 33,844\nConsumer\nResidential real estate first mortgage 105 808\nResidential real estate junior lien 1,781 632\nOther revolving and installment — 1\nTotal consumer 1,886 1,441\nTotal loans $ 61,563 $ 35,285\nCriticized loans as a percent of total loans 2.23 % 1.44 %\nCriticized loans represented 2.23% and 1.44% of total loans as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe increase in criticized loans was primarily due to one $20.6 million multi-family construction loan that became\ncriticized in the third quarter of 2023.\nThe following table presents information regarding nonperforming assets as of the dates presented:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nNonaccrual loans $ 8,596 $ 3,794\nAccruing loans 90+ days past due 139 —\nTotal nonperforming loans 8,735 3,794\nOREO and repossessed assets 32 30\nTotal nonperforming assets 8,767 3,824\nTotal restructured accruing loans — 151\nTotal nonperforming assets and restructured accruing loans $ 8,767 $ 3,975\nNonperforming loans to total loans 0.32 % 0.16 %\nNonperforming assets to total assets 0.22 % 0.10 %\nAllowance for credit losses on loans to nonperforming loans 410 % 821 %\nThe allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans ratio decreased 411 basis points from December 31,\n2022. The decrease was primarily the result of a modest increase in nonperforming loans for the year ended December\n31, 2023. The increase in nonperforming loans was primarily due to one $6.1 million loan being added to nonperforming\nloans for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nInterest income lost on nonaccrual loans approximated $467 thousand, $155 thousand, and $183 thousand for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There was no interest income included in net income\nrelated to nonaccrual loans for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n86\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses, or ACL, on loans is maintained at a level management believes is sufficient to\nabsorb expected losses in the loan portfolio over the remaining estimated life of loans in the portfolio. Under CECL\naccounting standard the ACL is a valuation estimated at each balance sheet date and deducted from the amortized cost\nbasis of loans held for investment to present the net amount expected to be collected. These evaluations are inherently\nsubjective as they require management to make material estimates, all of which may be susceptible to significant change.\nThe allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by actual charge-offs, net of recoveries.\nManagement estimates the ACL using relevant information, from internal and external sources, relating to past\nevents, current conditions, and reasonable supportable forecasts. Historical loss experience provides the basis for\nestimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in the current\nloan-specific risk characteristics such as different underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or life of the\nloan, as well as changes in environmental conditions, levels of economic activity, unemployment rates, property values\nand other relevant factors. The calculation also contemplates that the Company may not be able to make or obtain such\nforecasts for the entire life of the financial assets and requires a reversion to historical loss information.\nLoans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually\nare not also included in the collective evaluation. The ACL on individually evaluated loans is recognized on the basis of\nthe present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate, the fair value of collateral\nadjusted of estimated costs to sell, or observable market price as of the relevant date.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into commitments to extend credit, including\ncommitments under credit arrangements, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. Such financial\ninstruments are recorded when they are funded. A reserve for unfunded commitments is established using historical loss\ndata and utilization assumptions. This reserve is located under accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. The expense for provision for unfunded commitments was $2.2 million, $1.1 million, and $0.2 million\nfor the years ended years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n87\nThe following table presents, by loan type, the changes in the allowance for credit losses, after the opening\nadjustment related to the adoption of CECL in 2023, for the periods presented:\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nBalance—beginning of period (1) $ 35,003 $ 31,572 $ 34,246\nCommercial loan charge-offs\nCommercial and Industrial (436) (1,396) (1,230)\nReal estate construction — — —\nCommercial real estate — — (536)\nTotal commercial loan charge-offs (436) (1,396) (1,766)\nConsumer loan charge-offs\nResidential real estate first mortgage (49) — —\nResidential real estate junior lien (77) — —\nOther revolving and installment (51) (153) (156)\nTotal consumer loan charge-offs (177) (153) (156)\nTotal loan charge-offs (613) (1,549) (1,922)\nCommercial loan recoveries\nCommercial and Industrial 1,159 461 1,660\nReal estate construction — 76 —\nCommercial real estate 45 134 822\nTotal commercial recoveries 1,204 671 2,482\nConsumer loan recoveries\nResidential real estate first mortgage 330 — —\nResidential real estate junior lien 52 282 123\nOther revolving and installment 92 170 143\nTotal consumer loan recoveries 474 452 266\nTotal loan recoveries 1,678 1,123 2,748\nNet loan charge-offs (recoveries) (1,065) 426 (826)\nCommercial loan provision\nCommercial and Industrial 645 950 (1,759)\nReal estate construction 2,125 551 120\nCommercial real estate (778) (151) (2,082)\nTotal commercial loan provision 1,992 1,350 (3,721)\nConsumer loan provision\nResidential real estate first mortgage (1,829) (1,017) 700\nResidential real estate junior lien (115) (344) (215)\nOther revolving and installment (273) 11 (264)\nTotal consumer loan provision (2,217) (1,350) 221\nUnallocated provision expense — — —\nTotal provision for credit losses on loans (225) — (3,500)\nBalance—end of period $ 35,843 $ 31,146 $ 31,572\nTotal loans $ 2,759,583 $ 2,443,994 $ 1,758,020\nAverage total loans 2,535,073 2,059,435 1,858,686\nAllowance for credit losses on loans to total loans 1.30 % 1.27 % 1.80 %\nNet charge-offs/(recoveries) to average total loans (annualized) (0.04)% 0.02 % (0.04)%\n(1) Includes a $3.9 million opening adjustment to the beginning balance as of December 31, 2023.\nThe ACL on loans was $35.8 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $31.1 million at December 31, 2022.\nThe $4.7 million increase in the allowance for credit losses was primarily due to the adoption of CECL, which resulted\nin an additional allowance of $3.9 million in the ACL on loans.

Interest-bearing deposits increased $313.0 million while noninterest-bearing deposits decreased\n$132.9 million. The increase in interest-bearing deposits consisted primarily of increases of $134.4 million in interest-\nbearing demand deposits and $199.2 million in time deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased primarily due to\nheightened deposit competition, the impact of rising short-term interest rates on indexed money market deposits, and\nclients moving deposits out of noninterest bearing products into interest-bearing products.\nInterest-bearing deposit costs were 2.44% and 0.45% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The increase in interest-bearing deposit costs were the result of a rising interest rate environment and a\nhighly competitive deposit environment.\nThe Company competes for local deposits by offering products with competitive rates and rely on the deposit\nportfolio to fund loans and other asset growth. Management understands the importance of core deposits as a stable\nsource of funding and may periodically implement various deposit promotion strategies to encourage core deposit\ngrowth. For periods of rising interest rates, management has modeled the aggregate yields for non-maturity deposits and\ntime deposits to increase at a slower pace than the increase in underlying market rates. The mix of average deposits has\nbeen changing throughout the last several years. The weightings of core funds (noninterest checking, interest checking,\nsavings, and money market accounts) and time deposits’ have increased. The Company is focused on expanding core\naccount relationships and customers’ preference for unrestricted accounts in the low interest rate environment. The\nweighting of time deposits increased as clients are looking for higher yielding alternative investments with increased\nshort-term rates.\nThe following table presents the average balances and rates of the Company’s deposit portfolio by category for\nthe periods indicated.\nYear en ded Year en ded Year en ded\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nAverage Average Average Average Average Average\n(dollars in thousands) Balance Rate Balance Rate Balance Rate\nNoninterest-bearing demand $ 737,365 — % $ 851,821 — % $ 784,998 — %\nInterest-bearing demand 768,238 1.29 % 692,287 0.22 % 697,276 0.14 %\nMoney market and savings 1,118,815 2.92 % 1,113,426 0.55 % 1,023,677 0.15 %\nTime deposits 303,746 3.58 % 221,997 0.70 % 215,624 0.54 %\nTotal deposits $ 2,928,164 1.82 % $ 2,879,531 0.32 % $ 2,721,575 0.13 %\nThe following table presents the contractual maturity of time deposits, including certificate of deposits and IRA\ndeposits of $250 thousand and over, that were outstanding as of the date presented.\nD ecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023\nMaturing in:\n3 months or less $ 48,049\n3 months to 6 months 48,010\n6 months to 1 year 22,846\n1 year or greater 2,925\nTotal $ 121,830\n90\nThe Company’s total uninsured deposits, which are amounts of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC\ninsurance limit, currently $250,000, were approximately $1.1 billion and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. These amounts were estimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory\nreporting purposes.\nBorrowings and Subordinated Debt\nThe Company utilizes both short term and long term borrowings as part of its asset/liability management and\nfunding strategies. Short term borrowings consist of FHLB advances and federal funds purchased. The Company had\n$314.2 million and $378.1 million in short term borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFHLB advances were secured by specific investment securities and real estate loans with a carrying amount of\napproximately $1.0 billion and $909.8 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLong-term debt is utilized to fund longer term assets and as a source of regulatory capital. At\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company had $50.0 million of one outstanding 3.50% Fixed Rate Subordinated Note due 2031,\nor the Subordinated Note. The Subordinated Note currently bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.50% per year, payable\nannually through March 31, 2026. At the fifth anniversary of the issuance date of the Subordinated Note, on March 30,\n2026, the interest rate will reset to a fixed interest rate equal to the FHLB rate, plus 2.0%, with a minimum annual fixed\nrate of not less than 3.5%. The Subordinated Note matures on March 30, 2031, and the Company has the option to\nredeem or prepay any or all of the Subordinated Note without premium or penalty any time after March 31, 2026, or at\nany time in the event of certain changes that affect the deductibility of interest for tax purposes or the treatment of the\nnotes as Tier 2 Capital.\nJunior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts that issued trust preferred securities were $9.0 million as\nof December 31, 2023, compared to $8.8 million as of December 31, 2022. The increase was due to purchase accounting\namortization on the junior subordinated notes assumed in the Beacon Bank acquisition in 2016. See Note 14 (Long-Term\nDebt) of the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nSelected financial information pertaining to the components of the Company’s borrowings and subordinated\ndebt as of the dates indicated is as follows:\nDecemb er 31, 2023 Decemb er 31, 2022 Decemb er 31, 2021\nPercent of Percent of Percent of\n(dollars in thousands) Balance Portfolio Balance Portfolio Balance Portfolio\nFed funds purchased $ 114,170 30.6 % $ 153,080 35.0 % $ — — %\nFHLB Short-term advances 200,000 53.6 % 225,000 51.6 % — — %\nSubordinated notes 50,000 13.4 % 50,000 11.4 % 50,000 84.9 %\nJunior subordinated debentures 8,956 2.4 % 8,843 2.0 % 8,730 14.8 %\nFinance lease liability — — % — — 203 0.3 %\nTotal borrowed funds $ 373,126 100.0 % $ 436,923 100.0 % $ 58,933 100.0 %\n91\nCapital Resources\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the Company’s stockholders’ equity for the periods indicated.\nFor the y ea rs ended Dec em b er 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nBeginning balance $ 356,872 $ 359,403 $ 330,163\nCumulative effect of change in accounting principles, net of tax (4,452) — —\nNet income 11,696 40,005 52,681\nOther comprehensive income (loss) 24,986 (94,386) (14,893)\nCommon stock repurchased (6,638) (738) (712)\nCommon stock issued — 63,830 —\nCommon stock dividends (14,965) (13,146) (10,931)\nStock‑based compensation expense 1,628 1,904 3,095\nEnding balance $ 369,127 $ 356,872 $ 359,403\nTotal stockholders’ equity was $369.1 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of $12.3 million, or 3.4%,\ncompared to $356.9 million at December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to a $119.4 million increase in other\ncomprehensive income (loss). The increase in other comprehensive income (loss) was due in part to the sale of AFS\nsecurities as part of the previously reported balance sheet repositioning in the fourth quarter, as well as improved market\nconditions, which resulted in a higher fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale investment securities. This increase\nwas partially offset by a $28.3 million decrease in net income and a $4.5 million decrease to opening stockholders’\nequity related to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard.\nThe Company strives to maintain an adequate capital base to support its activities in a safe and sound manner\nwhile at the same time attempting to maximize stockholder value. Capital adequacy is assessed against the risk inherent\nin the Company’s balance sheet, recognizing that unexpected loss is the common denominator of risk and that common\nequity has the greatest capacity to absorb unexpected loss.\nThe Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements both at the Company and at the Bank level.\nFailure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary\nactions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on the Company’s financial statements.\nUnder capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, specific capital guidelines\nmust be met that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated\nunder regulatory accounting policies. The Company has consistently maintained regulatory capital ratios at or above the\nwell capitalized standards.\nAt December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company met all capital adequacy requirements to which the\nCompany was subject.\n92\nThe table below sets forth the capital ratios for the Company and the Bank as of the dates indicated.

See “Non-GAAP to GAAP Reconciliations and Calculation of Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures.”\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, the Company enters into various transactions to meet the financing needs of\nclients, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in the consolidated balance sheets. These transactions include\ncommitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit, which involve, to varying\ndegrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance\nsheets. Most of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon. All off-balance sheet commitments\nare included in the determination of the amount of risk-based capital that the Company and the Bank are required to\nhold.\nThe Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial\ninstrument for commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit is represented by\nthe contractual or notional amount of those instruments. The Company decreased its exposure to losses under these\ncommitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. The Company assesses the credit risk\nassociated with certain commitments to extend credit and establishes a liability for probable credit losses.\nFurther information related to financial instruments can be found in Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies)\nof the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity management is the process by which the Company manages the flow of funds necessary to meet its\nfinancial commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost and to take advantage of earnings enhancement\nopportunities. These financial commitments include withdrawals by depositors, credit commitments to borrowers,\nexpenses of the Company’s operations, and capital expenditures. Liquidity is monitored and closely managed by the\nCompany’s asset and liability committee, or ALCO, a group of senior officers from the finance, enterprise risk\nmanagement, deposit, investment, treasury, and lending areas. It is ALCO’s responsibility to ensure the Company has\nthe necessary level of funds available for normal operations as well as maintain a contingency funding policy to ensure\nthat potential liquidity stress events are planned for, quickly identified, and management has plans in place to respond.\nALCO has created policies which establish limits and require measurements to monitor liquidity trends, including\nmodeling and management reporting that identifies the amounts and costs of all available funding sources.\n93\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had on balance sheet liquidity of $668.2 million, compared to\n$778.9 million at December 31, 2022 and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2021. On balance sheet liquidity includes cash\nand cash equivalents, federal funds sold, unencumbered securities available-for-sale and over collateralized securities\npledging positions available-for-sale.\nThe Bank is a member of the FHLB, which provides short and long term funding to its members through\nadvances collateralized by real estate related assets and other select collateral, most typically in the form of debt\nsecurities. The actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $1.0 billion of collateral pledged to the FHLB. Based on this collateral the\nCompany is eligible to borrow up to $1.0 billion and had $706.6 million available capacity as of December 31, 2023. In\naddition, the Company can borrow up to $107.0 million through unsecured lines of credit the Company has established\nwith four other banks.\nIn addition, because the Bank is “well capitalized,” it can accept brokered deposits up to 20.0% of total assets\nbased on current policy limits. Management believed that the Company had adequate resources to fund all of its\ncommitments as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nThe Company’s primary sources of liquidity include liquid assets, as well as unencumbered securities that can\nbe used to collateralize additional funding. At December 31, 2023, the Company had $129.9 million of cash and cash\nequivalents of which $91.2 million were interest-bearing deposits held at the Federal Reserve, FHLB and other\ncorrespondent banks.\nThough remote, the possibility of a funding crisis exists at all financial institutions. Accordingly, management\nhas addressed this issue by formulating a liquidity contingency plan, which has been reviewed and approved by both the\nBank’s Board of Directors and the ALCO. The plan addresses the actions that the Company would take in response to\nboth a short-term and long-term funding crisis.\nA short term funding crisis would most likely result from a shock to the financial system, either internal or\nexternal, which disrupts orderly short term funding operations. Such a crisis would likely be temporary in nature and\nwould not involve a change in credit ratings. A long term funding crisis would most likely be the result of both external\nand internal factors and would most likely result in drastic credit deterioration. Management believes that both potential\ncircumstances have been fully addressed through detailed action plans and the establishment of trigger points for\nmonitoring such events.\nRecent Developments\nStockholder Dividend\nOn February 27, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per\ncommon share. This dividend is payable on April 12, 2024, to stockholders of record on March 15, 2024.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to\nchanges in interest rates. Interest-rate risk is the risk to earnings and equity value arising from changes in market interest\nrates and arises in the normal course of business to the extent that there is a divergence between the amount of\ninterest-earning assets and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities that are prepaid/withdrawn, re-price, or mature in\nspecified periods. The Company seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and equity while managing\nvolatility arising from shifts in market interest rates. The Company’s Asset and Liability Committee, or ALCO, oversees\nmarket risk management, monitoring risk measures, limits, and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest\nrate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital. The Bank’s Board of Directors approves policy limits with\nrespect to interest rate risk.\n94\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows\ncomplemented by investment and funding activities. The objectives of interest rate risk management are to control\nexposure of net interest income changes associated with interest rate movements and to achieve sustainable growth in net\ninterest income. Effective interest rate risk management begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets\nand liabilities and determining the appropriate interest rate risk position given business activities, management\nobjectives, market expectations and ALCO policy limits and guidelines.\nInterest rate risk can come in a variety of forms, including repricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and option\nrisk. Repricing risk is the risk of adverse consequences from a change in interest rates that arises because of differences\nin the timing of when those interest rate changes impact the Company’s assets and liabilities. Basis risk is the risk of\nadverse consequence resulting from unequal change in the spread between two or more rates for different instruments\nwith the same maturity. Yield curve risk is the risk of adverse consequence resulting from unequal changes in the spread\nbetween two or more rates for different maturities for the same or different instruments. Option risk in financial\ninstruments arises from embedded options such as options provided to borrowers to make unscheduled loan\nprepayments, options provided to debt issuers to exercise call options prior to maturity, and depositor options to make\nwithdrawals and early redemptions.\nManagement regularly reviews the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates. Among the factors\nconsidered are changes in the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, interest rate spreads and\nrepricing periods. ALCO reviews, on at least a quarterly basis, the interest rate risk position.\nThe interest rate risk position is measured and monitored at the Bank using net interest income simulation\nmodels and economic value of equity sensitivity analysis that capture both short term and long term interest rate risk\nexposure.\nModeling the sensitivity of net interest income and the economic value of equity to changes in market interest\nrates is highly dependent on numerous assumptions incorporated into the modeling process. The models used for these\nmeasurements rely on estimates of the potential impact that changes in interest rates may have on the value and\nprepayment speeds on all components of the Company’s loan portfolio, investment portfolio, as well as embedded\noptions and cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Balance sheet growth assumptions are also included in the\nsimulation modeling process. The analysis provides a framework as to what the Company’s overall sensitivity position is\nas of the Company’s most recent reported position and the impact that potential changes in interest rates may have on net\ninterest income and the economic value of the Company’s equity.\nNet interest income simulation involves forecasting net interest income under a variety of interest rate scenarios\nincluding instantaneous shocks.\nThe estimated impact on the Company’s net interest income in hypothetical rising and declining rate scenarios\nassuming immediate, parallel moves in interest rates, calculated as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, are\npresented in the table below.\nDece mbe r 31, 2023 Decem be r 3 1, 2022\nFollowing Following Following Following\n12 months 24 months 12 months 24 months\n+400 basis points 1.0 % 2.4 % −25.1 % −8.2 %\n+300 basis points 0.5 % 1.4 % −18.9 % −6.4 %\n+200 basis points 0.3 % 0.9 % −12.7 % −4.4 %\n+100 basis points 0.4 % 0.9 % −6.2 % −1.8 %\n−100 basis points −1.0 % −1.7 % 5.2 % 0.5 %\n−200 basis points −2.3 % −4.1 % 7.9 % −1.7 %\nThe above interest rate simulation suggests that the Company’s balance sheet is slightly asset sensitive, in the\nshort-term, as of December 31, 2023, demonstrating that an increase in interest rates would have a marginal positive\n95\nimpact on net interest income over the next 12 and 24 months. The balance sheet has shifted from being liability\nsensitive as of December 31, 2022. This change is attributable to both the derivatives strategies put in place throughout\n2023 that will begin to mature in 2024 as well as deposit growth and the balance sheet repositioning that consisted of\nselling fixed rate securities and redeploying the funds into both fixed and floating-rate loans.\nManagement strategies may impact future reporting periods, as actual results may differ from simulated results\ndue to the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, the difference between actual experience, and the\ncharacteristics assumed, as well as changes in market conditions. Market based prepayment speeds are factored into the\nanalysis for loan and securities portfolios. Rate sensitivity for transactional deposit accounts is modeled based on both\nhistorical experience and external industry studies.\nManagement uses economic value of equity sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of interest rate\nchanges on long term cash flows, income, and capital. Economic value of equity is based on discounting the cash flows\nfor all balance sheet instruments under different interest rate scenarios. Deposit premiums are based on external industry\nstudies and utilizing historical experience.\nThe table below presents the change in the economic value of equity as of December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, assuming immediate parallel shifts in interest rates.\nDecember 3 1, December 31 ,\n2023 2022\n+400 basis points −15.5 % −19.5 %\n+300 basis points −12.6 % −15.3 %\n+200 basis points −7.7 % −10.4 %\n+100 basis points −3.1 % −4.9 %\n−100 basis points 1.6 % 4.0 %\n−200 basis points 2.0 % 5.0 %\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk is the risk of loss due to human behavior, inadequate or failed internal systems and controls,\nand external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, and security risks. Management\ncontinuously strives to strengthen its system of internal controls, enterprise risk management, operating processes and\nemployee awareness to assess the impact on earnings and capital and to improve the oversight of the Company’s\noperational risk.\nCompliance Risk\nCompliance risk represents the risk of regulatory sanctions, reputational impact or financial loss resulting from\nfailure to comply with rules and regulations issued by the various banking agencies and standards of good banking\npractice. Activities which may expose the Company to compliance risk include, but are not limited to, those dealing with\nthe prevention of money laundering, privacy and data protection, community reinvestment initiatives, fair lending\nchallenges resulting from the expansion of the Company’s banking center network, employment and tax matters.\nStrategic and/or Reputation Risk\nStrategic and/or reputation risk represents the risk of loss due to impairment of reputation, failure to fully\ndevelop and execute business plans, failure to assess current and new opportunities in business, markets and products,\nand any other event not identified in the defined risk types mentioned previously. Mitigation of the various risk elements\nthat represent strategic and/or reputation risk is achieved through initiatives to help management better understand and\nreport on various risks, including those related to the development of new products and business initiatives.\n96\nITEM 8.

financial holding company organized under the laws of Delaware. Alerus\nFinancial Corporation and its subsidiaries, or the Company, is a diversified financial services company headquartered in\nGrand Forks, North Dakota. Through its subsidiary, Alerus Financial, National Association, or the Bank, the Company\nprovides innovative and comprehensive financial solutions to businesses and consumers through four distinct business\nlines – banking, retirement and benefit services, wealth management, and mortgage.\nThe Bank operates under a national charter and provides full banking services. As a national bank, the Bank is\nsubject to regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries in which the\nCompany has a controlling interest. Significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in\nconsolidation.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company may enter into a transaction with a variable interest entity, or\nVIE. VIEs are legal entities whose investors lack the ability to make decisions about the entity’s activities, or whose\nequity investors do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The applicable accounting guidance\nrequires the Company to perform ongoing quantitative and qualitative analysis to determine whether it must consolidate\nany VIE. The Company does not have any ownership interest in or exert any control over any VIE, and thus no VIEs are\nincluded in the consolidated financial statements.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts, without impact to net income or total\nstockholders’ equity, to conform to the current year’s presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from an acquisition\nand disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported\namounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term include the valuation\nof investment securities, determination of the allowance for credit losses, valuation of reporting units for the purpose of\ntesting goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, valuation of deferred tax assets, and fair values of financial\ninstruments.\nEmerging Growth Company\nThe Company qualifies as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of\n2012, or the JOBS Act, and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are\napplicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required\nto comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in periodic reports and proxy statements,\nand exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and\nstockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, even if the Company\ncomplies with the greater obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth companies, the Company may\n105\navail itself of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future, so long\nas the Company is an emerging growth company. The Company will continue to be an emerging growth company until\nthe earliest to occur of: (1) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of\ncommon equity securities under the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1, which was declared effective by\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on September 12, 2019; (2) the last day of the fiscal year in\nwhich the Company has $1.235 billion or more in annual revenues; (3) the date on which the Company is deemed to be a\n“large accelerated filer” under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act; or (4) the date on\nwhich the Company has, during the previous three-year period, issued publicly or privately, more than $1.0 billion in\nnon-convertible debt securities. Management cannot predict if investors will find the Company’s common stock less\nattractive because it will rely on the exemptions available to emerging growth companies. If some investors find the\nCompany’s common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for its common stock and\nthe Company’s stock price may be more volatile. The last year the Company qualifies as an emerging growth company\nis 2024.\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended\ntransition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933 for complying with new or revised\naccounting standards. As an emerging growth company, the Company can delay the adoption of certain accounting\nstandards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company elected to take advantage of\nthe benefits of this extended transition period.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nSubstantially all of the Company’s lending activities are with clients located within North Dakota, Minnesota,\nand Arizona. At December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively, 21.7% and 23.9% of the Company’s loan portfolio consisted\nof commercial and industrial loans that were not secured by real estate. The Company does not have any significant loan\nconcentrations in any one industry or with any one client. Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for credit losses) discusses the\nCompany’s loan portfolio.\nThe Company invests in a variety of investment securities and does not have any significant concentrations in\nany one industry or to any one issuer. Note 5 (Investment Securities) discusses the Company’s investment securities\nportfolio.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nFor purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash and due from banks includes cash and cash\nequivalents, balances due from banks, and federal funds sold, all of which have an original maturity within 90 days.\nCash flows from loans, FHLB stock, deposits, and short-term borrowings are reported net.\nInterest-bearing deposits in banks are carried at cost.\nInvestment Securities\nDebt securities are classified as available for sale, or AFS, and are carried at estimated fair value with\nunrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains (losses) on AFS debt\nsecurities are included in net gains (losses) on investment securities in other comprehensive income. Gains (losses) on\nsales of investment securities are determined using the specific identification method on the trade date. The amortization\nof premiums and accretion of discounts are recognized in interest income using methods approximating the interest\nmethod over the period to maturity.\nFor AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company evaluates the securities to determine\nwhether the decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis, or impairment, is due to credit-related factors or\nnoncredit-related factors. Any impairment that is not credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss),\nnet of applicable taxes. Credit-related impairment is recognized as an allowance for credit losses, or ACL, related to AFS\ndebt securities on the balance sheet, limited to the amount by which the amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value, with\n106\na corresponding adjustment to earnings as an expense (credit) within the provision for credit losses on the consolidated\nstatements of income. Both the ACL and the adjustment to net income may be reversed if conditions change. However,\nif the Company intends to sell an impaired available-for-sale investment security or is required to sell such a security\nbefore recovering its amortized cost basis, the entire impairment amount must be recognized in earnings with a\ncorresponding adjustment to the security’s amortized cost basis. Because the security’s amortized cost basis is adjusted\nto fair value, there is no ACL in this situation. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.\nIn evaluating AFS debt securities in unrealized loss positions for impairment and the criteria regarding its intent or\nrequirement to sell such securities, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost,\nwhether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies\nhave occurred, and the results of reviews of the issuers’ financial condition, macroeconomic trends of the industry\nspecific to the security, and any other adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was no ACL carried on the Company’s AFS debt securities nor were\nthere any permanent write-offs for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Refer to Note 5 (Investment\nSecurities) for further discussion.\nCertain debt securities that the Company has an intent to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity, or\nHTM, and recorded at amortized cost. Interest earned on HTM debt securities is included in interest income.\nAmortization or accretion of premiums and discounts is also recognized in interest income using the effective interest\nmethod over the contractual life of the security and is adjusted to reflect actual prepayments. Transfers of debt securities\nfrom AFS to HTM are made at fair value at the date of transfer. Unrealized holding gains and losses at the date of\ntransfer are included in other comprehensive income and in the carrying value of HTM security and are amortized over\nthe remaining life of the security.\nManagement measures expected credit losses on HTM debt securities on a collective basis by major security\ntype. The Company evaluates HTM debt securities by credit rating and an external study, updated quarterly, that\nincludes historical information such as probability of default and loss going back several years. Accrued interest\nreceivable on HTM debt securities is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.\nA change in the ACL related to HTM debt securities is recorded as an expense (credit) within the provision for\ncredit losses on the consolidated statements of income.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was $213 thousand of ACL carried on the Company’s HTM debt securities. As\nof December 31, 2022, there was no allowance carried on the Company’s HTM debt securities. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, there were no permanent write-offs. Refer to Note 5 (Investment Securities) for\nfurther discussion.\nNonmarketable Equity Securities\nNonmarketable equity securities include the Bank’s required investments in the stock of the Federal Home\nLoan Bank of Des Moines, or the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank, or the FRB. The Bank is a member of the FHLB\nas well as its regional FRB. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based of the level of borrowing and\nother factors, and may invest in additional amounts. FHLB stock and FRB stock are carried at cost, classified as other\nassets, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends\nare reported as income.\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair\nvalue in the aggregate. Net unrealized losses are recognized through a valuation allowance by charges to income. Gains\n(losses) on loan sales are recorded in mortgage banking revenue on the consolidated statements of income.\n107\nLoans\nLoans are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, reduced by an allowance for credit losses. Loans that\nmanagement has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future, until maturity or pay-off, generally are reported\nat their outstanding unpaid principal balances adjusted for charge-offs, and the allowance for credit losses. Loan fees\nreceived that are associated with originating or acquiring certain loans are deferred, net of costs, and amortized over the\nlife of the loan as a yield adjustment to interest income.\nThe accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is\nwell-secured and in process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged-off no later than 120 days past due. Past\ndue status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off at an\nearlier date if collection of principal or interest in considered doubtful.\nAll interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off is reversed against\ninterest income. The interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method until qualifying\nfor return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due\nare brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nACL on Loans\nUpon adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), as amended, effective January 1, 2023, the Company began using a\nmodified-prospective approach. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a cumulative-effective adjustment of $4.5\nmillion reducing retained earnings, with a corresponding adjustment of $172 thousand increasing the ACL on HTM debt\nsecurities, $3.9 million increasing the ACL on loans, and $1.9 million increasing other liabilities for the ACL on off-\nbalance sheet credit exposures.\nUnder the current expected credit loss, or CECL, accounting standard the ACL is a valuation estimated at each\nbalance sheet date and deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans held for investment to present the net amount\nexpected to be collected.\nThe Company estimates the ACL based on the underlying assets’ amortized cost basis, which is the amount at\nwhich the financing receivable is originated or acquired, adjusted for collection of cash and charge-offs, as well as\napplicable accretion or amortization of premium, discount and net deferred fees or costs. In the event that collection of\nprincipal becomes uncertain, the Company has policies in place to reverse accrued interest in a timely manner.\nTherefore, the Company has made the policy election to exclude accrued interest from the measurement of ACL.\nThe ACL on loans is increased by charges to provision for credit losses and reduced by charge-offs, net of\nrecoveries. Management evaluates the appropriateness of the ACL on loans quarterly. This evaluation is inherently\nsubjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change from period to period. The ACL\non loans is presented on the consolidated statements of condition.\nLoans past due 30 days or more are considered delinquent. In general, secured loans that are delinquent for 90\nconsecutive days are placed on non-accrual status and may be subject to individual loss assessment in accordance with\nestablished internal policy. In general, unsecured loans that are delinquent for 90 consecutive days have a provision\ntaken for the full amount of the loan.\nIn cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulty, the Company may make certain concessions for\nwhich the terms of the loan are modified. Loans experiencing financial difficulty can include modifications for an\ninterest rate reduction below current market rates, a forgiveness of principal balance, an extension of the loan term, an-\nother than significant payment delay, or some combination of similar types of modifications. During the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not provide any modifications to loans under these circumstances that\nwere experiencing financial difficulty.\n108\nThe ACL on loans reduces the loan portfolio to the net amount expected to be collected, and represents the\nexpected losses over the life of all loans at the reporting date. The allowance incorporates forward-looking information\nand applies a reversion methodology beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast.\nThe ACL on loans represents the Company's estimated risk of loss within its loan portfolio as of the reporting\ndate. To appropriately measure expected credit losses, management disaggregates the loan portfolio into pools of similar\nrisk characteristics (i.e. “segments”). The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow approach to calculate the expected\nloss for each segment. Within the discounted cash flow model, a PD and LGD assumption is applied to calculate the\nexpected loss for each segment. PD is the probability the asset will default within a given timeframe and LGD is the\npercentage of assets not expected to be collected due to default. The Company's PD and LGD assumptions is derived\nusing a combination of external data and internal historical default and loss experience.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the primary macroeconomic drivers used within the discounted cash flow model included\nforecasts of National Unemployment, changes in National GDP, and changes in the National Housing Price Index. These\nmacroeconomic drivers may change from time to time as a result of management’s assessment of continued suitability of\neach factor.\nTo determine its reasonable and supportable forecast, management may leverage macroeconomic forecasts\nobtained from various reputable sources, which may include, but is not limited to, the Federal Open Market Committee\nforecast and other publicly available forecasts from well recognized, leading economists or firms. External baseline\nforecasts are supplemented an assessment of the likelihood of standard alternative scenarios occurring over the forecast\nperiod. The Company’s reasonable and supportable forecast period generally ranges from one to two years, depending\non the facts and circumstances of the current state of the economy, portfolio segment and management’s judgement of\nwhat can be reasonably supported. The model reversion period generally ranges from one to two years, and it also\ndepends on the current state of the economy and management’s judgments of such. Management monitors and assesses\nthe forecast and reversion period at least annually. The Company used a one-year forecast and reversion period to\ncalculate the ACL on loans as of December 31, 2023.\nThe ACL on loans is calculated over a loan’s contractual life. For term loans, the contractual life is calculated\nbased on the maturity date. For revolving loans, the contractual life is based on either the estimated maturity date or a\ndefault date. For revolving loans with no stated maturity date, the contractual life is calculated based on the annual\nattrition rate for the pool. The contractual term does not include expected extension, renewals or modifications.\nThe Company's loan portfolio is segmented into 11 homogenous pools as follows based on the various risk\nprofiles of the Company's loans:\n Commercial & Industrial\n CRE – Construction, Land & Development\n CRE – Multifamily\n CRE – Non-Owner Occupied\n CRE – Owner Occupied\n Agricultural\n Residential – 1st Lien\n Residential – Construction\n Residential – HELOC\n Residential – Jr Lien\n Consumer\n Paycheck Protection Program\nIn calculating the ACL on loans, the contractual life of a loan must be adjusted for prepayments to arrive at\nexpected cash flows. The Company models term loans using an annualized prepayment. When the Company has a\n109\nspecific expectation of differing payment behavior for a given loan, the loan may be evaluated individually. For\nrevolving loans that do not have a principal payment schedule, a curtailment rate is factored into the cash flow.\nThe ACL on loans evaluation may also consider various qualitative factors, such as: actual or expected changes\nin economic trends and conditions, changes in the value of underlying collateral for loans, changes to lending policies,\nunderwriting standards and/or management personnel performing such functions, delinquency and other credit quality\ntrends, credit risk concentrations, if any, changes to the nature of the Company's business impacting the loan portfolio,\nand other external factors, that may include, but are not limited to, results of internal loan reviews, examinations by bank\nregulatory agencies, or other such events such as a natural disaster.\nCertain loans are individually evaluated for estimated credit losses, including those that are classified as substandard\nor doubtful and are on non-accrual or that have other unique characteristics differing from the segment. Specific reserves\nare established when appropriate for such loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows of the loan or\nthe estimated realizable value of the collateral, if any.\nManagement may also adjust its assumptions to account for differences between expected and actual losses from period-\nto-period. The variability of management’s assumptions could alter the ACL on loans materially and impact future\nresults of operations and financial condition. The loss estimation models and methods used to determine the allowance\nfor credit losses are continually refined and enhanced.\nOff Balance Sheet Credit Related Financial Instruments\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into commitments to extend credit, including\ncommitments under credit arrangements, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. Such financial\ninstruments are recorded when they are funded.\nACL on Off Balance Sheet Credit Exposures\nThe ACL on off balance sheet credit exposures, excluding those that are unconditionally cancellable by the\nCompany, estimates the expected losses on the unfunded commitments and standby letters of credit at each reporting\ndate. To appropriately measure expected credit losses, management disaggregates the loan portfolio into similar risk\ncharacteristics, identical to those determined for the loan portfolio. An estimated funding rate is then applied to the\nqualifying unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit using the Company’s own historical experience to\nestimate the expected funded for each loan segment as of the reporting date. Once the expected funded amount for each\nloan segment is determined, the loss rate, which is the calculated expected loan loss as a percent of the amortized cost\nbasis for each loan segment, is applied to calculate the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures as of the reporting\ndate.\nThe ACL on off balance sheet credit exposures is presented within accrued expenses and other liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheet. A charge (credit) to provision for credit losses on the consolidated statements of income is\nmade to account for the change in the ACL on off-balance sheet exposures between reporting periods.The ACL on off-\nbalance sheet credit related financial instruments was $7.4 million and $3.2 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nAccrued Interest Receivable\nAccrued interest receivable, including receivables related to investments and loans, is excluded from the\nmeasurement of the ACL. Accrued interest receivable is written off by reversing previously recognized interest income.\nThe Company has a robust policy in place to write off accrued interest when a loan is placed on non-accrual. For loans, a\nwrite-off typically occurs when a loan has been in default for 90 days or more.\n110\nLand, Premises and Equipment, Net\nLand is carried at cost. Other premises and equipment are carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation.\nDepreciation is computed on a straight-line method based principally on the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nMaintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred while major additions and improvements are capitalized. Gains\n(losses) on dispositions are included in current operations.\nBank Owned Life Insurance\nThe Company has purchased life insurance policies on certain key executives. Bank owned life insurance is\nrecorded at its cash surrender value, or the amount that can be realized, if lower.\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles, Net\nGoodwill resulting from acquisitions is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually. As part of its\ntesting, the Company performs a quantitative analysis to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated\nfair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines the estimated fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying amount using certain qualitative factors, the Company then compares the estimated\nfair value of the goodwill with its carrying amount, and then measures impairment loss by comparing the estimated fair\nvalue of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.\nSignificant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment. This judgment includes developing\ncash flow projections, selecting appropriate discount rates, identifying relevant market comparables, incorporating\ngeneral economic and market conditions, and selecting an appropriate control premium. At December 31, 2023, the\nCompany believes it did not have any indications of potential impairment based on the estimated fair value of the\nreporting units.\nIntangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over the remaining useful lives. Intangible and\nother long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events occur, or circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount may not be recoverable.\nMortgage Banking\nResidential real estate loans are originated for purposes of being held for investment and held for sale into the\nsecondary market. The transfer of these financial assets is accounted for as a sale when control over the asset has been\nsurrendered. Control is deemed to be surrendered when the asset has been isolated from the Company, the transferee\nobtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the\ntransferred asset, and the Company records the gain on sale of the financial asset within mortgage banking income on the\nconsolidated statements of income.\nServicing assets are recognized as separate assets when servicing rights are acquired through the sale of\nresidential mortgage loans with servicing rights retained. Capitalized servicing rights are initially recorded at estimated\nfair value based on assumptions provided by a third-party valuation service. The valuation model incorporates\nassumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income, such as servicing cost per\nloan, the discount rate, the escrow float rate, an inflation rate, ancillary income, prepayment speeds, and default rates and\nlosses. Loan servicing income is recorded on the accrual basis and includes servicing fees from investors and certain\ncharges collected from borrowers, such as late payment fees, and is net of estimated fair value adjustments to capitalized\nmortgage servicing rights. Capitalized servicing rights are amortized into mortgage banking income in proportion to, and\nover the period of, the estimated future servicing income of the underlying loans.\nServicing rights are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. Servicing rights are evaluated for\nimpairment based upon the estimated fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost. Impairment is determined\nby stratifying rights by predominant characteristics, such as interest rates and terms. Impairment is recognized through a\nvaluation allowance for an individual tranche, to the extent that estimated fair value is less than the capitalized amount\n111\nfor the tranche. If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular\ntranche, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income.\nServicing fee income is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on a\ncontractual percentage of the outstanding principal, or a fixed amount per loan, and are recorded as income when earned.\nThe amortization of servicing rights is netted against loan servicing fee income.\nImpairment of Long Lived Assets\nThe Company tests long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the\ncarrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by\ncomparing the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the\nasset.\nIn the event such an asset is considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount\nby which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are\nreported at the lower of the carrying value of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell.\nLeases\nThe Company leases office space, space for ATM locations and certain branch locations under noncancellable\noperating leases, several of which have renewal options to extend the lease terms. Upon commencement of a new lease,\nthe Company will recognize a right-of-use, or ROU, asset and a corresponding lease liability. The Company makes the\ndecision on whether to renew an option to extend a lease by considering various factors. The Company will recognize an\nadjustment to ROU asset and lease liability when lease agreements are amended and executed. The discount rate used in\ndetermining the present value of lease payments is based on the lessor’s implicit rate in the lease if known or the\nCompany’s incremental borrowings rate for borrowing terms similar to each lease at commencement date. The Company\nhas lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For real estate\nleases, non-lease components, such as common area maintenance charges, real estate taxes and insurance, are not\nincluded in the measurement of the lease liability since they are generally able to be segregated. The Company has\nelected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify.\nForeclosed Assets\nAssets acquired through loan foreclosure are included in other assets and are initially recorded at estimated fair\nvalue less estimated selling costs. The estimated fair value of foreclosed assets is evaluated regularly and any decreases\nin value along with holding costs, such as taxes, insurance and utilities, are reported in noninterest expense.\nTransfers of Financial Assets and Participating Interests\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over assets has been surrendered or in the\ncase of loan participation, a portion of the asset has been surrendered and meets the definition of a “participating\ninterest.” Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when 1) the assets have been isolated from the\nCompany, 2) the transferee obtains the rights to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and 3) the Company does not\nmaintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity.\nShould the transfer not meet these three criteria, the transaction is treated as a secured financing.\nLoans serviced for others are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Servicing loans for\nothers generally consists of collecting mortgage payments, maintaining escrow accounts, disbursing payments to\ninvestors and collection and foreclosure processing.\n112\nShort-Term and Long-Term Borrowings\nShort-term borrowings are those that, at time of origination, are scheduled to mature within one year. The\nCompany’s short-term borrowings include, but are not limited to, FHLB overnight and FHLB advances, federal funds\npurchased, and line-of-credit advances.\nLong-term borrowings are those that, at time of origination, are scheduled to mature in one or more years. The\nCompany’s long-term borrowings include, but are not limited to, FHLB advances, subordinated notes payable, trust\npreferred securities, and junior subordinated debentures.\nShort-term and long-term borrowings on the consolidated statements of income are presented net of\nunamortized issuance costs, if any, and amortized over the life of the borrowing.\nThe Company is required to post collateral for certain borrowings, for which it generally posts loans and/or\ninvestment securities as collateral.\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into derivative transactions to manage various risks and\nto accommodate the business requirements of its clients.\nDerivative instruments are reported in other assets or other liabilities at estimated fair value. The Company\nformally documents relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management\nobjectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company also assesses, both at the hedge’s\ninception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in\noffsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the\nexposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as\ninterest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Changes in fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a fair value\nhedge and the change in fair value of the hedged item are both recorded in earnings and offset each other when the\ntransaction is effective. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future\ncash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Changes in fair value of a\nderivative that is effective and that qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in OCI and are reclassified into earnings\nwhen the forecasted transaction or related cash flows affect earnings. The Company will also enter into derivative\ncontracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the\nCompany elects not to apply hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives not designated are\nrecognized directly in earnings.\nNoninterest Income\nSpecific guidelines are established for recognition of certain noninterest income components related to the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements. In accordance with Topic 606, revenues are recognized when control of\npromised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects\nto be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the\nCompany determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the\ncontract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price;\n(4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as)\nthe Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nThe Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the\nconsideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception,\nonce the contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, the Company assesses the goods or services that are\npromised within each contract and identifies those that contain performance obligations and assesses whether each\npromised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is\n113\nallocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. The material\ngroups of noninterest income that this methodology is applied to are defined as follows:\nRetirement and benefit services: Retirement and benefit services income is primarily comprised of fees earned\nfrom the administration of retirement plans, record-keeping, compliance services, health savings accounts, and flexible\nbenefit plans. Fees are earned based on a combination of the market value of assets under administration and transaction-\nbased fees for services provided. Fees that are determined based on the market value of the assets under administration\nare generally billed monthly or quarterly in arrears and recognized monthly as the Company’s performance obligations\nare met. Other transaction-based fees are recognized monthly as the performance obligation is satisfied.\nWealth management: Wealth management income is earned from a variety of sources including trust\nadministration and other related fiduciary services, custody, investment management and advisory services, and\nbrokerage. Fees are based on the market value of the assets under management and are generally billed monthly in\narrears and recognized monthly as the Company’s performance obligations are met. Commissions on transactions are\nrecognized on a trade-date basis as the performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time in which the trade is\nprocessed. Other related services are based on a fixed fee schedule and the revenue is recognized when the services are\nrendered, which is when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation.\nService charges on deposit accounts: Service charges on deposit accounts primarily consist of account analysis\nfees, monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees, and other deposit account related fees. Overdraft fees and certain service\ncharges are fixed, and the performance obligation is typically satisfied at the time of the related transaction. The\nconsideration for analysis fees and monthly maintenance fees are variable as the fee can be reduced if the customer\nmeets certain qualifying metrics. The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied at the time of the transaction or\nover the course of a month.\nOther noninterest income: Other noninterest income components include debit card interchange fees,\nbank-owned life insurance income and miscellaneous transactional fees. Income earned from these revenue streams is\ngenerally recognized concurrently with the satisfaction of the performance obligation.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nTax Credit Investments\nThe Company invests in qualified affordable housing projects for the purpose of community reinvestment and\nobtaining tax credits. These investments are included in other assets on the balance sheet, and any unfunded\ncommitments in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the balance sheet. The qualified affordable housing projects are\naccounted for under the proportional amortization method. Under the proportional amortization method, the initial cost\nof the investment is recognized over the period that the Company expects to receive the tax credits, with the expense\nincluded within income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income. Management analyzes these investments\nfor potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying\namount of the investment will not be realized. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying\namount of an investment exceeds its fair value.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary\ndifferences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax\nbasis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in\nthe years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets\nand liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation\nallowance would be recognized if it is “more likely than not” that the deferred tax asset would not be realized.\n114\nThese calculations are based on many complex factors including estimates of the timing of reversals of\ntemporary differences, the interpretation of federal and state income tax laws, and a determination of the differences\nbetween the tax and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ significantly from\nthe estimates and interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax liabilities.\nThe Company follows standards related to Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. These rules establish a\nhigher standard for tax benefits to meet before they can be recognized in a Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company can recognize in financial statements the impact of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, if it is\nmore likely than not that the position will be sustained on an audit based on the technical merit of the position. See\nNote 20 (Income Taxes) for additional disclosures. The Company recognizes both interest and penalties as components\nof other operating expenses.\nThe amount of the uncertain tax position was not determined to be material. It is not expected that the\nunrecognized tax benefit will be material within the next 12 months. The Company did not incur any interest or penalties\nin 2023, 2022, or 2021.\nThe Company files consolidated federal and state income tax returns. The Company is no longer subject to U.S.\nfederal or state tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2020.\nComprehensive Income\nRecognized revenue, expenses, gains, and losses are included in net income. Certain changes in assets and\nliabilities, such as unrealized gains (losses) on debt securities, unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedging derivatives,\nreclassification adjustments for losses (gains) realized in income, and unrealized gains (losses) on other derivatives, are\nreported as a separate component of the equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. Such items, along with net\nincome, are components of comprehensive income.\nStock Compensation Plans\nStock compensation accounting guidance requires that the compensation cost relating to share-based payment\ntransactions be recognized in financial statements. The cost will be measured based on the grant date estimated fair value\nof the equity or liability instruments issued. The grant date estimated fair value is determined using the closing price of\nthe Company’s common stock. The stock compensation accounting guidance requires that compensation cost for all\nstock awards be calculated and recognized over the employee’s service period, generally defined as the vesting period.\nFor awards with graded-vesting, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period\nfor the entire award.\nEarnings per Share\nEarnings per share are calculated utilizing the two-class method. Earnings per share calculations include shares\nrelated to the Alerus Financial Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Basic earnings per share is calculated by\ndividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common\nstockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share are calculated\nby dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common\nstockholders by the weighted-average number of shares adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock awards.\nNOTE 2 New Accounting Pronouncements\nThe following Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Updates, or ASUs are\ndivided into pronouncements which have been adopted by the Company since January 1, 2023, and those which are not\nyet effective and have been evaluated or are currently being evaluated by management, as of December 31, 2023.\n115\nAdopted Pronouncements\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic\n326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The measurement of expected credit losses under the\nCECL accounting standard is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables. It\nalso applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of\ncredit, financial guarantees, and other similar agreements). In addition, ASC 326 made changes to the accounting for\nAFS and HTM debt securities. One such change is to require credit losses to be presented as an allowance, rather than as\na write-down.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at\namortized cost, off-balance sheet credit exposures, and AFS and HTM debt securities. Results for reporting periods\nbeginning after December 31, 2022, are presented under ASC 326, while prior period amounts continue to be reported in\naccordance with previously applicable GAAP. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment of\n$4.5 million reducing retained earnings, with a corresponding adjustment of $3.9 million increasing the ACL on loans,\nan adjustment of $172 thousand increasing the ACL on HTM debt securities, an adjustment of $1.9 million increasing\nother liabilities for the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures, and an adjustment of $1.5 million increasing deferred\ntax assets as of January 1, 2023.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for financial assets purchased with\ncredit deterioration previously classified as purchased credit impaired and accounted for under ASC 310-30. In\naccordance with the standard, management did not reassess whether purchased credit impaired, or PCI, assets met the\ncriteria of purchased credit deteriorated, or PCD, assets as of the date of adoption.\nThe following table illustrates the impact of ASC 326:\nJa nuary 1, 2023\nAs reported Pre-tax impact of\n(dollars in thousands) under Pre-ASC 326 ASC 326\nAssets: ASC 326 Adoption Adoption\nInvestments\nHeld-to-maturity\nObligations of state and political agencies $ 110 $ — $ 110\nMortgage backed securities\nResidential agency 62 — 62\nTotal allowance for held-to-maturity investment securities 172 — 172\nLoans\nCommercial\nCommercial and industrial 8,526 9,233 (707)\nReal estate construction 3,986 1,437 2,549\nCommercial real estate 12,630 12,761 (131)\nTotal commercial 25,142 23,431 1,711\nConsumer\nResidential real estate first mortgage 8,126 5,857 2,269\nResidential real estate junior lien 1,291 1,318 (27)\nOther revolving and installment 444 540 (96)\nTotal consumer 9,861 7,715 2,146\nTotal allowance for loans 35,003 31,146 3,857\nAllowance for credit losses on loans and investments securities $ 35,175 $ 31,146 $ 4,029\nLiabilities:\nAllowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments $ 5,159 $ 3,244 $ 1,915\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging\n– Portfolio Layer Method, which clarifies the guidance on fair value hedge accounting of interest rate risk portfolios of\n116\nfinancial assets. ASU 2022-01 updates guidance in Topic 815, to expand the scope of the current last-of-layer method to\nallow multiple hedged layers to be designated for a single closed portfolio of financial assets or one or more beneficial\ninterests secured by a portfolio of financial instruments on a prospective basis. Additionally, ASU 2022-01 clarifies that\nbasis adjustments related to existing portfolio layer hedge relationships should not be considered when measuring credit\nlosses on the financial assets included in the closed portfolio. Further, ASU 2022-01 clarifies that any reversal of fair\nvalue hedge basis adjustments associated with an actual breach should be recognized in interest income immediately.\nASU 2022-01 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The\nCompany adopted ASU 2022-01 effective January 1, 2023, and entered into a fair value hedge agreement on February\n10, 2023 and adopted the portfolio layer method of accounting for this transaction. This adoption had no impact on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements as the Company did not have any hedged assets using the last-of-layer\nhedge accounting method.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosures. The amendments in this update eliminate the accounting guidance for Troubled\nDebt Restructurings, or TDRs, by creditors in Subtopic 310-40. Receivables – Troubled Debt Restructurings by\nCreditors, while enhancing the disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when\na borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. For public business entities, this amendment also has vintage disclosures\nthat require that an entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net\ninvestments in leases within the scope of Subtopic 326-20 Financial Instruments – Credit Losses – Measured at\nAmortized Cost. For entities that had not yet adopted the amendment in ASU 2016-13, the effective date for the\namendments in this update are same as the effective date for ASU 2016-13. The Company adopted this ASU on January\n1, 2023, and had no loans experience financial difficulty in the current period.\nPronouncements Not Yet Effective\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects\nof Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. These amendments provide temporary optional guidance to ease the\npotential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for\napplying GAAP to contract modifications and hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, that the London\nInterbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) reference or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. It is intended to help\nstakeholders during the global market-wide reference rate transition period. The guidance is effective for all entities as of\nMarch 12, 2020, through December 31, 2022. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01. Reference Rate Reform\n(Topic 848) in response to concerns about structural risks in accounting for reference rate reform. The ASU clarifies\ncertain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to\nderivatives that affected by the discontinuing transition. LIBOR is used as an index rate for a portion of the Company’s\navailable-for-sale securities, derivative contracts, subordinated notes payable, junior subordinated debentures, and\napproximately 5.3% of the Company’s loans, as of December 31, 2023.\nIf reference rates are discontinued, the existing contracts will be modified to replace the discounted rate with a\nreplacement rate. For accounting purposes, such contract modifications would have to be evaluated to determine whether\nthe modified contract is a new contract or a continuation of an existing contract. If they are considered new contracts, the\nprevious contract would be extinguished. Under one of the optional expedients of ASU 2020-04, modifications of\ncontracts within the scope of Topic 310, receivables, and 470, Debt, will be accounted for by prospectively adjusting the\neffective interest rates and no such evaluation is required. When elected, the optional expedient for contract\nmodifications must be applied consistently for all eligible contracts or eligible transactions. The Company is in the\nprocess of evaluating the impact of this pronouncement of those financial assets and liabilities where LIBOR is used as\nan index rate.\nIn December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06 Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) Deferral of the Sunset\nDate of Topic 848. This amendment provides an update to defer the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022,\nto December 31, 2024, after which all entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures. The amendments in this ASU related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures improve\n117\nthe transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information\nin the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The amendments allow investors to better\nassess, in their capital allocation decisions, how an entity’s worldwide operations and related tax risks and tax planning\nand operational opportunities affect its income tax rate and prospects for future cash flows. The other amendments in this\nUpdate improve the effectiveness and comparability of disclosures by adding disclosures of pretax income (or loss) and\nincome tax expense (or benefit) to be consistent with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation S-X\n210.4-08(h), Rules of General Application—General Notes to Financial Statements: Income Tax Expense, and removing\ndisclosures that no longer are considered cost beneficial or relevant. For public business entities, the amendments in this\nASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. For entities other than public business entities,\nthe amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025. Early adoption is permitted for\nannual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The amendments in this Update\nshould be applied on a prospective basis. Retrospective application is also permitted.\nNOTE 3 Business Combinations\nOn July 1, 2022, the Company acquired MPB BHC, Inc., the bank holding company for Metro Phoenix Bank\nlocated in Phoenix, Arizona, for a total purchase price of $64.0 million in a stock-for-stock transaction. The primary\nreasons for the acquisition were to expand the Company’s operations in the Phoenix MSA and grow the size of the\nCompany’s business.

The Company does\nnot believe that the AFS debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2023 represent a\ncredit loss impairment. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the gross unrealized loss positions were primarily related to\nmortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These\nsecurities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government, are widely recognized as “risk free,” and\nhave a long history of zero credit loss. Additionally, there were corporate bonds in gross unrealized loss positions;\nhowever, all bonds had an investment grade rating as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Total gross unrealized losses\nwere attributable to changes in interest rates, relative to when the investment securities were purchased, and not due to\nthe credit quality of the investment securities. The Company does not intend to sell the investment securities that were\nin an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment\nsecurities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.\nThe ACL on HTM debt securities is estimated using relevant information, from internal and external sources,\nrelating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable supportable forecasts. Using a probability of default and loss\ngiven default analysis an allowance for credit losses was established in the amount of $213 thousand as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\n120\nAccrued interest receivable on AFS investment securities and HTM investment securities is recorded in accrued\ninterest receivable and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. As of December 31, 2023, the accrued interest\nreceivable on AFS investment securities and HTM investment securities totaled $1.5 million and $1.4 million,\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2022, the accrued interest receivable on AFS investment securities and HTM\ninvestment securities totaled $1.9 million and $1.5 million, respectively.\nOn April 1, 2021, the Company transferred its state and political agencies debt securities portfolio, with a fair\nvalue of $149.2 million and a net unrealized gain of $1.3 million, from AFS to HTM. At December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nthe net unrealized gains on the transferred securities were $108 thousand and $272 thousand, net of a deferred tax of $55\nthousand and $137 thousand, respectively.\nProceeds from the sale of AFS securities for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 are displayed\nin the table below:\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nProceeds $ 171,758 $ — $ 13,189\nRealized gains — — 114\nRealized losses (24,643) — —\nProceeds from the call of HTM securities for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are displayed\nin the table below:\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nProceeds $ 242 $ 963 $ 1,772\nRealized gains — — 11\nRealized losses — — —\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no sales of HTM securities. During the year\nended December 31, 2021, the company sold one held-to-maturity security with an amortized cost of $330 thousand.\nProceeds from the sale totaled $348 thousand, resulting in realized gains of $11 thousand. For this sale of a held-to-\nmaturity security, the Company received evidence of a significant deterioration of the issuer’s creditworthiness.\nThe following table presents investment securities with gross unrealized losses, for which an ACL has not been\nrecorded at December 31, 2023 and 2022, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual\ninvestment securities have been in a continuous loss position:\nDecemb er 3 1, 2023\nLess than 12 Months Over 12 Months Total\nNumber of Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair\n(dollars in thousands) Holdings Losses Value Losses Value Losses Value\nAvailable-for-sale\nU.S. Treasury and agencies 1 $ (3) $ 489 $ — $ — $ (3) $ 489\nMortgage backed securities\nResidential agency 112 — 43 (88,547) 435,505 (88,547) 435,548\nCommercial 1 — — (123) 1,353 (123) 1,353\nAsset backed securities 3 — — (1) 25 (1) 25\nCorporate bonds 12 — — (9,349) 48,644 (9,349) 48,644\nTotal available-for-sale investment\nsecurities 129 $ (3) $ 532 $ (98,020) $ 485,527 $ (98,023) $ 486,059\n121\nDecembe r 3 1, 2022\nLess than 12 Months Over 12 Months Total\nNumber of Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair\n(dollars in thousands) Holdings Losses Value Losses Value Losses Value\nAvailable-for-sale\nU.S. Treasury and agencies 1 $ (17) $ 509 $ — $ — $ (17) $ 509\nMortgage backed securities\nResidential agency 145 (10,457) 79,693 (107,711) 507,418 (118,168) 587,111\nCommercial 17 (4,835) 50,437 (2,276) 13,120 (7,111) 63,557\nAsset backed securities 3 — 32 — 2 — 34\nCorporate bonds 17 (4,452) 48,048 (2,516) 14,484 (6,968) 62,532\nTotal available-for-sale investment\nsecurities 183 (19,761) 178,719 (112,503) 535,024 (132,264) 713,743\nHeld-to-maturity\nObligations of state and political agencies 181 (3,336) 18,788 (14,400) 98,762 (17,736) 117,550\nMortgage backed securities\nResidential agency 27 — — (33,254) 150,861 (33,254) 150,861\nTotal held-to-maturity investment\nsecurities 208 (3,336) 18,788 (47,654) 249,623 (50,990) 268,411\nTotal investment securities 391 $ (23,097) $ 197,507 $ (160,157) $ 784,647 $ (183,254) $ 982,154\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the unrealized losses on the Company’s AFS debt securities have not been\nrecognized into income because management does not intend to sell and it is not more-likely-than-not that the Company\nwill be required to sell any of the debt securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Furthermore, the unrealized\nlosses were due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions, were not reflective of credit events and the\nissuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments on the bonds. Agency-backed and government-\nsponsored enterprise securities have a long 40-year history with no credit losses, including during times of severe stress.\nThe principal and interest payments on agency-guaranteed debt is backed by the U.S. government. Government-\nsponsored enterprises similarly guarantee principal and interest payments and carry an implicit guarantee from the U.S.\nDepartment of the Treasury. Additionally, government-sponsored enterprise securities are exceptionally liquid, readily\nmarketable, and provide a substantial amount of price transparency and price parity, indicating a perception of zero\ncredit losses. Subordinate corporate bonds are primarily comprised of investment grade senior notes and senior\nsubordinated notes on other financial institutions. HTM municipal debt holdings are comprised solely of high credit\nquality state and municipal obligations. High credit quality state and municipal obligations have a history of zero to near-\nzero credit loss.\nThe Company determined that the expected credit loss on its HTM portfolio was $213 thousand as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The Company determined that the expected credit loss on its HTM portfolio was immaterial, and\ntherefore, an allowance was not carried on its HTM debt securities at December 31, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, none of the Company’s HTM debt securities were past due or on non-\naccrual status. The Company did not recognize any interest income on non-accrual HTM debt securities during years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n122\nThe following table presents amortized cost and fair value of AFS investment securities and the carrying value\nand fair value of HTM investment securities at December 31, 2023, by contractual maturity:\nHeld-to-maturity Available-for-sale\nCarrying Fair Amortized Fair\n(dollars in thousands) Value Value Cost Value\nDue within one year or less $ 8,588 $ 8,474 $ — $ —\nDue after one year through five years 47,995 44,557 524 521\nDue after five years through ten years 60,289 52,729 59,477 50,004\nDue after 10 years 12,731 11,230 613 617\n129,603 116,990 60,614 51,142\nMortgage-backed securities\nResidential agency 170,125 141,627 524,140 435,594\nTotal investment securities $ 299,728 $ 258,617 $ 584,754 $ 486,736\nExpected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay\nobligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.\nInvestment securities with a total carrying value of $250.0 million and $260.7 million, were pledged at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to secure public deposits and for other purposes required or permitted by\nlaw.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying value of the Company’s Federal Reserve Bank stock and\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, or FHLB, stock was as follows:\nD ecember 31, D ecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nFederal Reserve $ 4,623 $ 4,595\nFHLB 16,566 19,362\nThese securities can only be redeemed or sold at their par value and only to the respective issuing institution or\nto another member institution. The Company records these non-marketable equity securities as a component of other\nassets and periodically evaluates these securities for impairment. Management considers these non-marketable equity\nsecurities to be long-term investments. Accordingly, when evaluating these securities for impairment, management\nconsiders the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value.\nVisa Class B Restricted Shares\nIn 2008, the Company received Visa Class B restricted shares as part of Visa’s initial public offering. These\nshares are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into the publicly traded Class A\ncommon shares. This conversion will not occur until the settlement of certain litigation which will be indemnified by\nVisa members, including the Company. Visa funded an escrow account from its initial public offering to settle these\nlitigation claims. Should this escrow account be insufficient to cover these litigation claims, Visa is entitled to fund\nadditional amounts to the escrow account by reducing each member bank’s Class B conversion ratio to unrestricted\nClass A shares. As of December 31, 2023, the conversion ratio was 1.5991. Based on the existing transfer restriction and\nthe uncertainty of the outcome of the Visa litigation mentioned above, the 6,924 Class B shares (11,702 Class A\nequivalents) that the Company owned as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, were carried at a zero cost basis.\n123\nNOTE 6 Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses\nThe following table presents total loans outstanding, by portfolio segment, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDe cember 31, De cember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nCommercial\nCommercial and industrial $ 598,321 $ 583,876\nReal estate construction 124,034 97,810\nCommercial real estate 1,126,912 881,670\nTotal commercial 1,849,267 1,563,356\nConsumer\nResidential real estate first mortgage 726,879 679,551\nResidential real estate junior lien 154,134 150,479\nOther revolving and installment 29,303 50,608\nTotal consumer 910,316 880,638\nTotal loans $ 2,759,583 $ 2,443,994\nTotal loans include net deferred loan fees and costs of $0.2 million and $0.9 million at December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively.

The increase was primarily due to the adoption of CECL, which resulted in an additional allowance\nof $3.9 million in the ACL on loans. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the significant model inputs and assumptions\nused within the discounted cash flow model for purposes of estimating the ACL on loans were:\n Macroeconomic (loss) drivers: As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the following loss drivers for each loan\nsegment were used to calculate the expected PD over the forecast and reversion period:\n Commercial & Industrial – National Unemployment; Change in National GDP\n CRE – Construction, Land & Development – National Unemployment; Change in National GDP\n CRE – Multifamily – National Unemployment\n CRE – Non-Owner Occupied – National Unemployment; Change in National GDP\n CRE – Owner Occupied – National Unemployment\n Agricultural – (None)\n Residential – 1st Lien – National Unemployment; Change in National Home Price Index (“HPI”)\n Residential – Construction – National Unemployment; Change in National HPI\n Residential – HELOC – National Unemployment; Change in National HPI\n Residential – Jr Lien – National Unemployment; Change in National HPI\n Consumer – National Unemployment; Change in National GDP\n Paycheck Protection Program – (None)\nAfter adoption of ASU 2016-13, given the strong loan growth and the future economic uncertainty, the reserve\nincreased $840 thousand during 2023. This increase was partially offset by the release of certain qualitative factors due\nto strong asset quality and the continued maturity of the overall model. The increase in the reserve represents the\nelevated risk of credit loss within the Company's portfolio.\nCredit Concentrations\nThe Company focuses on maintaining a well-balanced and diversified loan portfolio. Despite such efforts, it is\nrecognized that credit concentrations may occasionally emerge as a result of economic conditions, changes in local\ndemand, natural loan growth and runoff. To identify credit concentrations effectively, all commercial and industrial and\nowner occupied real estate loans are assigned Standard Industrial Classification codes, North American Industry\nClassification System codes, and state and county codes. Property type coding is used for investment real estate. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company's total exposure to the general business industry was 10.7% of total loans. There\nwere no other industry concentrations exceeding 10% of the Company's total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2023.\nCredit Quality Indicators\nThe Company’s consumer loan portfolio is primarily comprised of secured loans that are evaluated at\norigination on a centralized basis against standardized underwriting criteria. The Company generally does not risk rate\nconsumer loans unless a default event such as bankruptcy or extended nonperformance takes place. Credit quality for the\nconsumer loan portfolio is measured by delinquency rates, nonaccrual amounts and actual losses incurred. These loans\nare rated as either performing or non-performing.\nThe Company assigns a risk rating to all commercial loans, except pools of homogeneous loans, and performs\ndetailed internal and external reviews of risk rated loans over a certain threshold to identify credit risks and to assess the\noverall collectability of the portfolio. These risk ratings are also subject to examination by the Company’s regulators.\nDuring the internal reviews, management monitors and analyzes the financial condition of borrowers and guarantors,\ntrends in the industries in which the borrowers operate and the estimated fair values of collateral securing the loans.\nThese credit quality indicators are used to assign a risk rating to each individual loan.\n128\nThe Company’s ratings are aligned to pass and criticized categories. The criticized category includes special\nmention, substandard, and doubtful risk ratings. The risk ratings are defined as follows:\n Pass: A pass loan is a credit with no existing or known potential weaknesses deserving of management’s close\nattention.\n Special Mention: Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management’s\nclose attention. If left uncorrected, this potential weakness may result in deterioration of the repayment\nprospects for the loan or of the Company’s credit position at some future date. Special mention loans are not\nadversely classified and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.\n Substandard: Loans classified as substandard are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying\ncapacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined\nweakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the repayment of the debt. Well-defined weaknesses include a\nborrower’s lack of marketability, inadequate cash flow or collateral support, failure to complete construction on\ntime, or the failure to fulfill economic expectations. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the\nCompany will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\n Doubtful: Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with\nthe added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or repayment in full, on the basis of currently\nexisting facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.\n Loss: Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and charged off immediately.\n129\nThe following table sets forth the amortized cost basis of loans by credit quality indicator and vintage based on\nthe most recent analysis performed, as of December 31, 2023:\nRevolving\n(dollars in thousands) Term Loans Amortized Cost Basis by Origination Year Loans Amortized\nAs of December 31, 2023 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Prior Cost Basis Total\nCommercial and industrial\nPass $ 197,533 $ 89,090 $ 67,691 $ 64,272 $ 34,603 $ 15,053 $ 100,239 $ 568,481\nSpecial mention — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard 464 4,844 236 6,328 94 2,513 15,361 29,840\nDoubtful — — — — — — — —\nSubtotal $ 197,997 $ 93,934 $ 67,927 $ 70,600 $ 34,697 $ 17,566 $ 115,600 $ 598,321\nGross charge-offs for the year ended $ 39 $ — $ 49 $ 11 $ 247 $ 90 $ — $ 436\nReal estate construction\nPass $ 29,902 $ 57,944 $ 14,326 $ 122 $ — $ 952 $ 121 $ 103,367\nSpecial mention — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — 20,667 — — — — — 20,667\nDoubtful — — — — — — — —\nSubtotal $ 29,902 $ 78,611 $ 14,326 $ 122 $ — $ 952 $ 121 $ 124,034\nGross charge-offs for the year ended $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nCommercial real estate\nPass $ 272,261 $ 265,549 $ 142,027 $ 153,796 $ 116,861 $ 159,454 $ 7,794 $ 1,117,742\nSpecial mention — — — — — 262 — 262\nSubstandard — 587 2,872 — 3,690 1,759 — 8,908\nDoubtful — — — — — — — —\nSubtotal $ 272,261 $ 266,136 $ 144,899 $ 153,796 $ 120,551 $ 161,475 $ 7,794 $ 1,126,912\nGross charge-offs for the year ended $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nResidential real estate first mortgage\nPerforming $ 72,180 $ 207,177 $ 218,719 $ 108,100 $ 33,102 $ 87,212 $ 284 $ 726,774\nNon-performing — — — — — 105 — 105\nSubtotal $ 72,180 $ 207,177 $ 218,719 $ 108,100 $ 33,102 $ 87,317 $ 284 $ 726,879\nGross charge-offs for the year ended $ — $ — $ 9 $ — $ — $ 40 $ — $ 49\nResidential real estate junior lien\nPerforming $ 18,408 $ 15,655 $ 5,946 $ 4,857 $ 1,769 $ 5,280 $ 100,438 $ 152,353\nNon-performing — — — — — — 1,781 1,781\nSubtotal $ 18,408 $ 15,655 $ 5,946 $ 4,857 $ 1,769 $ 5,280 $ 102,219 $ 154,134\nGross charge-offs for the year ended $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 77 $ — $ 77\nOther revolving and installment\nPerforming $ 5,320 $ 6,395 $ 980 $ 4,489 $ 1,554 $ 952 $ 9,613 $ 29,303\nNon-performing — — — — — — — —\nSubtotal $ 5,320 $ 6,395 $ 980 $ 4,489 $ 1,554 $ 952 $ 9,613 $ 29,303\nGross charge-offs for the year ended $ 4 $ 2 $ — $ 31 $ 6 $ 8 $ — $ 51\nTotal loans $ 596,068 $ 667,908 $ 452,797 $ 341,964 $ 191,673 $ 273,542 $ 235,631 $ 2,759,583\nGross charge-offs for the year ended $ 43 $ 2 $ 58 $ 42 $ 253 $ 215 $ — $ 613\nThe following table sets forth the risk category of loans by class and credit quality indicator used on the most\nrecent analysis performed as of December 31, 2022:\nDe ce mber 31, 202 2\nCriticized\nSpecial\n(dollars in thousands) Pass Mention Substandard Doubtful Total\nCommercial\nCommercial and industrial $ 558,694 $ 21,969 $ 3,213 $ — $ 583,876\nReal estate construction 97,548 — 262 — 97,810\nCommercial real estate 873,270 — 8,400 — 881,670\nTotal commercial 1,529,512 21,969 11,875 — 1,563,356\nConsumer\nResidential real estate first mortgage 678,743 63 745 — 679,551\nResidential real estate junior lien 149,847 — 632 — 150,479\nOther revolving and installment 50,607 — 1 — 50,608\nTotal consumer 879,197 63 1,378 — 880,638\nTotal loans $ 2,408,709 $ 22,032 $ 13,253 $ — $ 2,443,994\n130\nPast Due and Nonaccrual Loans\nThe Company closely monitors the performance of its loan portfolio. A loan is placed on non-accrual when the\nfinancial condition of the borrower is deteriorating, payment in full of both principal and interest is not expected as\nscheduled or principal or interest has been in default for 90 days or more. Exceptions may be made if the asset is secured\nby collateral sufficient to satisfy both the principal and accrued interest in full and collection is reasonably assured.\nWhen one loan to a borrower is placed on non-accrual, all other loans to the borrower are re-evaluated to determine if\nthey should also be placed on non-accrual. All previously accrued and unpaid interest is reversed at that time. A loan\nwill return to accrual when collection of principal and interest is assured and the borrower has demonstrated timely\npayments of principal and interest for a reasonable period, generally at least six months.\nThe following tables present past due aging analysis of total loans outstanding, by portfolio segment, as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively:\nDecemb er 3 1 , 2023\n90 Days\nAccruing 30 - 59 Days 60 - 89 Days or More Total\n(dollars in thousands) Current Past Due Past Due Past Due Nonaccrual Loans\nCommercial\nCommercial and industrial $ 590,663 $ 924 $ — $ 139 $ 6,595 $ 598,321\nReal estate construction 124,034 — — — — 124,034\nCommercial real estate 1,125,669 128 — — 1,115 1,126,912\nTotal commercial 1,840,366 1,052 — 139 7,710 1,849,267\nConsumer\nResidential real estate first mortgage 724,786 901 554 — 638 726,879\nResidential real estate junior lien 153,220 666 — — 248 154,134\nOther revolving and installment 29,086 170 47 — — 29,303\nTotal consumer 907,092 1,737 601 — 886 910,316\nTotal loans $ 2,747,458 $ 2,789 $ 601 $ 139 $ 8,596 $ 2,759,583\nDecemb er 3 1 , 2022\n90 Days\nAccruing 30 - 59 Days 60 - 89 Days or More Total\n(dollars in thousands) Current Past Due Past Due Past Due Nonaccrual Loans\nCommercial\nCommercial and industrial $ 580,288 $ 2,332 $ 94 $ — $ 1,162 $ 583,876\nReal estate construction 97,370 — — — 440 97,810\nCommercial real estate 879,830 368 — — 1,472 881,670\nTotal commercial 1,557,488 2,700 94 — 3,074 1,563,356\nConsumer\nResidential real estate first mortgage 677,471 1,234 311 — 535 679,551\nResidential real estate junior lien 149,918 377 — — 184 150,479\nOther revolving and installment 50,360 237 10 — 1 50,608\nTotal consumer 877,749 1,848 321 — 720 880,638\nTotal loans $ 2,435,237 $ 4,548 $ 415 $ — $ 3,794 $ 2,443,994\n131\nIn calculating expected credit losses, the Company includes loans on nonaccrual status and loans 90 days or\nmore past due and still accruing.

The unpaid\nprincipal balances of loans serviced for others totaled $190.0 million and $213.5 million at December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively. Servicing loans for others generally consists of collecting mortgage payments, maintaining escrow\naccounts, disbursing payments to investors and collection and foreclosure processing. Loan servicing income is recorded\non an accrual basis and includes servicing fees from investors and certain charges collected from borrowers, such as late\npayment fees, and is net of fair value adjustments to capitalized mortgage servicing rights.\n136\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s activity related to servicing rights for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021:\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nServicing Assets:\nBalance at beginning of year $ 2,643 $ 1,880 $ 1,987\nAdditions (1) 300 1,538 1,553\nAmortization (2) (595) (524) (745)\nBalance at end of year 2,348 2,894 2,795\nLess valuation reserve (3) (296) (251) (915)\nBalance at end of year, net of valuation reserve $ 2,052 $ 2,643 $ 1,880\nFair value, beginning of year $ 2,314 $ 1,892 $ 2,137\nFair value, end of year $ 2,062 $ 2,314 $ 1,892\n(1) Associated income was reported within mortgage banking income, net on the consolidated statements of income.\n(2) Associated amortization expense was reported within other noninterest income on the consolidated statements of income.\n(3) Associated valuation reserve was reported within mortgage and lending expenses on the consolidated statements of income.\nThe following is a summary of key data and assumptions used in the valuation of servicing rights as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.

Substantially all the leases in which the\nCompany is the lessee are comprised of real estate property for branches, and office equipment rentals with terms\nextending through 2037. Portions of certain properties are subleased for terms extending through 2024. Substantially all\nof the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases. The Company has no existing finance leases.\nThe Company elected not to include short-term leases (i.e., leases with initial terms of twelve months or less),\nor equipment leases (deemed immaterial) on the consolidated financial statements. The following table presents the\nclassification of the Company’s right-of-use, or ROU, assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated financial statements\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nD ecember 31, D ecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nLease Right-of-Use Assets Classification\nOperating lease right-of-use assets Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 5,436 $ 5,419\nLease Liabilities\nOperating lease liabilities Operating lease liabilities $ 5,751 $ 5,902\nThe calculated amount of the ROU assets and lease liabilities in the table above are impacted by the length of\nthe lease term and the discount rate used to present value the minimum lease payments. The Company’s lease\nagreements often include one or more options to renew at the Company’s discretion. If at lease inception, the Company\nconsiders the exercising of a renewal option to be reasonably certain, the Company will include the extended term in the\ncalculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. The Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate at lease inception,\n137\non a collateralized basis, over a similar term for the discount rate.

The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the\nfinancial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual or\nnotional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making such commitments as it\ndoes for instruments that are included in the statements of financial condition.\nA summary of the contractual amounts of the Company’s exposure to off-balance sheet risk as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, was as follows:\nDe cember 31, De cember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nCommitments to extend credit $ 942,413 $ 806,431\nStandby letters of credit 10,045 13,089\nTotal $ 952,458 $ 819,520\nThe Company had an allowance for loan losses on unfunded commitments of $3.2 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022. Upon the adoption of the CECL accounting standard, the Company recorded an additional $1.9\nmillion reserve for unfunded commitments. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an additional\n$2.3 million in provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments for a total of $7.4 million of allowance for credit\nlosses on unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2023.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a client as long as there is no violation of any condition\nestablished in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may\nrequire payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total\ncommitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each client’s\ncreditworthiness on a case by case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon\nextension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include accounts\nreceivable, inventory, property and equipment, and income producing commercial properties.\nThe Company was not required to perform on any financial guarantees and did not incur any losses on its\ncommitments during the past two years.\nThe Company utilizes standby letters of credit issued by either the FHLB or the Bank of North Dakota to secure\npublic unit deposits. The Company had no letters of credit outstanding with the FHLB as of December 31, 2023 or 2022.\nWith the Bank of North Dakota, the Company had one letter of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2023 in the\namount of $182.0 million. There were no letters of credit outstanding with the Bank of North Dakota as of\nDecember 31, 2022. Letters of credit with the Bank of North Dakota were collateralized by loans pledged to the Bank of\nNorth Dakota in the amount of $454.6 million and $215.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNOTE 16 Legal Contingencies\nThe Company may be subject to claims and lawsuits which may arise primarily in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. It is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate resolution of these claims and lawsuits is\ncurrently not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company.\n141\nNOTE 17 Share-Based Compensation Plan\nOn May 6, 2019, the Company’s stockholders approved the Alerus Financial Corporation 2019 Equity Incentive\nPlan. This plan allows the compensation committee the ability to grant a wide variety of equity awards, including stock\noptions, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and cash incentive awards in such forms and\namounts as it deems appropriate to accomplish the goals of the plan. Since inception, all awards issued under the plan\nhave been restricted stock and restricted stock units. Any shares subject to an award that is cancelled, forfeited, or\nexpires prior to exercise or realization, either in full or in part, shall again become available for issuance under the plan.\nHowever, shares subject to an award shall not again be made available for issuance or delivery under the plan if such\nshares are (a) tendered in payment of the exercise price of a stock option, (b) delivered to, or withheld by, the Company\nto satisfy any tax withholding obligation, or (c) covered by a stock-settled stock appreciation right or other awards that\nwere not issued upon the settlement of the award. Restricted stock units issued do not participate in dividends and\nrecipients are not entitled to vote these restricted stock units until shares of the Company’s common stock are delivered\nafter vesting of the restricted stock units. Shares vest, become exercisable and contain such other terms and conditions as\ndetermined by the compensation committee and set forth in individual agreements with the participant receiving the\naward. Awards issued to Company directors are not subject to any service requirements and vest immediately. The plan\nauthorizes the issuance of up to 1,100,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2023, 779,307 shares of\ncommon stock are still available for issue under the plan.\nThe compensation expense relating to awards under these plans was $1.6 million in 2023, $1.9 million in 2022,\nand $3.1 million in 2021. The number of unvested shares outstanding was 120,497 and 128,267 as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The number of unvested units outstanding was 111,160 and 110,219 as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following table presents the activity in the stock plans for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022\nwas as follows:\nYear ended De cember 31,\n2023 2022\nWeighted- Weighted-\nAverage Grant Average Grant\nAwards Date Fair Value Awards Date Fair Value\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Awards\nOutstanding at beginning of period 238,486 $ 23.65 260,850 $ 21.04\nGranted 117,706 19.95 102,265 25.44\nVested (98,138) 21.44 (113,562) 19.25\nForfeited or cancelled (26,397) 21.33 (11,067) 23.90\nOutstanding at end of period 231,657 $ 22.96 238,486 $ 23.65\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was $2.7 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of unrecognized\ncompensation expense related to non-vested awards granted under the plans. The expense is expected to be recognized\nover a weighted-average period of 2.3 and 2.7 years, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n142\nNOTE 18 Employee Benefits\nThe Company maintains two employee retirement plans including the Alerus Financial Corporation Employee\nStock Ownership Plan, or ESOP, and a defined contribution salary reduction plan, or 401(k) plan. The plans cover\nsubstantially all employees upon satisfying prescribed eligibility requirements for age and length of service.\nContributions to the ESOP are determined annually by the Board of Directors, at its discretion, and allocated to\nparticipants based on a percentage of annual compensation. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nthere were no unallocated ESOP shares outstanding. Shares of the Company stock within the ESOP are considered\noutstanding and dividends on these shares are charged to retained earnings. Under the 401(k) plan, the Company\ncontributes 100% of amounts deferred by employees up to 3% of eligible compensation and 50% of amounts deferred by\nemployees between 3% and 6% of eligible compensation. Retirement plan contributions are reflected under employee\nbenefits in the income statement and for years ending December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31, December 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nSalary reduction plan $ 2,933 $ 3,148 $ 3,123\nESOP 1,604 1,932 2,014\nTotal $ 4,537 $ 5,080 $ 5,137\nTotal ESOP shares outstanding 1,152,017 1,111,424 1,207,952\nNOTE 19 Noninterest Income\nThe following table presents the Company’s noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022,\nand 2021.\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nRetirement and benefits $ 65,294 $ 67,135 $ 71,709\nWealth management 21,855 20,870 21,052\nMortgage banking (1) 8,411 16,921 48,502\nService charges on deposit accounts 1,280 1,434 1,395\nNet gains (losses) on investment securities (1) (24,643) — 125\nOther\nInterchange fees 2,222 2,246 2,180\nBank-owned life insurance income (1) 877 836 793\nMisc. transactional fees 1,433 1,429 1,218\nOther noninterest income 3,500 352 413\nTotal noninterest income $ 80,229 $ 111,223 $ 147,387\n(1) Not within the scope of ASC 606.\nContract balances: A contract asset balance occurs when an entity performs a service for a customer before the\ncustomer pays consideration (resulting in a contract receivable) or before payment is due (resulting in a contract asset).\nA contract liability balance is an entity’s obligation to transfer a service to a customer for which the entity has already\nreceived payment (or payment is due) from the customer. The Company’s noninterest income streams are largely based\non transactional activity, or standard month-end revenue accruals such as asset management fees based on month-end\nmarket value. Consideration is often received immediately or shortly after the Company satisfies its performance\nobligation and revenue is recognized. The Company does not typically enter into long-term revenue contracts with\ncustomers, and therefore, does not experience significant contract balances. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the\nCompany did not have any significant contract balances.\n143\nContract acquisition costs: In connection with the adoption of Topic 606, an entity is required to capitalize, and\nsubsequently amortize into expense, certain incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if these costs are\nexpected to be recovered. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those costs that an entity incurs to obtain a\ncontract with a customer that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained (for example, sales\ncommission). The Company utilizes the practical expedient which allows entities to immediately expense contract\nacquisition costs when the asset would have resulted from capitalizing these costs would have been amortized in one\nyear or less.\nNOTE 20 Income Taxes\nThe components of income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were\nas follows:\nY ear ended\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nFederal\nCurrent $ 851 $ 9,005 $ 10,731\nDeferred 1,151 727 2,212\nFederal income tax 2,002 9,732 12,943\nState\nCurrent 2,415 2,298 2,879\nDeferred (259) 147 574\nState income tax 2,156 2,445 3,453\nTotal income tax expense $ 4,158 $ 12,177 $ 16,396\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and\ndeferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nDe cember 31, De cember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nDeferred Tax Assets\nAllowance for credit losses $ 9,002 $ 7,818\nEmployee compensation and benefit accruals 2,253 2,455\nExpense accruals 327 417\nIdentifiable intangible amortization 2,176 3,363\nDeferred loan fees 931 1,665\nNet operating loss carry forwards — 3\nNonaccrual loan interest 143 74\nUnrealized loss on available‑for‑sale investment securities 24,548 33,056\nUnrealized loss on derivative and hedge instruments 135 —\nUnfunded commitment liability 1,913 814\nOperating lease liabilities 1,486 —\nOther 129 70\nTotal deferred tax assets from temporary differences 43,043 49,735\nDeferred Tax Liabilities\nAccumulated depreciation 737 835\nGoodwill and intangible amortization 3,840 5,115\nServicing assets 530 663\nPrepaid expenses 1,188 552\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 1,539 —\nOther 614 201\nTotal deferred tax liabilities from temporary differences 8,448 7,366\nNet Deferred Tax Assets $ 34,595 $ 42,369\n144\nThe reconciliation between applicable income taxes and the amount computed at the applicable statutory\nFederal tax rate for years ending December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was as follows:\nY ear ende d December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nPercent of Percent of Percent of\n(dollars in thousands) Amount Pretax Income Amount Pretax Income Amount Pretax Income\nTaxes at statutory federal income tax rate $ 3,329 21.0 % $ 10,958 21.0 % $ 14,506 21.0 %\nTax effect of:\nTax exempt income (715) (4.5)% (514) (1.0)% (556) (0.8)%\nState income taxes, net of federal benefits 715 4.5 % 2,297 4.4 2,973 4.3 %\nNondeductible items and other 829 5.2 % (564) (1.1) (527) (0.8)%\nApplicable income taxes $ 4,158 26.2 % $ 12,177 23.3 % $ 16,396 23.7 %\nIt is the opinion of management that the Company has no significant uncertain tax positions that would be\nsubject to change upon examination.\nNOTE 21 Tax Credit Investments\nThe Company invests in qualified affordable housing projects for the purpose of community reinvestment and\nobtaining tax credits.

The Company’s chief operating decision\nmaker is the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Reportable segments are determined based on the\nservices offered, the significance of the services offered, the significance of those services to the Company’s financial\nstatements, and management’s regular review of the operating results of those services. The Company operates through\nfour operating segments: Banking, Retirement and Benefit Services, Wealth Management, and Mortgage.\nThe financial information presented for each segment includes net interest income, provision for credit losses,\nnoninterest income, and direct and indirect noninterest expense.

These loans are made on substantially the same terms and conditions as those prevailing at the\ntime for comparable transactions with outsiders and are not considered to involve more than the normal risk of\ncollectability. The following table presents the activity associated with loans made between related parties at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear ended Dece mb er 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nBeginning balance $ 130 $ 34\nNew loans and advances 1,313 145\nRepayments (665) (95)\nChanges to related parties (1) 257 46\nEnding balance $ 1,035 $ 130\n(1) Represents changes related to directors that were added to the Board during the year.\n147\nDeposits from related parties held by the Bank at December 31, 2023 and 2022, amounted to $710 thousand\nand $587 thousand, respectively.\nNOTE 25 Derivative Instruments\nThe Company uses a variety of derivative instruments to mitigate exposure to both market and credit risks\ninherent in its business activities. The Company manages these risks as part of its overall asset and liability management\nprocess and through its policies and procedures. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually require little\nor no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a\nnotional amount and an underlying as specified in the contract.\nDerivatives are often measured in terms of notional amount, but this amount is generally not exchanged, and it\nis not recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The notional amount is the basis to which the underlying\nis applied to determine required payments under the derivative contract. The underlying is a referenced interest rate,\nsecurity price, credit spread, or other index. Residential and commercial real estate loan commitments associated with\nloans to be sold also qualify as derivative instruments.\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\nThe Company uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to economic risks, including interest rate,\nliquidity and credit risk. Certain hedging relationships are formally designated and qualify for hedge accounting under\nGAAP. On the date the Company enters into a derivative contract designated as a hedging instrument, the derivative is\ndesignated as either a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. When a derivative is designated as a\nfair value, cash flow, or net investment hedge, the Company performs an assessment, at inception and, at a minimum,\nquarterly thereafter, to determine the effectiveness of the derivative in offsetting changes in the value or cash flows of\nthe hedged item(s). As of December 31, 2023, the Company only uses fair value and cash flow hedges.\nFair value hedges: These derivatives are interest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge the change in fair value\nrelated to interest rate changes of its underlying mortgage-backed investment securities and mortgage loan pools. The\ninterest rate swaps are carried on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value in other assets (when the\nfair value is positive) or in accrued expenses and other liabilities (when the fair value is negative). The changes in fair\nvalue of the interest rate swaps are recorded in interest income. The unrealized gains or losses due to changes in fair\nvalue of the interest rate swaps due to changes in benchmark interest rates are recorded as an adjustment to the hedged\ninstruments and offset in the same interest income line items.\nCash flow hedges: These derivatives are interest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge the variability of\nexpected future cash flows due to market interest changes. The interest rate swap is carried on the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheet at its fair value in other assets (when the fair value is positive) or in accrued expenses and\nother liabilities (when the fair value is negative). Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are\nrecorded in other comprehensive income (loss), or OCI, until the cash flows of the hedged items are realized. If a\nderivative designated as a cash flow hedge is terminated or ceases to be highly effective, the gain or loss in OCI is\namortized to earnings over the period the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings. If a hedged forecasted\ntransaction is no longer probable, hedge accounting is ceased and any gain or loss included in OCI is reported in\nearnings immediately, unless the forecasted transaction is at least reasonably possible of occurring, whereby the amounts\nremain within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), or AOCI. There were no cash flow hedges at December\n31, 2022. The Company estimates that an additional $0.3 million will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense\nover the next 12 months. All cash flow hedges were highly effective for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 12 months.\n148\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nInterest rate swaps: The Company periodically enters into commercial loan interest rate swap agreements in\norder to provide commercial loan customers with the ability to convert from variable to fixed interest rates. These\nderivative contracts relate to transactions in which the Company enters into an interest rate swap with a customer, while\nsimultaneously entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with an institutional counterparty.\nInterest rate lock commitments, forward loan sales commitments and to be announced (TBA) mortgage backed\nsecurities: The Company enters into forward delivery contracts to sell mortgage loans at specific prices and dates in\norder to hedge the interest rate risk in its portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale and its residential mortgage interest\nrate lock commitments.\nThe following table presents the total notional amounts and gross fair values of the Company’s derivatives as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDecemb er 31, 2023 D ecemb er 3 1, 2022\nFair Notional Fair Notional\n(dollars in thousands) Value Amount Value Amount\nDesignated as hedging instruments: Consolidated Balance Sheet Location\nFair value hedges:\nInterest rate swaps Accrued expenses and other liabilities $ 352 $ 600,000 $ — $ —\nCash flow hedges:\nInterest rate swaps Accrued expenses and other liabilities 297 200,000 — —\nTotal derivatives designated as hedging\ninstruments $ 649 $ 800,000 $ — $ —\nNot designated as hedging instruments:\nAsset Derivatives\nInterest rate swaps (1) Other assets $ 8,327 $ 120,671 $ 6,277 $ 43,430\nInterest rate lock commitments Other assets 179 8,126 121 10,462\nForward loan sales commitments Other assets 6 190 7 351\nTotal asset derivatives not designated as\nhedging instruments $ 8,512 $ 128,987 $ 6,405 $ 54,243\nLiability Derivatives\nInterest rate swaps (1) Accrued expenses and other liabilities $ 8,348 $ 120,671 $ 6,277 $ 43,430\nTo-be-announced mortgage backed securities Accrued expenses and other liabilities 183 20,500 26 25,750\nTotal liability derivatives not designated as\nhedging instruments $ 8,531 $ 141,171 $ 6,303 $ 69,180\n(1) Reported fair values include accrued interest receivable and payable.\nThe following table shows the effective portion of the gains (losses) recognized in other comprehensive income\n(loss) and the gains (losses), before tax, reclassified from OCI into earnings for the periods indicated:\nGains (Losses)\nGains (Losses) Reclassified\nRecognized in from OCI\n(dollars in thousands) OCI into Earnings\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023\nCash flow hedges:\nInterest rate swaps $ 176 $ 473\n149\nThe following table shows the effect of fair value and cash flow hedge accounting on derivatives designated as\nhedging instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Income:\nLocation and Amo un t o f Gains (Losses) R eco gn ized in Income\nInterest Income Interest Expense\nLoans, Investment\nincluding securities - Short-term\n(dollars in thousands) fees Taxable borrowings\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023\nTotal amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Income $ 136,918 $ 24,262 $ 20,976\nFair value hedges:\nInterest rate swaps 252 1,881 —\nCash flow hedges:\nInterest rate swaps — — (473)\nThe following table shows the notional amount, carrying amount and associated cumulative basis adjustments\nrelated to the application of hedge accounting that is included in the carrying amount of hedged assets and liabilities in\nfair value hedging relationships at December 31, 2023:\nD ecember 31, 2023\nCumulative Fair\nValue Hedging\nAdjustment in the\nCarrying Amount Carrying Amount of\nNotional of Hedged Assets/ Hedged Assets/\n(dollars in thousands) Amount Liabilities Liabilities\nMortgage-backed securities\nResidential agency (1) $ 200,000 $ 200,241 $ 241\nMortgage loan pools (2) 400,000 400,098 98\nTotal $ 600,000 $ 600,339 $ 339\n(1) Includes amounts related to residential agency mortgage-backed securities currently designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge using the\nportfolio layer method.

At\nDecember 31, 2023, the amortized cost basis of the residential real estate loans used in these hedging relationships was $687.5 million.\nThe gain (loss) recognized on derivatives not designated as hedging relationships for years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was as follows:\n(dollars in thousands) Year ended December 31,\nDerivatives not designated as\nhedging instruments Consolidated Statements of Income Location 2023 2022 2021\nInterest rate swaps Other noninterest income $ (20) $ 2 $ 1\nInterest rate lock commitments Mortgage banking 165 (1,464) (8,660)\nForward loan sales commitments Mortgage banking (1) (483) (2,174)\nTo-be-announced mortgage backed Mortgage banking\nsecurities 118 4,916 5,220\nTotal gain (loss) from derivatives\nnot designated as hedging\ninstruments $ 262 $ 2,971 $ (5,613)\n150\nThe Company has third-party agreements that require a minimum dollar transfer amount upon a margin call.\nThis requirement is dependent on certain specified credit measures. The amount of collateral posted with third parties at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, was $550 thousand and $309 thousand. The amount of collateral posted with\nthird parties is deemed to be sufficient to collateralize both the fair market value change a well as any additional amounts\nthat may be required as a result of a change in the specified credit measures.\nCredit Risk-Related Contingent Features\nBy using derivatives, the Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent that counterparties to the derivative\ncontracts do not perform as required. Should a counterparty fail to perform under the terms of a derivative contract, the\nCompany’s credit exposure on interest rate swaps is limited to the net positive fair value and accrued interest of all\nswaps with each counterparty. The Company seeks to minimize counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits,\nmonitoring procedures, and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. As such, management believes the risk of incurring\ncredit losses on derivative contracts with institutional counterparties is remote.\nThe Company has agreements with its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where, if the Company\ndefaults on any of its indebtedness, including defaults where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by\nthe lender, the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. In addition, the Company also\nhas agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where, if the Company fails to\nmaintain its status as a well-capitalized institution, the counterparty could terminate the derivative position(s) and the\nCompany could be required to settle its obligations under the agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, which included\naccrued interest but excludes any adjustment for non-performance risk, related to these agreements was $649 thousand\nand $0, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had minimum collateral posting thresholds with\ncertain of its derivative counterparties and has posted cash collateral of $550 thousand and $309, respectively. If the\nCompany had breached any of these provisions at December 31, 2023 or 2022, it could have been required to settle its\nobligations under the agreements at their termination value of $649 thousand and $0, respectively.\n151\nBalance Sheet Offsetting\nThe following table presents the Company’s derivative positions and the potential effect of netting\narrangements on its financial position as of the dates indicated:\nG ross Amount\nNot Offset in the\nConsolidated\nBalance Sheets\nGross Amount Gross Amount Net Amount\nRecognized in the Offset in the Presented in the\nConsolidated Consolidated Consolidated Cash Collateral\n(dollars in thousands) Balance Sheets Balance Sheets Balance Sheets Pledged (Received) Net Amount\nDecember 31, 2023\nDerivative assets:\nInterest rate swaps - Company (1)\n$ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nInterest rate swaps - dealer bank (1)\n8,327 — 8,327 (1,740) 6,587\nTo-be-announced mortgage backed\nsecurities — — — — —\nTotal $ 8,327 $ — $ 8,327 $ (1,740) $ 6,587\nDerivative liabilities:\nInterest rate swaps - Company (1)\n$ 649 $ — $ 649 $ 550 $ 99\nInterest rate swaps - customer (2) 8,348 — 8,348 — 8,348\nTo-be-announced mortgage backed\nsecurities 183 — 183 — 183\nTotal\n$ 9,180 $ — $ 9,180 $ 550 $ 8,630\nDecember 31, 2022\nDerivative assets:\nInterest rate swaps - Company (1) $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nInterest rate swaps - dealer bank (1)\n6,277 — 6,277 (6,030) 247\nTo-be-announced mortgage backed\nsecurities — — — — —\nTotal\n$ 6,277 $ — $ 6,277 $ (6,030) $ 247\nDerivative liabilities:\nInterest rate swaps - customer (2)\n$ 6,277 $ — $ 6,277 $ 309 $ 5,968\nTo-be-announced mortgage backed\nsecurities 26 — 26 — 26\nTotal\n$ 6,303 $ — $ 6,303 $ 309 $ 5,994\n(1) The Company maintains a master netting agreement with each counterparty and settles collateral on a net basis for all interest rate swaps with\ncounterparty banks.\n(2) The Company manages its net exposure on its customer loan swaps by obtaining collateral as part of the normal loan policy and underwriting\npractices. The Company does not post collateral to its customers as part of its contract.\nNOTE 26 Regulatory Matters\nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies.\nFailure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary\nactions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s and the Bank’s\nconsolidated financial statements.\n152\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the Bank\nto maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the following table) of common equity tier 1, tier 1, and total\ncapital (as defined in the regulations) to risk weighted assets (as defined) and of tier 1 capital (as defined) to average\nassets (as defined). Management believes at December 31, 2023 and 2022, each of the Company and the Bank met all of\nthe capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the most recent notification from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,\ncategorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.

The Bank normally restricts dividends to a lesser amount. In addition, the Company must adhere to various\nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, regulatory guidelines including required minimum\ncapital and liquidity to maintain their Federal Housing Administration approval status. Failure to comply with the HUD\nguidelines could result in withdrawal of this certification.

The Old Stock Repurchase Program was terminated on/expired on February\n18, 2024.\nOn December 12, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a new stock repurchase program, or\nthe New Stock Repurchase Program, which authorizes the Company to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of its common\nstock subject to certain limitations and conditions. The New Stock Repurchase Program became effective February 18,\n2024, and will expire on February 18, 2027. On February 18, 2024, the New Stock Repurchase Program replaced and\nsuperseded the Old Stock Repurchase Program.\nThe New Stock Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any shares of its common\nstock and there is no assurance that the Company will do so. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company\nrepurchased 356,474 shares, from time-to-time, under the Old Stock Repurchase Program. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company did not repurchase any shares under the Old Stock Repurchase Program. The\nCompany also repurchases shares to pay withholding taxes on the vesting of restricted stock awards and units.\nNOTE 29 Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company categorizes its assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value into a three level hierarchy\nbased on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique used to determine estimated fair value. The estimated fair\nvalue hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and\nthe lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used in the determination of the estimated fair value\nmeasurement fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is\nsignificant to the estimated fair value measurement. Assets and liabilities valued at estimated fair value are categorized\nbased on the following inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:\nLevel 1—Inputs that utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or\nliabilities that an entity has the ability to access.\n155\nLevel 2—Inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs\nthat are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the\nfinancial instrument. Estimated fair values for these instruments are estimated using pricing models, quoted\nprices of investment securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows.\nLevel 3—Inputs that are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an\nentity’s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. Subsequent to initial recognition, the\nCompany may re-measure the carrying value of assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis to\nestimated fair value. Adjustments to estimated fair value usually result when certain assets are impaired. Such\nassets are written down from their carrying amounts to their estimated fair value.\nProfessional standards allow entities the irrevocable option to elect to measure certain financial instruments and\nother items at estimated fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The\nCompany adopted the policy to value certain financial instruments at estimated fair value. The Company has not elected\nto measure any existing financial instruments at estimated fair value; however, it may elect to measure newly acquired\nfinancial instruments at estimated fair value in the future.\nRecurring Basis\nThe Company uses estimated fair value measurements to record estimated fair value adjustments to certain\nassets and liabilities and to determine estimated fair value disclosures. For additional information on how the Company\nmeasures estimated fair value refer to Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies).\nThe following tables present the balances of the assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a\nrecurring basis at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDecemb er 3 1 , 2023\n(dollars in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAvailable-for-sale\nU.S. treasury and government agencies $ — $ 1,120 $ — $ 1,120\nMortgage backed securities\nResidential agency — 435,594 — 435,594\nCommercial — 1,353 — 1,353\nAsset backed securities — 25 — 25\nCorporate bonds — 48,644 — 48,644\nTotal available-for-sale investment securities $ — $ 486,736 $ — $ 486,736\nOther assets\nDerivatives $ — $ 8,512 $ — $ 8,512\nOther liabilities\nDerivatives $ — $ 9,180 $ — $ 9,180\nDecemb er 3 1 , 2022\n(dollars in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAvailable-for-sale\nU.S. treasury and government agencies $ — $ 3,520 $ — $ 3,520\nMortgage backed securities\nResidential agency — 587,679 — 587,679\nCommercial — 63,558 — 63,558\nAsset backed securities — 34 — 34\nCorporate bonds — 62,533 — 62,533\nTotal available-for-sale investment securities $ — $ 717,324 $ — $ 717,324\nOther assets\nDerivatives $ — $ 6,405 $ — $ 6,405\nOther liabilities\nDerivatives $ — $ 6,303 $ — $ 6,303\n156\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at estimated fair\nvalue on a recurring basis, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.\nInvestment Securities, Available-for-sale\nGenerally, debt securities are valued using pricing for similar securities, recently executed transactions, and\nother pricing models utilizing observable inputs and therefore are classified as Level 2.\nDerivatives\nAll of the Company’s derivatives are traded in over the counter markets where quoted market prices are not\nreadily available. For these derivatives, estimated fair value is measured using internally developed models that use\nprimarily market observable inputs, such as yield curves and option volatilities, and accordingly, classify as Level 2.\nExamples of Level 2 derivatives are basic interest rate swaps and forward contracts.\nNonrecurring Basis\nCertain assets are measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets are not measured at\nestimated fair value on an ongoing basis; however, they are subject to estimated fair value adjustments in certain\ncircumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment or a change in the amount of previously recognized\nimpairment.\nThe estimated fair value of certain assets on a nonrecurring basis for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022 consisted of the following:\nDecemb er 3 1, 2023\n(dollars in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nCollateral dependent loans $ — $ — $ 3,998 $ 3,998\nForeclosed assets — — 32 32\nServicing rights — — 2,052 2,052\nDecemb er 3 1, 2022\n(dollars in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nCollateral dependent loans $ — $ — $ 2,813 $ 2,813\nForeclosed assets — — 30 30\nServicing rights — — 2,643 2,643\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans originated and held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. The Company obtains\nquotes or bids on these loans directly from purchasing financial institutions. Typically, these quotes include a premium\non the sale and thus these quotes indicate estimated fair value of the held for sale loans is greater than cost.\nImpairment losses for loans held for sale that are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value represent\nadditional net write-downs during the period to record these loans at the lower of cost or estimated fair value subsequent\nto their initial classification as loans held for sale.\n157\nThe valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used to measure Level 3 estimated fair value as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were as follows:\nD ece mber 31, 20 23\n(dollars in thousands) Weighted\nAsset Type Valuation Technique Unobservable Input Fair Value Range Average\nIndividually evaluated Appraisal value Property specific\nadjustment $ 3,998 10.0 % 10.0 %\nForeclosed assets Appraisal value Property specific\nadjustment (1) 32 N/A N/A\nServicing rights Discounted cash flows Prepayment speed\nassumptions 2,052 85-151 104\nDiscount rate 11.1 % 11.1 %\n(1) There were no discounts taken on the collateral that comprises the balance of foreclosed assets as of December 31, 2023.\nD ece mber 31, 20 22\n(dollars in thousands) Weighted\nAsset Type Valuation Technique Unobservable Input Fair Value Range Average\nIndividually evaluated Appraisal value Property specific\nadjustment $ 2,813 10.0 % 10.0 %\nForeclosed assets Appraisal value Property specific\nadjustment (1) 30 N/A N/A\nServicing rights Discounted cash flows Prepayment speed\nassumptions 2,643 103-137 115\nDiscount rate 10.5 % 10.5 %\n(1) There were no discounts taken on the collateral that comprises the balance of foreclosed assets as of December 31, 2022.\nDisclosure of estimated fair value information about financial instruments, for which it is practicable to\nestimate that value, is required whether or not recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. In cases in which quoted\nmarket prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation\ntechniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimate\nof future cash flows. In that regard, the derived estimated fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to\nindependent markets and, in many cases could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instruments. Certain\nfinancial instruments, with an estimated fair value that is not practicable to estimate and all non-financial instruments,\nare excluded from the disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate estimated fair value amounts presented do not\nnecessarily represent the underlying value of the Company.\nThe following disclosures represent financial instruments in which the ending balances, as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, were not carried at estimated fair value in their entirety on the consolidated balance\nsheets.\nCash and Due from Banks and Accrued Interest\nThe carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate those assets and liabilities\nestimated fair values.\nInvestment Securities, Held-to-Maturity\nThe fair values of debt securities held-to-maturity are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar\nsecurities, recently executed transactions and pricing models.\n158\nLoans\nFor variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, estimated fair values\nare based on carrying values. The estimated fair values of other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis,\nusing interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality.\nBank-Owned Life Insurance\nBank-owned life insurance is carried at the amount due upon surrender of the policy, which is also the\nestimated fair value. This amount was provided by the insurance companies based on the terms of the underlying\ninsurance contract.\nDeposits\nThe estimated fair values of demand deposits are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the\nconsolidated balance sheet date. The estimated fair values of fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a\ndiscounted cash flow calculation that applies current incremental interest rates being offered on certificates of deposit to\na schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities of the outstanding certificates of deposit.\nShort-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt\nFor variable-rate borrowings that reprice frequently, estimated fair values are based on carrying values. The\nestimated fair values of fixed-rate borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on the\nCompany’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Credit-Related Commitments\nOff-balance sheet credit related commitments are generally of short-term nature. The contract amount of such\ncommitments approximates their estimated fair value since the commitments are comprised primarily of unfunded loan\ncommitments which are generally priced at market at the time of funding.\nThe estimated fair values, and related carrying or notional amounts, of the Company’s financial instruments at\nthe dates indicated are as follows:\nDe c ember 31, 20 23\nCarrying Estimated Fair Value\n(dollars in thousands) Amount Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nFinancial Assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 129,893 $ 129,893 $ — $ — $ 129,893\nInvestment securities held-to-maturity 299,515 — 258,617 — 258,617\nLoans, net 2,723,740 — — 2,590,535 2,590,535\nAccrued interest receivable 15,700 15,700 — — 15,700\nBank-owned life insurance 33,236 — 33,236 — 33,236\nFinancial Liabilities\nNoninterest-bearing deposits $ 728,082 $ — $ 728,082 $ — $ 728,082\nInterest-bearing deposits 1,955,967 — 1,955,967 — 1,955,967\nTime deposits 411,562 — 408,910 — 408,910\nShort-term borrowings 314,170 314,170 — — 314,170\nLong-term debt 58,956 — 57,437 — 57,437\nAccrued interest payable 6,826 6,826 — — 6,826\n159\nDe c ember 31, 20 22\nCarrying Estimated Fair Value\n(dollars in thousands) Amount Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nFinancial Assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 58,242 $ 58,242 $ — $ — $ 58,242\nInvestment securities held-to-maturity 321,902 — 270,912 — 270,912\nLoans, net 2,412,848 — — 2,311,956 2,311,956\nAccrued interest receivable 12,869 12,869 — — 12,869\nBank-owned life insurance 33,991 — 33,991 — 33,991\nFinancial Liabilities\nNoninterest-bearing deposits $ 860,987 $ — $ 860,987 $ — $ 860,987\nInterest-bearing deposits 1,842,138 — 1,842,138 — 1,842,138\nTime deposits 212,359 — 208,550 — 208,550\nShort-term borrowings 378,080 378,080 — — 378,080\nLong-term debt 58,843 — 56,116 — 56,116\nAccrued interest payable 2,426 2,426 — — 2,426\n160\nNOTE 30 Parent Company Only Financial Statements\nThe condensed financial statements of Alerus Financial Corporation (parent company only) are presented\nbelow.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the\ndesign and operation of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as that term is defined in\nRule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2023, the end of the\nfiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, the Company’s disclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or\nsubmits under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the SEC’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including\nthe Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure.\nEvaluation of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent registered public\naccounting firm. As an emerging growth company, management’s report on internal control over financial reporting was\nnot subject to attestation by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with the JOBS\nAct.\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over\nfinancial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control\nsystem is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors\nregarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting of the Company includes those policies and procedures that pertain to\nthe maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the Company;\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s\nassets that could have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of inherent limitations in any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, misstatements\ndue to error or fraud may occur and not be detected, including the possibility of the circumvention or overriding of\ncontrols. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance\nwith respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness\nmay vary over time.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting set forth\nby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework\nin 2013. Based on this assessment, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer assert that the Company\nmaintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on the specified criteria.\n163\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the\nperiod covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially\naffect, the Company’s internal control over financial report.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, none of the Company’s directors or executive officers\nadopted or terminated any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities that was\nintended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.\nITEM 9C.

As a result, beginning on or about March 25, 2024, we sent our stockholders by\nmail a notice containing instructions on how to access our proxy materials over the internet and vote. This notice is not a proxy card and\ncannot be used to vote your shares. If you received a notice this year, you will not receive paper copies of the proxy materials unless you\nrequest paper copies of the proxy materials by following the instructions on the notice.\nWhy are we holding a virtual meeting instead of a physical meeting?\nOur Board determined that it would be in the best interests of our stockholders for the Company to hold the Annual Meeting virtually rather\nthan in person. We believe that hosting a virtual meeting will enable more of our stockholders to attend the meeting because it will allow our\nstockholders to participate from any location around the world with internet access.\nHow do I virtually attend the Annual Meeting?\nThe Annual Meeting will be a completely virtual meeting of stockholders, which will be conducted exclusively by live webcast. You are entitled\nto participate in the Annual Meeting only if you were a stockholder of record as of the record date for the Annual Meeting, March 12, 2024 (the\n“Record Date”), or if you hold a valid proxy for the Annual Meeting.

If you are not a stockholder of record but hold shares as a beneficial owner in street name, you should follow the instructions for\nattending the Annual Meeting provided by your broker or other fiduciary.

The stockholder list may be accessed at any time during the meeting or any\nadjournment.\nHow do I ask questions at the Annual Meeting?\nIn order to submit a question at the Annual Meeting, you will need to log into https://web.lumiagm.com/288140204 and enter (i) the\npasscode: alerus2024; and (ii) the 11-digit control number found on the proxy card distributed to each record stockholder. If you would like to\nask a question during the meeting, you can type in your question in the “ask a question” text box that will appear on your screen and click\n“submit”. We encourage you to submit any questions as soon as possible to ensure your question is received.\nWhy did I receive access to this Proxy Statement and proxy card?\nWe have made the proxy materials available to you over the internet because, on the Record Date, you owned shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock, $1.00 par value per share (the “Common Stock”). This Proxy Statement describes the matters that will be presented for\nconsideration by the stockholders at the Annual Meeting. It also gives you information concerning the matters to assist you in making an\ninformed decision.\nThe Board is asking you to give us your proxy. Giving us your proxy means that you authorize another person or persons to vote your shares of\nCommon Stock at the Annual Meeting in the manner you direct. If you vote using one of the methods described herein, you appoint the proxy\nholder as your representative at the meeting, who will vote your shares as you instruct, thereby assuring that your shares will be voted\nwhether or not you attend the meeting. Even if you plan to attend the meeting, you should complete, sign and return your proxy card, or vote\nby internet or telephone, in advance of the meeting, just in case your plans change. If you have signed and returned the proxy card, or voted\nby internet or telephone, and an issue comes up for a vote at the meeting that is not identified in this Proxy Statement or on the proxy card,\nthe proxy holder will vote your shares, pursuant to your proxy, in accordance with his or her judgment.\n2024 Proxy Statement 3\nWhat matters will be voted on at the Annual Meeting?\nYou are being asked to vote on: (1) the election of the eight director nominees named in this Proxy Statement to serve on the Board; and\n(2) the ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP (“RSM”) as our independent public accounting firm for the 2024 fiscal year.\nWhat are the Board’s voting recommendations?\nThe Board recommends that you vote your shares “FOR” the election of each of the eight director nominees named in this Proxy Statement\nand “FOR” the ratification of RSM as our independent public accounting firm for the 2024 fiscal year.\nHow do I vote?\nStockholders of Record. If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares are registered in your own name with our transfer agent), you\nmay vote using the enclosed proxy card. Voting instructions are provided on the proxy card contained in the proxy materials.\nBeneficial Owners of Shares Held in Street Name. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name (that is, if you hold your shares\nthrough a bank, broker or other holder of record), you must provide your voting instructions in accordance with the voting instruction form\nprovided by your bank, broker or other holder of record, who will then vote your shares on your behalf. The availability of telephone or\ninternet voting will depend upon your bank’s, broker’s, or other holder of record’s voting process.\nAlthough you may vote by mail, we ask that you vote instead by internet or telephone, which saves us postage and processing costs. You may\nvote by telephone by calling the toll-free number specified on your proxy card or vote by internet by accessing the website specified on your\nproxy card and by following the preprinted instructions on the proxy card. If you submit your vote by telephone or internet, you may incur\ncosts, such as cable telephone and internet access charges. Votes submitted by telephone or internet must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern\nTime, on Monday, May 6, 2024. The giving of a proxy by either of these means will not affect your right to vote in person if you decide to attend\nthe meeting.\nYou may also vote online during your attendance at the virtual Annual Meeting using the 11-digit control number found on the proxy card.\nPlease note that if your shares are held in the name of a broker or other fiduciary (i.e., in street name), you will need to follow the instructions\nprovided by your broker or other fiduciary to vote your shares electronically during the virtual Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the\nvirtual Annual Meeting, you should complete, sign and return your proxy card, or vote by telephone or internet, in advance of the Annual\nMeeting just in case your plans change.\nWhat happens if I do not give specific voting instructions?\nStockholders of Record. If you are a stockholder of record and you: (i) indicate when voting on the internet or by telephone that you wish to\nvote as recommended by the Board; or (ii) sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions; then the persons named as\nproxy holders will vote your shares in the manner recommended by the Board on all matters presented in this Proxy Statement and as the\nproxy holders may determine in their judgment with respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting.\nBeneficial Owners of Shares Held in Street Name. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name and do not provide the bank,\nbroker or other holder of record that holds your shares with specific voting instructions, then, under applicable rules, the bank, broker or other\nholder of record that holds your shares may generally vote on “routine” matters but cannot vote on “non-routine” matters. If the bank, broker\nor other holder of record that holds your shares does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares on a non-routine matter,\nthat bank, broker or other holder of record will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote on this matter with\nrespect to your shares. This is generally referred to as a “broker non-vote.”\nAt the meeting, the election of directors is considered a non-routine matter, but the ratification of the appointment of our independent\nregistered public accounting firm is considered a routine matter. This means that, if you hold your shares in street name and do not instruct\nthe bank, broker or other holder of record that holds your shares with specific voting instructions, then the bank broker or other holder of\nrecord that holds your shares will not have the authority to vote on the election of directors, but will have the authority to vote on the\nratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm.\nWhat should I do if some or all of my shares are held by the Company’s Employee Stock Ownership Plan?\nIf you hold shares of Common Stock as a participant in the Alerus Financial Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the “ESOP”), you\nwill be receiving this Proxy Statement, together with a confidential voting instruction form, from the trustee of the ESOP (the “Trustee”). You\nshould submit your confidential voting instruction form directly to the Trustee, who will vote the shares allocated to you in accordance with\nyour direction. If no voting instructions are received by the Trustee with respect to the shares allocated to you, the Trustee will vote such\nshares in a manner that is consistent with and proportionate to the voting instructions received from those ESOP participants and\nbeneficiaries who did provide voting direction to the Trustee. If you have any questions regarding these procedures, you should contact the\nTrustee directly.\n2024 Proxy Statement 4\nIf you hold shares of Common Stock as a participant in the ESOP and shares of Common Stock outside of the ESOP, you should submit to the\nTrustee a confidential voting instruction form with respect to the shares held through the ESOP, and also submit a proxy to the Company for\nthe shares held outside the ESOP.\nWhat if I change my mind after I return my proxy?\nIf you hold your shares in your own name, you may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before the polls close at the Annual\nMeeting. You may do this by:\n signing another proxy card with a later date and returning that proxy card to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, 55 Challenger Road, 2nd Floor,\nRidgefield Park, New Jersey 07660;\n timely submitting another proxy via telephone or internet; or\n voting in person at the virtual Annual Meeting.\nIf you hold your shares in the name of your broker or the ESOP, and desire to change your vote, you will need to contact your broker or the\nTrustee to do so.\nWhat is the quorum for each matter?\nThe holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes that could be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to\nvote at the Annual Meeting as of the Record Date must be present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting in order to hold the Annual\nMeeting and conduct business. Virtual attendance at the Annual Meeting constitutes presence “in person” for purposes of determining a\nquorum at the Annual Meeting. Shares are counted as present at the meeting if the stockholder either:\n is present and votes in person at the meeting; or\n has properly submitted a signed proxy card or other proxy, including voting by telephone or internet.\nOn the Record Date there were 19,885,905 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding, which is the only class of voting stock of the\nCompany outstanding. Therefore, at least 9,942,953 shares need to be represented in order to constitute a quorum. Broker non-votes will\ncount for purposes of determining whether or not a quorum is present since a routine matter (the ratification of the appointment of our\nindependent registered public accounting firm) is on the proxy ballot. Similarly, abstentions will be considered in determining the presence of\na quorum. Only the holders of record of Common Stock at the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to receive notice of the Annual\nMeeting and to vote on such matters as may come before the Annual Meeting. Each share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote per share\nof Common Stock.\nWhat happens if a director nominee is unable to stand for election?\nThe Board may, by resolution, provide for a lesser number of directors or designate a substitute nominee. In the latter case, shares\nrepresented by proxies may be voted for a substitute nominee. You cannot vote for more than eight director nominees. The Board has no\nreason to believe any nominee will be unable to stand for election.\nHow many votes may I cast?\nYou are entitled to cast one vote for each share of Common Stock you owned on the Record Date. The proxy card included with this Proxy\nStatement indicates the number of shares owned by an account attributable to you. Stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights with\nrespect to the election of directors.\nHow many votes are needed for each proposal?\nOn Proposal 1 (Election of Directors), the eight individuals receiving the highest number of votes cast “FOR” their election will be elected as\ndirectors of the Company. In an uncontested election, all director nominees will be elected if they receive at least one vote “FOR” their\nelection. Abstentions, votes to “withhold,” and broker non-votes, if any, will not affect the outcome of the election.\nProposal 2 (Ratification of RSM) must receive the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of Common Stock present in person or represented\nby proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter. Abstentions will have the same legal effect as a vote “against” this proposal,\nwhile broker non-votes, because they will not be counted as entitled to vote, will not affect the voting on this proposal.\nUnless otherwise provided by law, or by the Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) or the\nSecond Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the “Bylaws”), any other matter properly brought before the Annual Meeting or any\nadjournment thereof shall be decided by the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by\nproxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter. Abstentions will have the same legal effect as a vote “against” these matters,\nwhile broker non-votes, because they will not be counted as entitled to vote, will not affect the voting on such matters.\n2024 Proxy Statement 5\nWho bears the cost of soliciting proxies?\nThe Company will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to solicitations by mail, officers, directors or employees of the Company or its\nsubsidiary may solicit proxies in person or by telephone. These persons will not receive any special or additional compensation for soliciting\nproxies. We have engaged Broadridge Financial Solutions to assist in the delivery of proxy materials and to establish and operate online and\ntelephonic voting platforms and processes. We may also reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees, and fiduciaries for\ntheir reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding proxy and solicitation materials to stockholders.\nWhere do I find the voting results of the meeting?\nIf available, we will announce voting results at the Annual Meeting. The voting results will also be disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K\nthat we will file with the SEC within four business days after the Annual Meeting.\nHow can multiple stockholders sharing the same address request to receive only one notice or one set of proxy materials and other\ninvestor communications?\nYou may elect to receive future notices and proxy materials, as well as other investor communications, in a single package per address. This\npractice, known as “householding,” is designed to reduce our paper use and printing and postage costs. To make this election, please indicate\non your proxy card under “Householding Election” your consent to receive such communications in a single package per address. Once we\nreceive your consent, we will send a single package per household going forward, until you revoke your consent or request separate copies of\nour proxy materials by contacting the Company’s Secretary at 401 Demers Avenue, Grand Forks, North Dakota 58201 or (701) 795-3200. We will\nstart sending you individual copies of proxy materials and other investor communications following receipt of your revocation.\n2024 Proxy Statement 6\nPROPOSAL 1—\nElection of Directors\nGENERAL\nThe Company has one class of directors. Our directors serve for one-year terms or until their\nsuccessors are elected and qualified. The Company’s current Certificate of Incorporation provides\nthat the Board will consist of a maximum of twelve persons and a minimum of five persons, and the\nCompany’s current Bylaws provide that the number of directors may be fixed from time to time by\nthe Board within the range set by the Certificate of Incorporation. By resolutions adopted by the\nBoard, the number of directors of the Board will be fixed at eight, effective as of the date of the\nAnnual Meeting.\nThe Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Accordingly, the Board did not nominate Mr. Lemke or Mr. Mathews\nCorporate Governance Committee, has nominated the following for election at the Annual Meeting.

Our Board has evaluated the independence of its members based upon the rules of Nasdaq and the SEC. Applying these\nstandards and based on information provided by each director concerning his or her background, employment and affiliations, our Board has\naffirmatively determined that, with the exception of Ms. Lorenson and Mr. Newman, each of our current directors is an independent director,\nas defined under the applicable rules. The Board determined that Ms. Lorenson does not qualify as an independent director because she is an\nexecutive officer of the Company and the Bank, and that Mr. Newman does not qualify as an independent director because he was an\nexecutive officer of the Company and the Bank within the past three years.\nGenerally, the Board oversees our business and monitors the performance of our management. In accordance with our corporate governance\nprocedures, the Board does not involve itself in the day-to-day operations of the Company, which are monitored by our executive officers and\nmanagement. Our directors fulfill their duties and responsibilities by attending regular meetings of the full Board, with additional special\nmeetings held from time to time. Our directors also discuss business and other matters with Ms. Lorenson, other key executives and our\nprincipal external advisers (legal counsel, auditors and other consultants) at times other than regularly scheduled meetings when appropriate.\nOur Board has established standing committees in connection with the discharge of its responsibilities. These committees include the Audit\nCommittee, Compensation Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Risk Committee. Our Board also may\nestablish such other committees as it deems appropriate, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, our Certificate of Incorporation\nand Bylaws.\nThe current charters of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Risk\nCommittee are available on the Company’s website at investors.alerus.com under the “Corporate Governance – Governance Documents”\nheading.\nBOARD AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Board held four regular meetings and no special meetings. During 2023, all directors\nattended at least 75 percent of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the Board and the total number of meetings held by the\ncommittees on which they served. In 2024, the full Board intends to meet at least four times with special meetings held from time to time\nwhen necessary and through committee membership, which is discussed below. Although we do not have a formal policy regarding director\nattendance at the Annual Meeting, we encourage and expect all of our directors to attend. In 2023, all of the directors serving at that time were\npresent at the Annual Meeting.\nThe Board also regularly holds executive sessions of the independent (non-management) members of the Board, without inside directors or\nexecutive management present. Our independent Executive Chairman, Mr. Coughlin serves as Chairman at these executive sessions. The\nChairman is responsible for coordinating with the Chief Executive Officer to set the agenda for Board meetings and advising the Chief\nExecutive Officer on various Board matters.\nCOMMITTEE STRUCTURE\nThe Board exercises certain of its powers through the following committees: Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Nominating and\nCorporate Governance Committee, and Risk Committee. Each committee has a charter that addresses its purpose, authority, and\nresponsibilities and contains other provisions relating to membership and meeting requirements. As required by its charter, each committee\nannually reviews and assesses its charter, but may recommend amendments at any time. In addition, each charter requires the committee to\nannually review its performance. Each committee has the authority to engage outside advisors to the extent it considers appropriate to assist\nthe committee in its work. Each committee is comprised of non-employee directors only, and each non-employee director, other than Mr.\nNewman sits on at least two committees. Each committee chair reports to the full Board on the matters undertaken at each committee\nmeeting.\n2024 Proxy Statement 13\nThe following table summarizes the current membership of each of the committees of the Board:\nNOMINATING AND\nCORPORATE\nAUDIT COMPENSATION GOVERNANCE RISK\nDIRECTOR NAME COMMITTEE COMMITTEE COMMITTEE COMMITTEE\nDaniel E.

Our Board has evaluated the independence of the members\nof our Audit Committee and has affirmatively determined that: (i) each of the members of our Audit Committee meets the definition of\n“independent director” under Nasdaq rules; (ii) each of the members satisfies the additional independence standards under Nasdaq rules and\napplicable SEC rules for audit committee service; and (iii) each of the members has the ability to read and understand fundamental financial\nstatements.

It is our\ndirectors’ view that rather than having a rigid policy, the Board, with the advice and assistance of the Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee, and upon consideration of all relevant factors and circumstances, will determine, as and when appropriate, whether the two\noffices should be separate.\nCurrently, the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate and held by Mr. Coughlin and Ms. Lorenson, respectively. As\nnoted above, Mr. Coughlin is considered an “independent” director.\nThe Board believes, based on a review of the factors outlined above, that having a director other than the Chief Executive Officer serving as\nChairman of the Board is in the best interest of stockholders. The Board and its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believe\nthat this structure will be useful in providing consistent oversight and strategic direction to the Company. The Board expects Ms. Lorenson to\ntake the lead in developing the strategic plan for the Company, providing day-to-day leadership and managing the performance of the\nCompany. The Board expects the Chairman to lead the Board meetings, participate in committee meetings and advise Company\nmanagement. The Board intends to periodically review its leadership structure and make changes as dictated by the circumstances and the\nbest interests of the stockholders.\nBOARD OVERSIGHT OF RISK MANAGEMENT\nOur Board believes that effective risk management and control processes are critical to our safety and soundness, our ability to predict and\nmanage the challenges that we face, and, ultimately, our long-term corporate success. Our Board, both directly and through its committees, is\nresponsible for overseeing our risk management processes, with each of the committees of our Board assuming a different and important role\nin overseeing the management of the risks we face.\nThe Risk Committee of our Board oversees our enterprise-wide risk management framework and corporate risk function, which establishes\nour overall risk appetite and risk management strategy and enables our management to understand, manage and report on the risks we face.\nOur Risk Committee also reviews and oversees policies and practices established by management to identify, assess, measure and manage\nkey risks we face, including the risk appetite metrics and risk appetite statement developed by management and approved by the Risk\nCommittee. The Audit Committee of our Board is responsible for overseeing risks associated with financial matters (particularly financial\nreporting, accounting practices and policies, disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting). The\nCompensation Committee of our Board has primary responsibility for risks and exposures associated with our compensation policies, plans\nand practices, regarding both executive compensation and the Company’s compensation structure generally. In particular, our Compensation\nCommittee reviews our incentive compensation arrangements to ensure these programs are consistent with applicable laws and regulations,\nincluding safety and soundness requirements, and do not encourage imprudent or excessive risk-taking by our employees. The Nominating\nand Corporate Governance Committee of our Board oversees risks associated with the independence of our Board and potential conflicts of\ninterest.\nOur executive management team is responsible for implementing and reporting to our Board regarding our risk management processes,\nincluding by assessing and managing the risks we face, including strategic, operational, regulatory, investment and execution risks, on a day-\nto-day basis. Our executive management team is also responsible for creating and recommending to our Board for approval appropriate risk\nappetite metrics reflecting the aggregate levels and types of risk we are willing to accept in connection with the operation of our business and\npursuit of our business objectives.\nThe role of our Board in risk oversight is consistent with our leadership structure, with the members of our executive management team\nhaving responsibility for assessing and managing our risk exposure, and our Board and its committees providing oversight in connection with\nthose efforts. We believe this division of risk management responsibilities presents a consistent, systemic and effective approach for\nidentifying, managing and mitigating risks throughout our operations.\n2024 Proxy Statement 17\nCOMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION\nDuring 2023, Daniel E.

Cook & Co. to provide\ncompensation consulting services.\nANNUAL INCENTIVE BONUS\nOur named executive officers are eligible to receive an annual cash bonus under the Alerus Financial Corporation Short-Term Incentive Plan\n(the “STIP”). The purpose of the STIP is to incentivize our executive officers to drive Company performance metrics established by the\nCommittee on an annual basis. Under the STIP, the Compensation Committee establishes a target bonus as a percentage of annual base\nsalary. Bonus pay out is based upon actual levels of achievement.\nAs provided under the terms of the STIP, the Compensation Committee establishes Company performance metrics no later than February of\nthe respective year. The Company performance goals are comprised of specific Company performance metrics. In 2023, the Compensation\nCommittee selected net income, return on equity, and revenue as the Company’s performance metrics.\nThe following table sets forth the parts of each named executive officer’s target bonus in 2023:\nTARGET BONUS COMPANY PERFORMANCE (100%)\nNAME (AS % OF SALARY) NET INCOME RETURN ON EQUITY REVENUE\nKatie A. Lorenson 50 % 50 % 25 % 25 %\nJim R. Collins 40 % 50 % 25 % 25 %\nKarin M. Taylor 40 % 50 % 25 % 25 %\nWith respect to annual cash bonus earned by our named executive officers during 2023, in determining the Company’s achievement of the net\nincome performance metric, the Compensation Committee adjusted net income to reflect one-time operating expense items including\nadjustment for severance payments and signing bonuses incurred as a result of certain strategic staffing changes undertaken by the Company\nas well as certain actions taken by the Company to reposition its balance sheet in accordance with its long-term strategic plan.\nIn determining the ultimate payouts for 2023 under the STIP, the Compensation Committee also made positive adjustments to the amounts\notherwise earned by our named executive officers pursuant to the STIP. The dollar amounts of these adjustments are reflected in the “Bonus”\ncolumn of the Summary Compensation Table.\n2024 Proxy Statement 23\nThe combined effect of the Company’s actual performance along with the Compensation Committee’s actions resulted in 2023 annual cash\nbonuses paid under the STIP to our named executive officers at a level of achievement between the established threshold and target levels.\nThe actual percentage of base salary awarded as annual cash bonus was 86.5% for each of our named executive officers.\nEQUITY AWARDS\nOur named executive officers are eligible for long-term equity incentive awards under the Alerus Financial Corporation Long-Term Incentive\nPlan (the “LTIP”). The equity incentive awards due pursuant to the LTIP are granted under the Company’s 2019 Equity Incentive Plan. The\npurpose of the LTIP is to enhance Company performance consistent with our corporate strategic values, focus our executives on long-term\nperformance results consistent with the Company’s long-term strategic plan, strengthen the link between executive pay and performance\nthrough utilization of measurable Company goals, and strengthen the link between executives and our stockholders by creating a shared\ninterest in the Company’s growth.\nThe Committee establishes a target award for each named executive officer, which is stated as a percentage of annual base salary. Awards\nvest over time based upon qualifying time and performance considerations, as set forth in each award agreement and the terms of the\napplicable equity incentive plan. Among other terms, our award agreements provide that upon the expiration of a three-year performance-\nmeasuring period, participants will vest in a portion of the award relative to the level of attainment of the Company’s target cumulative net\nincome goal. The maximum a named executive officer can earn is 150% of the target opportunity, and the minimum threshold a named\nexecutive officer can earn is 50% of the target opportunity. For performance below the minimum threshold level, no incentive is earned. Award\npayouts for performance between the minimum threshold and target, or for performance between the target and maximum is determined by\nlinear interpolation. The performance target and award payout ranges for the 2023 long-term equity incentive awards were as follows:\nLEVEL OF ATTAINMENT\nOF NET INCOME GOAL AWARD PAYOUT\nMinimum 80 % 50 %\nTarget 100 % 100 %\nMaximum 120 % 150 %\nIn 2023, the target awards were: 50% of base salary for Ms. Lorenson, and 30% of base salary for each of Mr. Collins and Ms. Taylor. The terms\nof the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan are described in more detail below.\nDEFERRED COMPENSATION\nUnder the Alerus Financial Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Executives (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”), our named executive\nofficers may voluntarily defer a portion of their annual cash compensation, subject to the limit established by the Company. Elective deferrals\nare subject to earnings as set forth in the Deferred Compensation Plan and are not matched by the Company. The Company has discretion to\nmake a separate contribution to participant accounts. In 2023, no named executive officers received a contribution from the Company, and no\nnamed executive officers elected to defer compensation. Accounts are credited with earnings at the prime rate of interest as published by The\nWall Street Journal. In December of 2023, the Company adopted a new deferred compensation plan called the Alerus Financial Corporation\nDeferred Compensation Plan (the “New Deferred Compensation Plan”) and froze the existing Deferred Compensation Plan. The New Deferred\nCompensation Plan went into effect on January 1, 2024 and allows for employee contributions of base salary, bonus, and incentives, and\ndiscretionary company contributions. Participants in the New Deferred Compensation Plan are permitted the opportunity to accumulate\nearnings on their deferrals by selecting hypothetical investments from among those offered as investments funds under the Alerus 401(k)\nPlan.\nBENEFITS AND OTHER PERQUISITES\nOur named executive officers are eligible to participate in the same benefit plans available to all of our eligible full-time and part-time\nemployees, including medical, dental, vision, life, disability and accidental death insurance. We also provide our employees, including our\nnamed executive officers, with several retirement benefits. Our retirement plans are designed to assist our employees with planning for and\nsecuring appropriate levels of income during retirement. We believe these plans help us attract and retain quality employees, including\nexecutives, by offering benefits similar to those offered by our competitors.\nAlerus Financial Corporation Safe Harbor 401(k) Plan. The Alerus Financial Corporation Safe Harbor 401(k) Plan (the “401(k) Plan”) is designed\nto provide retirement benefits to all eligible full-time and part-time employees of the Company. The 401(k) Plan provides employees with the\nopportunity to save for retirement on a tax-favored basis. Named executive officers, all of whom were eligible during 2023, may elect to\nparticipate in the 401(k) Plan on the same basis as all other employees. Participants may defer into the 401(k) Plan a portion of their annual\ncompensation up to the applicable IRS limit. We currently provide a safe harbor matching contribution on behalf of each eligible participant\n2024 Proxy Statement 24\nequal to 100% of participant contributions on the first 3% of compensation and 50% of participant contributions on the next 3% of\ncompensation, up to the applicable IRS limit. The Company match is contributed in the form of cash and is invested according to the\nemployee’s current investment allocation. Although the Company may also make a discretionary matching contribution of up to 4% of each\neligible participant’s compensation, we did not do so in 2022 or 2023.\nAlerus Financial Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan. The ESOP is designed to reward eligible employees who complete a minimum\nnumber of service hours with an additional tax-qualified retirement benefit and an ownership interest in the Company. Each year, the\nCompany may make a contribution of cash or stock to the ESOP, which eligible employees, including our named executive officers, equally\nshare in proportion to an eligible portion of total annual compensation. For 2023, the Company elected to contribute cash to the ESOP in an\namount equal to 3% of employee compensation, up to the applicable IRS limit.\nHealth and Welfare Benefits. Our named executive officers are eligible to participate in our standard health and welfare benefits program,\nwhich offers a choice of medical, dental, vision, life, disability and accidental death insurance. Starting in 2024, our executive officers are\neligible to obtain an annual executive physical exam at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota; Scottsdale, Arizona; or Jacksonville, Florida at\nthe executive officer’s option and the Company’s expense.\nPerquisites. We provide our named executive officers with perquisites that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our overall\ncompensation program to better enable us to attract and retain executive talent. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the levels\nof perquisites and other personal benefits provided to named executive officers. Based on such review, perquisites are awarded or adjusted on\nan individual basis. Additionally, starting in 2024, our executive officers are eligible to obtain an annual executive physical exam at the Mayo\nClinic in Rochester, Minnesota; Scottsdale, Arizona; or Jacksonville, Florida at the executive officer’s option and the Company’s expense. The\nperquisites received by our named executive officers in 2023 consisted of an automobile allowance for Ms. Lorenson, Mr. Collins, and Ms. Taylor,\nand a cell phone allowance for Ms. Lorenson, Mr. Collins and Ms. Taylor.\nEXECUTIVE SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS\nIn the fall of 2018, we entered into severance agreements with Ms. Lorenson and Ms. Taylor and in 2022 we entered into a severance\nagreement with each of Mr. Collins, Mr. Villalon, Ms. Keney and Mr. Hendry. In February of 2024 we entered into a severance agreement with\nMr. Wilson. The severance agreements generally set forth the duties and obligations of each party in the event of a termination of employment\nand provide us with a measure of protection by subjecting the named executive officers to certain restrictive covenants during employment\nand for a specified duration following termination of employment.\nThe severance agreements provide for an initial term of two years, with automatic renewal for an additional day on each day after the effective\ndate, such that the agreement term is two years at all times. Either party may elect nonrenewal upon notice of 120 days prior to termination.\nThe severance agreements automatically terminate on the second anniversary of a change in control, as such term is defined in each\nseverance agreement.\nIn the event the Company terminates a named executive officer for any reason other than for cause prior to a change in control, the named\nexecutive officer is eligible to receive a severance payment in 12 monthly increments equal to the sum of (i) 100% of annual base salary; (ii) the\naverage of the named executive officer’s three most recent annual bonuses; and (iii) twelve months of the Company’s portion of premiums for\nhealth, disability, and life insurance policies in which the executive was entitled to participate immediately prior to termination. In the event of\na termination within a 24-month period following a change in control by the Company without cause or by the named executive officer for a\ngood reason, the executive is eligible to receive a severance payment in a lump sum equal to twice the amount described above.\nEach named executive officer is subject to a confidentiality provision for 24 months following termination of employment, which prohibits\ndisclosure, and use of, the Company’s trade secrets, confidential information, customer lists and other types of proprietary information. Our\nobligation to pay any severance is also conditioned upon the execution by the named executive officer of a general release and waiver of any\nand all claims with respect to his or her employment with the Company. The severance agreements contain a modified 280G cutback\nprovision, which provides for automatic reduction of payments if such reduction would result in a better net-after-tax result for the named\nexecutives officers after taking into account the impact of the golden parachute excise tax of the Internal Revenue Code.\n2024 Proxy Statement 25\nOUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS AT FISCAL YEAR END\nThe following table provides information about outstanding equity awards held by our named executive officers as of December 31, 2023:\nMARKET VALUE OF\nNUMBER OF SHARES OR UNITS EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN AWARDS: EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN AWARDS:\nSHARES OR\nUNITS OF STOCK THAT\nOF STOCK THAT HAVE NOT NUMBER OF UNEARNED MARKET VALUE OF UNEARNED\nHAVE NOT\nNOT VESTED YET VESTED ($) SHARES THAT HAVE NOT VESTED SHARES THAT HAVE NOT VESTED\nName (#)(1) (#)(2) ($)(3)\nKatie A.

All stock awards made to non-\nemployee directors were previously issued under our Stock Grant Plan for Non-Employee Directors. Future awards will be made under our\n2019 Equity Incentive Plan, which was approved by the Board on February 21, 2019, and approved by our stockholders on May 6, 2019. Each\nplan is described in more detail below.\n2009 Stock Plan\nUnder the 2009 Stock Plan, the Compensation Committee was permitted to grant a wide variety of equity awards, including stock options,\nstock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, and restricted stock units, in such forms and amounts as it deemed appropriate to\naccomplish the goals of the plan. The 2009 Stock Plan provided the Compensation Committee with broad discretion to determine the\namounts, conditions and restrictions of each award and to adjust awards as necessary. As adjusted for a three-for-one stock split, 1,350,000\nshares were available for issuance under the 2009 Stock Plan. Shares that were forfeited, subject to options that were cancelled or expired\nprior to exercise, withheld in connection with satisfaction of tax obligations, used by participants for payment of purchase price or otherwise\nsubject to an award that was terminated became available for reissuance under the 2009 Stock Plan. Shares vested, became exercisable, and\ncontained such other terms and conditions as determined by the Compensation Committee and set forth in individual agreements with the\nparticipant receiving the award. The 2009 Stock Plan provided that each annual award must have time-based and performance-based vesting\ncomponents. The 2009 Stock Plan provided for acceleration of vesting upon a change in control. Following the approval of our 2019 Equity\nIncentive Plan by our stockholders, no additional awards may be granted under our 2009 Stock Plan.\n2019 Equity Incentive Plan\nThe 2019 Equity Incentive Plan was adopted by our board on February 21, 2019, and became effective on May 6, 2019, upon approval by our\nstockholders. The 2019 Equity Incentive Plan is designed to promote the Company’s long-term financial success by providing a means to\nattract, retain and reward individuals who can, and do, contribute to such success and to further align their interests with those of the\nCompany’s stockholders. Pursuant to the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee may grant awards to eligible participants\nin the form of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock awards, stock appreciation rights and other incentive awards. Up to 1,100,000\nshares of Common Stock are available for issuance under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2023, 779,307 shares of Common\nStock are still available for issuance under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan. Awards vest, become exercisable and contain such other terms and\nconditions as determined by the Compensation Committee and set forth in individual agreements with the participants receiving the awards.\nThe 2019 Equity Incentive Plan enables the Compensation Committee to set specific performance criteria that must be met before an award\nvests.\nThe 2019 Equity Incentive Plan allows for acceleration of vesting and exercise privileges of awards at the discretion of the Compensation\nCommittee. If a participant is terminated for cause, then all vested and unvested awards are forfeited upon termination. In addition, unless\notherwise provided in an award agreement, upon the occurrence of a change in control of the Company, all stock options and SARs under the\n2019 Equity Incentive Plan then held by the participant will become fully exercisable immediately, and all stock awards and cash incentive\nawards will become fully earned and vested immediately if, (i) the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan is not an obligation of the successor entity\nfollowing a change in control, or (ii) the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan is an obligation of the successor entity following a change in control but the\n2024 Proxy Statement 26\nparticipant incurs a termination of service without cause or for good reason following the change in control. If vesting of an outstanding award\nis conditioned upon the achievement of performance measures, then (i) if, at the time of the change in control, the established performance\nmeasures are less than 50% attained, such award shall become vested and exercisable on a fractional basis with the numerator being the\npercentage of attainment and the denominator being 50% upon the change in control and (ii) if, at the time of the change in control, the\nperformance measures are at least 50% attained, then such award shall become fully earned and vested immediately upon the change in\ncontrol.\nSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of the Company’s Common Stock, as of March 12, 2024 by:\n each stockholder known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our outstanding Common Stock;\n each of the Company’s named executive officers;\n each of the Company’s directors; and\n all of the Company’s directors and executive officers as a group.\nWe have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC.

These requirements and restrictions include Sections 23A and 23B of\nthe Federal Reserve Act (which govern certain transactions by the Bank with its affiliates) and Regulation O promulgated by the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (which governs certain loans by the Bank to its executive officers, directors and principal\nstockholders). The Company has adopted policies to comply with these regulatory requirements and restrictions.\nOur Board has adopted the Related Party Transaction Policy governing the approval of related party transactions that complies with all\napplicable SEC and Nasdaq rules and requirements concerning related party transactions. Related party transactions are transactions in\nwhich: (i)the Company is a participant, (ii) the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and (iii) a related party of the Company has or will have a\ndirect or indirect material interest. Related parties of the Company include directors (including nominees for election as directors), executive\nofficers, five percent stockholders, and the immediate family members of these persons. The Audit Committee, in consultation with\nmanagement and outside counsel, as appropriate, reviews potential related party transactions to determine if they are subject to the Related\nParty Transaction Policy. If so, the transaction will be referred to the Audit Committee for approval. In determining whether to approve a\nrelated party transaction, the Audit Committee will consider, among other factors, the fairness of the proposed transaction, the direct or\nindirect nature of the related party’s interest in the transaction, the appearance of an improper conflict of interests for any director or\nexecutive officer taking into account the size of the transaction and the financial position of the related party, whether the transaction would\nimpair an outside director’s independence, the acceptability of the transaction to our regulators and the potential violations of other\ncorporate policies.

A copy of CLA’s letter to the SEC dated December 6, 2022 was filed as Exhibit 16.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the\nSEC on December 6, 2022.\nIn connection with the dismissal of CLA and on the same date, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of RSM as our new\nindependent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2023, effective January 1, 2023. During 2022 and 2021, and\nthrough the date of the Audit Committee’s action engaging RSM, neither we, nor anyone on our behalf, consulted with RSM regarding either\n(a) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might\nbe rendered on our financial statements, or (b) any matter that was either the subject of a “disagreement” as described in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of\nRegulation S-K, or any “reportable events,” as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.\nSTOCKHOLDER VOTE NECESSARY TO RATIFY THE APPOINTMENT OF RSM AS THE\nCOMPANY’S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nRatification of the appointment of RSM must receive the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of Common Stock present in person or\nrepresented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter. Abstentions will have the same legal effect as a vote “against”\nthis matter, while broker non-votes, because they will not be counted as entitled to vote, will not affect the voting on this matter.\nBOARD RECOMMENDATION\nWe recommend that you vote “FOR” the ratification of the appointment of RSM to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm\nfor the year ending December 31, 2024. Proxies properly signed and returned will be voted “FOR” this proposal unless you specify otherwise.\n2024 Proxy Statement 30\nACCOUNTANT FEES\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred the following fees for professional services rendered by RSM. For the fiscal\nyear ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred the following fees for professional services performed by CLA:\n2023 2022\nAudit fees(1) $ 516,640 $ 174,365\nAudit-related fees(2) 15,225 9,789\nTax fees(3) — 50,370\nAll other fees(4) — 19,700\n(1) Audit fees include fees for professional services performed by RSM and CLA for (i) the audit of the Company’s consolidated annual financial statements, (ii) the review of the interim\ncondensed consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, (iii) the services that are normally provided by the principal accountant in\nconnection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements, and (iv) other services that generally only the principal accountant can provide.\n(2) Audit-related fees include fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements and are not reported under “Audit Fees.” These services may include accounting consultations in connection with acquisitions and divestitures, attestation\nservices that are not required by statute or regulation, and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards.\n(3) Tax fees include fees incurred for professional services rendered for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning including preparation of corporation income tax returns.\n(4) All other fees include amounts billed for any other products or services offered by RSM and CLA, including administrative, technology, and out-of-pocket costs which are primarily\nrelated to travel.\nThe Audit Committee, after consideration of these matters, does not believe that the rendering of these services by RSM is incompatible with\nmaintaining their independence as our principal accountants.\nAUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICY\nAmong other things, the Audit Committee is responsible for appointing, setting compensation for, and overseeing the work of the\nindependent registered public accounting firm. We have adopted a pre-approval policy under which the Audit Committee approves in\nadvance all audit and non-audit services to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm. As part of its pre-approval\npolicy, the Audit Committee considers whether the provision of any proposed non-audit services is consistent with the SEC’s rules on auditor\nindependence. In accordance with the pre-approval policy, the Audit Committee has pre-approved certain specified audit and non-audit\nservices to be provided by RSM for up to twelve months from the date of the pre-approval. All of the services referred to above for 2023 were\npre-approved by the Audit Committee.\n2024 Proxy Statement 31\nAudit Committee Report\nThe following is the report of the Audit Committee with respect to the Company’s audited financial statements as of and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.

The Audit Committee also reviews the audited financial statements and recommends to the Board that they be included in\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K. The committee is currently comprised of Mr. Lemke, Mr. Coughlin, Ms. Zimmer, Mr. Uribe and Mr. Vetter.

The Audit Committee has also discussed with RSM the matters required\nto be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”), including Auditing Standard No. 1301 (Communications with\nAudit Committees) and the SEC, received and discussed the written disclosures and the letter from RSM required by PCAOB regarding RSM’s\ncommunication with the Audit Committee concerning independence, including Rule 3526 (Communication with Audit Committees\nConcerning Independence) and discussed with RSM its independence. Based on the review and discussions with management and RSM the\nAudit Committee has recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as\nfiled with the SEC on March 8, 2024.\nThis report is submitted on behalf of the current members of the Audit Committee:\nKevin D. Lemke Mary E. Zimmer Daniel E. Coughlin\nJohn Uribe Galen G. Vetter (chair)\n2024 Proxy Statement 32\nOther Matters\nUpon written request addressed to Kari Koob, Alerus Financial Corporation, P.O.

BUSINESS**\n\n**Company Overview and History**\n\nAlerus Financial Corporation, or the Company, is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Through the Company’s subsidiary, Alerus Financial, National Association, or the Bank, the Company provides innovative and comprehensive financial solutions to businesses and consumers through four distinct business segments—banking, retirement and benefit services, wealth management, and mortgage. These solutions are delivered through a relationship oriented primary point of contact along with responsive and client friendly technology.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $3.9 billion of total assets, $2.8 billion of total loans, $3.1 billion of total deposits, $369.1 million of stockholders’ equity, $36.7 billion of assets under administration/management in the Company’s retirement and benefit services segment, and $4.0 billion of assets under administration/management in the Company’s wealth management segment. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had $364.1 million of mortgage originations.\n\nThe Company’s business model produces strong financial performance and a diversified revenue stream, which has helped the Company establish a brand and culture yielding both a loyal client base and passionate and dedicated employees. The Company believes its client first and advice-based philosophy, diversified business model and history of high performance and growth distinguishes the Company from other financial service providers. The Company generates its revenues from both net interest income and noninterest income. Net interest income is derived from offering the Company’s traditional banking products and services. Noninterest income is driven primarily by the Company’s retirement and benefit services, wealth management, and mortgage business segments. The remainder of revenue consists of net interest income, which derives from offering the Company’s traditional banking products and services.\n\nThe Company’s operations date back to 1879, when it was originally founded as the Bank of Grand Forks, one of the first banks chartered in the Dakota Territory. In 2000, the Company changed its name to Alerus Financial Corporation, reflecting the Company’s evolution from a traditional community bank to a high value financial services company focused on serving the needs of businesses and consumers who desire comprehensive financial solutions delivered through relationship-based advice and service. Since this rebranding, the Company has experienced significant growth, both organically and through a series of strategic acquisitions. This growth has allowed the Company to build a diversified franchise and expand its geographic footprint into growing metropolitan areas. The Company believes these initiatives have transformed itself into a high tech, high touch client service provider, increased earnings and allowed the Company to return more value to stockholders.\n\n5\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\n**The Company’s Business Model and Products and Services**\n\nGeneral\n\nThe Company’s business model is client centric, with a focus on offering a diversified range of solutions to clients who desire an advice-based relationship, enabling the Company to become the preferred financial services provider for clients. Through this approach, instead of focusing on the broader population, the Company targets specific business and consumer segments that the Company believes it can serve better than its competitors and that have meaningful growth potential. By offering sound financial advice and a long-term partnership, the Company believes it aligns best with clients who are achievement oriented in their purpose and will allow the Company to play an active role in their success at all stages of their businesses and lives. The Company classifies its consumer clients based on their financial needs and goals, aligning best with those clients with complex situations. The Company’s business clients are classified by industry, with a focus on specific high priority industries and client types, including professional services, finance and insurance, wholesale, small business, construction, retail, and manufacturers. The Company targets businesses with sales between $2.0 million and $100.0 million.\n\nThe Company’s commitment to delivering diversified solutions is driven by the Company’s “One Alerus” initiative, launched in 2017, which enables the Company to bring all of its product and service offerings to clients in a cohesive and seamless manner. Underlying the One Alerus initiative is the Company’s strategy of serving clients through a combination of technology and skilled advisors—a “high tech, high touch” approach that the Company believes clients demand and deserve. One Alerus lays the strategic foundation for current and future technology investments and the synergistic growth strategies of a diversified financial services firm. It also brings together the Company’s product and service offerings in a unified way, which the Company believes differentiates itself from competitors and allows the Company to impact clients more meaningfully and generate long term value for the Company. The primary components of One Alerus are:\n\n●| the Company puts the client first in every decision it makes;  \n---|---  \n●| the Company provides comprehensive products and services, including banking, mortgage, wealth management, and retirement and benefits;  \n---|---  \n●| the Company’s diverse business model providing revenue funding and growth opportunities;  \n---|---  \n●| each client is paired with a primary point of contact to help with individual needs and integrate specialists when needed;  \n---|---  \n●| proactively invest in technology to integrate all business lines and enhance client engagement; and  \n---|---  \n●| the Company consistently seeks new ways to improve the client experience and enhance efficiencies to build scalability.  \n---|---  \n  \nThrough One Alerus, the Company strives to provide each client with a primary point of contact—a trusted advisor—who takes the time to develop an in depth understanding of the client’s needs and goals. The Company’s advisors work holistically with clients in a guidance-based manner to proactively help them with their financial decisions. The Company’s products and services include traditional bank offerings such as checking accounts, debit cards, savings accounts, personal and business loans, credit cards, online banking, mobile banking / wallet, private banking, deposit and payment solutions, and mortgages, as well as fee income services such as individual retirement accounts, or IRAs, 401(k) rollovers, retirement planning, employer sponsored plans, employee stock ownership plans, health savings account, or HSA, flex spending account, or FSA, administration and government health insurance program services, and wealth management services such as advisory, investment management, and trust and fiduciary services. The advisor is equipped to tailor this diverse set of products and services to each client’s unique goals and is empowered to reach across the Company’s organization to bring the client in contact with product specialists as needed. One Alerus bridges the gaps between the Company’s business units with a focus on client advocacy. The Company \n\n6\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nbelieves the One Alerus initiative will enable the Company to achieve future organic growth by leveraging its existing client base and help continue to provide strong returns to the Company’s stockholders.\n\nThe trusted advisor relationship is supported and enhanced through an integrated client access portal called “My Alerus.” By collaborating with a key technology partner, the Company has integrated the diverse client applications of the Company’s full product suite into a unified system and layered in new technology to bring a client’s entire financial picture into one view. For example, a client who has multiple products with the Company, such as banking accounts, a mortgage, wealth management accounts, a retirement account, and a health benefit account, can now access all of these accounts online and effect transactions via one, single login through My Alerus. Instead of being forced to use different usernames and passwords for each system, the Company has created a single login dashboard to access the most used information on client accounts and coupled that with the ability to link into more detailed information within each transaction system (banking, retirement, and benefits, wealth management and mortgage). The Company’s clients can further personalize their dashboard by integrating or linking financial accounts held at other institutions into My Alerus. Once the Company’s clients have integrated or linked all of their financial information, the data can be used to create a custom financial fitness score to help clients save for emergencies, plan for retirement, manage their debt, optimize health savings and protect them from unexpected events with insurance.\n\nOn July 1, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of MPB BHC, Inc., the holding company of Metro Phoenix Bank. The primary reasons for the acquisition were to expand the Company’s business in the Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale metropolitan statistical area, or Phoenix MSA, and grow the size of the Company’s business. As consideration for the merger, the Company issued $64.0 million of its common stock (valued at $23.81 per share as of July 1, 2022) in a stock-for-stock transaction. As a result of the acquisition, the Company acquired $270.4 million in loans and $353.7 million in deposits from Metro Phoenix Bank. \n\nBanking\n\n _Lending._ Through the Company’s relationship-oriented lending approach, the Company’s strategy is to offer a broad range of customized commercial and consumer lending products for the personal investment and business needs of the Company’s clients. The Company’s commercial lending products include commercial loans, business term loans and lines of credit for a diversified mix of small and midsized businesses. The Company offers both owner occupied and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, as well as construction and land development loans. The Company’s consumer lending products include residential first mortgage loans. In addition to originating these loans for the Company’s own portfolio, it originates and sells, primarily servicing released, whole loans in the secondary market. The Company’s mortgage loan sales activities are primarily directed at originating single family mortgages, which generally conform to Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation guidelines and are delivered to the investor shortly after funding. Additionally, the Company offers installment loans and lines of credit, typically to facilitate investment opportunities for consumer clients whose financial characteristics support the request. The Company also provides clients loans collateralized by cash and marketable securities.\n\nThe Company’s loan portfolio includes commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, consumer loans, which include residential real estate loans, indirect auto loans and other consumer loans, and a small amount of agricultural loans. The principal risk associated with each category of loans the Company makes is the creditworthiness of the borrower. Borrower creditworthiness is affected by general economic conditions and the attributes of the borrower and the borrower’s market or industry. The Company underwrites for strong cash flow, multiple sources of repayment, adequate collateral, borrower experience and backup guarantors. Attributes of the relevant business market or industry include the competitive environment, client and supplier availability, the threat of substitutes, and barriers to entry and exit.\n\n_Deposits._ The Company provides a broad range of deposit products and services, including demand deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, money market accounts, time and savings deposits, and certificates of deposit. Core deposits, which consist of noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing checking accounts, certificates of deposit less than $250,000, and money market accounts, provide the Company’s major source of funds from individuals, businesses and local governments. As of December 31, 2023, core deposits totaled $3.0 billion or 96.1% of the Company’s total deposits. The Company’s deposit portfolio includes synergistic deposits from the retirement and \n\n7\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nbenefits services and wealth management segments. As of December 31, 2023, these synergistic deposits totaled $851.5 million. The Company also offers an HSA deposit program to attract low cost deposits. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $176.7 million of HSA deposits which are included in the synergistic deposit total. \n\nThe Company offers a range of treasury management products, including electronic receivables management, remote deposit capture, cash vault services, merchant services, and other cash management services. Deposit flows are significantly influenced by general and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, internal pricing decisions and competition. The Company’s deposits are primarily obtained from depositors located in the Company’s geographic footprint, and the Company believes that it has attractive opportunities to capture additional deposits in the Company’s markets. In addition, the Company has created a National Market to focus on growing the synergistic deposits from the retirement and benefits services and wealth management segments. In order to attract and retain deposits, the Company relies on providing quality service, offering a suite of consumer and commercial products and services and introducing new products and services that meet the Company’s clients’ needs as they evolve. \n\nRetirement and Benefit Services\n\nThe Company’s retirement and benefit services business offers retirement plan administration and investment advisory services, employee stock ownership plan, or ESOP, administration, fiduciary services, HSA and other benefit services to clients on a nationwide basis. A breakdown of these services is as follows:\n\n●| **Advisory.** The Companyprovides investment fiduciary services to retirement plans.  \n---|---  \n●| **Retirement.** The Company provides recordkeeping and administration services to qualified retirement plans.  \n---|---  \n●| **ESOP Administration.** The Company provides recordkeeping and administration services to employee stock ownership plans.  \n---|---  \n●| **Health and Welfare.** The Company provides HSA, FSA, and government health insurance program recordkeeping and administration services to employers.  \n---|---  \n  \nWealth Management\n\nThe Company’s wealth management division provides fiduciary services to consumer and commercial clients. These services include financial planning, investment management, personal and corporate trust services, estate administration, and custody services. In addition, the wealth management division offers brokerage services to compliment the unique needs of its clients. The Company’s investment management services offer two unique and proprietary strategies called Dimension and Blueprint, which are primarily targeted toward IRAs, and agency account relationships. A Dimension account is a proprietary, separately managed account designed for individual investors, foundations, endowments and institutions with assets typically greater than $500 thousand. Dimension accounts use actively managed portfolios consisting of individual securities, mutual funds, and exchange traded funds selected and monitored by a centralized team of investment professionals. A Blueprint account uses a series of models that are designed to help investors gain exposure to a diversified, risk-based asset allocation. Portfolios in these accounts are comprised of mutual funds run by consistent, low-cost fund managers, with the Bank conducting initial and ongoing fund monitoring of the model allocations and rebalancing the portfolios on a regular basis.\n\nMortgage\n\nThe Company’s mortgage business offers first and second mortgage loans through a centralized mortgage unit located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, as well as through the Company’s banking office locations. These loans typically enable borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes, most of which serve as the primary residence of the owner. In 2023, approximately 97.0% of the loans made by the mortgage division were for the purchase of a residential property, compared to 3.0% for the refinance of an existing mortgage. The Company sources most residential mortgage loans from the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington metropolitan statistical area, or the Twin Cities MSA, and for the year ended \n\n8\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nDecember 31, 2023, approximately 85.6% of the total mortgage loans were attributable to that market, compared to 9.4% attributable to the North Dakota market and 5.0% attributable to the Phoenix MSA. The Company believes there is an opportunity to expand the mortgage loan pipeline in these other markets, especially in the Phoenix MSA. Although the Company originates loans for its own portfolio, the Company also conducts mortgage banking activities in which it originates and sells, servicing released, whole loans in the secondary market. Typically, loans with a fixed interest rate of greater than 10 years are available-for-sale and sold on the secondary market. The Company’s mortgage banking loan sales activities are primarily directed at originating single family mortgages that are priced and underwritten to conform to previously agreed criteria before loan funding and are delivered to the investor shortly after funding. The level of future loan originations, loan sales, and loan repayments depends on overall credit availability, the interest rate environment, the strength of the general economy, local real estate markets and the housing industry, and conditions in the secondary loan sale market. The amount of gain or loss on the sale of loans is primarily driven by market conditions and changes in interest rates, as well as the Company’s pricing and asset liability management strategies. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had mortgage loans held for sale of $11.5 million from the residential mortgage loans originated. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company’s mortgage segment originated $364.1 million of mortgage loans.\n\n**The Company’s Banking Market Areas**\n\nThe Company’s primary banking market areas are the states of North Dakota, Minnesota, specifically, the Twin Cities MSA, and Arizona, specifically, the Phoenix MSA. In addition to offices located in the Company’s banking markets, the retirement and benefit services business administers plans in all 50 states through offices located in Colorado, Michigan, and Minnesota.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nThe Company’s corporate headquarters, which is a full-service banking office located at 401 Demers Avenue, Grand Forks, North Dakota 58201, primarily serves the eastern North Dakota market along with two other full-service banking offices located in Grand Forks, North Dakota, three full-service banking offices located in Fargo and West Fargo, North Dakota, and one full-service banking office located in Northwood, North Dakota. The Company believes this market is rich in low-cost, core deposits and is strengthened by the Bakken Oil region. The Company can use these low-cost, core deposits to fund loans in higher-growth metropolitan markets. \n\nThe State of North Dakota also features one of the only state-owned banks in the nation, the Bank of North Dakota, which offers services, many of which are similar to those offered by a correspondent bank, only to banks like the Company that are headquartered in the state. The Bank of North Dakota expands the Company’s lending capacity by purchasing participations from the Bank. In addition, the Bank of North Dakota offers the Company additional financing options such as bank stock loans, lines of credit and subordinated debt at competitive rates. Finally, the Bank of North Dakota enables state banks to take deposits and manage funds for municipal and county governments without meeting collateral requirements, which are waived by a letter of credit from the Bank of North Dakota.\n\nMinnesota\n\nThe Company serves the Minnesota market through six full-service banking offices all located in the Twin Cities MSA. The Twin Cities MSA had total deposits of $237.6 billion as of June 30, 2023, and ranks as the 14th largest metropolitan statistical area in the United States in total deposits, based on FDIC data. The Twin Cities MSA is defined by attractive market demographics, including strong household incomes, dense populations, low unemployment, and the presence of a diverse group of large and small national and international businesses making the Twin Cities MSA one of the most economically vibrant and diverse markets in the country.\n\nArizona\n\nThe Company serves the Arizona market through full-service banking offices located in Phoenix and Scottsdale, Arizona. The Phoenix MSA had total deposits of $167.2 billion as of June 30, 2023, and ranks as the 20th largest metropolitan statistical area in the United States in total deposits, based on FDIC data. The Phoenix MSA is \n\n9\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\ndefined by attractive market demographics, including a large number of high-net-worth households, dense populations, low unemployment, and the presence of a diverse group of small-to-medium sized businesses. \n\n**The Company’s National Market**\n\nThe Company’s retirement and benefit services business serves clients in all 50 states. It offers retirement and benefit services at all of the Company’s banking offices located in the three primary market areas. In addition, the Company operates one retirement and benefits services office in Minnesota, one in Colorado and one in Michigan. In addition, the Company’s National Market President oversees the development of the national market’s client base. Retirement and benefit services assets under administration/management, wealth management assets under administration/management, and loans attributable to the National Market were $28.3 billion, $480.2 million, and $8.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023, representing approximately 77.1%, 15.2%, and 0.3%, respectively of total retirement and benefit services assets under administration/management, wealth management assets under administration/management, and loans as of that date.\n\n**Competition**\n\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive, and the Company competes in a number of areas, including commercial and consumer banking, residential mortgages, wealth advisory, investment management, trust, and record-keeping among others. The Company competes with other bank and nonbank institutions located within the Company’s market areas, along with competitors situated regionally, nationally, and others with only an online presence. These include large banks and other financial intermediaries, such as consumer finance companies, brokerage firms, mortgage banking companies, business leasing and finance companies, credit unions, Fintech companies and digital asset service providers, all actively engaged in providing various types of loans and other financial services. The Company also faces growing competition from online businesses with few or no physical locations, including online banks, lenders and consumer and commercial lending platforms, as well as automated retirement and investment services providers. Competition involves efforts to retain current clients, obtain new loans, deposits, and advisory services, increase the scope and type of services offered, and offer competitive interest rates paid on deposits, charged on loans, or charged for advisory services. The Company believes its integrated and high-touch service offering, along with its sophisticated relationship-oriented approach sets the Company apart from competitors.\n\n**Human Capital Resources**\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries employed a total of 754 employees as of December 31, 2023, of which approximately:\n\n●| 709 are full-time employees; and   \n---|---  \n●| 45 are part-time employees.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company’s workforce further breaks down into the following categories: \n\n●| gender: male 269, female 485; and   \n---|---  \n●| ethnicity: 624 white, 130 identify as either Native American Indian, Asian, African American, Hispanic, Latino, or not specified.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company has four operating segments with the following employees: \n\n●| Banking: 246 employees;   \n---|---  \n●| Mortgage: 47 employees;   \n---|---  \n  \n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\n●| Retirement and Benefits: 243 employees; and  \n---|---  \n●| Wealth Management: 56 employees.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe staff and support divisions include: \n\n●| Client Service Center: 39 employees; and   \n---|---  \n●| Human Resources, Information Technology, Marketing, Audit, Legal, Compliance, and the Executives staff areas: 123 employees.  \n---|---  \n  \nBanking is a people- and relationship-driven business and the Company’s employees are vital to the Company’s success in the financial services industry. In short, the Company’s long-term success depends on the Company’s ability to attract and retain top performers in every aspect of the Company’s business. The Company believes a diverse workforce better enables the Company to understand its client base, and to help its clients meet their own goals and expectations.\n\nThe Company’s culture is underpinned by its core values: Do the Right Thing (lead with integrity and provide valued advice and guidance), Passion for Excellence (act with accountability and a sense of urgency to best serve clients and achieve exceptional results), Success is Never Final (embrace opportunities to adapt and grow with our industry and our clients), and One Alerus (working together to provide purpose-driven products and services for our clients).\n\nThe Company’s Talent Management Program is built on the foundation of Alerus leadership essentials, which include 12 competencies, divided into four elements of success: Charting the Course, Achieving Results, Leading People, and Managing Self. Through this program the Company builds on strengths with continuous, real-time coaching and evaluation in areas of development, all aligned with the Company’s goals and strategies. \n\nThe development, attraction and retention of employees is a critical success factor for the Company for succession planning and sustaining its core values. To support the advancement of the Company’s employees, it offers training and development programs encouraging advancement from within and continues to fill its team with strong and experienced management talent. The Company leverages both formal and informal programs to identify, foster, and retain top talent at both the corporate and operating unit level. Training programs are offered through the Alerus University platform which provides a variety of courses in the areas of management, leadership, sales, technology, compliance, product knowledge, and on the job training opportunities. Alerus Essentials is a learning program for all employees to learn more about the Company’s goals, strategies, core values, and service offerings. Manager Connection provides managers across the Company an opportunity to learn together and share best practices for developing and leading teams.\n\nThe Company’s compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of its employees with the Company’s performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. The structure of the Company’s compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically, the Company compensates most of its employees through a combination of base salary, sales incentive programs, an annual performance bonus program tied to company success measures and a long-term equity program tied to Company long-term performance. Each element of compensation is designed to achieve a compensation package that is competitive in the Company’s markets and within the Company’s industry. The Company hired compensation consultants FW Cook to perform compensation analysis and benchmarking compared to the peer group for executive compensation plans. For all other areas, the Company hired McLagan a division of Aon, to provide benchmarking and analysis for base salary structures and sales incentive programs.\n\nThe Company’s benefits package provides employees medical, dental, vision, life, disability and accidental death insurance and paid time off benefits. The Company also provides its employees with retirement benefits designed to assist employees with planning for and securing appropriate levels of income during retirement. The Company believes these plans help attract and retain quality employees by offering benefits comparative with those offered by competitors.\n\n11\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe Company provides policies and training on ethical conduct. The Company maintains an open-door policy to encourage open communication, feedback and discussion about any matter of importance to any employees. The Company hired Lighthouse Services to provide employees with a confidential reporting mechanism for misconduct, including discrimination, ethics, harassment and hostility, human resource issues, privacy, security and safety.\n\n**Corporate Information**\n\nThe Company’s principal executive office is located at 401 Demers Avenue, Grand Forks, North Dakota 58201, and the Company’s telephone number at that address is (701) 795-3200. The Company’s website address is www.alerus.com. The information contained on the Company’s website is not a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this report. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, as the Company does. The website is www.sec.gov. The Company provides access to its SEC filings for viewing or downloading free of charge through its website at www.alerus.com. After accessing the website, the filings are available upon selecting “Investor Relations” and “SEC Filings.” Reports available include the Company’s proxy statements, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after the documents and reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.\n\n**SUPERVISION AND REGULATION**\n\n**General**\n\nAlerus Financial Corporation, a financial holding company, and its subsidiary, Alerus Financial, N.A., a national banking association, are extensively regulated under federal law. As a result, the Company’s growth and earnings performance may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of applicable statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the Company’s primary regulator, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or Federal Reserve, and the Bank’s primary regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or OCC, as well as the FDIC, as the insurer of the Company’s deposits, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, as the regulator of consumer financial services and their providers. Furthermore, taxation laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, securities laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and state securities authorities, and anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or Treasury, have an impact on the Company’s business. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and accounting rules are significant to the Company’s operations and results.\n\nFederal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of FDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies and affiliates that is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC-insured deposits and depositors of banks, rather than stockholders. These federal and state laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of the Company’s business; the kinds and amounts of investments the Company may make; required capital levels relative to the Company’s assets; the nature and amount of collateral for loans; the establishment of branches; the Company’s ability to merge, consolidate and acquire; dealings with insiders and affiliates; and the Company’s payment of dividends. In reaction to the global financial crisis and particularly following passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or Dodd-Frank Act, the Company experienced heightened regulatory requirements and scrutiny. Although the reforms primarily targeted systemically important financial service providers, their influence filtered down in varying degrees to community banks over time and caused the Company’s compliance and risk management processes, and the costs thereof, to increase. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018, or Regulatory Relief Act, eliminated questions about the applicability of certain Dodd-Frank Act reforms to community bank systems, including relieving the Company of any requirement to engage in mandatory stress tests, maintain a risk committee or comply with the Volcker Rule’s complicated prohibitions on proprietary trading and ownership of private funds. The Company believes these reforms have been favorable to operations. \n\n12\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe supervisory framework for U.S. banking organizations subjects banks and bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective regulatory agencies, which results in examination reports and ratings that are not publicly available and that can impact the conduct and growth of their business. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations.\n\nThe following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to the Company and the Bank. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision.\n\n**The Role of Capital**\n\nRegulatory capital represents the net assets of a banking organization available to absorb losses. Because of the risks attendant to their business, FDIC-insured institutions generally are required to hold more capital than other businesses, which directly affects the Company’s earnings capabilities. Although capital has historically been one of the key measures of the financial health of both bank holding companies and banks, its role became fundamentally more important in the wake of the global financial crisis, as the banking regulators recognized that the amount and quality of capital held by banks prior to the crisis was insufficient to absorb losses during periods of severe stress. \n\nCapital Levels.Banks have been required to hold minimum levels of capital based on guidelines established by the bank regulatory agencies since 1983. The minimums have been expressed in terms of ratios of “capital” divided by “total assets.” The capital guidelines for U.S. banks beginning in 1989 have been based upon international capital accords (known as “Basel” rules) adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a committee of central banks and bank supervisors that acts as the primary global standard-setter for prudential regulation, as implemented by the U.S. bank regulatory agencies on an interagency basis. The accords recognized that bank assets for the purpose of the capital ratio calculations needed to be risk weighted (the theory being that riskier assets should require more capital) and that off-balance sheet exposures needed to be factored in the calculations. Following the global financial crisis, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, announced agreement on a strengthened set of capital requirements for banking organizations around the world, known as Basel III, to address deficiencies recognized in connection with the global financial crisis. \n\nThe Basel III Rule**.** The United States bank regulatory agencies adopted the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, and, at the same time, effected changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act, in regulations that were effective (with certain phase-ins) in 2015. Basel III established capital standards for banks and bank holding companies that are meaningfully more stringent than those in place previously: it increased the required quantity and quality of capital; and it required a more complex, detailed and calibrated assessment of risk in the calculation of risk weightings. The Basel III Rule is applicable to all banking organizations that are subject to minimum capital requirements, including federal and state banks and savings and loan associations, as well as to most bank and savings and loan holding companies. The Company and the Bank are each subject to the Basel III Rule.\n\nNot only did Basel III increase most of the required minimum capital ratios in effect prior to January 1, 2015, but, in requiring that forms of capital be of higher quality to absorb loss, it introduced the concept of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, which consists primarily of common stock, related surplus (net of Treasury stock), retained earnings, and Common Equity Tier 1 minority interests subject to certain regulatory adjustments. The Basel III Rule also changed the definition of capital by establishing more stringent criteria that instruments must meet to be considered Additional Tier 1 Capital (primarily non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock that meets certain requirements) and Tier 2 Capital (primarily other types of preferred stock and subordinated debt, subject to limitations). The Basel III Rule also constrained the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, and deferred tax assets in capital and required deductions from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital if such assets exceeded a percentage of a banking institution’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. \n\n13\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe Basel III Rule requires **minimum** capital ratios as follows: \n\n●| A ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets;  \n---|---  \n●| A ratio of Tier 1 Capital equal to 6% of risk-weighted assets;   \n---|---  \n●| A continuation of the minimum required amount of Total Capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) at 8% of risk-weighted assets; and  \n---|---  \n●| A leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total quarterly average assets equal to 4% in all circumstances.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition, institutions that want to make capital distributions (including for dividends and repurchases of stock) and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction must also maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to a capital conservation buffer. The purpose of the conservation buffer is to ensure that banking institutions maintain a buffer of capital that can be used to absorb losses during periods of financial and economic stress. Factoring in the conservation buffer increases the minimum ratios depicted above to 7% for Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, 8.5% for Tier 1 Capital and 10.5% for Total Capital. \n\nWell-Capitalized Requirements**.** The ratios described above are minimum standards for banking organizations to be considered “adequately capitalized.” Bank regulatory agencies uniformly encourage banks to hold more capital and be “well-capitalized” and, to that end, federal law and regulations provide various incentives for banking organizations to maintain regulatory capital at levels in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. For example, a banking organization that is well-capitalized may: (i) qualify for exemptions from prior notice or application requirements otherwise applicable to certain types of activities; (ii) qualify for expedited processing of other required notices or applications; and (iii) accept, roll-over or renew brokered deposits. Higher capital levels could also be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual banking organizations. For example, the Federal Reserve’s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk, or the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities. Further, any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth would be expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions (_i.e._ , Tier 1 Capital less all intangible assets), well above the minimum levels.\n\nUnder the capital regulations of the Federal Reserve for the Company and the OCC for the Bank, in order to be well capitalized, the Company must maintain:\n\n●| A Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio to risk-weighted assets of 6.5% or more;   \n---|---  \n●| A ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8% or more;   \n---|---  \n●| A ratio of Total Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 10% or more; and   \n---|---  \n●| A leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total adjusted average quarterly assets of 5% or greater.  \n---|---  \n  \nIt is possible under the Basel III Rule to be well-capitalized while remaining out of compliance with the capital conservation buffer discussed above.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023: (i) the Bank was not subject to a directive from the OCC to increase its capital and (ii) the Bank was well-capitalized, as defined by OCC regulations. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had regulatory capital in excess of the Federal Reserve’s requirements and met the Basel III Rule requirements to be well-capitalized. The Company also remains in compliance with the capital conservation buffer of 2.5 % as of December 31, 2023.\n\n14\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nPrompt Corrective Action**.** The concept of being “well-capitalized” is part of a regulatory regime that provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take “prompt corrective action” to resolve the problems of depository institutions based on the capital level of each particular institution.The extent of the regulators’ powers depends on whether the institution in question is “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized,” in each case as defined by regulation. Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators’ corrective powers include: (i) requiring the institution to submit a capital restoration plan; (ii) limiting the institution’s asset growth and restricting its activities; (iii) requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to sell itself; (iv) restricting transactions between the institution and its affiliates; (v) restricting the interest rate that the institution may pay on deposits; (vi) ordering a new election of directors of the institution; (vii) requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; (viii) prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; (ix) requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; (x) prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and (xi) ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution.\n\nCommunity Bank Capital Simplification. Community banks have long raised concerns with bank regulators about the regulatory burden, complexity, and costs associated with certain provisions of the Basel III Rule. In response, Congress provided an “off-ramp” for institutions, like us, with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. Section 201 of the Regulatory Relief Act instructed the federal banking regulators to establish a single “Community Bank Leverage Ratio”, or CBLR, of between 8 and 10%. Under the final rule, a community banking organization is eligible to elect the new framework if it has: less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, limited amounts of certain assets and off-balance sheet exposures, and a CBLR greater than 9%. The Company has not elected to use the CBLR framework at this time.\n\n**Supervision and Regulation of the Company**\n\nGeneral. The Company, as the sole stockholder of the Bank, is a bank holding company that has elected financial holding company status. As a bank holding company, the Company is registered with, and subject to regulation, supervision and enforcement by, the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or the BHCA. The Company is legally obligated to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank in circumstances where the Company might not otherwise do so. Under the BHCA, the Company is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve and are required to file with the Federal Reserve periodic reports of the Company’s operations and such additional information regarding the Company and the Bank as the Federal Reserve may require. \n\nAcquisitions and Activities/ Financial Holding Company Election. The primary purpose of a bank holding company is to control and manage banks. The BHCA generally requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for any merger involving a bank holding company or any acquisition by a bank holding company of another bank or bank holding company. Subject to certain conditions (including deposit concentration limits established by the BHCA), the Federal Reserve may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the United States. In approving interstate acquisitions, the Federal Reserve is required to give effect to applicable state law limitations on the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its FDIC-insured institution affiliates in the state in which the target bank is located (provided that those limits do not discriminate against out-of-state institutions or their holding companies) and state laws that require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) before being acquired by an out-of-state bank holding company. Furthermore, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies must be well-capitalized and well-managed in order to effect interstate mergers or acquisitions. For a discussion of the capital requirements, see “—The Role of Capital” above.\n\nThe BHCA generally prohibits the Company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of a class of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries. This general prohibition is subject to a number of exceptions. The principal exception allows bank holding companies to engage in, and to own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the Federal Reserve prior to November 11, 1999 to be “so closely related to banking ... as to be a proper incident thereto.” This authority permits the Company to \n\n15\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nengage in a variety of banking-related businesses, including the ownership and operation of a savings association, or any entity engaged in consumer finance, equipment leasing, the operation of a computer service bureau (including software development) and mortgage banking and brokerage services. The BHCA does not place territorial restrictions on the domestic activities of nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies.\n\nAdditionally, bank holding companies that meet certain eligibility requirements prescribed by the BHCA and elect to operate as financial holding companies may engage in, or own shares in companies engaged in, a wider range of nonbanking activities, including securities and insurance underwriting and sales, merchant banking and any other activity that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines by regulation or order is financial in nature or incidental to any such financial activity or that the Federal Reserve determines by order to be complementary to any such financial activity, as long as the activity does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of FDIC-insured institutions or the financial system generally. The Company has elected to operate as a financial holding company. In order to maintain the Company’s status as a financial holding company, both the Company and the Bank must be well-capitalized, well-managed, and the Bank must have at least a satisfactory CRA rating. If the Federal Reserve determines that either the Company or the Bank is not well-capitalized or well-managed, the Federal Reserve will provide a period of time in which to achieve compliance, but during the period of noncompliance, the Federal Reserve may place any limitations on the Company that it deems appropriate. Furthermore, if non-compliance is based on the failure of the Bank to achieve a satisfactory CRA rating, the Company would not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities. \n\nChange in Control**.** Federal law prohibits any person or company from acquiring “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution or its holding company without prior notice to the appropriate federal bank regulator. “Control” is conclusively presumed to exist upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a bank or bank holding company, but may arise under certain circumstances between 10% and 24.99% ownership.\n\nCapital Requirements. The Company is subject to the complex consolidated capital requirements of the Basel III Rule, see “—the Role of Capital” above.\n\nDividend Payments. The Company’s ability to pay dividends to stockholders may be affected by both general corporate law considerations and policies of the Federal Reserve applicable to bank holding companies _._ As a Delaware corporation, the Company is subject to the limitations of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL. The DGCL allows the Company to pay dividends only out of its surplus (as defined and computed in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL) or if the Company has no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year.\n\nAs a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the Board of Directors of a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends to stockholders if: (i) the company’s net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. The Federal Reserve also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies. In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom to pay unrestricted dividends will have to maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to the capital conservation buffer. See “—The Role of Capital” above.\n\nMonetary Policy. The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has a significant effect on the operating results of financial or bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, which was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the tools available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open market transactions in U.S. government securities and changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\n\n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nFederal Securities Regulation. The Company’s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Consequently, the Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading and other restrictions and requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act.\n\nCorporate Governance**.** The Dodd-Frank Act addressed many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. It increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a nonbinding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments, and authorizing the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate and solicit voters for their own candidates using a company’s proxy materials. The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of bank holding companies, regardless of whether such companies are publicly traded.\n\n**Supervision and Regulation of the Bank**\n\nGeneral. The Bank is a national bank, chartered by the OCC under the National Bank Act. The deposit accounts of the Bank are insured by the deposit insurance fund, or DIF, to the maximum extent provided under federal law and FDIC regulations, currently $250,000 per insured depositor category, and the Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System. As a national bank, the Bank is subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of the OCC, the chartering authority for national banks. The Company’s defined business lines of Banking, Mortgage, Retirement and Benefits and Wealth Management are each subject to that authority. The FDIC, as administrator of the DIF, also has regulatory authority over the Bank.\n\nSupervision of Business Segments. As a national bank, the Bank is subject to examination and enforcement by the OCC. The OCC examines the Bank’s Banking and Mortgage business segments as part of its safety and soundness examinations, which consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality (with rigorous loan portfolio reviews) and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. Many of these subjects are discussed further below.\n\nThe Bank’s Retirement and Benefits and Wealth Management business segments are subject to separate examination as trust activities (generally on the same cycle as safety and soundness examinations). The OCC’s trust examinations evaluate compliance with applicable law, management ability, operations, internal controls, and auditing, earnings, compliance, and asset management. These business segments are subject to a multitude of state laws (trust law is a state concept) and federal laws to which the Bank and each individual account are subject. These include trust investment law, securities law, banking law, tax law, contract law, anti-money laundering requirements, environmental law, consumer protection law, criminal law, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control laws and regulations. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA, and the Internal Revenue Code are the primary sources of law governing the structure, administration, and operation of employee benefit plans. The U.S. Department of Labor is primarily responsible for administering and enforcing ERISA.\n\nThe OCC has broad enforcement authority to impose penalties, restrictions and limitations on the Bank where it determines, among other things, that the Bank’s operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations.\n\nDeposit Insurance**.** As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system whereby FDIC-insured institutions pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification. For institutions like the Bank that are not considered large and highly complex banking organizations, assessments are now based on examination ratings and financial ratios. The total base assessment rates currently range from 2.5 basis points to 32 basis points. At least semi-annually, the FDIC updates its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, increases or decreases the assessment rates, following notice and comment on proposed rulemaking. \n\nFor this purpose, the reserve ratio is the DIF balance divided by estimated insured deposits. In response to the global financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits. In its semiannual update in June 2022, the FDIC projected that the reserve ratio was at \n\n17\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nrisk of not reaching the statutory minimum of 1.35 % by September 30, 2028, the statutory deadline. Based on this update, the FDIC approved an increase in the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules by two basis points, applicable to all insured depository institutions. The increase was effective on January 1, 2023, applicable to the first quarterly assessment period of the 2023 assessment (January 1 through March 31, 2023). \n\nIn addition, because the total cost of the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank was approximately $16.3 billion, the FDIC adopted a special assessment for banks having deposits above $5 billion, at an annual rate of 13.4 basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2024 (January 1 through March 31, 2024) with an invoice payment date of June 28, 2024, and will continue to collect special assessments for an anticipated total of eight quarterly assessment periods. The base for the special assessment is equal to an insured depository institution’s estimated uninsured deposits for the December 31, 2022 reporting period, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits. \n\nSupervisory Assessments**.** National banks are required to pay supervisory assessments to the OCC to fund the operations of the OCC. The amount of the assessment is calculated using a formula that considers the bank’s size and its supervisory condition. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Bank paid supervisory assessments to the OCC totaling $431 thousand.\n\nCapital Requirements. Banks are generally required to maintain capital levels in excess of other businesses. For a discussion of capital requirements, see “—The Role of Capital” above.\n\nLiquidity Requirements. Liquidity is a measure of the ability and ease with which bank assets may be converted to meet financial obligations such as deposits or other funding sources. Banks are required to implement liquidity risk management frameworks that ensure they maintain sufficient liquidity, including a cushion of unencumbered, high quality liquid assets, to withstand a range of stress events. The level and speed of deposit outflows contributing to the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank in the first half of 2023 was unprecedented and contributed to acute liquidity and funding strain. These events have further underscored the importance of liquidity risk management and contingency funding planning by insured depository institutions like the Bank.\n\nThe primary roles of liquidity risk management are to: (i) prospectively assess the need for funds to meet financial obligations and (ii) ensure the availability of cash or collateral to fulfill those needs at the appropriate time by coordinating the various sources of funds available to the institution under normal and stressed conditions. Basel III includes a liquidity framework that requires the largest insured institutions to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests. One test, referred to as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, or LCR, is designed to ensure that the banking entity has an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets that can be converted easily and immediately in private markets into cash to meet liquidity needs for a 30-calendar day liquidity stress scenario. The other test, known as the Net Stable Funding Ratio, or NSFR, is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of FDIC-insured institutions over a one-year horizon. These tests provide an incentive for banks and holding companies to increase their holdings in Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets, increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source and rely on stable funding like core deposits (in lieu of brokered deposits).\n\nAlthough these tests do not, and will not, apply to the Bank, the Company continues to review its liquidity risk management policies in light of regulatory requirements and industry developments.\n\nDividend Payments. The primary source of funds for the Company is dividends from the Bank. Under the National Bank Act, a national bank may pay dividends out of its undivided profits in such amounts and at such times as the bank’s Board of Directors deems prudent. Without OCC approval, however, a national bank may not pay dividends in any calendar year that, in the aggregate, exceed that bank’s year-to-date income plus the bank’s retained net income for the two preceding years. The payment of dividends by any FDIC-insured institution is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and an FDIC-insured institution generally is prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the institution would be undercapitalized. As described above, the Bank exceeded its capital requirements under applicable guidelines as of December 31, 2023. Notwithstanding the availability of funds for dividends, however, the OCC may prohibit the \n\n18\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\npayment of dividends by the Bank if it determines such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom to pay dividends have to maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to the capital conservation buffer. See “—The Role of Capital” above.\n\nInsider Transactions. The Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on “covered transactions” between the Bank and its “affiliates.” The Company is an affiliate of the Bank for purposes of these restrictions, and covered transactions subject to the restrictions include extensions of credit to the Company, investments in the stock or other securities of the Company and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of the Company as collateral for loans made by the Bank. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained.\n\nCertain limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by the Bank to its directors and officers, to directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries, to principal stockholders of the Company and to “related interests” of such directors, officers and principal stockholders. In addition, federal law and regulations may affect the terms on which any person who is a director or officer of the Company or the Bank, or a principal stockholder of the Company, may obtain credit from banks with which the Bank maintains a correspondent relationship.\n\nSafety and Soundness Standards/Risk Management. FDIC-insured institutions are expected to operate in a safe and sound manner. The federal banking agencies have adopted operational and managerial standards to promote the safety and soundness of such institutions that address internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings.\n\nIn general, the safety and soundness standards prescribe the goals to be achieved in each area, and each institution is responsible for establishing its own procedures to achieve those goals. If an institution fails to operate in a safe and sound manner, the FDIC-insured institution’s primary federal regulator may require the institution to submit a plan for achieving and maintaining compliance. If an FDIC-insured institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan, or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan that has been accepted by its primary federal regulator, the regulator is required to issue an order directing the institution to cure the deficiency. Until the deficiency cited in the regulator’s order is cured, the regulator may restrict the FDIC-insured institution’s rate of growth, require the FDIC-insured institution to increase its capital, restrict the rates that the institution pays on deposits or require the institution to take any action that the regulator deems appropriate under the circumstances. Operating in an unsafe or unsound manner will also constitute grounds for other enforcement action by the federal bank regulatory agencies, including cease and desist orders and civil money penalty assessments.\n\nDuring the past decade, the bank regulatory agencies have increasingly emphasized the importance of sound risk management processes and strong internal controls when evaluating the activities of the FDIC-insured institutions that they supervise. Properly managing risks has been identified as critical to the conduct of safe and sound banking activities and has become even more important as new technologies, product innovation, and the size and speed of financial transactions have changed the nature of banking markets. The agencies have identified a spectrum of risks facing a banking institution including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal and reputational risk. The key risk themes identified for 2023 are discussed under Item 1A - Risk Factors. The Bank is expected to have active board and senior management oversight; adequate policies, procedures and limits; adequate risk measurement, monitoring and management information systems; and comprehensive internal controls.\n\nPrivacy and Cybersecurity. The Bank is subject to many U.S. federal and state laws and regulations governing requirements for maintaining policies and procedures to protect non-public confidential information of their customers. These laws require the Bank to periodically disclose its privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and permit consumers to opt out of their ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. They also impact the Bank’s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. In addition, as a part of its operational risk mitigation, the Bank is required to implement a comprehensive information security program that \n\n19\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nincludes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information and to require the same of its service providers. These security and privacy policies and procedures are in effect across all business lines and geographic locations.\n\nBranching Authority**.** National banks headquartered in North Dakota, such as the Bank, have the same branching rights in North Dakota as banks chartered under North Dakota law, subject to OCC approval. North Dakota law grants North Dakota-chartered banks the authority to establish branches anywhere in the State of North Dakota, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals. The Dodd-Frank Act permits well-capitalized and well-managed banks to establish new branches across state lines without legal impediments. However, while Federal law permits state and national banks to merge with banks in other states, such mergers are subject to: (i) regulatory approval; (ii) federal and state deposit concentration limits; and (iii) state law limitations requiring the merging bank to have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) prior to the merger. \n\nFinancial Subsidiaries. Under federal law and OCC regulations, national banks are authorized to engage, through “financial subsidiaries,” in any activity that is permissible for a financial holding company and any activity that the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Federal Reserve, determines is financial in nature or incidental to any such financial activity, except (i) insurance underwriting, (ii) real estate development or real estate investment activities (unless otherwise permitted by law), (iii) insurance company portfolio investments and (iv) merchant banking. The authority of a national bank to invest in a financial subsidiary is subject to a number of conditions, including, among other things, requirements that the bank must be well-managed and well-capitalized (after deducting from capital the bank’s outstanding investments in financial subsidiaries). The Bank has not applied for approval to establish any financial subsidiaries.\n\nFederal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB, which serves as a central credit facility for its members. The FHLB is funded primarily from proceeds from the sale of obligations of the FHLB system. It makes loans to member banks in the form of FHLB advances. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully collateralized as determined by the FHLB.\n\nCommunity Reinvestment Act Requirements. The CRA requires the Bank to have a continuing and affirmative obligation in a safe and sound manner to help meet the credit needs of the entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Federal regulators regularly assess the Bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of its communities. Applications for acquisitions would be affected by the evaluation of the Bank’s effectiveness in meeting its CRA requirements. \n\nOn October 24, 2023, the bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to strengthen and modernize the CRA regulations (the “CRA Rule”). The CRA Rule is designed to update how CRA activities qualify for consideration, where CRA activities are considered, and how CRA activities are evaluated. More specifically, the bank regulatory agencies described the goals of the CRA Rule as follows: (i) to expand access to credit, investment, and basic banking services in low and moderate income communities; (ii) to adapt to changes in the banking industry, including mobile and internet banking by modernizing assessment areas while maintaining a focus on branch based areas; (iii) to provide greater clarity, consistency, and transparency in the application of the regulations through the use of standardized metrics as part of CRA evaluation and clarifying eligible CRA activities focused on low and moderate income communities and underserved rural communities; (iv) to tailor CRA rules and data collection to bank size and business model; and (v) to maintain a unified approach among the regulators. Management of the Bank is assessing the impact of the CRA Rule on its CRA lending and investment activities in its markets.\n\nAnti-Money Laundering. The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) is the common name for a series of laws and regulations enacted in the United States to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism. They are designed to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the U.S. financial system and have significant implications for FDIC-insured institutions and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The so-called Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (“AML/CFT”) regime under the BSA provides a foundation to promote financial transparency and deter and detect those who seek to misuse the U.S. financial system to launder criminal proceeds, finance terrorist acts or move funds for other illicit purposes.\n\n20\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe laws mandate financial services companies to have policies and procedures with respect to measures designed to address: (i) customer identification programs; (ii) money laundering; (iii) terrorist financing; (iv) identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions; (v) currency crimes; and (vi) cooperation between FDIC-insured institutions and law enforcement authorities.\n\nConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate. Concentration risk exists when FDIC-insured institutions deploy too many assets to any one industry or segment. A concentration in commercial real estate, or CRE, is one example of regulatory concern. The interagency Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices guidance, or CRE Guidance, provides supervisory criteria, including the following numerical indicators, to assist bank examiners in identifying banks with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: (i) CRE loans exceeding 300% of capital and increasing 50% or more in the preceding three years; or (ii) construction and land development loans exceeding 100% of capital. The CRE Guidance does not limit banks’ levels of CRE lending activities, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentrations. On December 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies issued a statement to reinforce prudent risk-management practices related to CRE lending, having observed substantial growth in many CRE asset and lending markets, increased competitive pressures, rising CRE concentrations in banks, and an easing of CRE underwriting standards. The federal bank agencies reminded FDIC-insured institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise prudent risk-management practices to identify, measure, monitor, and manage the risks arising from CRE lending. In addition, FDIC-insured institutions must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentration risk.\n\nBased on the Bank’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2023, the Company did not exceed the guidelines for CRE lending. \n\nConsumer Financial Services. The historical structure of federal consumer protection regulation applicable to all providers of consumer financial products and services changed significantly on July 21, 2011, when the CFPB commenced operations to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all providers of consumer products and services, including the Bank, as well as the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over providers with more than $10 billion in assets. FDIC-insured institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, like the Bank, continue to be examined by their applicable bank regulators. \n\nBecause abuses in connection with residential mortgages were a significant factor contributing to the global financial crisis, many rules issued by the CFPB, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act addressed mortgage and mortgage-related products, their underwriting, origination, servicing and sales. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded underwriting requirements applicable to loans secured by 1-4 family residential real property and augmented federal law combating predatory lending practices. In addition to numerous disclosure requirements, the Dodd-Frank Act and the CFPB’s enabling rules imposed new standards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders, including banks and savings associations, in an effort to strongly encourage lenders to verify a borrower’s ability to repay, while also establishing a presumption of compliance for certain “qualified mortgages.” The CFPB’s rules have not had a significant impact on the Bank’s operations, except for higher compliance costs.\n\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\n _Investing in the Company’s common stock involves a high degree of risk. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company are described below. Before you decide to invest, you should carefully review and consider the risks described below, together with all other information included in this report and other documents the Company files with the SEC. Any of the following risks, as well as risks that the Company does not know or currently deem immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects._\n\n21\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis is a summary of some of the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affects the Company. The list is not exhaustive but provides a high-level summary of some of the material risks that are further described in this Item 1A. The Company encourages you to read Item 1A in its entirety.\n\n**Market and Interest Rate Risks**\n\n●| Interest rate risks associated with the Company’s business;  \n---|---  \n●| fluctuations in the values of the securities held in the Company’s securities portfolio; and  \n---|---  \n●| governmental monetary, trade and fiscal policies.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Credit Risks**\n\n●| The Company’s ability to successfully manage credit risk, including in the commercial real estate portfolio, and maintain an adequate level of allowance for credit losses;  \n---|---  \n●| new or revised accounting standards;  \n---|---  \n●| business and economic conditions in the Company’s market areas;  \n---|---  \n●| the overall health of the local and national real estate market;  \n---|---  \n●| concentrations within the Company’s loan portfolio; and  \n---|---  \n●| the level of nonperforming assets on the Company’s balance sheet.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Operational, Strategic and Reputational Risks**\n\n●| The impact of economic or market conditions on the Company’s fee-based services;  \n---|---  \n●| the Company’s ability to implement organic and strategic acquisition growth strategies;  \n---|---  \n●| potential impairment to the goodwill the Company recorded in connection with the Company’s past acquisitions;  \n---|---  \n●| the Company’s ability to continue to grow retirement and benefit services business;  \n---|---  \n●| the Company’s ability to continue to originate a sufficient volume of residential mortgages to make the mortgage division profitable;  \n---|---  \n●| the occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of the Company’s information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents, including those employing artificial intelligence;  \n---|---  \n●| interruptions involving the Company’s information technology and telecommunications systems or third-party services;  \n---|---  \n●| potential losses incurred in connection with mortgage loan repurchases;  \n---|---  \n  \n22\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\n●| the composition of the Company’s executive management team and the Company’s ability to attract and retain key personnel;  \n---|---  \n●| labor shortages;  \n---|---  \n●| any material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting; and  \n---|---  \n●| severe weather, natural disasters, effects of climate change, widespread disease or pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, civil unrest or other adverse external events.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Liquidity and Funding Risks**\n\n●| The Company’s ability to successfully manage liquidity risk, including the Company’s need to access higher cost sources of funds such as fed funds purchased and short-term borrowings;  \n---|---  \n●| concentrations of large depositors who may have deposits above the FDIC insurance limit; and  \n---|---  \n●| the Company’s dependence on dividends from the Bank.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Legal, Accounting and Compliance Risks**\n\n●| The effectiveness of the Company’s risk management framework;  \n---|---  \n●| the commencement and outcome of litigation and other legal proceedings and regulatory actions against the Company or to which the Company may become subject;  \n---|---  \n●| the extensive regulatory framework that applies to us; and  \n---|---  \n●| the impact of recent and future legislative and regulatory changes.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Market and Interest Rate Risks**\n\nThe Company’s business is subject to interest rate risk, and fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect the Company’s earnings.\n\nFluctuations in interest rates may negatively affect the Company’s business and may weaken demand for some of the Company’s products. The Company’s earnings and cash flows are dependent, in part, on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that the Company earns on interest earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest expense that the Company pays on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in interest rates might also impact the values of equity and debt securities under management and administration by the retirement and benefit services and wealth management businesses which may have a negative impact on the Company’s fee income. Additionally, changes in interest rates also affect the Company’s ability to fund operations with client deposits and the fair value of securities in the Company’s investment portfolio. Therefore, any change in general market interest rates, including changes in federal fiscal and monetary policies, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \n\nIt is currently expected that during 2024, and perhaps beyond, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve, or FOMC, will continue to monitor interest rates, in part to reduce the rate of inflation to its preferred level. In 2023, the FOMC increased at various dates throughout the year the target range for the federal funds rate from 4.25% to 4.50% to a range of 5.25% to 5.50%. All of these increases were expressly made in response to inflationary pressures. If the FOMC further increases the targeted federal funds rates, overall interest rates likely will rise, which may negatively impact the entire national economy. In addition, the Company’s net interest income could be adversely affected if the rates the Company pays on deposits and borrowings increase more rapidly than the rates the Company \n\n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nearns on loans and other assets. Rising interest rates also may reduce the demand for loans and the value of fixed-rate investment securities. These effects from interest rate changes or from other sustained economic stress or a recession, among other matters, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\n\nThe Company’s interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate prior to changes in broader market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind. The result of these changes to rates may cause differing spreads on interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The Company cannot control or accurately predict changes in market rates of interest. As a result of the recent interest rate increases, the Company has experienced net interest margin compression as the Company’s interest-earning assets have repriced slower than the Company’s interest-bearing liabilities, which has had a material adverse effect on the Company’s net interest income and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, the Company could be prevented from increasing the interest rates charged on loans or from maintaining the interest rates offered on deposits and money market savings accounts due to “price” competition from other banks and financial institutions with which the Company competes. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $728.1 million of non-maturity, noninterest bearing deposit accounts and $2.0 billion of non-maturity interest bearing deposit accounts. Interest rates for interest-bearing accounts have, throughout 2023, increased in response to a series of increases made by the Federal Reserve in the targeted fed funds rate and market competition. The Company does not know what market rates will be throughout 2024. In 2023, the Company has offered higher interest rates to maintain current clients or attract new clients, and as a result, interest expense has increased in recent periods and may increase further, perhaps materially. If the Company fails to offer interest at a sufficient level to keep these non-maturity deposits, core deposits may be reduced, which would require the Company to obtain funding in other ways or risk slowing future asset growth.\n\nThe Company could recognize losses on securities held in the Company’s securities portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the Company’s securities portfolio was approximately $745.4 million, or 19.1% of total assets. Factors beyond the Company’s control can significantly influence and cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of securities in the Company’s portfolio. For example, fixed-rate securities acquired by the Company are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities or the Company’s own analysis of the value of the securities, defaults by the issuers or individual mortgagors with respect to the underlying securities and instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors, as well as changing economic and market conditions or other factors, could cause write-downs and realized or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. The process for determining whether a write-down is required usually requires complex, subjective judgments, which could subsequently prove to have been wrong, about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer, the fair value of any collateral underlying the security and whether and the extent to which the principal and interest on the security will ultimately be paid in accordance with its payment terms. \n\nA large percentage of the Company’s investment securities classified as available-for-sale has fixed interest rates. As is the case with many financial institutions, the Company’s emphasis on increasing the development of core deposits, those with no stated maturity date, has resulted in the Company’s interest-bearing liabilities having a shorter duration than interest-earning assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because interest rates change over time. As interest rates have increased, the Company’s cost of funds has increased more rapidly than the yields on a substantial portion of the Company’s interest-earning assets. In addition, the market value of the Company’s fixed-rate assets, for example, investment securities, has declined in recent periods. In line with the foregoing, the Company has experienced and may continue to experience an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities primarily due to raising the rates the Company pays on some of its deposit products to stay competitive within the Company’s market and an increase in borrowing costs from increases in the federal funds rate.\n\n24\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had $139.1 million of unrealized losses in its securities portfolio. If the Company is forced to liquidate any of those investments prior to maturity, including because of a lack of liquidity, it would recognize as a charge to earnings the losses attributable to those securities. The Company’s securities portfolio has a weighted average effective duration of 5.0 years, so the Company expects an increase in realized losses if interest rates remain elevated or continue to increase in 2024.\n\nMonetary policies of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn the current environment, economic and business conditions are significantly affected by U.S. monetary policy, particularly the actions of the Federal Reserve in its effort to fight elevated levels of inflation. The Federal Reserve is mandated to pursue the goals of maximum employment and price stability and, throughout 2022 and 2023, made a series of significant increases to the target Federal Funds rate as part of an effort to combat elevated levels of inflation affecting the U.S. economy. This has helped drive a significant increase in prevailing interest rates, however it has had a negative effect on the Company’s net interest income and has harmed the value of the Company’s securities portfolio, which had $98.0 million in unrealized losses in available-for-sale investment securities at December 31, 2023. This decline in value has negatively affected the Company’s tangible book value. Higher interest rates can also negatively affect the Company’s customers’ businesses and financial condition, and the value of collateral securing loans in the Company’s portfolio.\n\nGiven the complex factors affecting the strength of the U.S. economy, including uncertainties regarding the persistence of inflation, geopolitical developments such as the ongoing conflicts between Israel and Palestine and between Russia and Ukraine and resulting disruptions in the global energy market, and tight labor market conditions and supply chain issues, there is a meaningful risk that the Federal Reserve and other central banks may raise interest rates too much, thereby limiting economic growth and potentially causing an economic recession or other political instability. As noted above, this could decrease loan demand, harm the credit characteristics of the Company’s existing loan portfolio and decrease the value of collateral securing loans in the portfolio.\n\nThe Company cannot guarantee that its stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.\n\nOn December 12, 2023, the Company’s board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program, which became effective on February 18, 2024, and which authorizes the Company to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of its common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions. The new stock repurchase program replaced and superseded the previous 770,000 share stock repurchase program, under which approximately 413,526 shares remained. The new stock repurchase program will expire on February 18, 2027. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any shares of its common stock, and other than repurchases that have been completed to date, there is no assurance that the Company will do so or that the Company will repurchase shares at favorable prices. The repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even if fully implemented, the repurchase program may not enhance long-term stockholder value.\n\n**Credit Risks**\n\nThe Company’s business depends on its ability to manage credit risk.\n\nAs a bank, the Company’s business requires it to manage credit risk; however, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect, such as fraud, or difficult to predict, such as catastrophic events affecting certain industries. As a lender, the Company is exposed to the risk that its borrowers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms, and that the collateral securing repayment of their loans, if any, may not be sufficient to ensure repayment. In addition, there are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid, proper loan underwriting, changes in economic and industry conditions, and inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, including the risk that a borrower may not provide information to the Company about its business in a timely manner, or may present inaccurate or incomplete information to the Company, as well as risks relating to the value of collateral. To manage credit risk, the Company must, among other actions, maintain \n\n25\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\ndisciplined and prudent underwriting standards and ensure that the Company’s bankers follow those standards. The weakening of these standards for any reason, such as an attempt to attract higher yielding loans, a lack of discipline or diligence by the Company’s employees in underwriting and monitoring loans, or the Company’s inability to adequately adapt policies and procedures to changes in economic, or any other conditions affecting borrowers and the quality of the Company’s loan portfolio, may result in loan defaults, foreclosures, and charge-offs and may necessitate that the Company significantly increases the allowance for credit losses, each of which could adversely affect net income. As a result, the Company’s inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\n\nThe Company’s allowance for credit losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb potential losses in its loan portfolio.\n\nThe Company establishes and maintains its allowance for credit losses at a level that management considers adequate to absorb current expected credit losses based on an analysis of the Company’s loan portfolio and current market environment. The allowance for credit losses represents the Company’s estimate of expected losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based upon relevant information available at such time. The allowance contains provisions for expected losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships, as well as expected losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are not specifically identified. Additions to the allowance for credit losses, which are charged to earnings through the provision for credit losses, are determined based on a variety of factors, including an analysis of the loan portfolio, historical loss experience and an evaluation of current economic conditions in the Company’s market area. The actual amount of credit losses is affected by, among other things, changes in economic, operating, and other conditions within the Company’s markets, which may be beyond the Company’s control, and such losses may exceed current estimates. \n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.30%, and as a percentage of total nonperforming loans was 410.3%. Although management believes that the allowance for credit losses was adequate on such date to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible, losses in excess of the existing allowance will reduce net income and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. The Company may also be required to take additional provisions for loan losses in the future to further supplement the allowance for credit losses, either due to management’s assessment that the allowance is inadequate or as required by the Company’s banking regulators. The Company’s banking regulators periodically review the Company’s allowance for credit losses and the value attributed to nonaccrual loans or to real estate acquired through foreclosure and may require the Company to adjust its determination of the value for these items. These adjustments may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nA decline in the business and economic conditions in the Company’s market areas could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe Company’s business activities and credit exposure, including real estate collateral for many of its loans, are concentrated in North Dakota, Minnesota and Arizona, although the Company also pursues business opportunities nationally. As of December 31, 2023, 89.4% of the loans in the Company’s loan portfolio were made to borrowers who live in or conduct business in those states. This concentration imposes risks from lack of geographic diversification. Weak economic conditions in North Dakota, Minnesota or Arizona may affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects, where adverse economic developments, among other things, could affect the volume of loan originations, increase the level of nonperforming assets, increase the rate of foreclosure losses on loans and reduce the value of the Company’s loans and loan servicing portfolio. Weak economic conditions are characterized by, among other indicators, state and local government deficits, deflation, elevated levels of unemployment, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, increased delinquencies on mortgage, consumer and commercial loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity. Any regional or local economic downturn that affects North Dakota, Minnesota or Arizona or existing or prospective borrowers or property values in such areas may affect the Company and the Company’s profitability more significantly and more adversely than the Company’s competitors whose operations are less geographically concentrated. Further, a general economic slowdown could decrease the value of the assets under administration, or AUA, and assets under management, or AUM, of the Company’s retirement and benefit services and wealth management businesses resulting in \n\n26\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nlower fee income, and clients could potentially seek alternative investment opportunities with other providers, which could also result in lower fee income to us. The Company’s business is also significantly affected by monetary, trade and other regulatory policies of the U.S. federal government, its agencies and government-sponsored entities. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond the Company’s control, are difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nContinued elevated levels of inflation could adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe United States has recently experienced elevated levels of inflation, with the consumer price index climbing approximately 3.4% in 2023. Continued elevated levels of inflation could have complex effects on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, some of which could be materially adverse. For example, while the Company generally expects any inflation-related increases in the Company’s interest expense to be offset by increases in interest income, inflation-driven increases in the Company’s levels of noninterest expense could negatively impact results of operations. Continued elevated levels of inflation could also cause increased volatility and uncertainty in the business environment, which could adversely affect loan demand and the Company’s clients’ ability to repay indebtedness. It is possible that governmental responses to the current inflation environment, such as changes to monetary and fiscal policy that are too strict, or the imposition or threatened imposition of price controls, could adversely affect the Company’s business. The duration and severity of the current inflationary period cannot be estimated with precision.\n\nBecause a significant portion of the Company’s loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans, negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity, as well as environmental factors, could impair the value of collateral securing the Company’s real estate loans and result in loan and other losses.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, approximately 77.5% of the Company’s total loan portfolio was comprised of loans with real estate as a primary component of collateral. The repayment of such loans is highly dependent on the ability of the borrowers to meet their loan repayment obligations to us, which can be adversely affected by economic downturns that can lead to (i) declines in the rents or decreases in occupancy and, therefore, in the cash flows generated by those real properties on which the borrowers depend to fund their loan payments to us, (ii) decreases in the values of those real properties, which make it more difficult for the borrowers to sell those real properties for amounts sufficient to repay their loans in full, and (iii) job losses of residential home buyers, which makes it more difficult for these borrowers to fund their loan payments. As a result, adverse developments affecting real estate values in the Company’s market areas could increase the credit risk associated with the Company’s real estate loan portfolio. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of interest rates and market conditions in the area in which the real estate is located and some of these values have been negatively affected by the recent rise in prevailing interest rates. Adverse changes affecting real estate values, including decreases in office occupancy due to the shift to remote working environments following the COVID-19 pandemic, and the liquidity of real estate in one or more of the Company’s markets could increase the credit risk associated with the Company’s loan portfolio, significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect the Company’s ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses or the Company’s ability to sell those loans on the secondary market. Such declines and losses would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. If real estate values decline, it is also more likely that the Company would be required to increase the Company’s allowance for credit losses, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, adverse weather events, including tornados, wildfires, flooding, and mudslides, can cause damage to the property pledged as collateral on loans, which could result in additional losses upon a foreclosure.\n\nIn addition, if hazardous or toxic substances are found on properties pledged as collateral, the value of the real estate could be impaired. If the Company forecloses on and takes title to such properties, the Company may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require the Company to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property’s value or limit the Company’s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or \n\n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nenforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the Company’s exposure to environmental liability. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nMany of the Company’s loans are to commercial borrowers, which have a higher degree of risk than other types of loans.\n\nCommercial and industrial loans represented 21.7% of the Company’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2023. These loans are often larger and involve greater risks than other types of lending. Because payments on such loans are often dependent on the successful operation of the business involved, repayment of such loans is often more sensitive than other types of loans to the general business climate and economy. Accordingly, a challenging business and economic environment generally, or in certain industries, may increase the Company’s risk related to commercial loans. In the current economic environment, the cumulative effects of rising inflation, labor shortages and supply chain constraints and the threat of a recession may adversely affect commercial and industrial loans, especially if general economic conditions worsen. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrowers’ ability to make repayment from their employment and other income and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial loans typically are made on the basis of the borrowers’ ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the commercial venture. The Company’s commercial and industrial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the collateral underlying the loans. Most often, this collateral consists of accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Inventory and equipment may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. If the cash flow from business operations is reduced, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Due to the larger average size of each commercial loan as compared with other loans such as residential loans, as well as collateral that is generally less readily-marketable, losses incurred on a small number of commercial loans could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe Company’s loan portfolio has a large concentration of commercial real estate loans, which involve risks specific to real estate values and the health of the real estate market generally.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $1.3 billion of commercial real estate loans, consisting of $569.4 million of non-owner occupied loans, $271.6 million of owner occupied loans, $245.1 million of loans secured by multifamily residential properties, $124.0 million of construction and land development loans and $40.1 million of loans secured by farmland. Commercial real estate loans represented 45.3% of the Company’s total loan portfolio and 353.4% of the Bank’s total capital at December 31, 2023. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of interest rates and market conditions in the area in which the real estate is located and some of these values have been negatively affected by the recent rise in prevailing interest rates. Adverse developments affecting real estate values in the Company’s market areas could increase the credit risk associated with the Company’s loan portfolio. Additionally, the repayment of commercial real estate loans generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic events, including decreases in office occupancy due to the shift to remote working environments following the COVID-19 pandemic, or governmental regulations outside of the control of the borrower or lender could negatively impact the future cash flow and market values of the affected properties. If the loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled during a time when market conditions are declining or have declined, then the Company may not be able to realize the full value of the collateral that the Company anticipated at the time of originating the loan, which could force the Company to take charge-offs or require the Company to increase the Company’s provision for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nConstruction and land development loans are based upon estimates of costs and values associated with the complete project. These estimates may be inaccurate, and the Company may be exposed to significant losses on loans for these projects.\n\nConstruction and land development loans comprised approximately 4.5% of the Company’s total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2023. Such lending involves additional risks because funds are advanced upon the security of the \n\n28\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nproject, which is of uncertain value prior to its completion, and costs may exceed realizable values in declining real estate markets. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs and the realizable market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. As a result, construction and land development loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If the Company’s appraisal of the value of the completed project proves to be overstated or market values or rental rates decline, the Company may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project. If the Company is forced to foreclose on a project prior to or at completion due to a default, the Company may not be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs. In addition, the Company may be required to fund additional amounts to complete the project and may have to hold the property for an unspecified period of time while the Company attempts to dispose of it.\n\nThe Company’s concentration of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans may result in lower yields and profitability.\n\nOne-to-four family residential mortgage loans comprised $726.9 million and $679.6 million, or 26.3% and 27.8%, of the Company’s loan portfolio at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These loans are secured primarily by properties located in the states of Minnesota, North Dakota and Arizona. These loans generally have lower yields relative to other loan categories within the Company’s loan portfolio. While these loans may possess higher yields than investment securities, their repayment characteristics are not as well defined, and they generally possess a higher degree of interest rate risk versus other loans and investment securities within the Company’s portfolio. This increased interest rate risk is due to the repayment and prepayment options inherent in residential mortgage loans which are exercised by borrowers based upon the overall level of interest rates. These residential mortgage loans are generally made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayments from his or her employment and the value of the property securing the loan. Thus, as a result, repayment of these loans is also subject to general economic and employment conditions within the communities and surrounding areas where the property is located.\n\nA decline in residential real estate market prices or home sales has the potential to adversely affect the Company’s one-to-four family residential mortgage portfolio in several ways, such as a decrease in collateral values and an increase in non-performing loans, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nNonperforming assets take significant time and resources to resolve and adversely affect the Company’s net interest income.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s nonperforming loans (which consist of nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more) totaled $8.7 million, or 0.32% of the Company’s total loan portfolio, and the Company’s nonperforming assets (which consist of nonperforming loans, foreclosed assets and other real estate owned) totaled $8.8 million, or 0.32% of total assets. In addition, the Company had $3.4 million of accruing loans that were 31-89 days delinquent as of December 31, 2023. \n\nThe Company’s nonperforming assets adversely affect net interest income in various ways. The Company does not record interest income on nonaccrual loans or foreclosed assets, thereby adversely affecting net income and returns on assets and equity. When the Company takes collateral in foreclosure and similar proceedings, the Company is required to mark the collateral to its then-fair market value, which may result in a loss. These nonperforming loans and foreclosed assets also increase the Company’s risk profile and the level of capital the Company’s regulators believe is appropriate for the Company to maintain in light of such risks. The resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant time commitments from management, which increases the Company’s loan administration costs and adversely affects its efficiency ratio and can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities, and may also involve additional financial resources. If the Company experiences increases in nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets, net interest income may be negatively impacted and the Company’s loan administration costs \n\n29\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\ncould increase, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe Company’s high concentration of large loans to certain borrowers may increase the Company’s credit risk.\n\nThe Company has developed relationships with certain individuals and businesses that have resulted in a concentration of large loans to a small number of borrowers. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s 10 largest borrowing relationships accounted for approximately 6.1% of the total loan portfolio. The Company has established an informal, internal limit on loans to one borrower, principal or guarantor, but the Company may, under certain circumstances, consider going above this internal limit in situations where management’s understanding of the industry, the borrower’s business and the credit quality of the borrower are commensurate with the increased size of the loan. Along with other risks inherent in these loans, such as the deterioration of the underlying businesses or property securing these loans, this high concentration of borrowers presents a risk to the Company’s lending operations. If any one of these borrowers becomes unable to repay its loan obligations as a result of business, economic or market conditions, or personal circumstances, such as divorce or death, the Company’s nonaccruing loans and the Company’s provision for loan losses could increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \n\nThe small to midsized businesses that the Company lends to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business developments, which may impair their ability to repay their loans.\n\nThe Company lends to small to midsized businesses, which generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities, frequently have smaller market share than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair their ability to repay their loans. In addition, the success of a small and midsized business often depends on the management talents and efforts of a small number of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay its loan. If general economic conditions negatively impact the markets in which the Company operates and small to midsized businesses are adversely affected or the Company’s borrowers are otherwise affected by adverse business developments, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected.\n\nReal estate market volatility and future changes in the Company’s disposition strategies could result in net proceeds that differ significantly from the Company’s foreclosed asset fair value appraisals.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had no foreclosed assets, which typically consist of properties that the Company obtains through foreclosure. Assets acquired through loan foreclosure are included in other assets and are initially recorded at estimated fair value less estimated selling costs. The estimated fair value of foreclosed assets is evaluated regularly and any decreases in value along with holding costs, such as taxes, insurance and utilities, are reported in noninterest expense. \n\nIn response to market conditions and other economic factors, the Company may utilize alternative sale strategies other than orderly disposition as part of the Company’s foreclosed asset disposition strategy, such as immediate liquidation sales. In this event, as a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized from such sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales and other estimates used to determine the fair value of the Company’s foreclosed assets.\n\nThe Company’s exposure to home equity lines of credit may increase the potential for loss.\n\nThe Company’s mortgage loan portfolio consists, in part, of home equity lines of credit. A large portion of home equity lines of credit are originated in conjunction with the origination of first mortgage loans eligible for sale in the secondary market, which the Company typically does not service if the loan is sold. By not servicing the first mortgage loans, the Company is unable to track the delinquency status which may indicate whether such loans are at risk \n\n30\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nof foreclosure by others. In addition, home equity lines of credit are initially offered as “revolving” lines of credit whereby the borrowers are only required to make scheduled interest payments during the initial terms of the loans, which is generally five or ten years. Thereafter, the borrowers no longer have the ability to make principal draws from the lines and the loans convert to a fully-amortizing basis, requiring scheduled principal and interest payments sufficient to repay the loans within a certain period of time, which is generally 15 or 20 years. The conversion of a home equity line of credit to a fully amortizing basis presents an increased level of default risk to the Company since the borrower no longer has the ability to make principal draws on the line, and the amount of the required monthly payment could substantially increase to provide for scheduled repayment of principal and interest. As of December 31, 2023, the unfunded commitment related to home equity lines of credit was $216.1 million.\n\n**Operational, Strategic and Reputational Risks**\n\nNoninterest income represents a significant portion of the Company’s total revenue and may be negatively impacted by changes in economic or market conditions and competition.\n\nA significant portion of the Company’s revenue results from fee-based services provided by the retirement and benefit services business. This contrasts with many other community and regional banks that rely more heavily on interest-based sources of revenue, such as loans and investment securities. For the year ended December 31, 2023, noninterest income represented approximately 47.7% of the Company’s total revenue, which includes net interest income and noninterest income, a significant portion of which is derived from the Company’s retirement and benefit services business. This fee income business presents special risks not borne by other institutions that focus exclusively on banking. The level of these fees is influenced by several factors, including the number of plans and participants the Company provides retirement, advisory and other services for, the level of transactions within the plans, and the asset values of the plans whose fees are earned based on the level of assets in the plans. If the Company is unable to maintain the Company’s number of plans, participants and AUA and AUM at historical or greater levels, the Company’s fee income derived from this business may decline. For example, in a typical year the Company expects to experience outflows in AUA and AUM due to withdrawals, client turnover, plan terminations, mergers and acquisition activity. In 2023, the Company experienced outflows of $4.8 billion in the Company’s retirement and benefit services division partially offset by inflows of $4.5 billion.\n\nIn addition, economic, market or other factors that reduce the level or rates of savings in or with the Company’s clients, either through reductions in financial asset valuations or through changes in investor preferences, could materially reduce the Company’s fee revenue. The financial markets and businesses operating in the securities industry are highly volatile (meaning that performance results can vary greatly within short periods of time) and are directly affected by, among other factors, domestic and foreign economic conditions and general trends in business and finance, all of which are beyond the Company’s control. the Company cannot assure you that broad market performance will be favorable in the future. Declines in the financial markets or a lack of sustained growth may result in a corresponding decline in the Company’s performance and may adversely affect the value of the assets that the Company manages. A general economic slowdown could decrease the value of the AUA and AUM in the Company’s retirement and benefit services and wealth management businesses and result in clients potentially seeking alternative investment opportunities with other providers, which could result in lower fee income to the Company.\n\nEven when economic and market conditions are generally favorable, the Company’s investment performance may be adversely affected by the investment style of the Company’s asset managers and the particular investments that they make. To the extent the Company’s future investment performance is perceived to be poor in either relative or absolute terms, the revenues and profitability of the Company’s wealth management business will likely be reduced and the Company’s ability to attract new clients will likely be impaired. In addition, the Company’s management contracts generally provide for fee payments for wealth management and trust services based on the market value of AUM. Because most contracts provide for a fee based on market values of securities, fluctuations in the underlying securities values may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s revenue. Fee compression due to competitive pressures has resulted in and continues to result in significant pressure to reduce the fees the Company charges for the Company’s services in both the retirement and benefit services and wealth management businesses.\n\n31\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe Company may not be successful in implementing the Company’s organic growth strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nPart of the Company’s business strategy is to focus on organic growth, which includes leveraging the Company’s business lines across the Company’s entire client base, enhancing brand awareness and building the Company’s infrastructure. The success of the Company’s organic growth strategy depends on the Company’s ability to increase loans, deposits, AUM and AUA at acceptable risk levels without incurring offsetting increases in noninterest expense. The Company may not be successful in generating organic growth if the Company fails to effectively execute the Company’s integrated One Alerus strategy, or as a result of other factors, including delays in introducing and implementing new products and services and other impediments resulting from regulatory oversight or lack of qualified personnel at the Company’s office locations. In addition, the success of the Company’s organic growth strategy will depend on maintaining sufficient regulatory capital levels and on favorable economic conditions in the Company’s primary market areas. Failure to adequately manage the risks associated with the Company’s anticipated organic growth could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nIn addition to the Company’s organic growth strategy, it intends to expand business by acquiring other banks and financial services companies, but may not be successful in doing so, either because of an inability to find suitable acquisition candidates, constrained capital resources or otherwise.\n\nWhile a key element of the Company’s business strategy is to grow the Company’s banking franchise and increase the Company’s market share through organic growth, the Company intends to take advantage of opportunities to acquire other banks and financial services companies, including wealth management and retirement administration businesses, as such opportunities present themselves. For example, in the third quarter of 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of MPB BHC, Inc., holding company for Metro Phoenix Bank in Phoenix, Arizona. Although the Company intends to continue to grow its business through organic growth and strategic acquisitions, because certain of the Company’s market areas are comprised of mature, rural communities with limited population growth, the Company anticipates that much of its future growth will be dependent on the Company’s ability to successfully implement the Company’s acquisition growth strategy. However, the Company may not be able to identify suitable acquisition targets, or may not succeed in seizing such opportunities when they arise or in integrating any such banks or financial service companies within the Company’s existing business framework following acquisition. In addition, even if suitable targets are identified, the Company expects to compete for such businesses with other potential bidders, many of which may have greater financial resources than the Company, which may adversely affect the Company’s ability to make acquisitions at attractive prices. The Company’s ability to execute on acquisition opportunities may require the Company to raise additional capital and to increase the Company’s capital position to support the growth of the Company’s franchise. It will also depend on market conditions over which the Company has no control. Moreover, certain acquisitions may require the approval of the Company’s bank regulators, and the Company may not be able to obtain such approvals on acceptable terms, if at all.\n\nIf the Company pursues additional strategic acquisitions, it may expose the Company to financial, execution and operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nSince 2000, the Company has experienced significant growth, both organically and through acquisitions of banks and other financial service providers, including wealth management and retirement administration businesses. The Company plans to continue to grow its business by executing additional strategic acquisitions of all or parts of other banks or financial institutions or through the hiring of teams of employees that fit within the Company’s overall strategy and that the Company believes make financial and strategic sense. These acquisitions may result in the Company entering new markets.\n\nIf the Company grows through acquisitions, it may expose the Company to financial, execution and operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations and \n\n32\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\ngrowth prospects. Acquiring other banks and financial service providers involve risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including:\n\n●| Potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the banks and businesses the Company acquires;  \n---|---  \n●| exposure to potential asset and credit quality issues of the acquired bank or related business;  \n---|---  \n●| difficulty and expense of integrating the operations, culture and personnel of banks and businesses the Company acquires, including higher than expected deposit attrition;  \n---|---  \n●| potential disruption to the Company’s business;  \n---|---  \n●| potential restrictions on the Company’s business resulting from the regulatory approval process;  \n---|---  \n●| an inability to realize the expected revenue increases, costs savings, market presence or other anticipated benefits;  \n---|---  \n●| potential diversion of the Company’s management’s time and attention; and  \n---|---  \n●| the possible loss of key employees and clients of the banks and businesses the Company acquires.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition to the foregoing, the Company may face additional risks in acquisitions to the extent the Company acquires new lines of business or new products, or enter new geographic areas, in which the Company has little or no current experience, especially if the Company loses key employees of the acquired operations. If the Company hires a new team of employees, the Company may incur additional expenses relating to their compensation without any guarantee that such new team will be successful in generating new business. In addition, if the Company later determines that the value of an acquired business has decreased and that the related goodwill is impaired, an impairment of goodwill charge to earnings would be recognized.\n\nAcquisitions involve inherent uncertainty and the Company cannot assure you that it will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. The Company’s inability to overcome risks associated with acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe Company’s retirement and benefit services business relies on acquisitions to maintain and grow the Company’s AUA and AUM.\n\nIn 2023, the Company’s retirement and benefit services business experienced outflows of AUA and AUM of $4.8 billion, due to withdrawals, client turnover, plan terminations, and mergers and acquisition activity. the Company believes this level of runoff is typical in the industry. To maintain and grow this business, the Company believes it needs to be an active acquirer and seek to complete acquisitions of retirement administration providers if the Company is able to find quality acquisition opportunities. If the Company is unable to source a pipeline of potential acquisitions of companies that it determines are a good strategic fit for the Company, the Company’s retirement and benefit services business may fail to grow or even shrink, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nIf the Company is unable to continue to originate residential real estate loans and sell them into the secondary market for a profit, the Company’s noninterest income could decrease.\n\nThe Company derives a portion of its noninterest income from the origination of residential real estate loans and the subsequent sale of such loans into the secondary market. If the Company is unable to continue to originate and sell residential real estate loans at historical or greater levels, the Company’s residential real estate loan volume would decrease, which could decrease the Company’s earnings. A rising interest rate environment, general economic \n\n33\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nconditions, market volatility or other factors beyond the Company’s control could adversely affect the Company’s ability to originate residential real estate loans. Mortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of mortgage interest rates and real estate and refinancing activity. In a lower interest rate environment, the demand for mortgage loans and refinancing activity will tend to increase. This has the effect of increasing fee income but could adversely impact the estimated fair value of the Company’s mortgage servicing rights as the rate of loan prepayments increase. In a higher interest rate environment, the demand for mortgage loans and refinancing activity will generally be lower. This has the effect of decreasing fee income opportunities. As a result of the current rising interest rate environment, the Company saw continued lower demand for mortgage loans and refinancing activity in 2023. In 2023, the Company originated $364.1 million of mortgage loans, compared to $812.3 million in 2022. The Company expects this trend to continue in 2024.\n\nThe financial services industry is experiencing an increase in regulatory and compliance requirements related to mortgage loan originations necessitating technology upgrades and other changes. If new regulations continue to increase and the Company is unable to make technology upgrades, the Company’s ability to originate mortgage loans will be reduced or eliminated. Additionally, the Company sells a large portion of its residential real estate loans to third party investors, and rising interest rates could negatively affect the Company’s ability to generate suitable profits on the sale of such loans. If interest rates increase after the Company originates the loans, the Company’s ability to market those loans is impaired as the profitability on the loans decreases. These fluctuations can have an adverse effect on the revenue the Company generates from residential real estate loans and in certain instances, could result in a loss on the sale of the loans.\n\nIn addition, a prolonged period of illiquidity in the secondary mortgage market, coupled with an increase in interest rates, could reduce the demand for residential mortgage loans and increase investor yield requirements for those loans. As a result, the Company may be at higher risk of retaining a larger portion of mortgage loans than in other environments until they are sold to investors. Any reduction of loan production volumes could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of the Company’s information security controls or cybersecurity related incidents could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nAs a financial institution, the Company is susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against the Company, its clients or third parties with whom the Company interacts, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to the Company or its clients, disclosure or misuse of the Company’s information or its client information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against the Company’s clients, litigation or damage to the Company’s reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by the Company or its clients, denial or degradation of service attacks and malware or other cyber-attacks.\n\nIn recent periods, there continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts and as a result of increasingly sophisticated methods of conducting cyber attacks, including those employing artificial intelligence. Consistent with industry trends, the Company has also experienced an increase in attempted electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cybersecurity related incidents in recent periods. Moreover, in recent periods, several large corporations, including retail companies, financial institutions and third party vendors specializing in providing services to financial institutions, including MOVEit and First American Financial, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their clients and employees and subjecting them to potential fraudulent activity. The Company is not aware of having experienced any misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information having a material impact on the Company as a result of a direct cyber security breach or other act on the Bank; however, some of the Company’s clients and third party vendors may have been affected by such breaches, which could increase their risks of identity theft and other fraudulent activity that could involve client accounts at the Bank.\n\n34\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nInformation pertaining to the Company and its clients is maintained, and transactions are executed, on networks and systems maintained by the Company and certain third-party partners, such as the Company’s online banking, mobile banking, record-keeping or accounting systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect the Company and the Company’s clients against fraud and security breaches and to maintain the confidence of the Company’s clients. Breaches of information security also may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to the Company’s systems or the confidential information of the Company’s clients, including employees. In addition, increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third party technologies (including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that the Company uses to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, the Company’s clients and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by the Company’s clients to access the Company’s systems. The Company’s third party partners’ inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in a number of negative events, including losses to the Company or its clients, loss of business or clients, damage to the Company’s reputation, the incurrence of additional expenses, disruption to the Company’s business, additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties or the Company’s exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nIssues with the use of artificial intelligence in our marketplace may result in reputational harm or liability, or could otherwise adversely affect the Company’s business.\n\n​\n\nArtificial intelligence, including generative artificial intelligence, is or may be enabled by or integrated into the Company’s products or those developed by its third party partners. As with many developing technologies, artificial intelligence presents risks and challenges that could affect its further development, adoption, and use, and therefore our business. Artificial intelligence algorithms may be flawed, for example datasets may contain biased information or otherwise be insufficient, and inappropriate or controversial data practices could impair the acceptance of artificial intelligence solutions and result in burdensome new regulations. If the analyses of those products incorporating artificial intelligence assist in producing for the Company or its third party partners are deficient, biased or inaccurate, the Company could be subject to competitive harm, potential legal liability and brand or reputational harm. The use of artificial intelligence may also present ethical issues. If the Company or its third party partners offer artificial intelligence enabled products that are controversial because of their purported or real impact on human rights, privacy, or other issues, the Company may experience competitive harm, potential legal liability and brand or reputational harm. In addition, the Company expects that governments will continue to assess and implement new laws and regulations concerning the use of artificial intelligence, which may affect or impair the usability or efficiency of products and services and those developed by the Company’s third party partners.\n\n​\n\nThe Company depends on information technology and telecommunications systems, and any systems failures, interruptions or data breaches involving these systems could adversely affect the Company’s operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company’s business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of its information technology and telecommunications systems, third party servicers, accounting systems, mobile and online banking platforms and financial intermediaries. The risks resulting from use of these systems result from a variety of factors, both internal and external. The Company is vulnerable to the impact of failures of its systems to operate as needed or intended. Such failures could include those resulting from human error, unexpected transaction volumes, intentional attacks or overall design or performance issues.\n\nThe Company outsources to third parties many of its major systems, such as data processing and mobile and online banking. In addition, the Company partners with a leading financial technology company to create an online account portal that integrates the Company’s diverse product applications into a user-friendly experience for the Company’s consumer clients. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt the Company’s operations. Because the Company’s information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems, the Company \n\n35\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\ncould experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. A system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of the Company’s ability to process loans or gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise the Company’s ability to operate effectively, result in potential noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations, damage the Company’s reputation, result in a loss of client business or subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, failures of third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or fraud or misconduct on the part of employees of any of these third parties, could disrupt the Company’s operations or adversely affect its reputation.\n\nIt may be difficult for the Company to replace some of its third-party vendors, particularly vendors providing the Company’s core banking and information services, in a timely manner if they are unwilling or unable to provide the Company with these services in the future for any reason and even if the Company is able to replace them, it may be at higher cost or result in the loss of clients. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe Company’s operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of information and the monitoring of a large number of transactions on a minute-by-minute basis, and even a short interruption in service could have significant consequences. The Company also interacts with and relies on retailers, for whom the Company processes transactions, as well as financial counterparties and regulators. Each of these third parties may be targets of the same types of fraudulent activity, computer break-ins and other cybersecurity breaches described above, including those employing artificial intelligence, and the cybersecurity measures that they maintain to mitigate the risk of such activity may be different than the Company’s own and may be inadequate.\n\nBecause financial entities and technology systems are becoming more interdependent and complex, a cyber incident, information breach or loss, or technology failure that compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including ourselves. As a result of the foregoing, the Company’s ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to the Company or to third parties with whom the Company interacts.\n\nA transition away from LIBOR as a reference rate for financial contracts could negatively affect the Company’s income and expenses and the value of various financial contracts.\n\nLIBOR represented the interest rate at which banks offer to lend funds to one another in the international interbank market for short-term loans. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR rates after 2021. U.S. Regulators issued guidance to urge market participants to address their LIBOR exposures and transition to robust and sustainable alternative rates and the Alternative Reference Rate Committee proposed that SOFR is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to U.S. dollar-LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to LIBOR, but has also advised participants to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of any alternative reference rates being considered for use. Contracts linked to LIBOR are vast in number and value, are intertwined with numerous financial products and services, and have diverse parties.\n\n​\n\nThe end date for LIBOR was June 30, 2023. The Company actively worked to plan for the transition away from LIBOR, but the transition is both complex and challenging and the downstream effect of unwinding or transitioning such contracts may yet cause instability and negatively impact on financial markets and individual institutions. If the Company or other market participants have failed to implement alternative rates other than LIBOR, it could have an adverse effect on the Company and the financial system as a whole.\n\n​\n\n36\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nPotential losses incurred in connection with possible repurchases and indemnification payments related to mortgages that the Company has sold into the secondary market may require the Company to increase its financial statement reserves in the future.\n\nThe Company engages in the origination and sale of residential real estate loans into the secondary market. In connection with such sales, the Company makes certain representations and warranties, which, if breached, may require the Company to repurchase such loans or indemnify the purchasers of such loans for actual losses incurred in respect of such loans. These representations and warranties vary based on the nature of the transaction and the purchaser’s or insurer’s requirements but generally pertain to the ownership of the mortgage loan, the real property securing the loan and compliance with applicable laws and applicable lender and government-sponsored entity underwriting guidelines in connection with the origination of the loan. While the Company believes its mortgage lending practices and standards to be adequate, the Company may receive repurchase or indemnification requests in the future, which could be material in volume. If that were to happen, the Company could incur losses in connection with loan repurchases and indemnification claims, and any such losses might exceed the Company’s financial statement reserves, requiring the Company to increase such reserves. In that event, any losses the Company might have to recognize and any increases the Company might have to make to the Company’s reserves could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe Company is highly dependent on its executive management team, and the loss of any of the Company’s senior executive officers or other key employees, or the Company’s inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, could harm the Company’s ability to implement its strategic plan and impair the Company’s relationships with clients.\n\nThe Company’s success is dependent, to a large degree, upon the continued service and skills of the Company’s executive management team, which consists of Katie Lorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; Alan Villalon, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Collins, Chief Banking and Revenue Officer; Missy Keney, Chief Engagement Officer; Jon Hendry, Chief Technology Officer; Karin Taylor, Chief Risk and Operations Officer; and Forrest Wilson, Chief Retirement Services Officer. The Company’s business and growth strategies are built primarily upon its ability to retain employees with experience and business relationships within the Company’s market areas. The loss of any of the members of the Company’s executive management team or any of the Company’s other key personnel, including client advisors, could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business and growth because of their skills, years of industry experience, knowledge of the Company’s market areas, the difficulty of finding qualified replacement personnel and any difficulties associated with transitioning of responsibilities to any new members of the executive management team. As such, the Company needs to continue to attract and retain key personnel and to recruit qualified individuals who fit the Company’s culture to succeed existing key personnel and ensure the continued growth and successful operation of the Company’s business. Leadership changes may occur from time to time, and the Company cannot predict whether significant retirements or resignations will occur or whether the Company will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel.\n\nCompetition for senior executives and skilled personnel in the financial services industry is intense, which means the cost of hiring, incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase. In addition, the Company’s ability to effectively compete for senior executives and other qualified personnel by offering competitive compensation and benefit arrangements may be restricted by our financial condition, and by applicable banking laws and regulations. The loss of the services of any senior executive or other key personnel, the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future or the failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe Company’s ability to retain and recruit employees is critical to the success of its business strategy and any failure to do so could impair the Company’s customer relationships and adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe Company’s ability to retain and grow its loans, deposits and fee income depends upon the business generation capabilities, reputation and relationship management skills of the Company’s employees. If the Company loses the services of any of its employees, including successful employees employed by banks or other businesses that the Company may acquire, to a new or existing competitor or otherwise, the Company may not be able to retain valuable \n\n37\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nrelationships and some of its customers could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of the Company’s services.\n\nThe Company’s success and growth strategy also depends on its continued ability to attract and retain experienced employees for all of the Company’s business lines. The Company may face difficulties in recruiting and retaining personnel of its desired caliber, including as a result of competition from other financial institutions. Competition for high quality personnel is strong and the Company may not be successful in attracting or retaining the personnel it requires. In particular, many of the Company’s competitors are significantly larger with greater financial resources and may be able to offer more attractive compensation packages and broader career opportunities. Additionally, the Company may incur significant expenses and expend significant time and resources on training, integration, and business development before the Company is able to determine whether a new employee will be profitable or effective in their role. If the Company is unable to attract and retain a successful customer development and management team or if the Company’s customer development and management team fails to meet its expectations in terms of customer relationships and profitability, the Company may be unable to execute its business strategy and its business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects may be negatively affected.\n\nThe Company’s ability to maintain its reputation is critical to the success of the Company’s business, and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect its business and the value of the Company’s stock.\n\nThe Company relies, in part, on its reputation to attract clients and retain client relationships. Damage to the Company’s reputation could undermine the confidence of its current and potential clients in the Company’s ability to provide high-quality financial services. Such damage could also impair the confidence of the Company’s counterparties and vendors and ultimately affect its ability to effect transactions. In particular, the Company’s ability to attract and retain clients and employees could be adversely affected to the extent its reputation is damaged. The Company’s actual or perceived failure to address various issues could give rise to reputational risk that could cause harm to the Company and its business prospects. These issues include, but are not limited to, legal and regulatory requirements; privacy; client and other third-party fraud; properly maintaining and safeguarding client and employee personal information; money laundering; illegal or fraudulent sales practices; ethical issues; appropriately addressing potential conflicts of interest; and the proper identification and disclosure of the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity, and market risks inherent in the Company’s products. Failure to appropriately address any of these issues could also give rise to additional regulatory restrictions, reputational harm and legal risks, which could, among other consequences, increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject the Company to enforcement actions, fines, and penalties and cause the Company to incur related costs and expenses. In addition, the Company’s businesses are dependent on the integrity of its relationships, asset managers and other employees. If a relationship manager, asset manager or other employee were to misappropriate any client funds or client information, the reputation of the Company’s businesses could be negatively affected, which may result in the loss of accounts and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nMaintenance of the Company’s reputation depends not only on its success in maintaining the Company’s service-focused culture and controlling and mitigating the various risks described in this report, but also on the Company’s success in identifying and appropriately addressing issues that may arise in the areas described above. Maintaining the Company’s reputation also depends on its ability to successfully prevent third parties from infringing on the “Alerus” brand and associated trademarks and the Company’s other intellectual property. Defense of the Company’s reputation, trademarks and other intellectual property, including through litigation, could result in costs that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nLabor shortages and a failure to attract and retain qualified employees could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nA number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to the Company or increase labor costs, including high employment levels and decreased labor force size and participation rates in recent periods. Although the Company has not experienced any material labor shortage to date, the Company continues to observe an overall tightening of and increase in competition in local labor markets. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within the Company’s employee base could lead to increased costs, such as increased compensation expense to attract \n\n38\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nand retain employees, as well as decreased efficiency. In addition, if the Company is unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high-level, or if mitigation measures the Company takes to respond to a decrease in labor availability have unintended negative effects, the Company’s business could be adversely affected. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation, caused by general macroeconomic factors, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe Company’s use of third-party vendors and its other ongoing third-party business relationships is subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention.\n\nThe Company’s use of third party vendors, including the financial technology company it partners with to create a customer portal, for certain information systems is subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by the Company’s federal bank regulators. Recent regulations require the Company to enhance its due diligence, ongoing monitoring and control over the Company’s third-party vendors and other ongoing third party business relationships. In certain cases, the Company may be required to renegotiate the Company’s agreements with these vendors to meet these enhanced requirements, which could increase costs. The Company expects that regulators will hold the Company responsible for deficiencies in oversight and control of its third party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which the Company has these relationships. As a result, if the Company’s regulators conclude that it has not exercised adequate oversight and control over the Company’s third party vendors or other ongoing third party business relationships or that such third parties have not performed appropriately, the Company could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines, as well as requirements for client remediation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe Company has a continuing need for technological change, and it may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology or it may experience operational challenges when implementing new technology.\n\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving clients, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. The Company’s future success will depend in part upon its, and its third party partners’, ability to address the needs of the Company’s clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations. The widespread adoption of new technologies, including mobile banking services, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies and payment systems, could require the Company in the future to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt the Company’s existing products and services as it grows and develops new products to satisfy the Company’s customers’ expectations, remain competitive and comply with regulatory guidance. The Company may experience operational challenges as it implements these new technology enhancements, which could result in the Company not fully realizing the anticipated benefits from such new technology or require the Company to incur significant costs to remedy any such challenges in a timely manner.\n\nMany of the Company’s larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or superior products to those that the Company will be able to offer, which would put the Company at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, a risk exists that the Company will not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to the Company’s clients.\n\nIn addition, the implementation of technological changes and upgrades to maintain current systems and integrate new ones may also cause service interruptions, transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause the Company to fail to comply with applicable laws. The Company expects that new technologies and business processes applicable to the financial services industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies and business processes may be better than those the Company currently uses. Because the pace of technological change is high and the Company’s industry is intensely competitive, it may not be able to sustain the Company’s investment in new technology as critical systems and applications become obsolete or as better ones become available. A failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry and failure to avoid \n\n39\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\ninterruptions, errors and delays could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe Company is subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors.\n\nEmployee errors and employee and customer misconduct could subject the Company to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm the Company’s reputation. Misconduct by the Company’s employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of the Company’s customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors or employee and customer misconduct, and the precautions the Company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject the Company to financial claims for negligence.\n\nThe Company maintains a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. If the Company’s internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe Company’s dividend policy may change.\n\nAlthough the Company has historically paid dividends to its stockholders and currently intends to maintain or increase its dividend levels in future quarters, the Company has no obligation to continue doing so and may change the Company’s dividend policy at any time without notice to the Company’s stockholders. Holders of the Company’s common stock are only entitled to receive such cash dividends as the Company’s Board of Directors, in its discretion, may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Further, consistent with the Company’s strategic plans, growth initiatives, capital availability, projected liquidity needs, and other factors, the Company has made, and will continue to make, capital management decisions and policies that could adversely impact the amount of dividends paid to the Company’s common stockholders.\n\nIn addition, the Company is a financial holding company, and the Company’s ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank and financial holding companies should generally pay dividends on capital stock only out of earnings, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs, asset quality and financial condition.\n\nThe Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries, including the Bank. The Company receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from the Bank, which it uses as the principal source of funds to pay expenses. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank and certain of the Company’s non-bank subsidiaries may pay the Company. Such limits are also tied to the earnings of the Company’s subsidiaries. If the Bank does not receive regulatory approval or if its earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to the Company while maintaining adequate capital levels, the Company’s ability to pay its expenses and its business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.\n\nFuture issuances of common stock could result in dilution, which could cause the Company’s common stock price to decline.\n\nThe Company is generally not restricted from issuing additional shares of stock, up to totals of 30,000,000 shares of common stock and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized in the Company’s certificate of incorporation, which in each case could be increased by a vote of the holders of a majority of the Company’s shares of common stock. The Company may issue additional shares of common stock in the future pursuant to current or future equity compensation plans, upon conversions of preferred stock or debt, or in connection with future acquisitions or financings. If the Company chooses to raise capital by selling shares of common stock for any reason, the issuance \n\n40\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nwould have a dilutive effect on the holders of the Company’s common stock and could have a material negative effect on the market price of the Company’s common stock.\n\nThe Company may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire the Company or could otherwise adversely affect holders of the Company’s common stock, which could depress the price of the Company’s common stock.\n\nAlthough there are currently no shares of the Company’s preferred stock issued and outstanding, the Company’s certificate of incorporation authorizes the Company to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of one or more series of preferred stock. The Company’s Board of Directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences over the Company’s common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up, and other terms. If the Company issues preferred stock in the future that has preference over the Company’s common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if the Company issues preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the Company’s common stock, the rights of the holders of the Company’s common stock or the market price of the Company’s common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, the ability of the Company’s Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of the Company’s stockholders may impede a takeover of the Company and prevent a transaction perceived to be favorable to the Company’s stockholders.\n\nThe holders of the Company’s debt obligations and preferred stock, if any, will have priority over the Company’s common stock with respect to payment in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up and with respect to the payment of interest and dividends.\n\nIn any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Company’s common stock would rank junior in priority to all claims of debt holders against the Company and claims of all of the Company’s outstanding shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $50.0 million of subordinated notes payable and $9.0 million of junior subordinated debentures outstanding. The Company does not currently have any shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. As a result, holders of the Company’s common stock will not be entitled to receive any payment or other distribution of assets upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company until after all of its obligations to debt holders have been satisfied and holders of senior equity securities, including any preferred shares, if any, have received any payment or distribution due to them.\n\nThe Company’s business and operations may be adversely affected in numerous and complex ways by weak economic conditions and global trade.\n\nThe Company’s businesses and operations, which primarily consist of lending money to clients in the form of commercial and residential mortgage loans, borrowing money from clients in the form of deposits and savings accounts, investing in securities, and providing wealth management, trust and fiduciary and recordkeeping services, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. If the United States economy weakens, the Company’s growth and profitability from the Company’s lending, deposit and investment operations could be constrained. Uncertainty about the federal fiscal policymaking process, the medium- and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal government, and future tax rates is a concern for businesses, consumers and investors in the United States. In addition, economic conditions in foreign countries and weakening global trade due to increased anti-globalization sentiment and recent tariff activity could affect the stability of global financial markets, which could hinder the economic growth of the United States. Weak economic conditions are characterized by deflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, a lack of liquidity or depressed prices in the secondary market for loans, increased delinquencies on mortgage, consumer and commercial loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity. Further, a general economic slowdown could decrease the value of the Company’s AUA and AUM resulting in clients potentially seeking alternative investment opportunities with other providers, which could result in lower fee income. All of these factors are detrimental to the Company’s business, and the interplay between these factors can be complex and unpredictable. Adverse economic conditions and government policy responses to such conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\n41\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe financial markets and the global economy may also be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including the ongoing conflicts between Israel and Palestine and between Russia and Ukraine, which is increasing volatility in commodity and energy prices, creating supply chain issues and causing instability in financial markets. Sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries in response to such conflict could further adversely impact the financial markets and the global economy, and any economic countermeasures by the affected countries or others could exacerbate market and economic instability. The specific consequences of these conflicts on the Company’s business are difficult to predict at this time, but in addition to inflationary pressures affecting the Company’s operations and those of the Company’s customers and borrowers, the Company may also experience an increase in cyberattacks against us, the Company’s customers and borrowers, service providers and other third parties.\n\nThe Company depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties.\n\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, and in evaluating and monitoring the Company’s loan portfolio on an ongoing basis, the Company may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. The Company may also rely on representations of those clients or counterparties or of other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate, incomplete, fraudulent or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial or business information, or the failure to receive such information on a timely basis, could result in loan losses, reputational damage or other effects that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nNew lines of business, products, product enhancements or services may subject the Company to additional risks.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may implement new lines of business or offer new products and product enhancements as well as new services within the Company’s existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances in which the markets are not fully developed. In implementing, developing or marketing new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services, the Company may invest significant time and resources, although the Company may not assign the appropriate level of resources or expertise necessary to make these new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services successful or to realize their expected benefits. Further, initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible.\n\nExternal factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also affect the successful implementation of a new line of business or offerings of new products, product enhancements or services. Further, any new line of business, product, product enhancement or service or system conversion could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the Company’s system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or offerings of new products, product enhancements or services could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe Company faces intense competition from other banks and financial services companies that could hurt its business.\n\nThe Company operates in the highly competitive financial services industry and faces significant competition for clients from financial institutions located both within and beyond the Company’s market areas. Overall, the Company competes with national commercial banks, regional banks, private banks, mortgage companies, online lenders, savings banks, credit unions, non-bank financial services companies, other financial institutions, including investment advisory and wealth management firms, financial technology, or “Fintech,” companies and securities brokerage firms, operating within or near the areas the Company serves. Many of the Company’s non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern the Company’s activities and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation.\n\n42\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nWhile the Company does not offer products relating to digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and other similar assets, there has been a significant increase in digital asset adoption globally over the past several years. Certain characteristics of digital asset transactions, such as the speed with which such transactions can be conducted, the ability to transact without the involvement of regulated intermediaries, the ability to engage in transactions across multiple jurisdictions, and the anonymous nature of the transactions, are appealing to certain consumers notwithstanding the various risks posed by such transactions. Accordingly, digital asset service providers—which, at present are not subject to the same degree of scrutiny and oversight as banking organizations and other financial institutions—are becoming active competitors to more traditional financial institutions.\n\nThe process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as “disintermediation,” could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Potential partnerships with digital asset companies, moreover, could also entail significant investment.\n\nIn the Company’s banking business, it may not be able to compete successfully with other financial institutions in the Company’s markets, particularly with larger financial institutions that have significantly greater resources than us, and the Company may have to pay higher interest rates to attract deposits, accept lower yields to attract loans and pay higher wages for new employees, resulting in lower net interest margins and reduced profitability. In addition, increased lending activity of competing banks has also led to increased competitive pressures on loan rates and terms for high-quality credits.\n\nCompetition in the retirement and benefit services and wealth management businesses is especially strong in the Company’s geographic market areas because there are numerous well-established, well-resourced, well-capitalized, and successful investment management, wealth advisory and wealth management and trust firms in these areas. In addition, the record-keeping and administration industry is dominated by a small number of larger institutions that may charge fees that are lower than the Company charges for similar services. The Company’s ability to successfully attract and retain retirement and benefit services and wealth management clients is dependent upon its ability to compete with competitors’ investment, advisory, fiduciary and recordkeeping products and services, levels of investment performance and marketing and distribution capabilities. If the Company is unable to compete effectively with other banking or other financial services businesses, it could find it more difficult to attract new and retain existing clients and the Company’s noninterest income could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe Company originates, sells and services residential mortgage loans. The Company’s mortgage business faces vigorous competition from banks and other financial institutions, including larger financial institutions and independent mortgage companies. The Company’s mortgage business competes on a number of factors including customer service, quality, range of products and services offered, price, reputation, interest rates, closing process and duration, and loan origination fees. The ability to attract and retain skilled mortgage origination professionals is critical to the Company’s mortgage origination business. Changes in interest rates and pricing decisions by the Company’s loan competitors affect demand for the Company’s residential mortgage loan products, the revenue realized on the sale of loans and revenues received from servicing such loans for others, ultimately reducing the Company’s noninterest income. In addition, if the Company is unable to attract and retain enough skilled employees, the Company’s mortgage origination volume may decline.\n\nThe Company’s business and operations may be adversely affected in numerous and complex ways by external business disruptors in the financial services industry.\n\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid change, as technology enables traditional banks to compete in new ways and non-traditional entrants to compete in certain segments of the banking market, in some cases with reduced regulation. As client preferences and expectations continue to evolve, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet and for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems, online lending and low-cost investment advisory services. New entrants may use new technologies, advanced \n\n43\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\ndata and analytic tools, lower cost to serve, reduced regulatory burden or faster processes to challenge traditional banks. For example, new business models have been observed in retail payments, consumer and commercial lending, foreign exchange and low-cost investment advisory services. While the Company closely monitors business disruptors and seek to adapt to changing technologies, matching the pace of innovation exhibited by new and differently situated competitors may require the Company and policy-makers to adapt at a greater pace. Because the financial services industry is experiencing rapid changes in technology, the Company’s future success will depend in part on its ability to address its clients’ needs by using technology. Client loyalty can be influenced by a competitor’s new products, especially offerings that could provide cost savings or a higher return to the client.\n\nThe investment management contracts the Company has with its clients are terminable without cause and on relatively short notice by the Company’s clients, which makes it vulnerable to short-term declines in the performance of the securities under the Company’s management.\n\nLike most investment advisory and wealth management businesses, the investment advisory contracts the Company has with the Company’s clients are typically terminable by the client without cause upon less than 30 days’ notice. As a result, even short-term declines in the performance of the securities the Company manages, which can result from factors outside the Company’s control, such as adverse changes in market or economic conditions or the poor performance of some of the investments the Company has recommended to the Company’s clients, could lead some of its clients to move assets under the Company’s management to other asset classes such as broad index funds or treasury securities, or to investment advisors which have investment product offerings or investment strategies different than ours. Therefore, the Company’s operating results are heavily dependent on the financial performance of the Company’s investment portfolios and the investment strategies the Company employs in the Company’s investment advisory businesses and even short-term declines in the performance of the investment portfolios the Company manages for the Company’s clients, whatever the cause, could result in a decline in AUM and a corresponding decline in investment management fees, which would adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.\n\nSevere weather, natural disasters, pandemics, acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events could significantly impact the Company’s business.\n\nSevere weather, natural disasters, effects of climate change, widespread disease or pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, civil unrest or other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Company’s ability to conduct business. In addition, such events could affect the stability of the Company’s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any of these events in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe Company’s wealth management business is dependent on asset managers to produce investment returns and financial advisors to solicit and retain clients, and the loss of a key asset manager or financial advisor could adversely affect the Company’s wealth management business.\n\nThe Company relies on its asset managers to produce investment returns and financial advisors to advise clients of the Company’s wealth management business. The Company believes that investment performance is an important factor for the growth of its AUM. Poor investment performance could impair the Company’s revenues and growth because existing clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products, which would result in lower investment management fees, or the Company’s ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish.\n\nThe market for asset managers and financial advisors is extremely competitive and is increasingly characterized by frequent movement of these types of employees among different firms. In addition, the Company’s asset managers and financial advisors often have regular direct contact with the Company’s clients, which can lead to a strong client relationship based on the client’s trust in that individual manager or advisor. The loss of a key asset manager or financial advisor could jeopardize the Company’s relationships with the Company’s clients and lead to the loss of client accounts. Losses of such accounts could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\n44\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe Company may be adversely affected by the soundness of certain securities brokerage firms.\n\nThe Company’s client investment accounts are maintained under custodial arrangements with large, well established securities brokerage firms or bank institutions that provide custodial services, either directly or through arrangements made by the Company with those firms. As a result, the performance of, or even rumors or questions about the integrity or performance of, any of those firms could adversely affect the confidence of the Company’s clients in the services provided by those firms or otherwise adversely impact their custodial holdings. Such an occurrence could negatively impact the Company’s ability to retain existing or attract new clients and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\n**Liquidity and Funding Risks**\n\nLiquidity risks could affect the Company’s operations and jeopardize its business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nLiquidity is essential to the Company’s business. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its obligations, including financial commitments, as they come due and is inherent in the Company’s operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans or investment securities, and from other sources could have a substantial negative effect on the Company’s liquidity.\n\nThe Company’s most important source of funds consists of the Company’s client deposits, which can decrease for a variety of reasons, including when clients perceive alternative investments, such as bonds, treasuries or stocks, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. Total deposits increased in 2023, however, clients demanded higher interest rates on deposit accounts to compete with higher yielding short-term investments available. The Company’s future growth will largely depend on its ability to maintain and grow a strong deposit base and the Company’s ability to retain its largest retirement and benefit services and wealth management clients, many of whom are also depositors. If clients, including the Company’s retirement and benefit services and wealth management clients, move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, the Company could lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, which would require the Company to seek other funding alternatives, including increasing the Company’s dependence on wholesale funding sources, in order to continue to grow, thereby increasing the Company’s funding costs and reducing net interest income and net income.\n\nAdditionally, uninsured deposits have historically been viewed by the FDIC as less stable than insured deposits. According to statements made by the FDIC staff and the leadership of the federal banking agencies, customers with larger uninsured deposit account balances often are small- to mid-sized businesses that rely upon deposit funds for payment of operational expenses and, as a result, are more likely to closely monitor the financial condition and performance of their depository institutions. As a result, in the event of financial distress, uninsured depositors historically have been more likely to withdraw their deposits. If a significant portion of our deposits were to be withdrawn within a short period of time such that additional sources of funding would be required to meet withdrawal demands, the Company may be unable to obtain funding at favorable terms, which may have an adverse effect on our net interest margin. Moreover, obtaining adequate funding to meet our deposit obligations may be more challenging during periods of higher prevailing interest rates, such as the present period. Our ability to attract depositors during a time of actual or perceived distress or instability in the marketplace may be limited. Further, interest rates paid for borrowings generally exceed the interest rates paid on deposits. This spread may be exacerbated by higher prevailing interest rates. In addition, because our available for sale securities lose value when interest rates rise, after-tax proceeds resulting from the sale of such assets may be diminished during periods when interest rates are elevated. Under such circumstances, we may be required to access funding from sources such as the Federal Reserve’s discount window in order to manage our liquidity risk.\n\nThe Company also accesses collateralized public funds, which are bank deposits of state and local municipalities. These deposits are required to be secured by certain investment grade securities to ensure repayment, which reduces standby liquidity by restricting the potential liquidity of the pledged collateral. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had pledged $250.0 million of investment securities for this purpose, which represented approximately 31.8% of the Company’s total securities portfolio. If the Company is unable to pledge sufficient qualifying collateral to \n\n45\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nsecure public funding, it may lose access to this source of liquidity that the Company has historically relied upon. In addition, the availability of and fluctuations in these funds depends on the individual municipality’s fiscal policies and cash flow needs. \n\nOther primary sources of funds consist of cash from operations, investment security maturities and sales and proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Company’s equity and debt securities to investors. Additional liquidity is provided by the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve and the FHLB. The Federal Reserve established the Bank Term Funding Program, or BTFP, on March 12, 2023, offering qualifying banks loans of up to one year in length collateralized by qualifying assets, including U.S. securities valued at par, to serve as a source of additional liquidity against high-quality securities and reducing an institution’s need to quickly sell high-quality securities to meet liquidity needs. The Federal Reserve has announced that it is ending the BTFP and will cease making new loans under this program on March 11, 2024. The Company may also borrow from third-party lenders from time to time. The Company’s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize the Company’s activities or on terms that are acceptable to the Company could be impaired by factors that affect the Company directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. Economic conditions and a loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase the Company’s cost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the Federal Reserve. There is also the potential risk that collateral calls with respect to the Company’s repurchase agreements could reduce the Company’s available liquidity. At December 31, 2023, the Company’s borrowed funds decreased to $314.2 million, compared to $378.1 million at December 31, 2022. The balance of borrowed funds as of December 31, 2023 included $200.0 million in FHLB advances and $114.2 million in federal funds purchased. Despite the decrease in borrowings, the Company’s cost of funds increased and in 2023, as compared to 2022 as a result of the increased interest rate environment. \n\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact the Company’s ability to continue to implement its strategic plan, including originating loans and investing in securities, or to fulfill obligations such as paying expenses, repaying borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe Company may not be able to maintain a strong core deposit base or other low-cost funding sources.\n\nThe Company depends primarily on core deposits from its clients, which consist of noninterest bearing deposits, interest bearing checking accounts, certificates of deposit less than $250,000 and money market savings accounts, as the Company’s primary source of funding for lending activities. The Company’s future growth will largely depend on its ability to maintain and grow this strong, core deposit base and the Company’s ability to retain its retirement and benefit and wealth management clients, many of whom are also depositors. Deposit and account balances can decrease when clients perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market or real estate, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. If clients, including the Company’s retirement and benefit and wealth management clients, move money out of bank deposits or money market accounts and into investments (or similar deposit products at other institutions that may provide a higher rate of return), the Company could lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing funding costs and reducing net interest income and net income.\n\nThe Company supplements its core deposit funding with non-core, short-term funding sources, including FHLB advances and fed funds purchased. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $200.0 million FHLB advances and $114.2 million of fed funds purchased from the FHLB. The Company’s maximum borrowing capacity from the FHLB is based on the amount of mortgage and commercial loans the Company can pledge. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s advances from the FHLB were collateralized by $970.4 million of real estate loans. If the Company is unable to pledge sufficient qualifying collateral to secure funding from the FHLB, it may lose access to this source of liquidity. If the Company is unable to access any of these types of funding sources or if its costs related to them increases, the Company’s liquidity and ability to support demand for loans could be materially adversely affected. \n\n46\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe Company’s high concentration of large depositors may increase its liquidity risk.\n\nThe Company has developed relationships with certain individuals and businesses that have resulted in a concentration of large deposits from a small number of clients. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s 10 largest depositor relationships accounted for approximately 8.7% of total deposits. This high concentration of depositors presents a risk to the Company’s liquidity if one or more of them decides to change its relationship with the Company and to withdraw all or a significant portion of their accounts, for example as a result of deposits above the FDIC insurance limit. If such an event occurs, the Company may need to seek out alternative sources of funding that may not be on the same terms as the deposits being replaced, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \n\nThe Company’s liquidity is largely dependent on dividends from the Bank.\n\nThe Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank, and its other subsidiaries. A substantial portion of the Company’s cash flow, including cash flow to pay principal and interest on the Company’s debt, comes from dividends the Company receives from the Bank. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Company. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank had the capacity to pay the Company a dividend of up to $61.3 million without the need to obtain prior regulatory approval. Also, the Company’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, it may not be able to service its debt, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe Company may need to raise additional capital in the future, and if it fails to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to losses, an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects, as well as its ability to maintain regulatory compliance, would be adversely affected.\n\nThe Company faces significant capital and other regulatory requirements as a financial institution. The Company may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet the Company’s commitments and business needs, which could include the possibility of financing acquisitions. The Company does not have any current plans, arrangements or understandings to make any additional acquisitions. In addition, the Company, on a consolidated basis, and the Bank, on a stand-alone basis, must meet certain regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. Regulatory capital requirements could increase from current levels, which could require the Company to raise additional capital or contract the Company’s operations. The Company’s ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, the Company’s credit ratings, its ability to maintain a listing on Nasdaq and its financial condition and performance. In particular, if the Company needs to raise additional capital in the current interest rate environment, the Company believes the pricing and other terms investors may require in such an offering may not be attractive to the Company. If the Company fails to maintain an investment grade credit rating, it may adversely impact its ability to raise capital or incur additional debt. Accordingly, the Company cannot assure you that it will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company fails to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, or is unable to raise capital to meet its business needs, its business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\n\nThe Company may be adversely affected by changes in the actual or perceived soundness or condition of other financial institutions.\n\nFinancial services institutions that deal with each other are interconnected as a result of trading, investment, liquidity management, clearing, counterparty , reputational and other relationships. Concerns about, or a default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems and losses or defaults by other institutions, as the commercial and financial soundness of many financial institutions is closely related as a result of these credit, trading, clearing and other relationships. Even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of, or questions about, a counterparty may lead to market-wide \n\n47\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nliquidity problems and losses or defaults by various institutions. For example, certain community banks experienced deposit outflows following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank in 2023. This systemic risk may adversely affect financial intermediaries with which the Company interacts on a daily basis or key funding providers such as the FHLB, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s access to liquidity or otherwise have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe Company receives substantial deposits and AUM as a result of referrals by professionals, such as attorneys, accountants, and doctors, and such referrals are dependent upon the continued positive interaction with and financial health of those referral sources.\n\nMany of the Company’s deposit clients and clients of the Company’s wealth management business are individuals involved in professional vocations, such as lawyers, accountants, and doctors. These clients are a significant source of referrals for new clients in both the deposit and wealth management areas. If the Company fails to adequately serve these professional clients with its deposit services, lending, wealth management products and other services, this source of referrals may diminish, which could have a negative impact on the Company’s financial results. Further, if the economy in the geographic areas that the Company serves is negatively impacted, the amount of deposits and services that these professional individuals will utilize and the number of referrals that they will make may decrease, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\n**Legal, Accounting and Compliance Risks**\n\nThe Company’s risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks or losses to the Company.\n\nThe Company’s risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which the Company is subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, interest rate and compliance. The Company’s framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. The Company’s risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances and it may not adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us. If the Company’s framework is not effective, it could suffer unexpected losses and the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. The Company may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences.\n\nThe Company’s accounting estimates and risk management processes and controls rely on analytical and forecasting techniques and models and assumptions, which may not accurately predict future events.\n\nThe Company’s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to the way it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. The Company’s management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and reflect management’s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet which may result in the Company’s reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\n\nCertain accounting policies are critical to presenting the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. If the Company’s underlying assumptions or estimates prove to be incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe Company’s risk management processes, internal controls, disclosure controls and corporate governance policies and procedures are based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable (not absolute) assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the Company’s controls, processes \n\n48\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nand procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls, processes and procedures could necessitate changes in those controls, processes and procedures, which may increase the Company’s compliance costs, divert management attention from its business or subject the Company to regulatory actions and increased regulatory scrutiny. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nChanges in accounting policies or standards could materially impact the Company’s financial statements.\n\nFrom time to time, FASB, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (or PCAOB) or the SEC, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s financial statements. Such changes may result in the Company being subject to new or changing accounting and reporting standards. In addition, the bodies that interpret the accounting standards (such as banking regulators or outside auditors) may change their interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. In addition, trends in financial and business reporting, including environmental social and governance (ESG) related disclosures, could require the Company to incur additional reporting expense. These changes may be beyond the Company’s control, can be hard to predict and can materially impact how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, or apply an existing standard differently, in each case resulting in the Company’s needing to revise or restate prior period financial statements.\n\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention, which divert time and attention from the Company’s business operations.\n\nAs a public company, the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Exchange Act requires that the Company file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to its business and financial condition with the SEC. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that the Company establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. Compliance with these reporting requirements and other rules and regulations, including period revisions to and additional rules and regulations, of the SEC could increase the Company’s legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly, which could negatively affect the Company’s efficiency ratio. Further, the need to maintain the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management’s attention from implementing the Company’s strategic plan, which could prevent the Company from successfully implementing the Company’s growth initiatives and improving its business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nAs an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, the Company is taking advantage of certain temporary exemptions from various reporting requirements, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in the Company’s periodic reports and proxy statements and an exemption from the requirement to obtain an attestation from the Company’s auditors on management’s assessment of its internal control over financial reporting. When these exemptions cease to apply, the Company expects to incur additional expenses and devote increased management effort toward ensuring compliance with them.\n\nThe financial reporting resources the Company has put in place may not be sufficient to ensure the accuracy of the additional information the Company is required to disclose as a publicly listed company.\n\nAs a public company, the Company is subject to heightened financial reporting standards under GAAP and SEC rules, including more extensive levels of disclosure. Complying with these standards required enhancements to the design and operation of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as well as additional financial reporting and accounting staff with appropriate training and experience in GAAP and SEC rules and regulations.\n\nIf the Company is unable to meet the demands required of the Company as a public company, including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Company may be unable to report its financial results accurately, or report them within the timeframes required by law or stock exchange regulations. Failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, when and as applicable, could also potentially subject the Company to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or \n\n49\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nother regulatory authorities. If material weaknesses or other deficiencies occur, the Company’s ability to report its financial results accurately and timely could be impaired, which could result in late filings of the Company’s annual and quarterly reports under the Exchange Act, restatements of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, a decline in the Company’s stock price, suspension or delisting of the Company’s common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Even if the Company is able to report its financial statements accurately and in a timely manner, any disclosure of material weaknesses in the Company’s future filings with the SEC could cause the Company’s reputation to be harmed and the Company’s stock price to decline significantly.\n\nThe Company did not engage its independent registered public accounting firm to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, as of any balance sheet date reported in the Company’s financial statements as of December 31, 2023. Had the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm performed an audit of its internal control over financial reporting under the standards of PCAOB, material weaknesses may have been identified. The JOBS Act provides that, so long as the Company qualifies as an emerging growth company, it will be exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley, which would require that the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting under the standards of PCAOB. The Company may take advantage of this exemption so long as it qualifies as an emerging growth company.\n\nThe recent change in the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm could materially impact the Company’s financial statements.\n\nOn December 1, 2022, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved the dismissal of CliftonLarsonAllen LLP (“CLA”), as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm because CLA indicated that it would not stand for reappointment following completion of the audit of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year-ending December 31, 2022. On December 1, 2022, the Audit Committee approved the appointment of RSM, LLP (“RSM”) to serve as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2023. RSM’s future audits of the Company’s financial statements may identify errors or omissions in the Company’s historical financial statements that were not previously identified and that could require the Company to restate previously issued financial statements or materially impact how the Company reports its financial condition and results of operations going forward. If the Company has to restate any historical financial statements it could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\n\nLitigation and regulatory actions, including possible enforcement actions, could subject the Company to significant fines, penalties, judgments or other requirements resulting in increased expenses or restrictions on the Company’s business activities.\n\nThe Company’s business is subject to increased litigation and regulatory risks because of a number of factors, including the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry and the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry generally. This focus has only intensified since the financial crisis, with regulators and prosecutors focusing on a variety of financial institution practices and requirements, including foreclosure practices, compliance with applicable consumer protection laws, classification of “held for sale” assets and compliance with anti-money laundering statutes, the Bank Secrecy Act and sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or OFAC.\n\nIn the normal course of business, from time to time, the Company has in the past and may in the future be named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with the Company’s current or prior business activities. Legal actions could include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. The Company may also, from time to time, be the subject of subpoenas, requests for information, reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding the Company’s current or prior business activities. Any such legal or regulatory actions may subject the Company to substantial compensatory or punitive damages, significant fines, penalties, obligations to change the Company’s business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses, diminished income and damage to the Company’s reputation. The Company’s involvement in any such matters, whether \n\n50\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\ntangential or otherwise and even if the matters are ultimately determined in the Company’s favor, could also cause significant harm to the Company’s reputation and divert management attention from the operation of the Company’s business. Further, any settlement, consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government agencies may result in litigation, investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government agencies begin independent reviews of the same activities. As a result, the outcome of legal and regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nMoreover, U.S. authorities have been increasingly focused on “conduct risk,” a term that is used to describe the risks associated with behavior by employees and agents, including third-party vendors, that could harm clients, consumers, investors or the markets, such as failures to safeguard consumers’ and investors’ personal information, failures to identify and manage conflicts of interest and improperly creating, selling and marketing products and services. In addition to increasing compliance risks, this focus on conduct risk could lead to more regulatory or other enforcement proceedings and litigation, including for practices which historically were acceptable but are now receiving greater scrutiny. Further, while the Company takes numerous steps to prevent and detect conduct by employees and agents that could potentially harm clients, investors or the markets, such behavior may not always be deterred or prevented. Banking regulators have also focused on the overall culture of financial services firms. In addition to regulatory restrictions or structural changes that could result from perceived deficiencies in the Company’s culture, such focus could also lead to additional regulatory proceedings.\n\nIf the goodwill that the Company recorded in connection with the Company’s recent acquisitions becomes impaired, it could have a negative impact on its financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had goodwill of $46.8 million, or 12.7% of the Company’s total stockholders’ equity. The excess purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets from acquisitions, or goodwill, is evaluated for impairment at least annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred. In testing for impairment, the Company conducts a qualitative assessment, and the Company also estimates the fair value of net assets based on analyses of its market value, discounted cash flows and peer values. Consequently, the determination of the fair value of goodwill is sensitive to market-based economics and other key assumptions. Variability in market conditions or in key assumptions could result in impairment of goodwill, which is recorded as a non-cash adjustment to income. An impairment of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \n\nThe Company is subject to extensive regulation, and the regulatory framework that applies to the Company, together with any future legislative or regulatory changes, may significantly affect its operations.\n\nThe banking industry is extensively regulated and supervised under both federal and state laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, clients, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not for the protection of the Company’s business or stockholders. The Company is subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve, and the Bank is subject to supervision and regulation by the OCC and the FDIC. The laws and regulations applicable to the Company govern a variety of matters, including permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and investments the Company may make, the maximum interest rate that may be charged, the amount of reserves the Company must hold against deposits the Company takes, the types of deposits the Company may accept, maintenance of adequate capital and liquidity, changes in the control of the Company and its Bank, restrictions on dividends and establishment of new offices. The Company must obtain approval from its regulators before engaging in certain activities, and there is the risk that such approvals may not be obtained, either in a timely manner or at all. The Company’s regulators also have the ability to compel it to take certain actions, or restrict it from taking certain actions entirely, such as actions that the Company’s regulators deem to constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The Company’s failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, or regulatory policies and interpretations of such laws and regulations, could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties or damage to the Company’s reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\n51\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nWhile the Company endeavors to maintain safe banking practices and controls beyond the regulatory requirements applicable to the Company, its internal controls may not match those of larger banking institutions that are subject to increased regulatory oversight.\n\nFinancial institutions generally have also been subjected to increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities, including in the wake of the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank in 2023. This increased regulatory burden has resulted, and may continue to result in, increased costs of doing business, and may in the future, result in decreased revenues and net income, reduce the Company’s ability to compete effectively, to attract and retain clients, or make it less attractive for the Company to continue providing certain products and services. Any future changes in federal and state laws and regulations, as well as the interpretation and implementation of such laws and regulations, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways, including those listed above or other ways that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. For example, in December 2019, the U.S. Congress enacted the Setting Every Community up for Retirement Enhancement, or SECURE Act. The SECURE Act made significant changes to provisions of existing law governing retirement plans and IRAs. Many of the provisions of the SECURE Act were effective on January 1, 2020, while other provisions are effective on later dates, including some that are not effective until action is taken to modify underlying retirement plan documents. In addition, in December 2022, the U.S. Congress enacted the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022, or SECURE 2.0, which built some of the provisions of the SECURE Act and made additional significant changes to provisions of existing law governing retirement plans and IRAs. Many of the provisions of SECURE 2.0 were effective immediately upon passage of SECURE 2.0 while other provisions are effective on later dates. Some of the changes in law made by the SECURE Act and SECURE 2.0 are complex and unclear in application. The Company cannot predict what impact the SECURE Act or SECURE 2.0 will ultimately have on the Company’s business. \n\nThere is uncertainty surrounding potential legal, regulatory and policy changes by new presidential administrations in the United States that may directly affect financial institutions and the global economy.\n\n​\n\n2024 is a presidential election year. Changes in federal policy and at regulatory agencies occur over time through policy and personnel changes following elections, which lead to changes involving the level of oversight and focus on the financial services industry. The nature, timing and economic and political effects of potential changes to the current legal and regulatory framework affecting financial institutions remain highly uncertain. Uncertainty surrounding future changes may adversely affect our operating environment and therefore our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\n​\n\nThe Company’s retirement and benefit services and wealth management businesses are highly regulated, and the regulators have the ability to limit or restrict the Company’s activities and impose fines or suspensions on the conduct of the Company’s business.\n\nThe Company’s retirement and benefit services and wealth management businesses are highly regulated, primarily at the federal level. The failure of any of the Company’s businesses that provide investment management or wealth management and trust services to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, suspensions of individual employees or other sanctions. The Company is also subject to the provisions and regulations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA, to the extent that the Company acts as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to certain of the Company’s clients. ERISA and the applicable provisions of the federal tax laws impose a number of duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of each ERISA plan which is a client, as well as certain transactions by the fiduciaries (and certain other related parties) to such plans. Changes in these laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe Company is currently subject to and may continue to be subject to claims and litigation relating to the Company’s fiduciary responsibilities.\n\nSome of the services the Company provides, such as trust and investment services, require the Company to act as fiduciary for its clients and others. From time to time, third parties or government agencies make claims and take legal \n\n52\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\naction against the Company pertaining to the performance of its fiduciary responsibilities. For example, the Company recently sold its ESOP fiduciary services business, but remains subject to a number of lawsuits that are typical in that industry, one of which was brought by the United States Department of Labor, related to the Company ESOP’s fiduciary services. If these claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, it may be exposed to significant financial liability or the Company’s reputation could be damaged. Either of these results may adversely impact demand for the Company’s products and services or otherwise have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nChanges in tax laws and regulations, or changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe Company operates in an environment that imposes income taxes on its operations at both the federal and state levels to varying degrees. The Company engages in certain strategies to minimize the impact of these taxes. Consequently, any change in tax laws or regulations, or new interpretation of an existing law or regulation, could significantly alter the effectiveness of these strategies.\n\nThe net deferred tax asset reported on the Company’s balance sheet generally represents the tax benefit of future deductions from taxable income for items that have already been recognized for financial reporting purposes. The bulk of these deferred tax assets consists of deferred loan loss deductions and deferred compensation deductions. The net deferred tax asset is measured by applying currently-enacted income tax rates to the accounting period during which the tax benefit is expected to be realized. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s net deferred tax asset was $34.6 million.\n\nThe Company is subject to stringent capital requirements.\n\nBanking institutions are required to hold more capital as a percentage of assets than most industries. In the wake of the global financial crisis, the Company’s capital requirements increased, both in the amount of capital it must hold and in the quality of the capital to absorb losses. In addition, following the bank failures in 2023, federal bank regulatory agencies have begun to propose changes and potential increases in existing capital requirements. Holding high amounts of capital compresses the Company’s earnings and constrains growth. In addition, the failure to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements could result in one or more of the Company’s regulators placing limitations or conditions on the Company’s activities, including its growth initiatives, or restricting the commencement of new activities, and could affect client and investor confidence, its costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs and its ability to make acquisitions and result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nFederal regulators periodically examine the Company’s business, and it may be required to remediate adverse examination findings.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and the OCC periodically examine the Company, including its operations and its compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a banking agency were to determine that the Company’s financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, asset concentrations, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, sensitivity to market risk or other aspects of any of the Company’s operations had become unsatisfactory, or that the Company was in violation of any law or regulation, they may take a number of different remedial actions as they deem appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin “unsafe or unsound” practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in the Company’s capital, to restrict the Company’s growth, to assess civil money penalties, to fine or remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate the Company’s deposit insurance and place the Company into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory action against the Company could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\n53\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe Company is subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\n\nThe CRA requires the Bank, consistent with safe and sound operations, to ascertain and meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate-income areas. The Company’s failure to comply with the CRA could, among other things, result in the denial or delay of certain corporate applications filed by us, including applications for branch openings or relocations and applications to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking institution or holding company. In addition, the CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations prohibit discriminatory lending practices by financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice, federal banking agencies and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful challenge to an institution’s compliance with fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also challenge an institution’s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. In addition, new regulations, increased regulatory reviews or changes in the structure of the secondary mortgage markets which the Company utilizes to sell mortgage loans may be introduced and may increase costs and make it more difficult to operate a residential mortgage origination business. Any of the actions described above could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nNoncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations could result in fines or sanctions against the Company.\n\nThe Bank Secrecy Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and to file reports such as suspicious activity and currency transaction reports. The Company is required to comply with these and other anti-money laundering requirements. The federal banking agencies and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network are authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and have recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts against banks and other financial services providers with the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. The Company is also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC. If the Company’s policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of any financial institution the Company acquires in the future are deemed deficient, the Company would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on the Company’s ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of the Company’s business plan, including any acquisitions.\n\nFailure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nRegulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase the Company’s costs, affect or limit how the Company collects and use personal information and adversely affect its business opportunities.\n\nThe Company is subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification, and the Company could be negatively affected by these laws. For example, the Company’s business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things (i) imposes certain limitations on its ability to share nonpublic personal information about its clients with nonaffiliated third parties, (ii) requires that the Company provide certain disclosures to clients about the Company’s information collection, sharing and security practices and afford clients the right to “opt out” of any information sharing by the Company with nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions) and (iii) requires that the Company develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing appropriate safeguards based on the Company’s size and complexity, the nature and scope of the Company’s activities and the sensitivity of client information it processes, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various state and federal banking regulators and states have also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Moreover, legislators and regulators \n\n54\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nin the United States are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws, including with respect to the use of artificial intelligence by financial institutions and their service providers, that potentially could have a significant impact on the Company’s current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, the Company’s collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer or employee information and some of the Company’s current or planned business activities. This could also increase the Company’s costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives. This includes increased privacy-related enforcement activity at the federal level, by the Federal Trade Commission and the CFPB, as well as at the state level, such as with regard to mobile applications.\n\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws (including those regarding security breach notification) affecting client or employee data to which the Company is subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict the Company’s ability to provide certain products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. The Company’s failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or governmental investigations or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to the Company’s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe Federal Reserve may require the Company to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\n\nAs a matter of policy, the Federal Reserve expects a financial holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the Federal Reserve’s policy on serving as a source of financial strength. Under the “source of strength” doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the resources to provide it and therefore may be required to borrow the funds or raise capital. Any loans by a holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institution’s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the Company to make a required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nNew and future rulemaking by the CFPB and other regulators, as well as enforcement of existing consumer protection laws, may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nThe CFPB has the authority to implement and enforce a variety of existing federal consumer protection statutes and to issue new regulations but, with respect to institutions of the Company’s size, does not have primary examination and enforcement authority with respect to such laws and regulations. The authority to examine depository institutions with $10.0 billion or less in assets, like us, for compliance with federal consumer laws remains largely with the Company’s primary federal regulator, the OCC. However, the CFPB may participate in examinations of smaller institutions on a “sampling basis” and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary regulators. In some cases, regulators such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice also retain certain rulemaking or enforcement authority, and the Company also remains subject to certain state consumer protection laws. As an independent bureau within the Federal Reserve, the CFPB may impose requirements more severe than the previous bank regulatory agencies. The CFPB has placed significant emphasis on consumer complaint management and has established a public consumer complaint database to encourage consumers to file complaints they may have against financial institutions. The Company is expected to monitor and respond to these complaints, including those that the Company deems frivolous, and doing so may require management to reallocate resources away from more profitable endeavors.\n\n55\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe level of the Company’s commercial real estate portfolio may subject the Company to heightened regulatory scrutiny.\n\nThe federal banking regulators have issued the Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices guidance, or CRE Guidance, which provides supervisory criteria, including the following numerical indicators, to assist bank examiners in identifying banks with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: (i) commercial real estate loans exceeding 300% of capital and increasing 50% or more in the preceding three years; or (ii) construction and land development loans exceeding 100% of capital. The CRE Guidance does not limit the Bank’s levels of commercial real estate lending activities, but rather, guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations. On December 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies issued a statement to reinforce prudent risk-management practices related to CRE lending, having observed substantial growth in many CRE asset and lending markets, increased competitive pressures, rising CRE concentrations in banks, and an easing of CRE underwriting standards. The federal bank agencies reminded FDIC-insured institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise prudent risk-management practices to identify, measure, monitor, and manage the risks arising from CRE lending. In addition, FDIC-insured institutions must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentration risk.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Bank did not exceed these guidelines.\n\nThe Company is an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act and because the Company has decided to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting and other requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, the Company’s common stock could be less attractive to investors.\n\nFor as long as the Company remains an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, it will have the option to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting and other requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, being permitted to have an extended transition period for adopting any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the FASB or the SEC, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. The Company has elected to, and expect to continue to, take advantage of certain of these and other exemptions until it is no longer an emerging growth company. The Company will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the end of the fiscal year during which the Company has total annual gross revenues of $1.235 billion or more, (ii) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities under the Company’s registration statement on Form S-1, which was declared effective by the SEC on September 12, 2019, (iii) the date on which the Company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt and (iv) the end of the first fiscal year in which (A) the market value of the Company’s equity securities that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30 of that year, (B) the Company has been a public reporting company under the Exchange Act for at least twelve calendar months and (C) the Company has filed at least one annual report on Form 10-K. The Company expects to no longer qualify as an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2024.\n\nBecause the Company has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards for an emerging growth company, the Company’s financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with these accounting standards as of the public company effective dates.\n\nThe Company has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act. This election allows the Company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, the Company’s financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with these accounting standards as of the public company effective dates. Because the Company’s financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates, investors may have difficulty evaluating or comparing the Company’s business, financial results or prospects in \n\n56\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\ncomparison to other public companies, which may have a negative impact on the value and liquidity of the Company’s common stock. The Company cannot predict if investors will find its common stock less attractive because the Company plans to rely on this exemption. If some investors find the Company’s common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for the Company’s common stock and the Company’s stock price may be more volatile.\n\nCertain banking laws and certain provisions of the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect.\n\nProvisions of federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it difficult for a third party to acquire the Company, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to the Company’s stockholders. In general, acquisitions of 10% or more of any class of voting stock of a bank holding company or depository institution generally creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer “controls” the bank holding company or depository institution. Also, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before, among other things, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank, including the Bank.\n\nThere are also provisions in the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging another party from acquiring control of the Company, even if such acquisition would be viewed by the Company’s stockholders to be in their best interests. These include supermajority stockholder voting thresholds and requirements relating to stockholder meetings and nominations or proposals. The Company is also subject to a statutory antitakeover provision included in the DGCL. In addition, the Company’s Board of Directors is authorized under its certificate of incorporation to issue shares of preferred stock, and determine the rights, terms conditions and privileges of such preferred stock, without stockholder approval. These provisions may effectively inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Company’s common stock.\n\nThe Company’s certificate of incorporation has an exclusive forum provision, which could limit a stockholder’s ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or other employees.\n\nThe Company’s certificate of incorporation has an exclusive forum provision providing that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on the Company’s behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty by any of the Company’s directors, officers, employees or agents; (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the DGCL, the Company’s certificate of incorporation or the Company’s bylaws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. However, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a provision, and the Company’s stockholders will not be deemed to have waived its compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\n\nThe Company’s stockholders approved this provision. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of the Company’s capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of the Company’s certificate of incorporation. The exclusive forum provision, if enforced, may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company’s directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the exclusive forum provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\n57\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 or other such laws could result in increased operating expenses as well as additional exposure to the risk of litigation by or on behalf of customers.\n\nIn June of 2018, the Governor of California signed into law The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or the CCPA. This new law became effective on January 1, 2020 and provides consumers with expansive rights and control over their personal information, which is obtained by or shared with “covered businesses,” including for-profit businesses that conduct business in California and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds. The CCPA will give consumers the right to request disclosure of information collected about them and whether that information has been sold or shared with others, the right to request deletion of personal information subject to certain exceptions, the right to opt out of the sale of the consumer’s personal information, and the right not to be discriminated against because of choices regarding the consumer’s personal information.\n\nThe CCPA provides for certain monetary penalties and for its enforcement by the California Attorney General or consumers whose rights under the law are not observed. It also provides for damages as well as injunctive or declaratory relief if there has been unauthorized access, theft, or disclosure of personal information due to failure to implement reasonable security procedures. The Company continues to assess the potential impact of the CCPA on the Company’s business, but it could result in increased operating expenses as well as additional exposure to the risk of litigation by or on behalf of consumers. It is also possible that other states where the Company has customers could enact similar laws.\n\nClimate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may result in operational changes and expenditures that could significantly impact the Company’s business. \n\nThe current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased. In recent years, governments across the world have entered into international agreements to attempt to reduce global temperatures, in part by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change. These agreements and measures may result in the imposition of taxes and fees, the required purchase of emission credits, and the implementation of significant operational changes, each of which may require the Company to expend significant capital and incur compliance, operating, maintenance, and remediation costs. Consumers and businesses may also change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. The impact on the Company’s customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on, or role in, carbon intensive activities. The Company’s efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions, including by increasing the Company’s business with climate-friendly companies, may not be effective in protecting the Company from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior.\n\nGiven the lack of empirical data on the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change, it is difficult to predict how climate change may impact the Company’s financial condition and operations; however, as a banking organization, the physical effects of climate change may present certain unique risks. For example, weather disasters, shifts in local climates, and other disruptions related to climate change may adversely affect the value of real properties securing the Company’s loans, which could diminish the value of the Company’s loan portfolio. Such events may also cause reductions in regional and local economic activity that may have an adverse effect on the Company’s customers, which could limit the Company’s ability to raise and invest capital in these areas and communities.\n\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNone.\n\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\n\nRisk Management and Strategy. The Company relies extensively on various information systems and other electronic resources to operate its business. In addition, nearly all of the Company’s customers, service providers and other business partners on whom the Company depends, including the providers of the Company’s online banking, mobile \n\n58\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nbanking and accounting systems, use these systems and their own electronic information systems. Any of these systems can be compromised, including by employees, customers and other individuals who are authorized to use them, and bad actors using sophisticated and constantly evolving set of software, tools and strategies to do so. The nature of the Company’s business, as a financial services provider, and the Company’s relative size, make the Company and its business partners high-value targets for these bad actors to pursue. See “Item 1A.

The Company’s dividend policy and practice may change in the future, however, and the Company’s Board of Directors may change or eliminate the payment of future dividends at its discretion, without notice to the Company’s stockholders. Any future determination to pay dividends to holders of the Company’s common stock will depend on its results of operations, financial condition, economic conditions, capital requirements, banking regulations, contractual restrictions and any other factors that the Company’s Board of Directors may deem relevant.\n\n62\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\n**Dividend Restrictions**\n\nAs a Delaware corporation, the Company is subject to certain restrictions on dividends under the DGCL. In general, a Delaware corporation may only pay dividends either out of surplus (as defined and computed in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL) or out of the current or the immediately preceding year’s net profits. Surplus is defined as the excess, if any, at any given time, of the total assets of a corporation over its total liabilities and statutory capital. The value of a corporation’s assets can be measured in a number of ways and may not necessarily equal their book value.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, the Company issued subordinated debt to the Bank of North Dakota pursuant to a Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement, dated March 30, 2021 (the “Note Purchase Agreement”). Under the terms of the Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement, if an event of default has occurred (as defined in the Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement), the Company cannot, subject to certain exceptions outlined in the Note Purchase Agreement, pay any dividends to its stockholders until such event of default or failure to comply with said covenants is cured, without the prior written consent of the Bank of North Dakota.\n\nUnder the terms of the Company’s junior subordinated debentures issued to its two statutory trusts, the Company is not permitted to pay dividends on its capital stock if an event of default occurs under the terms of the debentures, the Company is otherwise in default with respect to the Company’s payment obligations or the Company has elected to defer interest payments on the debentures.\n\nIn addition, the Company is subject to certain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends as a result of banking laws, regulations and policies. See “SUPERVISION AND REGULATION—Supervision and Regulation of the Company—Dividend Payments.” Because the Company is a holding company and does not engage directly in business activities of a material nature, the Company’s ability to pay dividends to its stockholders depends, in large part, upon its receipt of dividends from the Bank, which is also subject to numerous limitations on the payment of dividends under federal banking laws, regulations and policies. See “SUPERVISION AND REGULATION—Supervision and Regulation of the Bank—Dividend Payments.”\n\n**Use of Proceeds**\n\nNone.\n\nITEM 6. [RESERVED]\n\nNot applicable.\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n _The following discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the “Selected Financial Data” and the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, including but not limited to those set forth under “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The Company assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements._\n\nOverview\n\nThe Company is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Through the Company’s subsidiary, Alerus Financial, National Association, the Company provides innovative and comprehensive financial solutions to businesses and consumers through four distinct business lines—banking, retirement \n\n63\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nand benefit services, wealth management and mortgage. These solutions are delivered through a relationship oriented primary point of contact along with responsive and client friendly technology.\n\nThe Company’s primary banking market areas are the states of North Dakota, Minnesota, specifically, the Twin Cities MSA, and Arizona, specifically, the Phoenix MSA. In addition to the Company’s offices located in the Company’s banking markets, its retirement and benefit services business administers plans in all 50 states through offices located in Michigan, Minnesota and Colorado.\n\nThe Company’s business model produces strong financial performance and a diversified revenue stream, which has helped the Company establish a brand and culture yielding both a loyal client base and passionate and dedicated employees. The Company believes its client first and advice based philosophy, diversified business model and history of high performance and growth distinguishes the Company from other financial service providers. The Company generates a majority of its overall revenue from noninterest income, which is driven primarily by the Company’s retirement and benefit services, wealth management and mortgage business lines. \n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $3.9 billion of total assets, $2.8 billion of total loans, $3.1 billion of total deposits, $369.1 million of stockholders’ equity, $36.7 billion of AUA/AUM in the Company’s retirement and benefit services segment, and $4.0 billion of AUA/AUM in the Company’s wealth management segment. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had $364.1 million of mortgage originations.\n\nNet Interest Income\n\nNet interest income represents interest income less interest expense. The Company generates interest income on interest-earning assets, primarily loans and available-for-sale securities. The Company incurs interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, primarily interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. To evaluate net interest income, the Company measures and monitors: (i) yields on loans, available-for-sale securities and other interest-earning assets; (ii) the costs of deposits and other funding sources; (iii) the rates incurred on borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities; and (iv) the regulatory risk weighting associated with the assets. Interest income is primarily impacted by loan growth and loan repayments, along with changes in interest rates on the loans. Interest expense is primarily impacted by changes in deposit balances along with the volume and type of interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is primarily impacted by changes in market interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, and interest the Company earns on interest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities.\n\nNoninterest Income\n\nNoninterest income primarily consists of the following:\n\n●| The Company’s retirement and benefit services business, which includes retirement plan administration, retirement plan investment advisory, HSA, ESOP administration and recordkeeping, and other benefit services, is the Company’s largest source of noninterest income. Over half of the Company’s retirement and benefit services fees are transaction or participant-based fees and are impacted by the number of plans and participants. The remainder of noninterest income is based on the market value of the related AUA and AUM and impacted by the level of contributions, withdrawals, new business, lost business and fluctuation in market values.  \n---|---  \n●| Wealth management includes personal trust, investment and brokerage services. The Company earns trust, investment, and IRA fees from managing assets, including corporate trusts, personal trusts, and separately managed accounts. Trust and investment management fees are primarily based on a tiered scale relative to the market value of the AUM. Trust and investment management fees are primarily impacted by rates charged and increases and decreases in AUM. AUM is primarily impacted by opening and closing of client advisory and trust accounts, contributions and withdrawals, and the fluctuation in market values.  \n---|---  \n  \n64\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\n●| Mortgage noninterest income consists of gains on originating and selling mortgages and origination fees. Mortgage gains are primarily impacted by the level of originations, amount of loans sold, the type of loans sold and market conditions.  \n---|---  \n●| Service charges on deposit accounts are comprised of income generated through deposit account related service charges such as: electronic transfer fees, treasury management fees, bill pay fees, and other banking fees. Banking fees are primarily impacted by the level of business activities and cash movement activities of the Company’s clients.  \n---|---  \n●| Net gains (losses) on investment securities consists of the realized gains or losses related to the sale of available-for-sale investment securities.   \n---|---  \n●| Other noninterest income consists of debit card interchange income, income earned on the growth of the cash surrender value of life insurance policies the Company holds on to certain key employees, loan servicing income net of the related amortization, and any other income which does not fit within one of the specific noninterest income lines described above. Other noninterest income is generally impacted by business activities and level of transactions.  \n---|---  \n  \nNoninterest Expense\n\nNoninterest expense is comprised primarily of the following:\n\n●| Compensation and employee taxes and benefits—include all forms of personnel related expenses including salary, commissions, incentive compensation, payroll related taxes, stock-based compensation, benefit plans, health insurance, 401(k) plan match costs, ESOP and other benefit related expenses. Compensation and employee benefit costs are primarily impacted by changes in headcount and fluctuations in benefits costs.  \n---|---  \n●| Occupancy and equipment—costs related to owning and leasing the Company’s office space, depreciation charges for the furniture, fixtures and equipment, amortization of leasehold improvements, utilities and other occupancy related expenses. Occupancy and equipment costs are primarily impacted by the number and size of the locations the Company occupies.  \n---|---  \n●| Business services, software and technology—costs related to contracts with core system and third-party data processing providers, software and information technology services to support office activities and internal networks. The Company believes its technology spending enhances the efficiency of the Company’s employees and enables the Company to provide outstanding service to its clients. Technology and information system costs are primarily impacted by the number of locations the Company occupies, the number of employees, clients and volume of transactions the Company has and the level of service the Company requires from its third party technology vendors.  \n---|---  \n●| Intangible amortization expense is the result of acquisitions of fee income and banking companies. Identified intangible assets with definite lives consist of client relationship intangibles and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period representing the estimated remaining lives of the assets. The amount of expense is impacted by the timing of acquisitions and the estimated remaining lives of the assets.  \n---|---  \n●| Professional fees and assessments—costs related to legal, accounting, tax, consulting, personnel recruiting, directors fees, insurance and other outsourcing arrangements. Professional services costs are primarily impacted by corporate activities requiring specialized services. FDIC insurance expense is also included in this line and represents the assessments that the Company pays to the FDIC for deposit insurance.  \n---|---  \n●| Other operational expenses—includes costs related to marketing, donations, promotions, and expenses associated with office supplies, postage, travel expenses, meals and entertainment, dues and memberships,   \n---|---  \n  \n65\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\ncosts to maintain or prepare other real estate owned, or OREO, for sale, and other general corporate expenses that do not fit within one of the specific noninterest expense lines described above. Other operational expenses are generally impacted by the Company’s business activities and needs.  \n---  \n  \nOperating Segments\n\nThe Company measures the overall profitability of business operations based on income before income tax. The Company allocates costs to its segments, which consist primarily of compensation and overhead expense directly attributable to the products and services within banking, retirement and benefit services, wealth management, and mortgage. The Company measures the profitability of each segment based on the direct and indirect allocations of expense as it believes it better approximates the contribution generated by the Company’s reportable operating segments. All indirect overhead allocations to each segment are determined by management based on an annual review of department expenses. Income tax expense is allocated to corporate administration. A description of each segment is provided in Note 22 (Segment Reporting) of the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\nAs a result of the complex and dynamic nature of the Company’s business, management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying the most appropriate accounting policies for its various areas of operations. The policy decision process not only ensures compliance with current GAAP, but also reflects management’s discretion with regard to choosing the most suitable methodology for reporting the Company’s financial performance. It is management’s opinion that the accounting estimates covering certain aspects of the business have more significance than others due to the relative importance of those areas to overall performance, or the level of subjectivity in the selection process. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as disclosures of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The most critical of the accounting policies is discussed below.\n\nAllowance for credit losses (“ACL”)— In 2023, the Company adopted the new accounting standard for credit losses, ASU No. 2016-13 _, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses_  _(Topic 326):_  _Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments_ , as amended (“ASU 2016-13”). This new accounting standard, commonly referred to as “CECL,” significantly changed the Company’s methodology for accounting for reserves on loans, unfunded off balance sheet credit exposures, including certain unfunded loan commitments and standby guarantees, as well as introduced the consideration for an allowance on HTM investment securities. ASU 2016-13 replaced the “incurred loss” methodology used prior to 2023 to establish an allowance on loans and off-balance sheet credit exposures, with an “expected loss” approach. Under CECL, the ACL at each reporting period serves as our best estimate of projected credit losses over the contractual life of certain assets, adjusted for expected prepayments, given an expectation of economic conditions and forecasts as of the valuation date.\n\n​\n\nThe recorded ACL on loans and HTM investment securities is determined based on the amortized cost basis of the assets and may be determined at various levels, including homogeneous loan pools, individual credits with unique risk factors, and homogenous HTM investment securities pools, by credit rating. Since adoption of CECL in 2023, the Company has used a discounted cash flow approach to calculate the ACL for each loan segment. Within the discounted cash flow model, a probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”) assumption is applied to calculate the expected loss for each loan segment. PD is the probability the asset will default within a given timeframe and LGD is the percentage of the assets not expected to be collected due to default. PD and LGD data is derived using a combination of external data and internal historical default and loss experience.\n\n​\n\nCECL may create more volatility in our ACL, particularly our ACL on loans and ACL on off balance sheet credit exposures. Under CECL, our ACL may increase or decrease period to period based on many factors, including, but not limited to: macroeconomic forecasts and conditions; a change in the prepayment speed assumption; an increase or decrease in loan balances, including changes to the Company’s loan portfolio mix; credit quality of the loan portfolio; and various qualitative factors outlined in ASU 2016-13.\n\n​\n\n66\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nASU 2016-13 also changed the Company’s methodology and accounting for credit losses within the investment portfolio designated as AFS. To the extent the fair value of a security designated as AFS is less than its amortized cost and the Company either intends to sell the security or it is more-likely-than-not the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, then the investment is permanently impaired and the amortized cost basis is written down to fair value and a corresponding impairment charge is recorded within the consolidated statements of income. If neither of the above is true, but the fair value of the investment is below its amortized cost basis at the reporting date, then an allowance is established on the AFS investment for the portion of the impairment that is due to credit reasons (e.g. credit rating downgrades, past due receivables, and/or other macro- or micro-adverse trends). The allowance established on an AFS investment due to credit losses is limited to the amount the fair value of the investment is below its amortized cost basis as of the reporting date. If the fair value of the investment is below its amortized cost basis for non-credit-related reasons (e.g. interest rate environment), then the impairment continues to be recognized within stockholders' equity through AOCI.\n\n​\n\n _ACL on Loans._ The Company considers the ACL on loans to be a critical accounting policy given the uncertainty in evaluating the allowance required to cover management’s estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of the loans in its portfolio. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is a key management function that requires significant judgment and estimate by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the current loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance in future periods. While the Company’s current evaluation indicates that the ACL on loans at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was appropriate, the allowance may need to be increased under adversely different conditions or assumptions.\n\n​\n\nThe significant key assumptions used with the ACL on loans calculation at December 31, 2023 using the CECL methodology, included:\n\n​\n\n●|  _Macroeconomic factors (loss drivers):_ Macroeconomic factors are used within our discounted cash flow model to forecast the PD over the forecast period. As macroeconomic factors condition worsen, the PD increases, and the corresponding LGD increases, resulting in an increase in the ACL on loans. The Company utilizes National unemployment, changes in National GDP, and changes in National Housing Price Index in estimation of the ACL on loans. Macroeconomic factors used in the calculation of the ACL on loans may change from time to time and in times of greater uncertainty. The Company may consider a range of possible forecasts and evaluate the probability of each scenario.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●|  _Forecast Period and Reversion speed:_ ASU 2016-13 requires a company to use a reasonable and supportable forecast period in developing the ACL, which represents the time period that management believes it can reasonably forecast the identified loss drivers. Generally, the forecast period management believes to be reasonable and supportable is set annually and validated through an assessment of economic leading indicators. In periods of greater volatility and uncertainty, such as that seen across the global markets and economies, including the U.S., the Company may elect to use a shorter forecast period, whereas when markets, economies and various other factors are considered more stable and certain, the Company may elect to use a longer forecast period. Generally, the Company expects its forecast period to range from one to two years. Once the reasonable and supportable forecast period is determined, ASU 2016-13 requires a company to revert its loss expectations to the long-run historical mean for the remainder of the contract life of the asset, adjusted for prepayments. In determining the length of time over which the reversion will take place (_i.e._ “reversion speed”), the Company considers such factors such as, but not limited to, historical loan loss experience over previous economic cycles, as well as where the Company believes it is within the current economic cycle. At December 31, 2023, the Company used a one-year forecast period and one-year reversion period for each loan segment to measure the ACL on loans.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●|  _Prepayment speeds:_ Prepayment speeds are determined for each loan segment utilizing the Company’s own historical loan data, as well as consideration of current environmental factors. The prepayment speed assumption is utilized with the discounted cash flow model (_i.e_. the CECL model) to forecast expected cash flows over the contractual life of the loan, adjusted for expected prepayments. A higher prepayment speed assumption will drive a lower ACL, and vice versa.  \n---|---  \n  \n67\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\n​\n\n●|  _Qualitative factors:_ ASU 2016-13 requires companies to consider various qualitative factors that may impact expected credit losses. The Company continues to consider qualitative factors in determining and arriving at our ACL on loans each reporting period.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the recorded ACL on loans was $35.8 million and represented the Company’s best estimate of expected credit losses within the loan portfolio. However, the Company may adjust its assumptions to account for differences between expected and actual losses each period. A future change of the Company’s assumptions will likely alter the level of allowance required and may have a material impact on future results of operations and financial condition. The ACL is reviewed periodically within a calendar quarter to assess trends in the aforementioned key assumptions, as well as asset quality within the loan portfolio, and the Company considers the impact of these trends on the ACL and the Company's financial condition, if any. The ACL on loans is reviewed and approved on a quarterly basis by the ACL Governance Committee, and later reviewed and ratified by the Bank's Board of Directors.\n\n​\n\nRefer to “—Results of Operations—Provision for Credit Losses,” “—Financial Condition—Asset Quality,” and Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n\n​\n\n _ACL on Off Balance Sheet Credit Exposures._ The Company considers the ACL on off balance sheet credit exposures to be a critical accounting policy given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover management’s estimate of all expected credit losses on expected future loan fundings of, primarily, unfunded loan commitments for those that are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The expected credit loss factor calculated for each loan segment using the ACL on loans methodology described above, as well as within Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, is used to calculate the ACL on off balance sheet credit exposures for each applicable loan segment, and, thus, are subject to the same level of estimation risk and volatility previously described. In addition, one other key assumption is used to derive the allowance on off balance sheet credit exposures and that is the expected funding rate. The expected funding rate is derived using historical loan level data for credit line usage, and is applied to total off balance sheet credit exposures at each reporting date, excluding any that are unconditionally cancellable by the Company, to determine the expected funding amount. As unfunded loan commitments are funded, the allowance migrates from that provided for off balance sheet credit exposures to the ACL on loans. If the expected funding rate or any other key assumption used is not reasonable, then this could have an adverse impact on the total ACL upon funding.\n\n​\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the recorded ACL on off balance sheet credit exposures was $7.4 million and presented within accrued interest and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Increases (decreases) to the allowance are presented within provision (credit) for credit losses on the consolidated statements of income. The allowance at December 31, 2023, represented the Company’s best estimate, however, it may adjust assumptions to account for differences between expected and actual losses from period to period. A future change to the Company’s assumptions will likely alter the level of allowance required and may have a material impact on future results of operations and financial condition.\n\n​\n\nRefer to “—Results of Operations—Provision for Credit Losses,” “—Financial Condition—Asset Quality,” and Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n\n​\n\n _ACL for HTM Debt Securities._ The estimate of expected credit losses on the Company’s HTM investment portfolio utilizes external PD and LGD data by credit rating to determine a loss rate. Management may exercise discretion to make adjustments based on various environmental factors.\n\n​\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company held securities in its HTM portfolio with an amortized cost basis of $299.7 million that primarily consisted of MBS and CMO debt securities issued, municipal bonds or guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies. Under ASU 2016-13 the Company has the ability to exclude certain securities when the historical credit loss information, adjusted for current conditions and forecasts, resulting in zero risk of nonpayment of the amortized cost basis of the security. Management has evaluated and determined zero risk of nonpayment on all securities guaranteed by the U.S government agencies. At December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an ACL on HTM debt securities of $213 thousand.\n\n​\n\n68\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nRefer to “—Financial Condition—Investments” and Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n\n​\n\n _ACL on AFS Debt Securities._ The Company considers the ACL on AFS debt securities to be a critical accounting policy given the size of the investment portfolio and level of estimation used to determine the allowance, as appropriate. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's AFS portfolio was entirely made up of assets that are fair valued using level 2 valuation techniques in accordance with ASC 820,  _Fair Value Measurement_. The Company engages a third party pricing agency to assist with the valuation of such debt securities and the assets are carried at fair value at each reporting period. An allowance is recorded on an AFS debt security to the extent an event has occurred that suggests receipt of full contractual payments are at risk. When such an event has been identified, a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the expected losses due to credit risk, and an allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the debt security by the calculated expected loss amount, limited to the amount by which the fair value of the debt security is below its amortized cost basis.\n\n​\n\nAs further described within “—Financial Condition—Investments,” the Company's AFS portfolio, as of December 31, 2023, primarily consisted of MBS and CMO debt securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies, and, thus, presenting little to no credit risk. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had not identified indications of credit risk and did not carry any allowance for credit losses on its AFS portfolio, nor did it record any permanent impairments during 2023, 2022 or 2021.\n\n​\n\nRefer to “—Financial Condition—Investments” and Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n\n​\n\nIntangible assets—As a result of acquisitions, the Company carries goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets at the acquisition date. Goodwill is evaluated at least annually or when business conditions suggest impairment may have occurred. Should impairment occur, goodwill will be reduced to its revised carrying value through a charge to earnings. Core deposits and other identifiable intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives. The determination of whether or not impairment exists is based upon discounted cash flow modeling techniques that require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. It also requires them to select a discount rate that reflects the current return requirements of the market in relation to present risk-free interest rates, required equity market premiums, and company-specific performance and risk metrics, all of which are susceptible to change based on changes in economic and market conditions and other factors. Future events or changes in the estimates used to determine the carrying value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations.\n\nFair value measurements—Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices, or observable market inputs. For financial instruments that are traded actively and have quoted market prices, or observable market inputs, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. However, when quoted market prices or observable market inputs are not fully available, significant management judgement may be necessary to estimate fair value. In developing our fair value measurements, we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nFinancial assets that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include investment securities, available-for-sale and derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, $495.2 million, or 12.7%, and $723.7 million, or 19.1%, respectively, of the Company’s total assets consisted of financial assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and most of these financial assets consisted of available-for-sale investment securities. The fair value of financial assets on a recurring basis are classified in either Levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Financial liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are comprised of derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, $9.2 million and $6.3 million of derivative financial instruments, respectively, were classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, representing less than 1% of the Company’s total liabilities in those years. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had no fair value assets or liabilities classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nA summary of the accounting policies used by management is disclosed in Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies) of the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\n​\n\n69\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nSelected Financial Data\n\nThe following consolidated selected financial data is derived from the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the three years ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe consolidated selected financial data presented below contains financial measures that are not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and have not been audited.

These non-GAAP financial measures include the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible common equity per share, return on average tangible common equity, net interest margin (tax-equivalent), the efficiency ratio, and the adjusted efficiency ratio. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of its performance, and believes financial analysts and others frequently use these measures, and other similar measures, to evaluate capital adequacy. Management calculates: (i) tangible common equity as total common stockholders’ equity, less goodwill and other intangible assets; (ii) tangible common equity per share as tangible common equity divided by shares of common stock outstanding; (iii) tangible assets as total assets, less goodwill and other intangible assets; (iv) return on average tangible common equity as net income adjusted for intangible amortization net of tax, divided by average tangible common equity; (v) net interest margin (tax-equivalent) as net interest income plus a tax-equivalent adjustment, divided by average earning assets; (vi) efficiency ratio as noninterest expense less intangible amortization expense, divided by net interest income plus noninterest income plus a tax-equivalent adjustment; and (vii) adjusted efficiency ratio as noninterest expense less intangible amortization expense, divided by net interest income plus noninterest income plus a tax-equivalent adjustment less net gains (losses) on investment securities.\n\nThe following tables present these non-GAAP financial measures along with the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP for the periods indicated.\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **December 31,**|  ​| **December 31,**|  ​| **December 31,**  \n​| **2023**|  ​| **2022**|  ​| **2021**  \n**Tangible common equity to tangible assets**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nTotal common stockholders’ equity| ​| $|  369,127| ​| ​| $|  356,872| ​| ​| $|  359,403| ​  \nLess: Goodwill| ​| ​|  46,783| ​| ​| ​|  47,087| ​| ​| ​|  31,490| ​  \nLess: Other intangible assets| ​| ​|  17,158| ​| ​| ​|  22,455| ​| ​| ​|  20,250| ​  \nTangible common equity **(a)**|  ​| ​|  305,186| ​| ​| ​|  287,330| ​| ​| ​|  307,663| ​  \nTotal assets| ​| ​|  3,907,713| ​| ​| ​|  3,779,637| ​| ​| ​|  3,392,691| ​  \nLess: Goodwill| ​| ​|  46,783| ​| ​| ​|  47,087| ​| ​| ​|  31,490| ​  \nLess: Other intangible assets| ​| ​|  17,158| ​| ​| ​|  22,455| ​| ​| ​|  20,250| ​  \nTangible assets **(b)**|  ​| ​|  3,843,772| ​| ​| ​|  3,710,095| ​| ​| ​|  3,340,951| ​  \nTangible common equity to tangible assets **(a)/(b)**|  ​| ​|  7.94| %| ​| ​|  7.74| %| ​| ​|  9.21| %  \n**Tangible book value per common share**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nTotal common stockholders’ equity| ​| $|  369,127| ​| ​| $|  356,872| ​| ​| $|  359,403| ​  \nLess: Goodwill| ​| ​|  46,783| ​| ​| ​|  47,087| ​| ​| ​|  31,490| ​  \nLess: Other intangible assets| ​| ​|  17,158| ​| ​| ​|  22,455| ​| ​| ​|  20,250| ​  \nTangible common equity **(c)**|  ​| ​|  305,186| ​| ​| ​|  287,330| ​| ​| ​|  307,663| ​  \nTotal common shares issued and outstanding **(d)**|  ​| ​|  19,734| ​| ​| ​|  19,992| ​| ​| ​|  17,213| ​  \nTangible book value per common share **(c)/(d)**|  ​| $|  15.46| ​| ​| $|  14.37| ​| ​| $|  17.87| ​  \n  \n​\n\n71\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **December 31,**|  ​| **December 31,**|  ​| **December 31,**  \n​| **2023**|  ​| **2022**|  ​| **2021**  \n**Return on average tangible common equity**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nNet income| ​| $|  11,696| ​| ​| $|  40,005| ​| ​| $|  52,681| ​  \nAdd: Intangible amortization expense (net of tax)| ​| ​|  4,184| ​| ​| ​|  3,756| ​| ​| ​|  3,460| ​  \nNet income, excluding intangible amortization **(e)**|  ​| ​|  15,880| ​| ​| ​|  43,761| ​| ​| ​|  56,141| ​  \nAverage total equity| ​| ​|  358,268| ​| ​| ​|  346,355| ​| ​| ​|  346,059| ​  \nLess: Average goodwill| ​| ​|  46,959| ​| ​| ​|  39,415| ​| ​| ​|  30,385| ​  \nLess: Average other intangible assets (net of tax)| ​| ​|  15,624| ​| ​| ​|  17,018| ​| ​| ​|  18,548| ​  \nAverage tangible common equity **(f)**|  ​| ​|  295,685| ​| ​| ​|  289,922| ​| ​| ​|  297,126| ​  \nReturn on average tangible common equity **(e)/(f)**|  ​| ​|  5.37| %| ​| ​|  15.09| %| ​| ​|  18.89| %  \n**Efficiency ratio**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nNoninterest expense| ​| $|  150,157| ​| ​| $|  158,770| ​| ​| $|  168,909| ​  \nLess: Intangible amortization expense| ​| ​|  5,296| ​| ​| ​|  4,754| ​| ​| ​|  4,380| ​  \nAdjusted noninterest expense **(g)**|  ​| ​|  144,861| ​| ​| ​|  154,016| ​| ​| ​|  164,529| ​  \nNet interest income| ​| ​|  87,839| ​| ​| ​|  99,729| ​| ​| ​|  87,099| ​  \nNoninterest income| ​| ​|  80,229| ​| ​| ​|  111,223| ​| ​| ​|  147,387| ​  \nTax-equivalent adjustment| ​| ​|  671| ​| ​| ​|  429| ​| ​| ​|  492| ​  \nTotal tax-equivalent revenue **(h)**|  ​| ​|  168,739| ​| ​| ​|  211,381| ​| ​| ​|  234,978| ​  \nEfficiency ratio **(g)/(h)**|  ​| ​|  85.85| %| ​| ​|  72.86| %| ​| ​|  70.02| %  \n**Adjusted efficiency ratio**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nNoninterest expense| ​| $|  150,157| ​| ​| $|  158,770| ​| ​| $|  168,909| ​  \nLess: Intangible amortization expense| ​| ​|  5,296| ​| ​| ​|  4,754| ​| ​| ​|  4,380| ​  \nAdjusted noninterest expense **(i)**|  ​| ​|  144,861| ​| ​| ​|  154,016| ​| ​| ​|  164,529| ​  \nNet interest income| ​| ​|  87,839| ​| ​| ​|  99,729| ​| ​| ​|  87,099| ​  \nNoninterest income| ​| ​|  80,229| ​| ​| ​|  111,223| ​| ​| ​|  147,387| ​  \nTax-equivalent adjustment| ​| ​|  671| ​| ​| ​|  429| ​| ​| ​|  492| ​  \nLess: Net gains (losses) on investment securities| ​| ​|  (24,643)| ​| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​| ​|  125| ​  \nTotal tax-equivalent revenue **(j)**|  ​| ​|  193,382| ​| ​| ​|  211,381| ​| ​| ​|  234,853| ​  \nAdjusted efficiency ratio **(i)/(j)**|  ​| ​|  74.91| %| ​| ​|  72.86| %| ​| ​|  70.06| %  \n  \n​\n\nResults of Operations\n\nThe following discussion describes the consolidated operations and financial condition of the Company and the Bank. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 are compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the consolidated financial condition of the Company as of December 31, 2023 is compared to December 31, 2022. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to results for the year ended December 31, 2021, can be found in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company’s 2022 annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 10, 2023.\n\nSummary\n\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $11.7 million, a decrease of $28.3 million, or 70.8%, compared to $40.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.58 in 2023, compared to $2.10 in 2022. Return on average total assets was 0.31% in 2023, compared to 1.14% for 2022. The decrease in net income was primarily driven by a $31.0 million decrease in noninterest income and a $11.9 million decrease in net interest income, partially offset by an $8.6 million decrease in noninterest expense. Noninterest income decreased primarily due to a $24.6 million loss on investment securities as a result of a strategic balance sheet repositioning in the fourth quarter, as well as an $8.5 million decrease in mortgage banking revenue, attributable to a decrease in mortgage originations due to the impact of higher interest rates. The decrease in net interest income was due to heightened deposit competition, the impact of rising short-term interest rates on indexed money market deposits, and clients moving deposits out of noninterest bearing products into interest-bearing products. The decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to a $4.4 million decrease in compensation expense, driven by a decrease in mortgage incentives associated with the decrease in mortgage originations.\n\n72\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nNet Interest Income—With Nontaxable Income Converted to Fully Taxable Equivalent, or FTE\n\nNet interest income totaled $87.8 million in 2023, a decrease of $11.9 million, or 11.90%, from 2022. Net interest margin decreased 58 basis points to 2.46% in 2023, from the 3.04% reported in 2022. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily a result of a $61.2 million increase in interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by a $49.3 million increase in interest income on interest earning assets. The increase in interest expense was primarily driven by a 220 basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities due to increases in short-term interest rates and a highly competitive deposit environment. Additionally, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $411.6 million, driven by increased short-term borrowings to support loan growth, core deposit growth, and deposit migration from noninterest bearing deposit accounts into interest bearing deposit accounts. The increase in the interest income earned on interest bearing assets was driven by a 105 basis point increase in the average rate earned on loans as well as a $475.6 million increase in the average balance of total loans from organic growth.\n\nThe following table sets forth information related to the Company’s average balance sheet, average yields on assets, and average rates of liabilities for the periods indicated. The Company derived these yields by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities. The Company derived average balances from the daily balances throughout the periods indicated. Average loan balances include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual, while interest previously accrued on these loans is reversed against interest income.

Rates and Operating Interest Differential\n\nIncreases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on interest earning assets and the interest incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous period’s average rate. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average rate by the previous period’s volume.\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Year ended December 31, 2023**| **Year ended December 31, 2022**  \n​| ​| **Compared with**|  ​| **Compared with**  \n​| ​| **Year ended December 31, 2022**| **Year ended December 31, 2021**  \n​| ​| **Change due to:**|  ​| **Interest**| **Change due to:**|  ​| **Interest**  \n _(tax-equivalent basis, dollars in thousands)_| **Volume**| **Rate**| **Variance**| **Volume**| **Rate**| **Variance**  \n**Interest earning assets**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nInterest-bearing deposits with banks| ​| $|  (230)| ​| $|  846| ​| $|  616| ​| $|  (231)| ​| $|  495| ​| $|  264  \nInvestment securities| ​|  (3,250)| ​|  4,116| ​|  866| ​| ​|  4,447| ​|  5,714| ​|  10,161  \nFed funds sold| ​| ​|  (192)| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  (192)| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  192| ​| ​|  192  \nLoans held for sale| ​|  (394)| ​|  260| ​|  (134)| ​| ​|  (937)| ​|  298| ​|  (639)  \nLoans| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nCommercial:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nCommercial and industrial| ​|  2,638| ​|  8,344| ​|  10,982| ​| ​|  (3,533)| ​|  1,092| ​|  (2,441)  \nReal estate construction| ​|  1,877| ​|  2,430| ​|  4,307| ​| ​|  883| ​|  705| ​|  1,588  \nCommercial real estate| ​|  11,131| ​|  10,257| ​|  21,388| ​| ​|  5,345| ​|  2,764| ​|  8,109  \nTotal commercial| ​|  15,646| ​|  21,031| ​|  36,677| ​| ​|  2,695| ​|  4,561| ​|  7,256  \nConsumer| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nResidential real estate first mortgage| ​|  4,171| ​|  2,496| ​|  6,667| ​| ​|  3,811| ​|  187| ​|  3,998  \nResidential real estate junior lien| ​|  929| ​|  3,488| ​|  4,417| ​| ​|  235| ​|  894| ​|  1,129  \nOther revolving and installment| ​|  (781)| ​|  435| ​|  (346)| ​| ​|  (243)| ​|  231| ​|  (12)  \nTotal consumer| ​|  4,319| ​|  6,419| ​|  10,738| ​| ​|  3,803| ​|  1,312| ​|  5,115  \nTotal loans| ​|  19,965| ​|  27,450| ​|  47,415| ​| ​|  6,498| ​|  5,873| ​|  12,371  \nFederal Reserve/FHLB Stock| ​|  648| ​|  329| ​|  977| ​| ​|  327| ​|  181| ​|  508  \nTotal interest income| ​|  16,547| ​|  33,001| ​|  49,548| ​| ​|  10,104| ​|  12,561| ​|  22,665  \n**Interest-bearing liabilities**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nInterest-bearing demand deposits| ​|  167| ​|  8,189| ​|  8,356| ​| ​|  (7)| ​|  536| ​|  529  \nMoney market and savings deposits| ​|  30| ​|  26,519| ​|  26,549| ​| ​|  135| ​|  4,455| ​|  4,590  \nTime deposits| ​|  572| ​|  8,741| ​|  9,313| ​| ​|  34| ​|  355| ​|  389  \nFed funds purchased| ​|  5,522| ​|  8,207| ​|  13,729| ​| ​|  —| ​|  1,554| ​|  1,554  \nShort-term borrowings| ​|  745| ​|  2,163| ​|  2,908| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  2,785| ​| ​|  2,785  \nLong-term debt| ​|  1| ​|  340| ​|  341| ​| ​|  303| ​|  140| ​|  443  \nTotal interest expense| ​|  7,037| ​|  54,159| ​|  61,196| ​| ​|  465| ​|  9,825| ​|  10,290  \nChange in net interest income| ​| $|  9,510| ​| $|  (21,158)| ​| $|  (11,648)| ​| ​|  9,639| ​| $|  2,736| ​| $|  12,375  \n  \n​\n\nProvision for Credit Losses\n\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses expense of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to no provision for credit losses expense for the year ended December 31, 2022. The provision for credit losses expense for the year ended December 31, 2023, included $(225) thousand recovery for credit losses on loans, $2.2 million in provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments and $40 thousand in provision for credit losses on investment securities held-to-maturity. The Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, accounting standard requires the Company to recognize losses over the expected life of the loan as opposed to the losses expected to already have been incurred. The increase in provision for credit losses is primarily a result of a change in forecasting assumptions brought about by the new methodology as well as strong loan growth and unfunded commitments.\n\n75\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nNoninterest Income\n\nThe following table presents noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Year ended December 31,**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_| **2023**| **2022**| **$ Change**| **% Change**| **2022**| **2021**| **$ Change**| **% Change**  \nRetirement and benefit services| ​| $|  65,294| ​| $|  67,135| ​| $|  (1,841)| ​|  (2.7)| % | ​| $|  67,135| ​| $|  71,709| ​| $|  (4,574)| ​|  (6.4)| %   \nWealth management| ​|  21,855| ​|  20,870| ​|  985| ​|  4.7| % | ​|  20,870| ​|  21,052| ​|  (182)| ​|  (0.9)| %   \nMortgage banking| ​|  8,411| ​|  16,921| ​|  (8,510)| ​|  (50.3)| % | ​|  16,921| ​|  48,502| ​|  (31,581)| ​|  (65.1)| %   \nService charges on deposit accounts| ​|  1,280| ​|  1,434| ​|  (154)| ​|  (10.7)| % | ​|  1,434| ​|  1,395| ​|  39| ​|  2.8| %   \nNet gains (losses) on investment securities| ​|  (24,643)| ​|  —| ​|  (24,643)| ​|  100.0| % | ​|  —| ​|  125| ​|  (125)| ​|  (100.0)| %   \nOther| ​|  8,032| ​|  4,863| ​|  3,169| ​|  65.2| % | ​|  4,863| ​|  4,604| ​|  259| ​|  5.6| %   \nTotal noninterest income| ​| $|  80,229| ​| $|  111,223| ​| $|  (30,994)| ​|  (27.9)| % | ​| $|  111,223| ​| $|  147,387| ​| $|  (36,164)| ​|  (24.5)| %   \nNoninterest income as a % of revenue| ​| ​|  47.7| % | ​|  52.7| % | ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​|  52.7| % | ​|  62.9| % | ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n  \n​\n\nTotal noninterest income decreased $31.0 million, or 27.9%, to $80.2 million in 2023, from $111.2 million for 2022. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily driven by the previously announced balance sheet repositioning, as a result of which a $24.6 million loss on the sale of investment securities was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023. Mortgage banking revenue decreased $8.5 million in 2023 primarily as a result of a $448.2 million, or 55.2%, decrease in mortgage originations due to the impact of higher interest rates. \n\nNoninterest income as a percent of total operating revenue, which consists of net interest income plus noninterest income, was 47.7% in 2023, down from 52.7% the prior year. The decrease in 2023 was due to a 27.9% decrease in noninterest income and an 11.9% decrease in net interest income.\n\nNoninterest Expense\n\nThe following table presents noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Year ended December 31,**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_| **2023**| **2022**| **$ Change**| **% Change**| **2022**| **2021**| **$ Change**| **% Change**  \nCompensation| ​| $|  76,290| ​| $|  80,656| ​| $|  (4,366)| ​|  (5.4)| % | ​| $|  80,656| ​| $|  93,386| ​| $|  (12,730)| ​|  (13.6)| %   \nEmployee taxes and benefits| ​|  20,051| ​|  21,915| ​|  (1,864)| ​|  (8.5)| % | ​|  21,915| ​| ​|  22,033| ​|  (118)| ​|  (0.5)| %   \nOccupancy and equipment expense| ​|  7,477| ​|  7,605| ​|  (128)| ​|  (1.7)| % | ​|  7,605| ​| ​|  8,148| ​|  (543)| ​|  (6.7)| %   \nBusiness services, software and technology expense| ​|  21,053| ​|  19,487| ​|  1,566| ​|  8.0| % | ​|  19,487| ​| ​|  20,486| ​|  (999)| ​|  (4.9)| %   \nIntangible amortization expense| ​|  5,296| ​|  4,754| ​|  542| ​|  11.4| % | ​|  4,754| ​| ​|  4,380| ​|  374| ​|  8.5| %   \nProfessional fees and assessments| ​|  6,743| ​|  8,367| ​|  (1,624)| ​|  (19.4)| % | ​|  8,367| ​| ​|  6,292| ​|  2,075| ​|  33.0| %   \nMarketing and business development| ​|  3,027| ​|  3,254| ​|  (227)| ​|  (7.0)| % | ​|  3,254| ​| ​|  3,182| ​|  72| ​|  2.3| %   \nSupplies and postage| ​|  1,796| ​|  2,440| ​|  (644)| ​|  (26.4)| % | ​|  2,440| ​| ​|  2,361| ​|  79| ​|  3.3| %   \nTravel| ​|  1,189| ​|  1,182| ​|  7| ​|  0.6| % | ​|  1,182| ​| ​|  442| ​|  740| ​|  167.4| %   \nMortgage and lending expenses| ​|  1,902| ​|  2,183| ​|  (281)| ​|  (12.9)| % | ​|  2,183| ​| ​|  4,250| ​|  (2,067)| ​|  (48.6)| %   \nOther| ​|  5,333| ​|  6,927| ​|  (1,594)| ​|  (23.0)| % | ​|  6,927| ​| ​|  3,949| ​|  2,978| ​|  75.4| %   \nTotal noninterest expense| ​| $|  150,157| ​| $|  158,770| ​| $|  (8,613)| ​|  (5.4)| % | ​| $|  158,770| ​| $|  168,909| ​| $|  (10,139)| ​|  (6.0)| %   \n  \n​\n\nTotal noninterest expense decreased $8.6 million, or 5.4%, to $150.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $158.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in noninterest expense was primarily driven by a $4.4 million decrease in compensation expense, a $1.9 million decrease in employee taxes and benefits expense, and a $1.6 million decrease in professional fees and assessments expense, partially offset by an increase of $1.6 million in business services, software and technology expense. The decreases in compensation expense and employee taxes and benefits expenses were primarily driven by a decrease in mortgage incentives associated with the decrease in mortgage originations, and decreased expenses related to group insurance. Professional fees and assessments expenses decreased due to merger related expenses associated with the acquisition of Metro Phoenix Bank in 2022, partially offset by an increase in FDIC assessments. Business services, software and technology expense increased primarily due to higher contract renewals due to inflationary pressures and equipment purchases. \n\n76\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized income tax expense of $4.2 million on $15.9 million of pre-tax income, resulting in an effective tax rate of 26.2%. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized an income tax expense of $12.2 million on $52.2 million of pre-tax income, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.3%. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by items related to the acquisition of Metro Phoenix Bank in 2022 and an increase in state taxes driven by increased income earned in Minnesota and Arizona.\n\nSegment Reporting\n\nThe Company determined reportable segments based on the significance of the services offered, the significance of those services to the Company’s financial condition and operating results, and the Company’s regular review of the operating results of those services. The Company has four operating segments—banking, retirement and benefit services, wealth management, and mortgage. These segments are components for which financial information is prepared and evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.\n\nThe selected financial information presented for each segment sets forth net interest income, provision for loan losses, noninterest income, and direct and indirect noninterest expense overhead allocations. Corporate administration includes all remaining income and expenses not allocated to the four operating segments. Certain reclassification adjustments have been made between corporate administration and the various lines of business for consistency in presentation.\n\nFor additional financial information on the Company’s segments see Note 22 (Segment Reporting) of the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\nBanking\n\nThe banking segment offers a complete line of loan, deposit, cash management, and treasury services through 15 offices in North Dakota, Minnesota, and Arizona. These products and services are supported through various digital applications. The majority of the Company’s assets and liabilities are on the banking segment balance sheet.\n\nThe banking segment reported net income before taxes of $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $25.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by a $21.6 million decrease in noninterest income and a $10.5 million decrease in net interest income, partially offset by a $8.8 million decrease in noninterest expense. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company sold $171.8 million of available-for-sale (AFS) securities in a balance sheet repositioning. The sale resulted in a one-time pre-tax net loss of $24.6 million. Proceeds from the sale were reinvested into loans to new and existing clients throughout the communities the Company serves, in addition to paying down borrowings.\n\nRetirement and Benefit Services\n\nRetirement and benefit services provide the following services nationally: recordkeeping and administration services to qualified retirement plans; ESOP recordkeeping and administration; investment fiduciary services to retirement plans; HSA, flex spending account, and government health insurance program recordkeeping and administration services to employers. The division services approximately 8,300 retirement plans and more than 474,000 plan participants. In addition, the division employs approximately 243 professionals, and operates within the Company’s banking markets, as well as East Lansing, Michigan, and Lakewood, Colorado.\n\nThe retirement and benefit services segment reported net income before taxes of $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $4.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Revenue of $65.3 million, comprised of $23.1 million in asset-based revenue and $42.2 million in participant and transaction revenues, decreased $1.8 million, or 2.7%, primarily due to the divestiture of the payroll services line of business.\n\n77\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe following table presents changes in the combined AUA and AUM for the Company’s retirement and benefit services segment for the periods presented.\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Year ended**  \n​| ​| **December 31,**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_| **2023**|  ​| **2022**|  ​| **2021**  \nAUA & AUM balance beginning of period| ​| $|  32,122,520| ​| ​| $|  36,732,938| ​| ​| $|  34,199,954| ​  \nAcquired assets| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​| ​|  —| ​  \nInflows (1)| ​|  4,548,845| ​| ​|  5,735,604| ​| ​| ​|  5,589,925| ​  \nOutflows (2)| ​|  (4,836,524)| ​| ​|  (7,512,492)| ​| ​| ​|  (6,010,136)| ​  \nMarket impact (3)| ​|  4,847,584| ​| ​|  (2,833,530)| ​| ​| ​|  2,953,195| ​  \nAUA & AUM balance end of period| ​| $|  36,682,425| ​| ​| $|  32,122,520| ​| ​| $|  36,732,938| ​  \nYield (4)| ​|  0.19| % | ​|  0.20| % | ​| ​|  0.20| %   \n(1)| Inflows include new account assets, contributions, dividends and interest.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Outflows include closed account assets, withdrawals and client fees.  \n---|---  \n(3)| Market impact reflects gains and losses on portfolio investments.  \n---|---  \n(4)| Retirement and benefit services noninterest income divided by simple average ending balances.  \n---|---  \n  \nAUA and AUM for the retirement and benefit services segment was $36.7 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $4.6 billion, or 14.2%, compared to the total at December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $4.8 billion in market impact, driven by improved bond and equity markets. \n\nWealth Management\n\nThe wealth management division provides advisory and planning services, investment management, and trust and fiduciary services to clients across the Company’s footprint.\n\nWealth management reported net income before taxes of $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $3.1 million, or 23.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.

The increase was driven by a $0.3 million increase in market impact. Additionally, there was a $32 thousand increase as inflows outpaced outflows in 2023, driven by improved bond and equity markets. \n\nMortgage\n\nThe mortgage division offers first and second mortgage loans through the banking office locations.\n\nMortgage reported a net loss before taxes of $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $2.9 million, or 117.2%, from the $2.5 million net loss reported for the year ended December 31, 2022. Mortgage noninterest income for 2023 of $8.4 million decreased $8.5 million, or 50.3%, from 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in mortgage originations and a 32 basis point decrease in the gain on sale margin, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in the change in fair value of the secondary market derivatives.\n\n79\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nFinancial Condition\n\nOverview\n\nTotal assets were $3.9 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $128.1 million, or 3.4%, compared to $3.8 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in total assets was primarily due to increases of $312.1 million in loans held for investment and $64.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by a decrease of $253.0 million in investment securities.\n\nInvestment Securities\n\nThe following table presents the carrying amount of the Company’s investment securities portfolio at the dates indicated:\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **December 31, 2023**|  ​| **December 31, 2022**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **Percent of**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| **Percent of**  \n _(dollars in thousands)_| **Balance**| **Portfolio**|  ​| **Balance**| **Portfolio**  \nAvailable-for-sale| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nU.S. Treasury and agencies| ​| $|  1,120| ​|  0.1| % | ​| $|  3,520| ​|  0.3| %   \nMortgage backed securities| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nResidential agency| ​| ​|  435,594| ​|  55.4| % | ​| ​|  587,679| ​|  56.6| %   \nCommercial| ​| ​|  1,353| ​|  0.2| % | ​| ​|  63,558| ​|  6.1| %   \nAsset backed securities| ​| ​|  25| ​|  —| % | ​| ​|  34| ​|  —| %   \nCorporate bonds| ​| ​|  48,644| ​|  6.2| % | ​| ​|  62,533| ​|  6.0| %   \nTotal available-for-sale investment securities| ​|  486,736| ​|  61.9| % | ​|  717,324| ​|  69.0| %   \nHeld-to-maturity| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nObligations of state and political agencies| ​|  129,603| ​|  16.5| % | ​|  137,787| ​|  13.3| %   \nMortgage backed securities| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nResidential agency| ​| ​|  170,125| ​|  21.6| %| ​| ​|  184,115| ​|  17.7| %  \nTotal held-to-maturity investment securities| ​| ​|  299,728| ​|  38.1| % | ​| ​|  321,902| ​|  31.0| %   \nTotal investment securities| ​| $|  786,464| ​|  100.0| % | ​| $|  1,039,226| ​|  100.0| %   \n  \n​\n\nThe composition of the Company’s investment securities portfolio reflects the Company’s investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity for normal operations while providing an additional source of revenue. The investment portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet, while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds, furnishing liquidity, and supplying securities to pledge as collateral. In 2021, the Company transferred its portfolio of obligations of state and political agencies from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity to protect capital and reduce volatility in other comprehensive income due to market value changes.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, total investment securities were $0.8 billion compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2022. Investment securities as a percentage of total assets were 20.1% and 27.5%, as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The decrease in investment securities was primarily due to a strategic balance sheet repositioning in the fourth quarter, in which the Company sold $171.8 million of available-for-sale securities. Proceeds from the sale were reinvested into loans to new and existing clients in addition to paying down borrowings. Securities with a carrying value of $250.0 million were pledged at December 31, 2023, to secure public deposits and for other purposes required or permitted by law.\n\nThe net pre-tax unrealized market value loss on the available-for-sale investment portfolio as of December 31, 2023 was $98.0 million, as compared to a $132.2 million loss as of December 31, 2022. The decrease is a result of improved markets and an overall reduction of the size of the investment portfolio.\n\nThe investment portfolio is composed of U.S. Treasury debentures, U.S. Agency mortgage-backed pass-throughs, U.S. Agency, Commercial Mortgage Obligations, or CMOs, Corporate bonds and Municipal bonds.\n\n80\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 the Company held 75 tax-exempt state and local municipal securities totaling $35.0 million and held 85 tax-exempt state and local municipal securities totaling $40.9 million, respectively. Other than the aforementioned investments, at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. Government and its agencies, in an amount greater than 10% of stockholders’ equity.\n\nThe Company’s available-for-sale (“AFS”) debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position are assessed to determine if an allowance should be recorded or if a write-down is required in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13. As of and for the years ended years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not record any allowances or write-down any of the AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position. Refer to Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies) of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details of the Company’s assessment of the allowance for AFS investments as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nIn accordance with ASU 2016-13, each reporting period the Company’s held-to-maturity (“HTM”) debt securities are assessed to determine if any allowance should be recorded or if a write-down is required. As of and for the years ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an allowance of $213 thousand and did not write-down any HTM debt securities. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not record any allowances or write-down any HTM debt securities. Refer to Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies) of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details of the Company’s assessment of the allowance for HTM investments as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe investment securities presented in the following table are reported at fair value and by contractual maturity as of December 31, 2023. Actual timing may differ from contractual maturities if borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Additionally, the mortgage backed securities receive monthly principal payments, which are not reflected below.

The increase in total loans was primarily due to organic loan growth due to the Company’s expanded commercial lending team. The increases in organic loan growth included increases of $245.2 million in CRE, $47.3 million in residential real estate first mortgages, $26.2 million in real estate construction, and $11.0 million in commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by a $21.3 million decrease in other revolving and installment loans. \n\nThe Company’s loan portfolio is highly diversified. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 21.7% of loans outstanding were commercial and industrial, while 45.3% of loans outstanding were CRE, and 31.9% of loans outstanding were residential real estate. \n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **December 31, 2023**|  ​| **December 31, 2022**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **Percent of**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| **Percent of**  \n _(dollars in thousands)_|  ​| **Balance**|  ​| **Portfolio**|  ​| **Balance**|  ​| **Portfolio**  \n**Commercial and industrial:**(1)| ​| ​| ​  \nGeneral business| ​| $|  294,149| ​|  10.7| % | ​| $|  319,433| ​|  13.1| %   \nServices| ​| ​|  146,318| ​|  5.3| % | ​| ​|  108,817| ​|  4.5| %   \nRetail trade| ​| ​|  91,216| ​|  3.3| % | ​| ​|  87,525| ​|  3.6| %   \nManufacturing| ​| ​|  66,638| ​|  2.4| % | ​| ​|  68,101| ​|  2.8| %   \nTotal commercial and industrial| ​|  598,321| ​|  21.7| % | ​|  583,876| ​|  24.0| %   \n**Commercial real estate:**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nOwner occupied| ​| ​|  271,619| ​|  9.8| % | ​| ​|  258,617| ​|  10.6| %   \nNon-owner occupied| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nMultifamily| ​| ​|  245,103| ​|  8.9| % | ​| ​|  175,708| ​|  7.2| %   \nOffice| ​| ​|  124,684| ​|  4.5| % | ​| ​|  110,138| ​|  4.5| %   \nMedical office or nursing facility| ​| ​|  111,413| ​|  4.0| % | ​| ​|  42,687| ​|  1.7| %   \nIndustrial| ​| ​|  104,241| ​|  3.8| % | ​| ​|  98,470| ​|  4.0| %   \nRetail| ​| ​|  96,578| ​|  3.5| % | ​| ​|  53,254| ​|  2.2| %   \nHotel| ​| ​|  80,576| ​|  2.9| % | ​| ​|  15,666| ​|  0.6| %   \nOther commercial real estate| ​| ​|  51,866| ​|  1.9| % | ​| ​|  132,093| ​|  5.3| %   \nTotal non-owner occupied| ​| ​|  814,461| ​|  29.5| % | ​| ​|  628,016| ​|  25.5| %   \nConstruction| ​| ​|  124,034| ​|  4.5| % | ​| ​|  55,153| ​|  2.3| %   \nAgricultural real estate| ​| ​|  40,832| ​|  1.5| % | ​| ​|  37,694| ​|  1.5| %   \nTotal commercial real estate| ​| ​|  1,250,946| ​|  45.3| % | ​| ​|  979,480| ​|  39.9| %   \n**Consumer**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nResidential real estate first mortgage| ​| ​|  726,879| ​|  26.3| % | ​| ​|  679,551| ​|  27.8| %   \nResidential real estate junior lien| ​| ​|  154,134| ​|  5.6| % | ​| ​|  150,479| ​|  6.2| %   \nOther revolving and installment| ​| ​|  29,303| ​|  1.1| % | ​| ​|  50,608| ​|  2.1| %   \nTotal consumer| ​| ​|  910,316| ​|  33.0| % | ​| ​|  880,638| ​|  36.1| %   \nTotal loans| ​| $|  2,759,583| ​|  100.0| % | ​| $|  2,443,994| ​|  100.0| %   \n(1)| Includes PPP loans of $387 thousand and $737 thousand as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  \n---|---  \n  \nCommercial loans represent loans for working capital, purchases of equipment and other needs of commercial customers primarily located within our geographical footprint. These loans are underwritten individually and represent ongoing relationships based on a thorough knowledge of the customer, the customer's industry, and market. While commercial loans are generally secured by the customer's assets including real property, inventory, accounts receivable, operating equipment, and other property and may also include personal guarantees of the owners and related parties, the primary source of repayment of the loans is the ongoing cash flow from operations of the customer's business. In addition, revolving lines of credit are generally governed by a borrowing base. Inherent lending risks are monitored on a continuous basis through interim reporting, covenant testing and annual underwriting.\n\nCRE loans consist of term loans secured by a mortgage lien on the real property and includes both owner occupied CRE loans as well as non-owner-occupied loans. Non-owner occupied CRE loans consist of mortgage loans to finance investments in real property that may include, but are not limited to, multi-family, industrial, office, retail and \n\n82\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nother specific use properties as well as CRE construction loans that are offered to builders and developers generally within our geographical footprint. The primary risk characteristics in the non-owner-occupied portfolio include impacts of overall leasing rates, absorption timelines, levels of vacancy rates and operating expenses. The Company requires collateral values in excess of the loan amounts, cash flows in excess of expected debt service requirements and equity investment in the project. The expected cash flows from all significant new or renewed income producing property commitments are stress tested to reflect the risks in varying interest rates, vacancy rates and rental rates. Inherent lending risks are monitored on a continuous basis through quarterly monitoring and our annual underwriting process, incorporating an analysis of cash flow, collateral, market conditions and guarantor liquidity, if applicable. CRE loan policies are specific to individual product types and underwriting parameters vary depending on the risk profile of each asset class. CRE loan policies are reviewed no less than semi-annually by management and approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors to ensure they align with current market conditions and the Bank’s moderate risk appetite. Construction loans are monitored monthly and includes on-site inspections. Management reviews all construction loans quarterly to ensure projects are on time and within budget. CRE concentration limits have been established by product type and are monitored quarterly by the Bank’s Credit Governance Committee and Bank Board of Directors. \n\nCRE loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The Company does not monitor the CRE portfolio for attributes such as loan to value ratios, occupancy rates, and net operating income as these characteristics are assessed and evaluated on an individual loan basis. Portfolio stress testing is completed based on property type and takes into consideration changes to net operating income and capitalization rates. The Company does not have exposure to the office building sector in central business districts as the office portfolio is generally diversified in suburban markets with strong occupancy levels. As of December 31, 2023, at 202%, the Company’s applicable investor commercial real estate loans, as a percentage of its risk-based capital, remained below the regulatory guideline limit of 300%. Construction loans at 31% were also below the regulatory guideline limit of 100%.\n\nThe following table presents the geographical markets of the collateral related to the non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans for the periods presented:\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **December 31, 2023**|  ​| **December 31, 2022**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **Percent of**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| **Percent of**  \n _(dollars in thousands)_|  ​| **Balance**|  ​| **Total**|  ​| **Balance**|  ​| **Total**  \n**Geographical Market:**|  ​| ​| ​| ​  \nMinnesota| ​| $|  394,754| ​|  48.5| % | ​| $|  257,844| ​|  41.1| %   \nNorth Dakota| ​| ​|  214,884| ​|  26.4| % | ​| ​|  187,477| ​|  29.9| %   \nArizona| ​| ​|  139,450| ​|  17.1| % | ​| ​|  143,483| ​|  22.8| %   \nMissouri| ​| ​|  15,969| ​|  2.0| % | ​| ​|  15,963| ​|  2.5| %   \nOregon| ​| ​|  14,953| ​|  1.8| % | ​| ​|  —| ​|  —| %   \nSouth Dakota| ​| ​|  14,790| ​|  1.8| % | ​| ​|  4,438| ​|  0.7| %   \nOther| ​| ​|  19,661| ​|  2.4| % | ​| ​|  18,811| ​|  3.0| %   \nTotal non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans| ​| $|  814,461| ​|  100.0| % | ​| $|  628,016| ​|  100.0| %   \n  \n​\n\nThe Bank does not currently monitor owner occupied CRE loans based on geographical markets as the primary source of repayment for these loans is predicated on the cash flow from the underlying operating entity. These loans are generally located within the Company’s geographical footprint.\n\nHighly competitive conditions continue to prevail in the small and middle market commercial segments in which the Company primarily operates. The Company maintains a commitment to generating growth in the Company’s business portfolio in a manner that adheres to its twin goals of maintaining strong asset quality and producing profitable margins. The Company continues to invest in additional personnel, technology, and business development resources to further strengthen its capabilities.\n\nResidential real estate loans represent loans to consumers for the purchase or refinance of a residence. These loans are generally financed over a 15- to 30-year term and, in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence with both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate terms. Real estate construction loans are also offered to consumers who wish to build their own homes and are often structured to be converted to permanent loans at the end of \n\n83\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nthe construction phase, which is typically twelve months. Residential real estate loans also include home equity loans and lines of credit that are secured by a first- or second lien on the borrower’s residence. Home equity lines of credit consist mainly of revolving lines of credit secured by residential real estate. \n\nConsumer loans include loans made to individuals not secured by real estate, including loans secured by automobiles or watercraft, and personal unsecured loans. \n\nThe Company originates both fixed and adjustable rate residential real estate loans conforming to the underwriting guidelines of the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, as well as home equity loans and lines of credit that are secured by first or junior liens. Most of the Company’s fixed rate residential loans, along with some of the Company’s adjustable rate mortgages are sold to other financial institutions with which the Company has established a correspondent lending relationship.\n\nThe Company’s consumer mortgage loans have minimal direct exposure to subprime mortgages as the loans are underwritten to conform to secondary market standards. Volume in this portion of the loan portfolio increased over the last few years due to low long-term interest rates and comparatively stable real estate valuations in the Company’s primary markets. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s consumer mortgage portfolio was $881.0 million, which was a $51.0 million, or 9.4%, increase from $830.0 million as of December 31, 2022. Market interest rates, expected duration, and the Company’s overall interest rate sensitivity profile continue to be the most significant factors in determining whether the Company chooses to retain versus sell portions of new consumer mortgage originations.\n\n84\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe following table shows the maturities and sensitivity to interest rates for the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2023:\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **December 31, 2023**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **After one**|  ​| **After five**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **One year**|  ​| **but within**|  ​| **but within**|  ​| **After**|  ​| ​| ​  \n _(dollars in thousands)_| **or less**| **five years**| **fifteen years**|  ​| **fifteen years**| **Total**  \n**Commercial**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nCommercial and industrial| ​| $|  127,510| ​| $|  279,282| ​| $|  191,529| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  598,321  \nReal estate construction| ​|  9,694| ​|  101,803| ​|  10,346| ​|  2,191| ​|  124,034  \nCommercial real estate| ​|  84,702| ​|  563,573| ​|  413,383| ​|  65,254| ​|  1,126,912  \nTotal commercial| ​|  221,906| ​|  944,658| ​|  615,258| ​|  67,445| ​|  1,849,267  \n**Consumer**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nResidential real estate first mortgage| ​|  5,267| ​|  30,295| ​|  45,545| ​|  645,772| ​|  726,879  \nResidential real estate junior lien| ​|  7,746| ​|  22,153| ​|  33,039| ​|  91,196| ​|  154,134  \nOther revolving and installment| ​|  7,743| ​|  18,787| ​|  2,773| ​|  —| ​|  29,303  \nTotal consumer| ​|  20,756| ​|  71,235| ​|  81,357| ​|  736,968| ​|  910,316  \nTotal loans| ​| $|  242,662| ​| $|  1,015,893| ​| $|  696,615| ​| $|  804,413| ​| $|  2,759,583  \n**Loans with fixed interest rates:**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Commercial**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nCommercial and industrial| ​| $|  17,025| ​| $|  218,174| ​| $|  74,354| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  309,553  \nReal estate construction| ​|  954| ​|  27,315| ​|  8,666| ​|  —| ​|  36,935  \nCommercial real estate| ​|  65,203| ​|  386,005| ​|  276,182| ​|  22,547| ​|  749,937  \nTotal commercial| ​|  83,182| ​|  631,494| ​|  359,202| ​|  22,547| ​|  1,096,425  \n**Consumer**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nResidential real estate first mortgage| ​|  3,360| ​|  26,826| ​|  37,996| ​|  417,414| ​|  485,596  \nResidential real estate junior lien| ​|  1,454| ​|  6,650| ​|  22,367| ​|  14,430| ​|  44,901  \nOther revolving and installment| ​|  1,729| ​|  15,249| ​|  2,773| ​|  —| ​|  19,751  \nTotal consumer| ​|  6,543| ​|  48,725| ​|  63,136| ​|  431,844| ​|  550,248  \nTotal loans with fixed interest rates| ​| $|  89,725| ​| $|  680,219| ​| $|  422,338| ​| $|  454,391| ​| $|  1,646,673  \n**Loans with floating interest rates:**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Commercial**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nCommercial and industrial| ​| $|  110,485| ​| $|  61,108| ​| $|  117,175| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  288,768  \nReal estate construction| ​|  8,740| ​|  74,488| ​|  1,680| ​|  2,191| ​|  87,099  \nCommercial real estate| ​|  19,499| ​|  177,568| ​|  137,201| ​|  42,707| ​|  376,975  \nTotal commercial| ​|  138,724| ​|  313,164| ​|  256,056| ​|  44,898| ​|  752,842  \n**Consumer**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nResidential real estate first mortgage| ​|  1,907| ​|  3,469| ​|  7,549| ​| ​|  228,358| ​|  241,283  \nResidential real estate junior lien| ​|  6,292| ​|  15,503| ​|  10,672| ​|  76,766| ​|  109,233  \nOther revolving and installment| ​|  6,014| ​|  3,538| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  9,552  \nTotal consumer| ​|  14,213| ​|  22,510| ​|  18,221| ​|  305,124| ​|  360,068  \nTotal loans with floating interest rates| ​| $|  152,937| ​| $|  335,674| ​| $|  274,277| ​| $|  350,022| ​| $|  1,112,910  \n  \n​\n\nThe expected life of the Company’s loan portfolio will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to curtail or prepay their loans with or without penalties. Consequently, the table above includes information limited to contractual maturities of the underlying loans.\n\nAsset Quality\n\nThe Company’s strategy for credit risk management includes well-defined, centralized credit policies; uniform underwriting criteria; and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all commercial and consumer credit exposures. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry, and client level; regular credit examinations; and management reviews of loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality. The Company strives to identify potential problem loans early, take necessary charge-offs promptly, and maintain adequate reserve levels for credit losses inherent in the portfolio. Management performs ongoing, internal reviews of any problem credits and continually assesses the adequacy of the allowance. The Company utilized an internal lending division, Special Credit Services, to develop and implement strategies for the management of individual nonperforming loans.\n\n85\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nCredit Quality Indicators\n\nLoans are assigned a risk rating and grouped into categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt, such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The risk ratings are aligned to pass and criticized categories. The criticized categories include special mention, substandard, and doubtful risk ratings. See Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a definition of each of the risk ratings.\n\nThe table below represents criticized loans outstanding by loan portfolio segment as of December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021:\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **December 31,**|  ​| **December 31,**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_| **2023**|  ​| **2022**  \nCommercial| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nCommercial and industrial| ​| $|  29,840| ​| ​| $|  25,182| ​  \nReal estate construction| ​|  20,667| ​| ​| ​|  262| ​  \nCommercial real estate| ​|  9,170| ​| ​| ​|  8,400| ​  \nTotal commercial| ​|  59,677| ​| ​| ​|  33,844| ​  \nConsumer| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nResidential real estate first mortgage| ​|  105| ​| ​| ​|  808| ​  \nResidential real estate junior lien| ​|  1,781| ​| ​| ​|  632| ​  \nOther revolving and installment| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​| ​|  1| ​  \nTotal consumer| ​|  1,886| ​| ​| ​|  1,441| ​  \nTotal loans| ​| $|  61,563| ​| ​| $|  35,285| ​  \nCriticized loans as a percent of total loans| ​| ​|  2.23| %| ​| ​|  1.44| %  \n  \n​\n\nCriticized loans represented 2.23% and 1.44% of total loans as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The decrease was primarily the result of a modest increase in nonperforming loans for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in nonperforming loans was primarily due to one $6.1 million loan being added to nonperforming loans for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nInterest income lost on nonaccrual loans approximated $467 thousand, $155 thousand, and $183 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There was no interest income included in net income related to nonaccrual loans for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n86\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n\nThe allowance for credit losses, or ACL, on loans is maintained at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb expected losses in the loan portfolio over the remaining estimated life of loans in the portfolio. Under CECL accounting standard the ACL is a valuation estimated at each balance sheet date and deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans held for investment to present the net amount expected to be collected. These evaluations are inherently subjective as they require management to make material estimates, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by actual charge-offs, net of recoveries.\n\nManagement estimates the ACL using relevant information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable supportable forecasts. Historical loss experience provides the basis for estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in the current loan-specific risk characteristics such as different underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or life of the loan, as well as changes in environmental conditions, levels of economic activity, unemployment rates, property values and other relevant factors. The calculation also contemplates that the Company may not be able to make or obtain such forecasts for the entire life of the financial assets and requires a reversion to historical loss information.\n\nLoans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not also included in the collective evaluation. The ACL on individually evaluated loans is recognized on the basis of the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate, the fair value of collateral adjusted of estimated costs to sell, or observable market price as of the relevant date.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into commitments to extend credit, including commitments under credit arrangements, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded. A reserve for unfunded commitments is established using historical loss data and utilization assumptions. This reserve is located under accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The expense for provision for unfunded commitments was $2.2 million, $1.1 million, and $0.2 million for the years ended years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n87\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe following table presents, by loan type, the changes in the allowance for credit losses, after the opening adjustment related to the adoption of CECL in 2023, for the periods presented:\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Year ended**  \n​| ​| **December 31,**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_| **2023**|  ​| **2022**|  ​| **2021**  \n**Balance—beginning of period**(1)| ​| $|  35,003| ​| ​| $|  31,572| ​| ​| $|  34,246| ​  \nCommercial loan charge-offs| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nCommercial and Industrial| ​|  (436)| ​| ​|  (1,396)| ​| ​| ​|  (1,230)| ​  \nReal estate construction| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​| ​|  —| ​  \nCommercial real estate| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​| ​|  (536)| ​  \nTotal commercial loan charge-offs| ​|  (436)| ​| ​|  (1,396)| ​| ​| ​|  (1,766)| ​  \nConsumer loan charge-offs| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nResidential real estate first mortgage| ​|  (49)| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​| ​|  —| ​  \nResidential real estate junior lien| ​|  (77)| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​| ​|  —| ​  \nOther revolving and installment| ​|  (51)| ​| ​|  (153)| ​| ​| ​|  (156)| ​  \nTotal consumer loan charge-offs| ​|  (177)| ​| ​|  (153)| ​| ​| ​|  (156)| ​  \nTotal loan charge-offs| ​|  (613)| ​| ​|  (1,549)| ​| ​| ​|  (1,922)| ​  \nCommercial loan recoveries| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nCommercial and Industrial| ​|  1,159| ​| ​|  461| ​| ​| ​|  1,660| ​  \nReal estate construction| ​|  —| ​| ​|  76| ​| ​| ​|  —| ​  \nCommercial real estate| ​|  45| ​| ​|  134| ​| ​| ​|  822| ​  \nTotal commercial recoveries| ​|  1,204| ​| ​|  671| ​| ​| ​|  2,482| ​  \nConsumer loan recoveries| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nResidential real estate first mortgage| ​|  330| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​| ​|  —| ​  \nResidential real estate junior lien| ​|  52| ​| ​|  282| ​| ​| ​|  123| ​  \nOther revolving and installment| ​|  92| ​| ​|  170| ​| ​| ​|  143| ​  \nTotal consumer loan recoveries| ​|  474| ​| ​|  452| ​| ​| ​|  266| ​  \nTotal loan recoveries| ​|  1,678| ​| ​|  1,123| ​| ​| ​|  2,748| ​  \nNet loan charge-offs (recoveries)| ​|  (1,065)| ​| ​|  426| ​| ​| ​|  (826)| ​  \nCommercial loan provision| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nCommercial and Industrial| ​|  645| ​| ​|  950| ​| ​| ​|  (1,759)| ​  \nReal estate construction| ​|  2,125| ​| ​|  551| ​| ​| ​|  120| ​  \nCommercial real estate| ​|  (778)| ​| ​|  (151)| ​| ​| ​|  (2,082)| ​  \nTotal commercial loan provision| ​|  1,992| ​| ​|  1,350| ​| ​| ​|  (3,721)| ​  \nConsumer loan provision| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nResidential real estate first mortgage| ​|  (1,829)| ​| ​|  (1,017)| ​| ​| ​|  700| ​  \nResidential real estate junior lien| ​|  (115)| ​| ​|  (344)| ​| ​| ​|  (215)| ​  \nOther revolving and installment| ​|  (273)| ​| ​|  11| ​| ​| ​|  (264)| ​  \nTotal consumer loan provision| ​|  (2,217)| ​| ​|  (1,350)| ​| ​| ​|  221| ​  \nUnallocated provision expense| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​| ​|  —| ​  \nTotal provision for credit losses on loans| ​|  (225)| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​| ​|  (3,500)| ​  \n**Balance—end of period**|  ​| $|  35,843| ​| ​| $|  31,146| ​| ​| $|  31,572| ​  \nTotal loans| ​| $|  2,759,583| ​| ​| $|  2,443,994| ​| ​| $|  1,758,020| ​  \nAverage total loans| ​| ​|  2,535,073| ​| ​| ​|  2,059,435| ​| ​| ​|  1,858,686| ​  \nAllowance for credit losses on loans to total loans| ​|  1.30| % | ​|  1.27| %| ​| ​|  1.80| %  \nNet charge-offs/(recoveries) to average total loans (annualized)| ​|  (0.04)| % | ​|  0.02| %| ​| ​|  (0.04)| %  \n(1)| Includes a $3.9 million opening adjustment to the beginning balance as of December 31, 2023.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nThe ACL on loans was $35.8 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $31.1 million at December 31, 2022.

Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nDeposits\n\nDeposit inflows and outflows are influenced by prevailing market interest rates, competition, local and economic conditions, and fluctuations in the Company’s customers’ own liquidity needs and may also be influenced by recent developments in the financial services industry, including the large-scale deposit withdrawals over a short period of time at Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank that resulted in the failure of those institutions.\n\nTotal deposits were $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of $180.1 million, or 6.2%, from December 31, 2022. Interest-bearing deposits increased $313.0 million while noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $132.9 million. The increase in interest-bearing deposits consisted primarily of increases of $134.4 million in interest-bearing demand deposits and $199.2 million in time deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased primarily due to heightened deposit competition, the impact of rising short-term interest rates on indexed money market deposits, and clients moving deposits out of noninterest bearing products into interest-bearing products.\n\nInterest-bearing deposit costs were 2.44% and 0.45% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in interest-bearing deposit costs were the result of a rising interest rate environment and a highly competitive deposit environment.\n\nThe Company competes for local deposits by offering products with competitive rates and rely on the deposit portfolio to fund loans and other asset growth. Management understands the importance of core deposits as a stable source of funding and may periodically implement various deposit promotion strategies to encourage core deposit growth. For periods of rising interest rates, management has modeled the aggregate yields for non-maturity deposits and time deposits to increase at a slower pace than the increase in underlying market rates. The mix of average deposits has been changing throughout the last several years. The weightings of core funds (noninterest checking, interest checking, savings, and money market accounts) and time deposits’ have increased. The Company is focused on expanding core account relationships and customers’ preference for unrestricted accounts in the low interest rate environment. The weighting of time deposits increased as clients are looking for higher yielding alternative investments with increased short-term rates.\n\nThe following table presents the average balances and rates of the Company’s deposit portfolio by category for the periods indicated.\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Year ended**|  ​| **Year ended**|  ​| **Year ended**  \n​| ​| **December 31, 2023**|  ​| **December 31, 2022**|  ​| **December 31, 2021**  \n​| ​| **Average**|  ​| **Average**|  ​| **Average**|  ​| **Average**|  ​| **Average**|  ​| **Average**  \n _(dollars in thousands)_|  ​| **Balance**| **Rate**|  ​| **Balance**| **Rate**|  ​| **Balance**| **Rate**  \nNoninterest-bearing demand| ​| $|  737,365| ​|  —| %| ​| $|  851,821| ​|  —| %| ​| $|  784,998| ​|  —| %  \nInterest-bearing demand| ​| ​|  768,238| ​|  1.29| %| ​| ​|  692,287| ​|  0.22| %| ​| ​|  697,276| ​|  0.14| %  \nMoney market and savings| ​| ​|  1,118,815| ​|  2.92| %| ​| ​|  1,113,426| ​|  0.55| %| ​| ​|  1,023,677| ​|  0.15| %  \nTime deposits| ​| ​|  303,746| ​|  3.58| %| ​| ​|  221,997| ​|  0.70| %| ​| ​|  215,624| ​|  0.54| %  \nTotal deposits| ​| $|  2,928,164| ​|  1.82| %| ​| $|  2,879,531| ​|  0.32| %| ​| $|  2,721,575| ​|  0.13| %  \n  \n​\n\nThe following table presents the contractual maturity of time deposits, including certificate of deposits and IRA deposits of $250 thousand and over, that were outstanding as of the date presented.\n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **December 31,**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_| **2023**  \nMaturing in:| ​  \n3 months or less| ​| $|  48,049  \n3 months to 6 months| ​|  48,010  \n6 months to 1 year| ​|  22,846  \n1 year or greater| ​|  2,925  \nTotal| ​| $|  121,830  \n  \n​\n\n90\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe Company’s total uninsured deposits, which are amounts of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit, currently $250,000, were approximately $1.1 billion and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These amounts were estimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting purposes.\n\nBorrowings and Subordinated Debt\n\nThe Company utilizes both short term and long term borrowings as part of its asset/liability management and funding strategies. Short term borrowings consist of FHLB advances and federal funds purchased. The Company had $314.2 million and $378.1 million in short term borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \n\nFHLB advances were secured by specific investment securities and real estate loans with a carrying amount of approximately $1.0 billion and $909.8 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nLong-term debt is utilized to fund longer term assets and as a source of regulatory capital. At December 31, 2023, the Company had $50.0 million of one outstanding 3.50% Fixed Rate Subordinated Note due 2031, or the Subordinated Note. The Subordinated Note currently bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.50% per year, payable annually through March 31, 2026. At the fifth anniversary of the issuance date of the Subordinated Note, on March 30, 2026, the interest rate will reset to a fixed interest rate equal to the FHLB rate, plus 2.0%, with a minimum annual fixed rate of not less than 3.5%. The Subordinated Note matures on March 30, 2031, and the Company has the option to redeem or prepay any or all of the Subordinated Note without premium or penalty any time after March 31, 2026, or at any time in the event of certain changes that affect the deductibility of interest for tax purposes or the treatment of the notes as Tier 2 Capital. \n\nJunior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts that issued trust preferred securities were $9.0 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $8.8 million as of December 31, 2022. The increase was due to purchase accounting amortization on the junior subordinated notes assumed in the Beacon Bank acquisition in 2016.

The increase was primarily due to a $119.4 million increase in other comprehensive income (loss). The increase in other comprehensive income (loss) was due in part to the sale of AFS securities as part of the previously reported balance sheet repositioning in the fourth quarter, as well as improved market conditions, which resulted in a higher fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale investment securities. This increase was partially offset by a $28.3 million decrease in net income and a $4.5 million decrease to opening stockholders’ equity related to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard.\n\nThe Company strives to maintain an adequate capital base to support its activities in a safe and sound manner while at the same time attempting to maximize stockholder value. Capital adequacy is assessed against the risk inherent in the Company’s balance sheet, recognizing that unexpected loss is the common denominator of risk and that common equity has the greatest capacity to absorb unexpected loss.\n\nThe Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements both at the Company and at the Bank level. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on the Company’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, specific capital guidelines must be met that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting policies. The Company has consistently maintained regulatory capital ratios at or above the well capitalized standards.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company met all capital adequacy requirements to which the Company was subject.\n\n92\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe table below sets forth the capital ratios for the Company and the Bank as of the dates indicated.

See “Non-GAAP to GAAP Reconciliations and Calculation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”  \n---|---  \n  \nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company enters into various transactions to meet the financing needs of clients, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in the consolidated balance sheets. These transactions include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Most of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon. All off-balance sheet commitments are included in the determination of the amount of risk-based capital that the Company and the Bank are required to hold.\n\nThe Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. The Company decreased its exposure to losses under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. The Company assesses the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit and establishes a liability for probable credit losses.\n\nFurther information related to financial instruments can be found in Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) of the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nLiquidity management is the process by which the Company manages the flow of funds necessary to meet its financial commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost and to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities. These financial commitments include withdrawals by depositors, credit commitments to borrowers, expenses of the Company’s operations, and capital expenditures. Liquidity is monitored and closely managed by the Company’s asset and liability committee, or ALCO, a group of senior officers from the finance, enterprise risk management, deposit, investment, treasury, and lending areas. It is ALCO’s responsibility to ensure the Company has the necessary level of funds available for normal operations as well as maintain a contingency funding policy to ensure that potential liquidity stress events are planned for, quickly identified, and management has plans in place to respond. ALCO has created policies which establish limits and require measurements to monitor liquidity trends, including modeling and management reporting that identifies the amounts and costs of all available funding sources.\n\n93\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had on balance sheet liquidity of $668.2 million, compared to $778.9 million at December 31, 2022 and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2021. On balance sheet liquidity includes cash and cash equivalents, federal funds sold, unencumbered securities available-for-sale and over collateralized securities pledging positions available-for-sale.\n\nThe Bank is a member of the FHLB, which provides short and long term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate related assets and other select collateral, most typically in the form of debt securities. The actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $1.0 billion of collateral pledged to the FHLB. Based on this collateral the Company is eligible to borrow up to $1.0 billion and had $706.6 million available capacity as of December 31, 2023. In addition, the Company can borrow up to $107.0 million through unsecured lines of credit the Company has established with four other banks.\n\nIn addition, because the Bank is “well capitalized,” it can accept brokered deposits up to 20.0% of total assets based on current policy limits. Management believed that the Company had adequate resources to fund all of its commitments as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\nThe Company’s primary sources of liquidity include liquid assets, as well as unencumbered securities that can be used to collateralize additional funding. At December 31, 2023, the Company had $129.9 million of cash and cash equivalents of which $91.2 million were interest-bearing deposits held at the Federal Reserve, FHLB and other correspondent banks.\n\nThough remote, the possibility of a funding crisis exists at all financial institutions. Accordingly, management has addressed this issue by formulating a liquidity contingency plan, which has been reviewed and approved by both the Bank’s Board of Directors and the ALCO. The plan addresses the actions that the Company would take in response to both a short-term and long-term funding crisis.\n\nA short term funding crisis would most likely result from a shock to the financial system, either internal or external, which disrupts orderly short term funding operations. Such a crisis would likely be temporary in nature and would not involve a change in credit ratings. A long term funding crisis would most likely be the result of both external and internal factors and would most likely result in drastic credit deterioration. Management believes that both potential circumstances have been fully addressed through detailed action plans and the establishment of trigger points for monitoring such events.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nStockholder Dividend\n\nOn February 27, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per common share. This dividend is payable on April 12, 2024, to stockholders of record on March 15, 2024.\n\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates. Interest-rate risk is the risk to earnings and equity value arising from changes in market interest rates and arises in the normal course of business to the extent that there is a divergence between the amount of interest-earning assets and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities that are prepaid/withdrawn, re-price, or mature in specified periods. The Company seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and equity while managing volatility arising from shifts in market interest rates. The Company’s Asset and Liability Committee, or ALCO, oversees market risk management, monitoring risk measures, limits, and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital. The Bank’s Board of Directors approves policy limits with respect to interest rate risk.\n\n94\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nInterest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities. The objectives of interest rate risk management are to control exposure of net interest income changes associated with interest rate movements and to achieve sustainable growth in net interest income. Effective interest rate risk management begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate interest rate risk position given business activities, management objectives, market expectations and ALCO policy limits and guidelines.\n\nInterest rate risk can come in a variety of forms, including repricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and option risk. Repricing risk is the risk of adverse consequences from a change in interest rates that arises because of differences in the timing of when those interest rate changes impact the Company’s assets and liabilities. Basis risk is the risk of adverse consequence resulting from unequal change in the spread between two or more rates for different instruments with the same maturity. Yield curve risk is the risk of adverse consequence resulting from unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different maturities for the same or different instruments. Option risk in financial instruments arises from embedded options such as options provided to borrowers to make unscheduled loan prepayments, options provided to debt issuers to exercise call options prior to maturity, and depositor options to make withdrawals and early redemptions.\n\nManagement regularly reviews the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates. Among the factors considered are changes in the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, interest rate spreads and repricing periods. ALCO reviews, on at least a quarterly basis, the interest rate risk position.\n\nThe interest rate risk position is measured and monitored at the Bank using net interest income simulation models and economic value of equity sensitivity analysis that capture both short term and long term interest rate risk exposure.\n\nModeling the sensitivity of net interest income and the economic value of equity to changes in market interest rates is highly dependent on numerous assumptions incorporated into the modeling process. The models used for these measurements rely on estimates of the potential impact that changes in interest rates may have on the value and prepayment speeds on all components of the Company’s loan portfolio, investment portfolio, as well as embedded options and cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Balance sheet growth assumptions are also included in the simulation modeling process. The analysis provides a framework as to what the Company’s overall sensitivity position is as of the Company’s most recent reported position and the impact that potential changes in interest rates may have on net interest income and the economic value of the Company’s equity.\n\nNet interest income simulation involves forecasting net interest income under a variety of interest rate scenarios including instantaneous shocks.\n\nThe estimated impact on the Company’s net interest income in hypothetical rising and declining rate scenarios assuming immediate, parallel moves in interest rates, calculated as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, are presented in the table below. \n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **December 31, 2023**|  ​| **December 31, 2022**  \n​| **Following**|  ​| **Following**|  ​| **Following**|  ​| **Following**  \n​| ​| **12 months**|  ​| **24 months**|  ​| **12 months**|  ​| **24 months**  \n+400 basis points|  1.0| % | ​|  2.4| % | ​| −25.1| % | ​| −8.2| %  \n+300 basis points|  0.5| % | ​|  1.4| % | ​| −18.9| % | ​| −6.4| %  \n+200 basis points|  0.3| % | ​|  0.9| % | ​| −12.7| % | ​| −4.4| %  \n+100 basis points|  0.4| % | ​|  0.9| % | ​| −6.2| % | ​| −1.8| %  \n−100 basis points| −1.0| % | ​| −1.7| % | ​|  5.2| % | ​|  0.5| %  \n−200 basis points| −2.3| % | ​| −4.1| % | ​|  7.9| % | ​| −1.7| %  \n  \n​\n\nThe above interest rate simulation suggests that the Company’s balance sheet is slightly asset sensitive, in the short-term, as of December 31, 2023, demonstrating that an increase in interest rates would have a marginal positive \n\n95\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nimpact on net interest income over the next 12 and 24 months. The balance sheet has shifted from being liability sensitive as of December 31, 2022. This change is attributable to both the derivatives strategies put in place throughout 2023 that will begin to mature in 2024 as well as deposit growth and the balance sheet repositioning that consisted of selling fixed rate securities and redeploying the funds into both fixed and floating-rate loans.\n\nManagement strategies may impact future reporting periods, as actual results may differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, the difference between actual experience, and the characteristics assumed, as well as changes in market conditions. Market based prepayment speeds are factored into the analysis for loan and securities portfolios. Rate sensitivity for transactional deposit accounts is modeled based on both historical experience and external industry studies.\n\nManagement uses economic value of equity sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of interest rate changes on long term cash flows, income, and capital. Economic value of equity is based on discounting the cash flows for all balance sheet instruments under different interest rate scenarios. Deposit premiums are based on external industry studies and utilizing historical experience.\n\nThe table below presents the change in the economic value of equity as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, assuming immediate parallel shifts in interest rates.\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **December 31,**|  ​| **December 31,**  \n​| **2023**|  ​| **2022**  \n+400 basis points| −15.5| % | ​| −19.5| %  \n+300 basis points| −12.6| % | ​| −15.3| %  \n+200 basis points| −7.7| % | ​| −10.4| %  \n+100 basis points| −3.1| % | ​| −4.9| %  \n−100 basis points|  1.6| % | ​|  4.0| %  \n−200 basis points|  2.0| % | ​|  5.0| %  \n  \n​\n\nOperational Risk\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss due to human behavior, inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, and security risks. Management continuously strives to strengthen its system of internal controls, enterprise risk management, operating processes and employee awareness to assess the impact on earnings and capital and to improve the oversight of the Company’s operational risk.\n\nCompliance Risk\n\nCompliance risk represents the risk of regulatory sanctions, reputational impact or financial loss resulting from failure to comply with rules and regulations issued by the various banking agencies and standards of good banking practice. Activities which may expose the Company to compliance risk include, but are not limited to, those dealing with the prevention of money laundering, privacy and data protection, community reinvestment initiatives, fair lending challenges resulting from the expansion of the Company’s banking center network, employment and tax matters.\n\nStrategic and/or Reputation Risk\n\nStrategic and/or reputation risk represents the risk of loss due to impairment of reputation, failure to fully develop and execute business plans, failure to assess current and new opportunities in business, markets and products, and any other event not identified in the defined risk types mentioned previously. Mitigation of the various risk elements that represent strategic and/or reputation risk is achieved through initiatives to help management better understand and report on various risks, including those related to the development of new products and business initiatives.\n\n​\n\n96\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\n​\n\n**ITEM 8.

VIEs are legal entities whose investors lack the ability to make decisions about the entity’s activities, or whose equity investors do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The applicable accounting guidance requires the Company to perform ongoing quantitative and qualitative analysis to determine whether it must consolidate any VIE. The Company does not have any ownership interest in or exert any control over any VIE, and thus no VIEs are included in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nReclassifications\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts, without impact to net income or total stockholders’ equity, to conform to the current year’s presentation.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from an acquisition and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term include the valuation of investment securities, determination of the allowance for credit losses, valuation of reporting units for the purpose of testing goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, valuation of deferred tax assets, and fair values of financial instruments.\n\nEmerging Growth Company\n\nThe Company qualifies as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, even if the Company complies with the greater obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth companies, the Company may \n\n105\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\navail itself of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future, so long as the Company is an emerging growth company. The Company will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (1) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities under the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1, which was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on September 12, 2019; (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which the Company has $1.235 billion or more in annual revenues; (3) the date on which the Company is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act; or (4) the date on which the Company has, during the previous three-year period, issued publicly or privately, more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities. Management cannot predict if investors will find the Company’s common stock less attractive because it will rely on the exemptions available to emerging growth companies. If some investors find the Company’s common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for its common stock and the Company’s stock price may be more volatile. The last year the Company qualifies as an emerging growth company is 2024.\n\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933 for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As an emerging growth company, the Company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.\n\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\n\nSubstantially all of the Company’s lending activities are with clients located within North Dakota, Minnesota, and Arizona. At December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively, 21.7% and 23.9% of the Company’s loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial loans that were not secured by real estate. The Company does not have any significant loan concentrations in any one industry or with any one client. Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for credit losses) discusses the Company’s loan portfolio.\n\nThe Company invests in a variety of investment securities and does not have any significant concentrations in any one industry or to any one issuer. Note 5 (Investment Securities) discusses the Company’s investment securities portfolio.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nFor purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash and due from banks includes cash and cash equivalents, balances due from banks, and federal funds sold, all of which have an original maturity within 90 days. Cash flows from loans, FHLB stock, deposits, and short-term borrowings are reported net.\n\nInterest-bearing deposits in banks are carried at cost.\n\nInvestment Securities\n\nDebt securities are classified as available for sale, or AFS, and are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains (losses) on AFS debt securities are included in net gains (losses) on investment securities in other comprehensive income. Gains (losses) on sales of investment securities are determined using the specific identification method on the trade date. The amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are recognized in interest income using methods approximating the interest method over the period to maturity.\n\nFor AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis, or impairment, is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. Any impairment that is not credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable taxes. Credit-related impairment is recognized as an allowance for credit losses, or ACL, related to AFS debt securities on the balance sheet, limited to the amount by which the amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value, with \n\n106\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\na corresponding adjustment to earnings as an expense (credit) within the provision for credit losses on the consolidated statements of income. Both the ACL and the adjustment to net income may be reversed if conditions change. However, if the Company intends to sell an impaired available-for-sale investment security or is required to sell such a security before recovering its amortized cost basis, the entire impairment amount must be recognized in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the security’s amortized cost basis. Because the security’s amortized cost basis is adjusted to fair value, there is no ACL in this situation. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.\n\nIn evaluating AFS debt securities in unrealized loss positions for impairment and the criteria regarding its intent or requirement to sell such securities, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and the results of reviews of the issuers’ financial condition, macroeconomic trends of the industry specific to the security, and any other adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. \n\n​\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was no ACL carried on the Company’s AFS debt securities nor were there any permanent write-offs for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Refer to Note 5 (Investment Securities) for further discussion.\n\n​\n\nCertain debt securities that the Company has an intent to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity, or HTM, and recorded at amortized cost. Interest earned on HTM debt securities is included in interest income. Amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts is also recognized in interest income using the effective interest method over the contractual life of the security and is adjusted to reflect actual prepayments. Transfers of debt securities from AFS to HTM are made at fair value at the date of transfer. Unrealized holding gains and losses at the date of transfer are included in other comprehensive income and in the carrying value of HTM security and are amortized over the remaining life of the security.\n\nManagement measures expected credit losses on HTM debt securities on a collective basis by major security type. The Company evaluates HTM debt securities by credit rating and an external study, updated quarterly, that includes historical information such as probability of default and loss going back several years. Accrued interest receivable on HTM debt securities is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.\n\nA change in the ACL related to HTM debt securities is recorded as an expense (credit) within the provision for credit losses on the consolidated statements of income.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was $213 thousand of ACL carried on the Company’s HTM debt securities. As of December 31, 2022, there was no allowance carried on the Company’s HTM debt securities. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, there were no permanent write-offs. Refer to Note 5 (Investment Securities) for further discussion. \n\nNonmarketable Equity Securities\n\nNonmarketable equity securities include the Bank’s required investments in the stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, or the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank, or the FRB. The Bank is a member of the FHLB as well as its regional FRB. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based of the level of borrowing and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts. FHLB stock and FRB stock are carried at cost, classified as other assets, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income.\n\nLoans Held for Sale\n\nLoans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value in the aggregate. Net unrealized losses are recognized through a valuation allowance by charges to income. Gains (losses) on loan sales are recorded in mortgage banking revenue on the consolidated statements of income.\n\n107\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nLoans\n\nLoans are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, reduced by an allowance for credit losses. Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future, until maturity or pay-off, generally are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balances adjusted for charge-offs, and the allowance for credit losses. Loan fees received that are associated with originating or acquiring certain loans are deferred, net of costs, and amortized over the life of the loan as a yield adjustment to interest income.\n\nThe accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is well-secured and in process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged-off no later than 120 days past due. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest in considered doubtful.\n\nAll interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off is reversed against interest income. The interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\n\nACL on Loans\n\nUpon adoption of ASU 2016-13, _Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments_ (“ASU 2016-13”), as amended, effective January 1, 2023, the Company began using a modified-prospective approach. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a cumulative-effective adjustment of $4.5 million reducing retained earnings, with a corresponding adjustment of $172 thousand increasing the ACL on HTM debt securities, $3.9 million increasing the ACL on loans, and $1.9 million increasing other liabilities for the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures.\n\nUnder the current expected credit loss, or CECL, accounting standard the ACL is a valuation estimated at each balance sheet date and deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans held for investment to present the net amount expected to be collected.\n\nThe Company estimates the ACL based on the underlying assets’ amortized cost basis, which is the amount at which the financing receivable is originated or acquired, adjusted for collection of cash and charge-offs, as well as applicable accretion or amortization of premium, discount and net deferred fees or costs. In the event that collection of principal becomes uncertain, the Company has policies in place to reverse accrued interest in a timely manner. Therefore, the Company has made the policy election to exclude accrued interest from the measurement of ACL.\n\nThe ACL on loans is increased by charges to provision for credit losses and reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Management evaluates the appropriateness of the ACL on loans quarterly. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change from period to period. The ACL on loans is presented on the consolidated statements of condition.\n\n​\n\nLoans past due 30 days or more are considered delinquent. In general, secured loans that are delinquent for 90 consecutive days are placed on non-accrual status and may be subject to individual loss assessment in accordance with established internal policy. In general, unsecured loans that are delinquent for 90 consecutive days have a provision taken for the full amount of the loan.\n\n​\n\nIn cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulty, the Company may make certain concessions for which the terms of the loan are modified. Loans experiencing financial difficulty can include modifications for an interest rate reduction below current market rates, a forgiveness of principal balance, an extension of the loan term, an-other than significant payment delay, or some combination of similar types of modifications. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not provide any modifications to loans under these circumstances that were experiencing financial difficulty.\n\n​\n\n108\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe ACL on loans reduces the loan portfolio to the net amount expected to be collected, and represents the expected losses over the life of all loans at the reporting date. The allowance incorporates forward-looking information and applies a reversion methodology beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast.\n\n​\n\nThe ACL on loans represents the Company's estimated risk of loss within its loan portfolio as of the reporting date. To appropriately measure expected credit losses, management disaggregates the loan portfolio into pools of similar risk characteristics (_i.e._ “segments”). The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow approach to calculate the expected loss for each segment. Within the discounted cash flow model, a PD and LGD assumption is applied to calculate the expected loss for each segment. PD is the probability the asset will default within a given timeframe and LGD is the percentage of assets not expectedto be collected due to default. The Company's PD and LGD assumptions is derived using a combination of external data and internal historical default and loss experience.\n\n​\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the primary macroeconomic drivers used within the discounted cash flow model included forecasts of National Unemployment, changes in National GDP, and changes in the National Housing Price Index. These macroeconomic drivers may change from time to time as a result of management’s assessment of continued suitability of each factor.\n\n​\n\nTo determine its reasonable and supportable forecast, management may leverage macroeconomic forecasts obtained from various reputable sources, which may include, but is not limited to, the Federal Open Market Committee forecast and other publicly available forecasts from well recognized, leading economists or firms. External baseline forecasts are supplemented an assessment of the likelihood of standard alternative scenarios occurring over the forecast period. The Company’s reasonable and supportable forecast period generally ranges from one to two years, depending on the facts and circumstances of the current state of the economy, portfolio segment and management’s judgement of what can be reasonably supported. The model reversion period generally ranges from one to two years, and it also depends on the current state of the economy and management’s judgments of such. Management monitors and assesses the forecast and reversion period at least annually. The Company used a one-year forecast and reversion period to calculate the ACL on loans as of December 31, 2023.\n\n​\n\nThe ACL on loans is calculated over a loan’s contractual life. For term loans, the contractual life is calculated based on the maturity date. For revolving loans, the contractual life is based on either the estimated maturity date or a default date. For revolving loans with no stated maturity date, the contractual life is calculated based on the annual attrition rate for the pool. The contractual term does not include expected extension, renewals or modifications.\n\n​\n\nThe Company's loan portfolio is segmented into 11 homogenous pools as follows based on the various risk profiles of the Company's loans:\n\n​\n\n●| Commercial & Industrial  \n---|---  \n●| CRE – Construction, Land & Development  \n---|---  \n●| CRE – Multifamily  \n---|---  \n●| CRE – Non-Owner Occupied  \n---|---  \n●| CRE – Owner Occupied  \n---|---  \n●| Agricultural  \n---|---  \n●| Residential – 1st Lien  \n---|---  \n●| Residential – Construction  \n---|---  \n●| Residential – HELOC  \n---|---  \n●| Residential – Jr Lien  \n---|---  \n●| Consumer  \n---|---  \n●| Paycheck Protection Program  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nIn calculating the ACL on loans, the contractual life of a loan must be adjusted for prepayments to arrive at expected cash flows. The Company models term loans using an annualized prepayment. When the Company has a \n\n109\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nspecific expectation of differing payment behavior for a given loan, the loan may be evaluated individually. For revolving loans that do not have a principal payment schedule, a curtailment rate is factored into the cash flow.\n\n​\n\nThe ACL on loans evaluation may also consider various qualitative factors, such as: actual or expected changes in economic trends and conditions, changes in the value of underlying collateral for loans, changes to lending policies, underwriting standards and/or management personnel performing such functions, delinquency and other credit quality trends, credit risk concentrations, if any, changes to the nature of the Company's business impacting the loan portfolio, and other external factors, that may include, but are not limited to, results of internal loan reviews, examinations by bank regulatory agencies, or other such events such as a natural disaster.\n\n​\n\nCertain loans are individually evaluated for estimated credit losses, including those that are classified as substandard or doubtful and are on non-accrual or that have other unique characteristics differing from the segment. Specific reserves are established when appropriate for such loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows of the loan or the estimated realizable value of the collateral, if any.\n\n​\n\nManagement may also adjust its assumptions to account for differences between expected and actual losses from period-to-period. The variability of management’s assumptions could alter the ACL on loans materially and impact future results of operations and financial condition. The loss estimation models and methods used to determine the allowance for credit losses are continually refined and enhanced.\n\n​\n\nOff Balance Sheet Credit Related Financial Instruments\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into commitments to extend credit, including commitments under credit arrangements, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded. \n\nACL on Off Balance Sheet Credit Exposures\n\nThe ACL on off balance sheet credit exposures, excluding those that are unconditionally cancellable by the Company, estimates the expected losses on the unfunded commitments and standby letters of credit at each reporting date. To appropriately measure expected credit losses, management disaggregates the loan portfolio into similar risk characteristics, identical to those determined for the loan portfolio. An estimated funding rate is then applied to the qualifying unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit using the Company’s own historical experience to estimate the expected funded for each loan segment as of the reporting date. Once the expected funded amount for each loan segment is determined, the loss rate, which is the calculated expected loan loss as a percent of the amortized cost basis for each loan segment, is applied to calculate the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures as of the reporting date.\n\n​\n\nThe ACL on off balance sheet credit exposures is presented within accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. A charge (credit) to provision for credit losses on the consolidated statements of income is made to account for the change in the ACL on off-balance sheet exposures between reporting periods.The ACL on off-balance sheet credit related financial instruments was $7.4 million and $3.2 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n​\n\nAccrued Interest Receivable\n\nAccrued interest receivable, including receivables related to investments and loans, is excluded from the measurement of the ACL. Accrued interest receivable is written off by reversing previously recognized interest income. The Company has a robust policy in place to write off accrued interest when a loan is placed on non-accrual. For loans, a write-off typically occurs when a loan has been in default for 90 days or more.\n\n110\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nLand, Premises and Equipment, Net\n\nLand is carried at cost. Other premises and equipment are carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line method based principally on the estimated useful lives of the assets. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred while major additions and improvements are capitalized. Gains (losses) on dispositions are included in current operations.\n\nBank Owned Life Insurance\n\nThe Company has purchased life insurance policies on certain key executives. Bank owned life insurance is recorded at its cash surrender value, or the amount that can be realized, if lower.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles, Net\n\nGoodwill resulting from acquisitions is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually. As part of its testing, the Company performs a quantitative analysis to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount using certain qualitative factors, the Company then compares the estimated fair value of the goodwill with its carrying amount, and then measures impairment loss by comparing the estimated fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.\n\nSignificant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment. This judgment includes developing cash flow projections, selecting appropriate discount rates, identifying relevant market comparables, incorporating general economic and market conditions, and selecting an appropriate control premium. At December 31, 2023, the Company believes it did not have any indications of potential impairment based on the estimated fair value of the reporting units.\n\nIntangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over the remaining useful lives. Intangible and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events occur, or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\nMortgage Banking\n\nResidential real estate loans are originated for purposes of being held for investment and held for sale into the secondary market. The transfer of these financial assets is accounted for as a sale when control over the asset has been surrendered. Control is deemed to be surrendered when the asset has been isolated from the Company, the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred asset, and the Company records the gain on sale of the financial asset within mortgage banking income on the consolidated statements of income.\n\nServicing assets are recognized as separate assets when servicing rights are acquired through the sale of residential mortgage loans with servicing rights retained. Capitalized servicing rights are initially recorded at estimated fair value based on assumptions provided by a third-party valuation service. The valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income, such as servicing cost per loan, the discount rate, the escrow float rate, an inflation rate, ancillary income, prepayment speeds, and default rates and losses. Loan servicing income is recorded on the accrual basis and includes servicing fees from investors and certain charges collected from borrowers, such as late payment fees, and is net of estimated fair value adjustments to capitalized mortgage servicing rights. Capitalized servicing rights are amortized into mortgage banking income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future servicing income of the underlying loans.\n\nServicing rights are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. Servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the estimated fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights by predominant characteristics, such as interest rates and terms. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual tranche, to the extent that estimated fair value is less than the capitalized amount \n\n111\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nfor the tranche. If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular tranche, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income.\n\nServicing fee income is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal, or a fixed amount per loan, and are recorded as income when earned. The amortization of servicing rights is netted against loan servicing fee income.\n\nImpairment of Long Lived Assets\n\nThe Company tests long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.\n\nIn the event such an asset is considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying value of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell.\n\nLeases\n\nThe Company leases office space, space for ATM locations and certain branch locations under noncancellable operating leases, several of which have renewal options to extend the lease terms. Upon commencement of a new lease, the Company will recognize a right-of-use, or ROU, asset and a corresponding lease liability. The Company makes the decision on whether to renew an option to extend a lease by considering various factors. The Company will recognize an adjustment to ROU asset and lease liability when lease agreements are amended and executed. The discount rate used in determining the present value of lease payments is based on the lessor’s implicit rate in the lease if known or the Company’s incremental borrowings rate for borrowing terms similar to each lease at commencement date. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For real estate leases, non-lease components, such as common area maintenance charges, real estate taxes and insurance, are not included in the measurement of the lease liability since they are generally able to be segregated. The Company has elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify.\n\nForeclosed Assets\n\nAssets acquired through loan foreclosure are included in other assets and are initially recorded at estimated fair value less estimated selling costs. The estimated fair value of foreclosed assets is evaluated regularly and any decreases in value along with holding costs, such as taxes, insurance and utilities, are reported in noninterest expense.\n\nTransfers of Financial Assets and Participating Interests\n\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over assets has been surrendered or in the case of loan participation, a portion of the asset has been surrendered and meets the definition of a “participating interest.” Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when 1) the assets have been isolated from the Company, 2) the transferee obtains the rights to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and 3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity. Should the transfer not meet these three criteria, the transaction is treated as a secured financing.\n\nLoans serviced for others are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Servicing loans for others generally consists of collecting mortgage payments, maintaining escrow accounts, disbursing payments to investors and collection and foreclosure processing.\n\n112\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nShort-Term and Long-Term Borrowings\n\nShort-term borrowings are those that, at time of origination, are scheduled to mature within one year. The Company’s short-term borrowings include, but are not limited to, FHLB overnight and FHLB advances, federal funds purchased, and line-of-credit advances.\n\nLong-term borrowings are those that, at time of origination, are scheduled to mature in one or more years. The Company’s long-term borrowings include, but are not limited to, FHLB advances, subordinated notes payable, trust preferred securities, and junior subordinated debentures.\n\nShort-term and long-term borrowings on the consolidated statements of income are presented net of unamortized issuance costs, if any, and amortized over the life of the borrowing.\n\nThe Company is required to post collateral for certain borrowings, for which it generally posts loans and/or investment securities as collateral. \n\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into derivative transactions to manage various risks and to accommodate the business requirements of its clients.\n\nDerivative instruments are reported in other assets or other liabilities at estimated fair value. The Company formally documents relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company also assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Changes in fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a fair value hedge and the change in fair value of the hedged item are both recorded in earnings and offset each other when the transaction is effective. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Changes in fair value of a derivative that is effective and that qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in OCI and are reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction or related cash flows affect earnings. The Company will also enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives not designated are recognized directly in earnings. \n\nNoninterest Income\n\nSpecific guidelines are established for recognition of certain noninterest income components related to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In accordance with Topic 606, revenues are recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\n\nThe Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, the Company assesses the goods or services that are promised within each contract and identifies those that contain performance obligations and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is \n\n113\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nallocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. The material groups of noninterest income that this methodology is applied to are defined as follows:\n\n_Retirement and benefit services:_ Retirement and benefit services income is primarily comprised of fees earned from the administration of retirement plans, record-keeping, compliance services, health savings accounts, and flexible benefit plans. Fees are earned based on a combination of the market value of assets under administration and transaction-based fees for services provided. Fees that are determined based on the market value of the assets under administration are generally billed monthly or quarterly in arrears and recognized monthly as the Company’s performance obligations are met. Other transaction-based fees are recognized monthly as the performance obligation is satisfied.\n\n_Wealth management:_ Wealth management income is earned from a variety of sources including trust administration and other related fiduciary services, custody, investment management and advisory services, and brokerage. Fees are based on the market value of the assets under management and are generally billed monthly in arrears and recognized monthly as the Company’s performance obligations are met. Commissions on transactions are recognized on a trade-date basis as the performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time in which the trade is processed. Other related services are based on a fixed fee schedule and the revenue is recognized when the services are rendered, which is when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation.\n\n_Service charges on deposit accounts:_ Service charges on deposit accounts primarily consist of account analysis fees, monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees, and other deposit account related fees. Overdraft fees and certain service charges are fixed, and the performance obligation is typically satisfied at the time of the related transaction. The consideration for analysis fees and monthly maintenance fees are variable as the fee can be reduced if the customer meets certain qualifying metrics. The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied at the time of the transaction or over the course of a month.\n\n_Other noninterest income:_ Other noninterest income components include debit card interchange fees, bank-owned life insurance income and miscellaneous transactional fees. Income earned from these revenue streams is generally recognized concurrently with the satisfaction of the performance obligation.\n\nAdvertising Costs\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nTax Credit Investments\n\nThe Company invests in qualified affordable housing projects for the purpose of community reinvestment and obtaining tax credits. These investments are included in other assets on the balance sheet, and any unfunded commitments in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the balance sheet. The qualified affordable housing projects are accounted for under the proportional amortization method. Under the proportional amortization method, the initial cost of the investment is recognized over the period that the Company expects to receive the tax credits, with the expense included within income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income. Management analyzes these investments for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of the investment will not be realized. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its fair value. \n\nIncome Taxes\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance would be recognized if it is “more likely than not” that the deferred tax asset would not be realized.\n\n114\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThese calculations are based on many complex factors including estimates of the timing of reversals of temporary differences, the interpretation of federal and state income tax laws, and a determination of the differences between the tax and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates and interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax liabilities.\n\nThe Company follows standards related to Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. These rules establish a higher standard for tax benefits to meet before they can be recognized in a Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company can recognize in financial statements the impact of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on an audit based on the technical merit of the position. See Note 20 (Income Taxes) for additional disclosures. The Company recognizes both interest and penalties as components of other operating expenses.\n\nThe amount of the uncertain tax position was not determined to be material. It is not expected that the unrecognized tax benefit will be material within the next 12 months. The Company did not incur any interest or penalties in 2023, 2022, or 2021.\n\nThe Company files consolidated federal and state income tax returns. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal or state tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2020.\n\nComprehensive Income\n\nRecognized revenue, expenses, gains, and losses are included in net income. Certain changes in assets and liabilities, such as unrealized gains (losses) on debt securities, unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedging derivatives, reclassification adjustments for losses (gains) realized in income, and unrealized gains (losses) on other derivatives, are reported as a separate component of the equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. Such items, along with net income, are components of comprehensive income.\n\nStock Compensation Plans\n\nStock compensation accounting guidance requires that the compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. The cost will be measured based on the grant date estimated fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. The grant date estimated fair value is determined using the closing price of the Company’s common stock. The stock compensation accounting guidance requires that compensation cost for all stock awards be calculated and recognized over the employee’s service period, generally defined as the vesting period. For awards with graded-vesting, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.\n\nEarnings per Share\n\nEarnings per share are calculated utilizing the two-class method. Earnings per share calculations include shares related to the Alerus Financial Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock awards.\n\n​\n\nNOTE 2 New Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThe following Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Updates, or ASUs are divided into pronouncements which have been adopted by the Company since January 1, 2023, and those which are not yet effective and have been evaluated or are currently being evaluated by management, as of December 31, 2023.\n\n115\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nAdopted Pronouncements\n\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL accounting standard is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other similar agreements). In addition, ASC 326 made changes to the accounting for AFS and HTM debt securities. One such change is to require credit losses to be presented as an allowance, rather than as a write-down.\n\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized cost, off-balance sheet credit exposures, and AFS and HTM debt securities. Results for reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2022, are presented under ASC 326, while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment of $4.5 million reducing retained earnings, with a corresponding adjustment of $3.9 million increasing the ACL on loans, an adjustment of $172 thousand increasing the ACL on HTM debt securities, an adjustment of $1.9 million increasing other liabilities for the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures, and an adjustment of $1.5 million increasing deferred tax assets as of January 1, 2023.\n\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for financial assets purchased with credit deterioration previously classified as purchased credit impaired and accounted for under ASC 310-30. In accordance with the standard, management did not reassess whether purchased credit impaired, or PCI, assets met the criteria of purchased credit deteriorated, or PCD, assets as of the date of adoption.\n\nThe following table illustrates the impact of ASC 326:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **January 1, 2023**  \n​| ​| **As reported**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| **Pre-tax impact of**  \n _(dollars in thousands)_| **under**|  ​| **Pre-ASC 326**|  ​| **ASC 326**  \n**Assets:**| **ASC 326**|  ​| **Adoption**|  ​| **Adoption**  \nInvestments| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nHeld-to-maturity| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nObligations of state and political agencies| ​| $|  110| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  110  \nMortgage backed securities| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nResidential agency| ​| ​|  62| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  62  \nTotal allowance for held-to-maturity investment securities| ​| ​|  172| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  172  \nLoans| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nCommercial| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nCommercial and industrial| ​| ​|  8,526| ​| ​|  9,233| ​| ​|  (707)  \nReal estate construction| ​| ​|  3,986| ​| ​|  1,437| ​| ​|  2,549  \nCommercial real estate| ​| ​|  12,630| ​| ​|  12,761| ​| ​|  (131)  \nTotal commercial| ​| ​|  25,142| ​| ​|  23,431| ​| ​|  1,711  \nConsumer| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nResidential real estate first mortgage| ​| ​|  8,126| ​| ​|  5,857| ​| ​|  2,269  \nResidential real estate junior lien| ​| ​|  1,291| ​| ​|  1,318| ​| ​|  (27)  \nOther revolving and installment| ​| ​|  444| ​| ​|  540| ​| ​|  (96)  \nTotal consumer| ​| ​|  9,861| ​| ​|  7,715| ​| ​|  2,146  \nTotal allowance for loans| ​| ​|  35,003| ​| ​|  31,146| ​| ​|  3,857  \nAllowance for credit losses on loans and investments securities| ​| $|  35,175| ​| $|  31,146| ​| $|  4,029  \n**Liabilities:**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nAllowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments| ​| $|  5,159| ​| $|  3,244| ​| $|  1,915  \n  \n​\n\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method, which clarifies the guidance on fair value hedge accounting of interest rate risk portfolios of \n\n116\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nfinancial assets. ASU 2022-01 updates guidance in Topic 815, to expand the scope of the current last-of-layer method to allow multiple hedged layers to be designated for a single closed portfolio of financial assets or one or more beneficial interests secured by a portfolio of financial instruments on a prospective basis. Additionally, ASU 2022-01 clarifies that basis adjustments related to existing portfolio layer hedge relationships should not be considered when measuring credit losses on the financial assets included in the closed portfolio. Further, ASU 2022-01 clarifies that any reversal of fair value hedge basis adjustments associated with an actual breach should be recognized in interest income immediately. ASU 2022-01 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2022-01 effective January 1, 2023, and entered into a fair value hedge agreement on February 10, 2023 and adopted the portfolio layer method of accounting for this transaction. This adoption had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as the Company did not have any hedged assets using the last-of-layer hedge accounting method.\n\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. The amendments in this update eliminate the accounting guidance for Troubled Debt Restructurings, or TDRs, by creditors in Subtopic 310-40. Receivables – Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, while enhancing the disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. For public business entities, this amendment also has vintage disclosures that require that an entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of Subtopic 326-20 Financial Instruments – Credit Losses – Measured at Amortized Cost. For entities that had not yet adopted the amendment in ASU 2016-13, the effective date for the amendments in this update are same as the effective date for ASU 2016-13. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2023, and had no loans experience financial difficulty in the current period.\n\nPronouncements Not Yet Effective\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. These amendments provide temporary optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications and hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, that the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) reference or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. It is intended to help stakeholders during the global market-wide reference rate transition period. The guidance is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020, through December 31, 2022. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01. Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) in response to concerns about structural risks in accounting for reference rate reform. The ASU clarifies certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that affected by the discontinuing transition. LIBOR is used as an index rate for a portion of the Company’s available-for-sale securities, derivative contracts, subordinated notes payable, junior subordinated debentures, and approximately 5.3% of the Company’s loans, as of December 31, 2023.\n\nIf reference rates are discontinued, the existing contracts will be modified to replace the discounted rate with a replacement rate. For accounting purposes, such contract modifications would have to be evaluated to determine whether the modified contract is a new contract or a continuation of an existing contract. If they are considered new contracts, the previous contract would be extinguished. Under one of the optional expedients of ASU 2020-04, modifications of contracts within the scope of Topic 310, receivables, and 470, Debt, will be accounted for by prospectively adjusting the effective interest rates and no such evaluation is required. When elected, the optional expedient for contract modifications must be applied consistently for all eligible contracts or eligible transactions. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this pronouncement of those financial assets and liabilities where LIBOR is used as an index rate.\n\nIn December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06 Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848. This amendment provides an update to defer the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024, after which all entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amendments in this ASU related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures improve \n\n117\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nthe transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The amendments allow investors to better assess, in their capital allocation decisions, how an entity’s worldwide operations and related tax risks and tax planning and operational opportunities affect its income tax rate and prospects for future cash flows. The other amendments in this Update improve the effectiveness and comparability of disclosures by adding disclosures of pretax income (or loss) and income tax expense (or benefit) to be consistent with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation S-X 210.4-08(h), Rules of General Application—General Notes to Financial Statements: Income Tax Expense, and removing disclosures that no longer are considered cost beneficial or relevant. For public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. For entities other than public business entities, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The amendments in this Update should be applied on a prospective basis. Retrospective application is also permitted.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNOTE 3 Business Combinations\n\nOn July 1, 2022, the Company acquired MPB BHC, Inc., the bank holding company for Metro Phoenix Bank located in Phoenix, Arizona, for a total purchase price of $64.0 million in a stock-for-stock transaction. The primary reasons for the acquisition were to expand the Company’s operations in the Phoenix MSA and grow the size of the Company’s business. As part of the transaction, $7.6 million was allocated to a customer deposit intangible and $15.1 million to goodwill, which is not deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill resulting from the acquisition was allocated to the Company’s Banking segment. The purchase consisted of $270.4 million in loans and $353.7 million in deposits.

The Company does not believe that the AFS debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2023 represent a credit loss impairment. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the gross unrealized loss positions were primarily related to mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government, are widely recognized as “risk free,” and have a long history of zero credit loss. Additionally, there were corporate bonds in gross unrealized loss positions; however, all bonds had an investment grade rating as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Total gross unrealized losses were attributable to changes in interest rates, relative to when the investment securities were purchased, and not due to the credit quality of the investment securities. The Company does not intend to sell the investment securities that were in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.\n\n​\n\nThe ACL on HTM debt securities is estimated using relevant information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable supportable forecasts. Using a probability of default and loss given default analysis an allowance for credit losses was established in the amount of $213 thousand as of December 31, 2023.\n\n120\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\n​\n\nAccrued interest receivable on AFS investment securities and HTM investment securities is recorded in accrued interest receivable and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. As of December 31, 2023, the accrued interest receivable on AFS investment securities and HTM investment securities totaled $1.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the accrued interest receivable on AFS investment securities and HTM investment securities totaled $1.9 million and $1.5 million, respectively.\n\nOn April 1, 2021, the Company transferred its state and political agencies debt securities portfolio, with a fair value of $149.2 million and a net unrealized gain of $1.3 million, from AFS to HTM. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the net unrealized gains on the transferred securities were $108 thousand and $272 thousand, net of a deferred tax of $55 thousand and $137 thousand, respectively.\n\nProceeds from the sale of AFS securities for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 are displayed in the table below:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Year ended**  \n​| ​| **December 31,**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_| **2023**| **2022**| **2021**  \nProceeds| ​| $|  171,758| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  13,189  \nRealized gains| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​| ​|  114  \nRealized losses| ​|  (24,643)| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —  \n  \n​\n\nProceeds from the call of HTM securities for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are displayed in the table below:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Year ended**  \n​| ​| **December 31,**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_| **2023**| **2022**| **2021**  \nProceeds| ​| $|  242| ​| $|  963| ​| $|  1,772  \nRealized gains| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​| ​|  11  \nRealized losses| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —  \n  \n​\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no sales of HTM securities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the company sold one held-to-maturity security with an amortized cost of $330 thousand. Proceeds from the sale totaled $348 thousand, resulting in realized gains of $11 thousand. For this sale of a held-to-maturity security, the Company received evidence of a significant deterioration of the issuer’s creditworthiness.\n\nThe following table presents investment securities with gross unrealized losses, for which an ACL has not been recorded at December 31, 2023 and 2022, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual investment securities have been in a continuous loss position:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| ​| ​| **December 31, 2023**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| **Less than 12 Months**|  ​| **Over 12 Months**|  ​| **Total**  \n​| ​| **Number of**|  ​| **Unrealized**|  ​| **Fair**|  ​| **Unrealized**|  ​| **Fair**|  ​| **Unrealized**|  ​| **Fair**  \n _(dollars in thousands)_| **Holdings**|  ​| **Losses**| **Value**| **Losses**| **Value**| **Losses**| **Value**  \nAvailable-for-sale | ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nU.S. Treasury and agencies| ​|  1| ​| $|  (3)| ​| $|  489| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  (3)| ​| $|  489  \nMortgage backed securities| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nResidential agency| ​|  112| ​|  —| ​|  43| ​|  (88,547)| ​|  435,505| ​|  (88,547)| ​|  435,548  \nCommercial| ​|  1| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  (123)| ​|  1,353| ​|  (123)| ​|  1,353  \nAsset backed securities| ​|  3| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  (1)| ​|  25| ​|  (1)| ​|  25  \nCorporate bonds| ​|  12| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  (9,349)| ​|  48,644| ​|  (9,349)| ​|  48,644  \nTotal available-for-sale investment securities| ​|  129| ​| $|  (3)| ​| $|  532| ​| $|  (98,020)| ​| $|  485,527| ​| $|  (98,023)| ​| $|  486,059  \n  \n​\n\n121\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| ​| ​| **December 31, 2022**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| **Less than 12 Months**|  ​| **Over 12 Months**|  ​| **Total**  \n​| ​| **Number of**|  ​| **Unrealized**|  ​| **Fair**|  ​| **Unrealized**|  ​| **Fair**|  ​| **Unrealized**|  ​| **Fair**  \n _(dollars in thousands)_| **Holdings**|  ​| **Losses**| **Value**| **Losses**| **Value**| **Losses**| **Value**  \nAvailable-for-sale | ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nU.S. Treasury and agencies| ​|  1| ​| $|  (17)| ​| $|  509| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  (17)| ​| $|  509  \nMortgage backed securities| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nResidential agency| ​|  145| ​|  (10,457)| ​|  79,693| ​|  (107,711)| ​|  507,418| ​|  (118,168)| ​|  587,111  \nCommercial| ​|  17| ​|  (4,835)| ​|  50,437| ​|  (2,276)| ​|  13,120| ​|  (7,111)| ​|  63,557  \nAsset backed securities| ​|  3| ​|  —| ​|  32| ​|  —| ​|  2| ​|  —| ​|  34  \nCorporate bonds| ​|  17| ​|  (4,452)| ​|  48,048| ​|  (2,516)| ​|  14,484| ​|  (6,968)| ​|  62,532  \nTotal available-for-sale investment securities| ​|  183| ​| ​|  (19,761)| ​| ​|  178,719| ​| ​|  (112,503)| ​| ​|  535,024| ​| ​|  (132,264)| ​| ​|  713,743  \nHeld-to-maturity| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nObligations of state and political agencies| ​|  181| ​| ​|  (3,336)| ​| ​|  18,788| ​| ​|  (14,400)| ​| ​|  98,762| ​| ​|  (17,736)| ​| ​|  117,550  \nMortgage backed securities| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nResidential agency| ​|  27| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  (33,254)| ​| ​|  150,861| ​| ​|  (33,254)| ​| ​|  150,861  \nTotal held-to-maturity investment securities| ​|  208| ​| ​|  (3,336)| ​| ​|  18,788| ​| ​|  (47,654)| ​| ​|  249,623| ​| ​|  (50,990)| ​| ​|  268,411  \nTotal investment securities| ​|  391| ​| $|  (23,097)| ​| $|  197,507| ​| $|  (160,157)| ​| $|  784,647| ​| $|  (183,254)| ​| $|  982,154  \n  \n​\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the unrealized losses on the Company’s AFS debt securities have not been recognized into income because management does not intend to sell and it is not more-likely-than-not that the Company will be required to sell any of the debt securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Furthermore, the unrealized losses were due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions, were not reflective of credit events and the issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments on the bonds. Agency-backed and government-sponsored enterprise securities have a long 40-year history with no credit losses, including during times of severe stress. The principal and interest payments on agency-guaranteed debt is backed by the U.S. government. Government-sponsored enterprises similarly guarantee principal and interest payments and carry an implicit guarantee from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Additionally, government-sponsored enterprise securities are exceptionally liquid, readily marketable, and provide a substantial amount of price transparency and price parity, indicating a perception of zero credit losses. Subordinate corporate bonds are primarily comprised of investment grade senior notes and senior subordinated notes on other financial institutions. HTM municipal debt holdings are comprised solely of high credit quality state and municipal obligations. High credit quality state and municipal obligations have a history of zero to near-zero credit loss. \n\nThe Company determined that the expected credit loss on its HTM portfolio was $213 thousand as of December 31, 2023. The Company determined that the expected credit loss on its HTM portfolio was immaterial, and therefore, an allowance was not carried on its HTM debt securities at December 31, 2022.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, none of the Company’s HTM debt securities were past due or on non-accrual status. The Company did not recognize any interest income on non-accrual HTM debt securities during years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. \n\n​\n\n122\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe following table presents amortized cost and fair value of AFS investment securities and the carrying value and fair value of HTM investment securities at December 31, 2023, by contractual maturity:\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Held-to-maturity**|  ​| **Available-for-sale**  \n​| ​| **Carrying**|  ​| **Fair**|  ​| **Amortized**|  ​| **Fair**  \n _(dollars in thousands)_| **Value**|  ​| **Value**|  ​| **Cost**| **Value**  \nDue within one year or less| ​| $|  8,588| ​| $|  8,474| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —  \nDue after one year through five years| ​|  47,995| ​|  44,557| ​|  524| ​|  521  \nDue after five years through ten years| ​|  60,289| ​|  52,729| ​|  59,477| ​|  50,004  \nDue after 10 years| ​|  12,731| ​|  11,230| ​|  613| ​|  617  \n​| ​| ​|  129,603| ​| ​|  116,990| ​| ​|  60,614| ​| ​|  51,142  \nMortgage-backed securities| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nResidential agency| ​| ​|  170,125| ​| ​|  141,627| ​| ​|  524,140| ​| ​|  435,594  \nTotal investment securities| ​| $|  299,728| ​| $|  258,617| ​| $|  584,754| ​| $|  486,736  \n  \n​\n\nExpected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.\n\nInvestment securities with a total carrying value of $250.0 million and $260.7 million, were pledged at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to secure public deposits and for other purposes required or permitted by law.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying value of the Company’s Federal Reserve Bank stock and Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, or FHLB, stock was as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **December 31,**|  ​| **December 31,**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_| **2023**| **2022**  \nFederal Reserve| ​| $|  4,623| ​| $|  4,595  \nFHLB| ​|  16,566| ​|  19,362  \n  \n​\n\nThese securities can only be redeemed or sold at their par value and only to the respective issuing institution or to another member institution. The Company records these non-marketable equity securities as a component of other assets and periodically evaluates these securities for impairment. Management considers these non-marketable equity securities to be long-term investments. Accordingly, when evaluating these securities for impairment, management considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value.\n\nVisa Class B Restricted Shares\n\nIn 2008, the Company received Visa Class B restricted shares as part of Visa’s initial public offering. These shares are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into the publicly traded Class A common shares. This conversion will not occur until the settlement of certain litigation which will be indemnified by Visa members, including the Company. Visa funded an escrow account from its initial public offering to settle these litigation claims. Should this escrow account be insufficient to cover these litigation claims, Visa is entitled to fund additional amounts to the escrow account by reducing each member bank’s Class B conversion ratio to unrestricted Class A shares. As of December 31, 2023, the conversion ratio was 1.5991. Based on the existing transfer restriction and the uncertainty of the outcome of the Visa litigation mentioned above, the 6,924 Class B shares (11,702 Class A equivalents) that the Company owned as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, were carried at a zero cost basis.\n\n123\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nNOTE 6 Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nThe following table presents total loans outstanding, by portfolio segment, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **December 31,**| **December 31,**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_| **2023**| **2022**  \nCommercial| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nCommercial and industrial| ​| $|  598,321| ​| $|  583,876  \nReal estate construction| ​|  124,034| ​|  97,810  \nCommercial real estate| ​|  1,126,912| ​|  881,670  \nTotal commercial| ​|  1,849,267| ​|  1,563,356  \nConsumer| ​| ​  \nResidential real estate first mortgage| ​|  726,879| ​|  679,551  \nResidential real estate junior lien| ​|  154,134| ​|  150,479  \nOther revolving and installment| ​|  29,303| ​|  50,608  \nTotal consumer| ​|  910,316| ​|  880,638  \nTotal loans| ​| $|  2,759,583| ​| $|  2,443,994  \n  \n​\n\nTotal loans include net deferred loan fees and costs of $0.2 million and $0.9 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The increase was primarily due to the adoption of CECL, which resulted in an additional allowance of $3.9 million in the ACL on loans. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the significant model inputs and assumptions used within the discounted cash flow model for purposes of estimating the ACL on loans were:\n\n​\n\n●|  _Macroeconomic (loss) drivers:_ As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the following loss drivers for each loan segment were used to calculate the expected PD over the forecast and reversion period:  \n---|---  \n●| Commercial & Industrial – National Unemployment; Change in National GDP  \n---|---  \n●| CRE – Construction, Land & Development – National Unemployment; Change in National GDP  \n---|---  \n●| CRE – Multifamily – National Unemployment  \n---|---  \n●| CRE – Non-Owner Occupied – National Unemployment; Change in National GDP  \n---|---  \n●| CRE – Owner Occupied – National Unemployment  \n---|---  \n●| Agricultural – (None)  \n---|---  \n●| Residential – 1st Lien – National Unemployment; Change in National Home Price Index (“HPI”)  \n---|---  \n●| Residential – Construction – National Unemployment; Change in National HPI  \n---|---  \n●| Residential – HELOC – National Unemployment; Change in National HPI  \n---|---  \n●| Residential – Jr Lien – National Unemployment; Change in National HPI  \n---|---  \n●| Consumer – National Unemployment; Change in National GDP  \n---|---  \n●| Paycheck Protection Program – (None)  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nAfter adoption of ASU 2016-13, given the strong loan growth and the future economic uncertainty, the reserve increased $840 thousand during 2023. This increase was partially offset by the release of certain qualitative factors due to strong asset quality and the continued maturity of the overall model. The increase in the reserve represents the elevated risk of credit loss within the Company's portfolio.\n\n​\n\nCredit Concentrations\n\nThe Company focuses on maintaining a well-balanced and diversified loan portfolio. Despite such efforts, it is recognized that credit concentrations may occasionally emerge as a result of economic conditions, changes in local demand, natural loan growth and runoff. To identify credit concentrations effectively, all commercial and industrial and owner occupied real estate loans are assigned Standard Industrial Classification codes, North American Industry Classification System codes, and state and county codes. Property type coding is used for investment real estate. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's total exposure to the general business industry was 10.7% of total loans. There were no other industry concentrations exceeding 10% of the Company's total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2023.\n\n​\n\nCredit Quality Indicators\n\nThe Company’s consumer loan portfolio is primarily comprised of secured loans that are evaluated at origination on a centralized basis against standardized underwriting criteria. The Company generally does not risk rate consumer loans unless a default event such as bankruptcy or extended nonperformance takes place. Credit quality for the consumer loan portfolio is measured by delinquency rates, nonaccrual amounts and actual losses incurred. These loans are rated as either performing or non-performing.\n\nThe Company assigns a risk rating to all commercial loans, except pools of homogeneous loans, and performs detailed internal and external reviews of risk rated loans over a certain threshold to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of the portfolio. These risk ratings are also subject to examination by the Company’s regulators. During the internal reviews, management monitors and analyzes the financial condition of borrowers and guarantors, trends in the industries in which the borrowers operate and the estimated fair values of collateral securing the loans. These credit quality indicators are used to assign a risk rating to each individual loan.\n\n​\n\n128\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe Company’s ratings are aligned to pass and criticized categories. The criticized category includes special mention, substandard, and doubtful risk ratings. The risk ratings are defined as follows:\n\n●|  _Pass:_ A pass loan is a credit with no existing or known potential weaknesses deserving of management’s close attention.  \n---|---  \n●|  _Special Mention:_ Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, this potential weakness may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the Company’s credit position at some future date. Special mention loans are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.  \n---|---  \n●|  _Substandard:_ Loans classified as substandard are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the repayment of the debt. Well-defined weaknesses include a borrower’s lack of marketability, inadequate cash flow or collateral support, failure to complete construction on time, or the failure to fulfill economic expectations. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.  \n---|---  \n●|  _Doubtful:_ Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or repayment in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.  \n---|---  \n●|  _Loss:_ Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and charged off immediately.  \n---|---  \n

A loan is placed on non-accrual when the financial condition of the borrower is deteriorating, payment in full of both principal and interest is not expected as scheduled or principal or interest has been in default for 90 days or more. Exceptions may be made if the asset is secured by collateral sufficient to satisfy both the principal and accrued interest in full and collection is reasonably assured. When one loan to a borrower is placed on non-accrual, all other loans to the borrower are re-evaluated to determine if they should also be placed on non-accrual. All previously accrued and unpaid interest is reversed at that time. A loan will return to accrual when collection of principal and interest is assured and the borrower has demonstrated timely payments of principal and interest for a reasonable period, generally at least six months. \n\nThe following tables present past due aging analysis of total loans outstanding, by portfolio segment, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **December 31, 2023**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **90 Days**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **Accruing**|  ​| **30 - 59 Days**|  ​| **60 - 89 Days**|  ​| **or More**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| **Total**  \n _(dollars in thousands)_| **Current**| **Past Due**| **Past Due**| **Past Due**| **Nonaccrual**| **Loans**  \nCommercial| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nCommercial and industrial| ​| $|  590,663| ​| $|  924| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  139| ​| $|  6,595| ​| $|  598,321  \nReal estate construction| ​|  124,034| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  124,034  \nCommercial real estate| ​|  1,125,669| ​|  128| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  1,115| ​|  1,126,912  \nTotal commercial| ​|  1,840,366| ​|  1,052| ​|  —| ​|  139| ​|  7,710| ​|  1,849,267  \nConsumer| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nResidential real estate first mortgage| ​|  724,786| ​|  901| ​|  554| ​|  —| ​| ​|  638| ​|  726,879  \nResidential real estate junior lien| ​|  153,220| ​|  666| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  248| ​|  154,134  \nOther revolving and installment| ​|  29,086| ​|  170| ​|  47| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  29,303  \nTotal consumer| ​|  907,092| ​|  1,737| ​|  601| ​|  —| ​|  886| ​|  910,316  \nTotal loans| ​| $|  2,747,458| ​| $|  2,789| ​| $|  601| ​| $|  139| ​| $|  8,596| ​| $|  2,759,583  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **December 31, 2022**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **90 Days**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **Accruing**|  ​| **30 - 59 Days**|  ​| **60 - 89 Days**|  ​| **or More**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| **Total**  \n _(dollars in thousands)_| **Current**| **Past Due**| **Past Due**| **Past Due**| **Nonaccrual**| **Loans**  \nCommercial| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nCommercial and industrial| ​| $|  580,288| ​| $|  2,332| ​| $|  94| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  1,162| ​| $|  583,876  \nReal estate construction| ​|  97,370| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  440| ​|  97,810  \nCommercial real estate| ​|  879,830| ​|  368| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  1,472| ​|  881,670  \nTotal commercial| ​|  1,557,488| ​|  2,700| ​|  94| ​|  —| ​|  3,074| ​|  1,563,356  \nConsumer| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nResidential real estate first mortgage| ​|  677,471| ​|  1,234| ​|  311| ​|  —| ​|  535| ​|  679,551  \nResidential real estate junior lien| ​|  149,918| ​|  377| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  184| ​|  150,479  \nOther revolving and installment| ​|  50,360| ​|  237| ​|  10| ​|  —| ​|  1| ​|  50,608  \nTotal consumer| ​|  877,749| ​|  1,848| ​|  321| ​|  —| ​|  720| ​|  880,638  \nTotal loans| ​| $|  2,435,237| ​| $|  4,548| ​| $|  415| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  3,794| ​| $|  2,443,994  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n131\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nIn calculating expected credit losses, the Company includes loans on nonaccrual status and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing.

Servicing loans for others generally consists of collecting mortgage payments, maintaining escrow accounts, disbursing payments to investors and collection and foreclosure processing. Loan servicing income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes servicing fees from investors and certain charges collected from borrowers, such as late payment fees, and is net of fair value adjustments to capitalized mortgage servicing rights.\n\n136\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s activity related to servicing rights for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **Year ended**  \n​| ​| **December 31,**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_| **2023**| **2022**| **2021**  \n**Servicing Assets:**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nBalance at beginning of year| ​| $|  2,643| ​| $|  1,880| ​| $|  1,987  \nAdditions (1)| ​|  300| ​|  1,538| ​| ​|  1,553  \nAmortization (2)| ​|  (595)| ​|  (524)| ​| ​|  (745)  \nBalance at end of year| ​| ​|  2,348| ​| ​|  2,894| ​| ​|  2,795  \nLess valuation reserve (3)| ​|  (296)| ​|  (251)| ​| ​|  (915)  \nBalance at end of year, net of valuation reserve| ​| $|  2,052| ​| $|  2,643| ​| $|  1,880  \nFair value, beginning of year| ​| $|  2,314| ​| $|  1,892| ​| $|  2,137  \nFair value, end of year| ​| $|  2,062| ​| $|  2,314| ​| $|  1,892  \n(1)| Associated income was reported within mortgage banking income, net on the consolidated statements of income.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Associated amortization expense was reported within other noninterest income on the consolidated statements of income.  \n---|---  \n(3)| Associated valuation reserve was reported within mortgage and lending expenses on the consolidated statements of income.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nThe following is a summary of key data and assumptions used in the valuation of servicing rights as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Substantially all the leases in which the Company is the lessee are comprised of real estate property for branches, and office equipment rentals with terms extending through 2037. Portions of certain properties are subleased for terms extending through 2024. Substantially all of the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases. The Company has no existing finance leases.\n\nThe Company elected not to include short-term leases (i.e., leases with initial terms of twelve months or less), or equipment leases (deemed immaterial) on the consolidated financial statements. The following table presents the classification of the Company’s right-of-use, or ROU, assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **December 31,**| **December 31,**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_|  ​| **2023**| **2022**  \n**Lease Right-of-Use Assets**|  ​| **Classification**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets| Operating lease right-of-use assets| ​| $|  5,436| ​| $|  5,419  \n**Lease Liabilities**|  ​| ​| ​  \nOperating lease liabilities| Operating lease liabilities| ​| $|  5,751| ​| $|  5,902  \n  \n​\n\nThe calculated amount of the ROU assets and lease liabilities in the table above are impacted by the length of the lease term and the discount rate used to present value the minimum lease payments. The Company’s lease agreements often include one or more options to renew at the Company’s discretion. If at lease inception, the Company considers the exercising of a renewal option to be reasonably certain, the Company will include the extended term in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. The Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, \n\n137\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\non a collateralized basis, over a similar term for the discount rate.

The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making such commitments as it does for instruments that are included in the statements of financial condition.\n\nA summary of the contractual amounts of the Company’s exposure to off-balance sheet risk as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, was as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **December 31,**|  ​| **December 31,**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_| **2023**| **2022**  \nCommitments to extend credit| ​| $|  942,413| ​| $|  806,431  \nStandby letters of credit| ​|  10,045| ​|  13,089  \nTotal| ​| $|  952,458| ​| $|  819,520  \n  \n​\n\nThe Company had an allowance for loan losses on unfunded commitments of $3.2 million as of December 31, 2022. Upon the adoption of the CECL accounting standard, the Company recorded an additional $1.9 million reserve for unfunded commitments. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an additional $2.3 million in provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments for a total of $7.4 million of allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2023.\n\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a client as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each client’s creditworthiness on a case by case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, and income producing commercial properties.\n\nThe Company was not required to perform on any financial guarantees and did not incur any losses on its commitments during the past two years.\n\nThe Company utilizes standby letters of credit issued by either the FHLB or the Bank of North Dakota to secure public unit deposits. The Company had no letters of credit outstanding with the FHLB as of December 31, 2023 or 2022. With the Bank of North Dakota, the Company had one letter of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2023 in the amount of $182.0 million. There were no letters of credit outstanding with the Bank of North Dakota as of December 31, 2022. Letters of credit with the Bank of North Dakota were collateralized by loans pledged to the Bank of North Dakota in the amount of $454.6 million and $215.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nNOTE 16 Legal Contingencies\n\nThe Company may be subject to claims and lawsuits which may arise primarily in the ordinary course of business. It is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate resolution of these claims and lawsuits is currently not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n141\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nNOTE 17 Share-Based Compensation Plan\n\nOn May 6, 2019, the Company’s stockholders approved the Alerus Financial Corporation 2019 Equity Incentive Plan. This plan allows the compensation committee the ability to grant a wide variety of equity awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and cash incentive awards in such forms and amounts as it deems appropriate to accomplish the goals of the plan. Since inception, all awards issued under the plan have been restricted stock and restricted stock units. Any shares subject to an award that is cancelled, forfeited, or expires prior to exercise or realization, either in full or in part, shall again become available for issuance under the plan. However, shares subject to an award shall not again be made available for issuance or delivery under the plan if such shares are (a) tendered in payment of the exercise price of a stock option, (b) delivered to, or withheld by, the Company to satisfy any tax withholding obligation, or (c) covered by a stock-settled stock appreciation right or other awards that were not issued upon the settlement of the award. Restricted stock units issued do not participate in dividends and recipients are not entitled to vote these restricted stock units until shares of the Company’s common stock are delivered after vesting of the restricted stock units. Shares vest, become exercisable and contain such other terms and conditions as determined by the compensation committee and set forth in individual agreements with the participant receiving the award. Awards issued to Company directors are not subject to any service requirements and vest immediately. The plan authorizes the issuance of up to 1,100,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2023, 779,307 shares of common stock are still available for issue under the plan.\n\n​\n\nThe compensation expense relating to awards under these plans was $1.6 million in 2023, $1.9 million in 2022, and $3.1 million in 2021. The number of unvested shares outstanding was 120,497 and 128,267 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The number of unvested units outstanding was 111,160 and 110,219 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nThe following table presents the activity in the stock plans for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 was as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Year ended December 31,**  \n​| ​| **2023**|  ​| **2022**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| **Weighted-**|  ​| ​| ​| **Weighted-**  \n​| ​| ​| **Average Grant**|  ​| ​| ​| **Average Grant**  \n​| **Awards**| **Date Fair Value**| **Awards**| **Date Fair Value**  \nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Awards| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nOutstanding at beginning of period|  238,486| $|  23.65| ​|  260,850| $|  21.04  \nGranted|  117,706| ​|  19.95| ​|  102,265| ​|  25.44  \nVested|  (98,138)| ​|  21.44| ​|  (113,562)| ​|  19.25  \nForfeited or cancelled|  (26,397)| ​|  21.33| ​|  (11,067)| ​|  23.90  \nOutstanding at end of period| ​|  231,657| ​| $|  22.96| ​|  238,486| ​| $|  23.65  \n  \n​\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was $2.7 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested awards granted under the plans.

The plans cover substantially all employees upon satisfying prescribed eligibility requirements for age and length of service. Contributions to the ESOP are determined annually by the Board of Directors, at its discretion, and allocated to participants based on a percentage of annual compensation. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, there were no unallocated ESOP shares outstanding. Shares of the Company stock within the ESOP are considered outstanding and dividends on these shares are charged to retained earnings. Under the 401(k) plan, the Company contributes 100% of amounts deferred by employees up to 3% of eligible compensation and 50% of amounts deferred by employees between 3% and 6% of eligible compensation. Retirement plan contributions are reflected under employee benefits in the income statement and for years ending December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **December 31,**|  ​| **December 31,**|  ​| **December 31,**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_| **2023**| **2022**| **2021**  \nSalary reduction plan| ​| $|  2,933| ​| $|  3,148| ​| $|  3,123  \nESOP| ​|  1,604| ​|  1,932| ​|  2,014  \nTotal| ​| $|  4,537| ​| $|  5,080| ​| $|  5,137  \nTotal ESOP shares outstanding| ​|  1,152,017| ​|  1,111,424| ​|  1,207,952  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\nNOTE 19 Noninterest Income\n\nThe following table presents the Company’s noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Year ended**  \n​| ​| **December 31,**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_| **2023**| **2022**| **2021**  \nRetirement and benefits| ​| $|  65,294| ​| $|  67,135| ​| $|  71,709  \nWealth management| ​|  21,855| ​|  20,870| ​| ​|  21,052  \nMortgage banking (1)| ​|  8,411| ​|  16,921| ​| ​|  48,502  \nService charges on deposit accounts| ​|  1,280| ​|  1,434| ​| ​|  1,395  \nNet gains (losses) on investment securities (1)| ​|  (24,643)| ​|  —| ​| ​|  125  \nOther| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nInterchange fees| ​|  2,222| ​|  2,246| ​| ​|  2,180  \nBank-owned life insurance income (1)| ​|  877| ​|  836| ​| ​|  793  \nMisc. transactional fees| ​|  1,433| ​|  1,429| ​| ​|  1,218  \nOther noninterest income| ​|  3,500| ​|  352| ​| ​|  413  \nTotal noninterest income| ​| $|  80,229| ​| $|  111,223| ​| $|  147,387  \n(1)| Not within the scope of ASC 606.  \n---|---  \n  \n_Contract balances:_ A contract asset balance occurs when an entity performs a service for a customer before the customer pays consideration (resulting in a contract receivable) or before payment is due (resulting in a contract asset). A contract liability balance is an entity’s obligation to transfer a service to a customer for which the entity has already received payment (or payment is due) from the customer. The Company’s noninterest income streams are largely based on transactional activity, or standard month-end revenue accruals such as asset management fees based on month-end market value. Consideration is often received immediately or shortly after the Company satisfies its performance obligation and revenue is recognized. The Company does not typically enter into long-term revenue contracts with customers, and therefore, does not experience significant contract balances. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not have any significant contract balances.\n\n​\n\n143\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\n _Contract acquisition costs_ : In connection with the adoption of Topic 606, an entity is required to capitalize, and subsequently amortize into expense, certain incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if these costs are expected to be recovered. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those costs that an entity incurs to obtain a contract with a customer that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained (for example, sales commission). The Company utilizes the practical expedient which allows entities to immediately expense contract acquisition costs when the asset would have resulted from capitalizing these costs would have been amortized in one year or less.\n\nNOTE 20 Income Taxes\n\nThe components of income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Year ended**  \n​| ​| **December 31,**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_| **2023**| **2022**| **2021**  \n**Federal**|  ​| ​| ​  \nCurrent| ​| $|  851| ​| $|  9,005| ​| $|  10,731  \nDeferred| ​|  1,151| ​|  727| ​|  2,212  \nFederal income tax| ​|  2,002| ​|  9,732| ​|  12,943  \n**State**|  ​| ​| ​  \nCurrent| ​|  2,415| ​|  2,298| ​|  2,879  \nDeferred| ​|  (259)| ​|  147| ​|  574  \nState income tax| ​|  2,156| ​|  2,445| ​|  3,453  \nTotal income tax expense| ​| $|  4,158| ​| $|  12,177| ​| $|  16,396  \n  \n​\n\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **December 31,**|  ​| **December 31,**  \n_(dollars in thousands)_| **2023**| **2022**  \n**Deferred Tax Assets**|  ​| ​  \nAllowance for credit losses| ​| $|  9,002| ​| $|  7,818  \nEmployee compensation and benefit accruals| ​|  2,253| ​|  2,455  \nExpense accruals| ​|  327| ​|  417  \nIdentifiable intangible amortization| ​|  2,176| ​|  3,363  \nDeferred loan fees| ​|  931| ​|  1,665  \nNet operating loss carry forwards| ​|  —| ​|  3  \nNonaccrual loan interest| ​|  143| ​|  74  \nUnrealized loss on available‑for‑sale investment securities| ​|  24,548| ​|  33,056  \nUnrealized loss on derivative and hedge instruments| ​| ​|  135| ​| ​|  —  \nUnfunded commitment liability| ​| ​|  1,913| ​| ​|  814  \nOperating lease liabilities| ​| ​|  1,486| ​| ​|  —  \nOther| ​|  129| ​|  70  \nTotal deferred tax assets from temporary differences| ​|  43,043| ​|  49,735  \n**Deferred Tax Liabilities**|  ​| ​  \nAccumulated depreciation| ​|  737| ​|  835  \nGoodwill and intangible amortization| ​|  3,840| ​|  5,115  \nServicing assets| ​|  530| ​|  663  \nPrepaid expenses| ​|  1,188| ​|  552  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets| ​| ​|  1,539| ​| ​|  —  \nOther| ​|  614| ​|  201  \nTotal deferred tax liabilities from temporary differences| ​|  8,448| ​|  7,366  \nNet Deferred Tax Assets| ​| $|  34,595| ​| $|  42,369  \n  \n​\n\n144\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe reconciliation between applicable income taxes and the amount computed at the applicable statutory Federal tax rate for years ending December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Year ended December 31,**|  ​  \n​| ​| **2023**|  ​| ​| **2022**|  ​| **2021**|  ​  \n​| ​| ​| **Percent of**|  ​| ​| **Percent of**|  ​| ​| **Percent of**  \n _(dollars in thousands)_|  ​| **Amount**|  ​| **Pretax Income**|  ​| **Amount**|  ​| **Pretax Income**| **Amount**|  ​| **Pretax Income**  \nTaxes at statutory federal income tax rate| ​| $|  3,329|  21.0| % | ​| $|  10,958|  21.0| %| $|  14,506|  21.0| %  \nTax effect of:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nTax exempt income| ​|  (715)|  (4.5)| % | ​|  (514)|  (1.0)| % |  (556)|  (0.8)| %  \nState income taxes, net of federal benefits| ​|  715|  4.5| % | ​|  2,297|  4.4| ​|  2,973|  4.3| %  \nNondeductible items and other| ​| ​|  829| ​|  5.2| % | ​| ​|  (564)| ​|  (1.1)| ​| ​|  (527)| ​|  (0.8)| %  \nApplicable income taxes| ​| $|  4,158|  26.2| % | ​| $|  12,177|  23.3| %| $|  16,396|  23.7| %  \n  \n​\n\nIt is the opinion of management that the Company has no significant uncertain tax positions that would be subject to change upon examination.\n\nNOTE 21 Tax Credit Investments\n\nThe Company invests in qualified affordable housing projects for the purpose of community reinvestment and obtaining tax credits.

The Company manages these risks as part of its overall asset and liability management process and through its policies and procedures. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a notional amount and an underlying as specified in the contract. \n\nDerivatives are often measured in terms of notional amount, but this amount is generally not exchanged, and it is not recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The notional amount is the basis to which the underlying is applied to determine required payments under the derivative contract. The underlying is a referenced interest rate, security price, credit spread, or other index. Residential and commercial real estate loan commitments associated with loans to be sold also qualify as derivative instruments. \n\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity and credit risk. Certain hedging relationships are formally designated and qualify for hedge accounting under GAAP. On the date the Company enters into a derivative contract designated as a hedging instrument, the derivative is designated as either a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. When a derivative is designated as a fair value, cash flow, or net investment hedge, the Company performs an assessment, at inception and, at a minimum, quarterly thereafter, to determine the effectiveness of the derivative in offsetting changes in the value or cash flows of the hedged item(s). As of December 31, 2023, the Company only uses fair value and cash flow hedges. \n\n_Fair value hedges:_ These derivatives are interest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge the change in fair value related to interest rate changes of its underlying mortgage-backed investment securities and mortgage loan pools. The interest rate swaps are carried on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value in other assets (when the fair value is positive) or in accrued expenses and other liabilities (when the fair value is negative). The changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in interest income. The unrealized gains or losses due to changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps due to changes in benchmark interest rates are recorded as an adjustment to the hedged instruments and offset in the same interest income line items.\n\n_Cash flow hedges:_ These derivatives are interest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge the variability of expected future cash flows due to market interest changes. The interest rate swap is carried on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at its fair value in other assets (when the fair value is positive) or in accrued expenses and other liabilities (when the fair value is negative). Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), or OCI, until the cash flows of the hedged items are realized. If a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is terminated or ceases to be highly effective, the gain or loss in OCI is amortized to earnings over the period the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings. If a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable, hedge accounting is ceased and any gain or loss included in OCI is reported in earnings immediately, unless the forecasted transaction is at least reasonably possible of occurring, whereby the amounts remain within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), or AOCI. There were no cash flow hedges at December 31, 2022. The Company estimates that an additional $0.3 million will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense over the next 12 months. All cash flow hedges were highly effective for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 12 months.\n\n​\n\n148\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\n\n _Interest rate swaps:_ The Company periodically enters into commercial loan interest rate swap agreements in order to provide commercial loan customers with the ability to convert from variable to fixed interest rates. These derivative contracts relate to transactions in which the Company enters into an interest rate swap with a customer, while simultaneously entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with an institutional counterparty.\n\n_Interest rate lock commitments, forward loan sales commitments and to be announced (TBA) mortgage backed securities:_ The Company enters into forward delivery contracts to sell mortgage loans at specific prices and dates in order to hedge the interest rate risk in its portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale and its residential mortgage interest rate lock commitments.\n\nThe following table presents the total notional amounts and gross fair values of the Company’s derivatives as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​|

This requirement is dependent on certain specified credit measures. The amount of collateral posted with third parties at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, was $550 thousand and $309 thousand. The amount of collateral posted with third parties is deemed to be sufficient to collateralize both the fair market value change a well as any additional amounts that may be required as a result of a change in the specified credit measures.\n\nCredit Risk-Related Contingent Features\n\nBy using derivatives, the Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent that counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as required. Should a counterparty fail to perform under the terms of a derivative contract, the Company’s credit exposure on interest rate swaps is limited to the net positive fair value and accrued interest of all swaps with each counterparty. The Company seeks to minimize counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. As such, management believes the risk of incurring credit losses on derivative contracts with institutional counterparties is remote. \n\nThe Company has agreements with its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where, if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including defaults where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. In addition, the Company also has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where, if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well-capitalized institution, the counterparty could terminate the derivative position(s) and the Company could be required to settle its obligations under the agreements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, which included accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for non-performance risk, related to these agreements was $649 thousand and $0, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of its derivative counterparties and has posted cash collateral of $550 thousand and $309, respectively. If the Company had breached any of these provisions at December 31, 2023 or 2022, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their termination value of $649 thousand and $0, respectively.\n\n​\n\n151\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nBalance Sheet Offsetting\n\nThe following table presents the Company’s derivative positions and the potential effect of netting arrangements on its financial position as of the dates indicated:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **Gross Amount**|  ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **Not Offset in the**|  ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **Consolidated**|  ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **Balance Sheets**|  ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **Gross Amount**|  ​| **Gross Amount**|  ​| **Net Amount**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **Recognized in the**|  ​| **Offset in the**|  ​| **Presented in the**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **Consolidated**|  ​| **Consolidated**|  ​| **Consolidated**|  ​| **Cash Collateral**|  ​| ​| ​  \n _(dollars in thousands)_|  ​| **Balance Sheets**|  ​| **Balance Sheets**|  ​| **Balance Sheets**|  ​| **Pledged (Received)**|  ​| **Net Amount**  \nDecember 31, 2023| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Derivative assets:**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nInterest rate swaps - Company (1)| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —  \nInterest rate swaps - dealer bank (1)| ​| ​|  8,327| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  8,327| ​| ​|  (1,740)| ​| ​|  6,587  \nTo-be-announced mortgage backed securities| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —  \nTotal| ​| $|  8,327| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  8,327| ​| $|  (1,740)| ​| $|  6,587  \n**Derivative liabilities:**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nInterest rate swaps - Company (1)| ​| $|  649| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  649| ​| $|  550| ​| $|  99  \nInterest rate swaps - customer (2)| ​| ​|  8,348| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  8,348| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  8,348  \nTo-be-announced mortgage backed securities| ​| ​|  183| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  183| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  183  \nTotal| ​| $|  9,180| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  9,180| ​| $|  550| ​| $|  8,630  \nDecember 31, 2022| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Derivative assets:**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nInterest rate swaps - Company (1)| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —  \nInterest rate swaps - dealer bank (1)| ​| ​|  6,277| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  6,277| ​| ​|  (6,030)| ​| ​|  247  \nTo-be-announced mortgage backed securities| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —  \nTotal| ​| $|  6,277| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  6,277| ​| $|  (6,030)| ​| $|  247  \n**Derivative liabilities:**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nInterest rate swaps - customer (2)| ​| $|  6,277| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  6,277| ​| $|  309| ​| $|  5,968  \nTo-be-announced mortgage backed securities| ​| ​|  26| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  26| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  26  \nTotal| ​| $|  6,303| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  6,303| ​| $|  309| ​| $|  5,994  \n(1)| The Company maintains a master netting agreement with each counterparty and settles collateral on a net basis for all interest rate swaps with counterparty banks.  \n---|---  \n(2)| The Company manages its net exposure on its customer loan swaps by obtaining collateral as part of the normal loan policy and underwriting practices.

The Old Stock Repurchase Program was terminated on/expired on February 18, 2024. \n\nOn December 12, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a new stock repurchase program, or the New Stock Repurchase Program, which authorizes the Company to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of its common stock subject to certain limitations and conditions. The New Stock Repurchase Program became effective February 18, 2024, and will expire on February 18, 2027. On February 18, 2024, the New Stock Repurchase Program replaced and superseded the Old Stock Repurchase Program.\n\nThe New Stock Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any shares of its common stock and there is no assurance that the Company will do so. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased 356,474 shares, from time-to-time, under the Old Stock Repurchase Program. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not repurchase any shares under the Old Stock Repurchase Program. The Company also repurchases shares to pay withholding taxes on the vesting of restricted stock awards and units.\n\nNOTE 29 Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities\n\nThe Company categorizes its assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value into a three level hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique used to determine estimated fair value. The estimated fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used in the determination of the estimated fair value measurement fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the estimated fair value measurement. Assets and liabilities valued at estimated fair value are categorized based on the following inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:\n\n_Level 1_ —Inputs that utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that an entity has the ability to access.\n\n​\n\n155\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\n _Level 2_ —Inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Estimated fair values for these instruments are estimated using pricing models, quoted prices of investment securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows.\n\n_Level 3_ —Inputs that are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company may re-measure the carrying value of assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis to estimated fair value. Adjustments to estimated fair value usually result when certain assets are impaired. Such assets are written down from their carrying amounts to their estimated fair value.\n\nProfessional standards allow entities the irrevocable option to elect to measure certain financial instruments and other items at estimated fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The Company adopted the policy to value certain financial instruments at estimated fair value. The Company has not elected to measure any existing financial instruments at estimated fair value; however, it may elect to measure newly acquired financial instruments at estimated fair value in the future.\n\nRecurring Basis\n\nThe Company uses estimated fair value measurements to record estimated fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine estimated fair value disclosures. For additional information on how the Company measures estimated fair value refer to Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies).\n\nThe following tables present the balances of the assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **December 31, 2023**  \n _(dollars in thousands)_| **Level 1**| **Level 2**| **Level 3**| **Total**  \nAvailable-for-sale | ​| ​| ​| ​  \nU.S. treasury and government agencies| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  1,120| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  1,120  \nMortgage backed securities| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nResidential agency| ​|  —| ​|  435,594| ​|  —| ​|  435,594  \nCommercial| ​|  —| ​|  1,353| ​|  —| ​|  1,353  \nAsset backed securities| ​|  —| ​|  25| ​|  —| ​|  25  \nCorporate bonds| ​|  —| ​|  48,644| ​|  —| ​|  48,644  \nTotal available-for-sale investment securities| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  486,736| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  486,736  \nOther assets| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nDerivatives| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  8,512| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  8,512  \nOther liabilities| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nDerivatives| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  9,180| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  9,180  \n  \n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **December 31, 2022**  \n _(dollars in thousands)_| **Level 1**| **Level 2**| **Level 3**| **Total**  \nAvailable-for-sale | ​| ​| ​| ​  \nU.S. treasury and government agencies| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  3,520| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  3,520  \nMortgage backed securities| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nResidential agency| ​|  —| ​|  587,679| ​|  —| ​|  587,679  \nCommercial| ​|  —| ​|  63,558| ​|  —| ​|  63,558  \nAsset backed securities| ​|  —| ​|  34| ​|  —| ​|  34  \nCorporate bonds| ​|  —| ​|  62,533| ​|  —| ​|  62,533  \nTotal available-for-sale investment securities| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  717,324| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  717,324  \nOther assets| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nDerivatives| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  6,405| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  6,405  \nOther liabilities| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nDerivatives| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  6,303| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  6,303  \n  \n​\n\n156\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.\n\nInvestment Securities, Available-for-sale\n\nGenerally, debt securities are valued using pricing for similar securities, recently executed transactions, and other pricing models utilizing observable inputs and therefore are classified as Level 2.\n\nDerivatives\n\nAll of the Company’s derivatives are traded in over the counter markets where quoted market prices are not readily available. For these derivatives, estimated fair value is measured using internally developed models that use primarily market observable inputs, such as yield curves and option volatilities, and accordingly, classify as Level 2. Examples of Level 2 derivatives are basic interest rate swaps and forward contracts.\n\nNonrecurring Basis\n\nCertain assets are measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets are not measured at estimated fair value on an ongoing basis; however, they are subject to estimated fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment or a change in the amount of previously recognized impairment.\n\nThe estimated fair value of certain assets on a nonrecurring basis for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **December 31, 2023**  \n _(dollars in thousands)_| **Level 1**| **Level 2**| **Level 3**| **Total**  \nCollateral dependent loans| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  3,998| ​| $|  3,998  \nForeclosed assets| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  32| ​|  32  \nServicing rights| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  2,052| ​|  2,052  \n  \n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **December 31, 2022**  \n _(dollars in thousands)_| **Level 1**| **Level 2**| **Level 3**| **Total**  \nCollateral dependent loans| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  2,813| ​| $|  2,813  \nForeclosed assets| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  30| ​|  30  \nServicing rights| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  2,643| ​|  2,643  \n  \n​\n\nLoans Held for Sale\n\nLoans originated and held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value.

Typically, these quotes include a premium on the sale and thus these quotes indicate estimated fair value of the held for sale loans is greater than cost.\n\nImpairment losses for loans held for sale that are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value represent additional net write-downs during the period to record these loans at the lower of cost or estimated fair value subsequent to their initial classification as loans held for sale.\n\n​\n\n157\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nThe valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used to measure Level 3 estimated fair value as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **December 31, 2023**|  ​  \n _(dollars in thousands)_|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **Weighted**|  ​  \n**Asset Type**| **Valuation Technique**| **Unobservable Input**| **Fair Value**| **Range**| **Average**  \nIndividually evaluated| Appraisal value| Property specific adjustment| $|  3,998|  10.0| % |  10.0| %   \nForeclosed assets| Appraisal value| Property specific adjustment (1)|  32| N/A| N/A  \nServicing rights| Discounted cash flows| Prepayment speed assumptions|  2,052| 85-151|  104  \n​| Discount rate|  11.1| % |  11.1| %   \n(1)| There were no discounts taken on the collateral that comprises the balance of foreclosed assets as of December 31, 2023.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **December 31, 2022**|  ​  \n _(dollars in thousands)_|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **Weighted**  \n**Asset Type**| **Valuation Technique**| **Unobservable Input**| **Fair Value**| **Range**| **Average**  \nIndividually evaluated| Appraisal value| Property specific adjustment| $|  2,813|  10.0| % |  10.0| %   \nForeclosed assets| Appraisal value| Property specific adjustment (1)|  30| N/A| N/A| ​  \nServicing rights| Discounted cash flows| Prepayment speed assumptions|  2,643| 103-137|  115| ​  \n​| Discount rate|  10.5| % |  10.5| %  \n(1)| There were no discounts taken on the collateral that comprises the balance of foreclosed assets as of December 31, 2022.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nDisclosure of estimated fair value information about financial instruments, for which it is practicable to estimate that value, is required whether or not recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. In cases in which quoted market prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimate of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived estimated fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instruments. Certain financial instruments, with an estimated fair value that is not practicable to estimate and all non-financial instruments, are excluded from the disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate estimated fair value amounts presented do not necessarily represent the underlying value of the Company.\n\n​\n\nThe following disclosures represent financial instruments in which the ending balances, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, were not carried at estimated fair value in their entirety on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nCash and Due from Banks and Accrued Interest\n\nThe carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate those assets and liabilities estimated fair values.\n\nInvestment Securities, Held-to-Maturity\n\nThe fair values of debt securities held-to-maturity are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar securities, recently executed transactions and pricing models.\n\n158\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nLoans\n\nFor variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, estimated fair values are based on carrying values. The estimated fair values of other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality.\n\nBank-Owned Life Insurance\n\nBank-owned life insurance is carried at the amount due upon surrender of the policy, which is also the estimated fair value. This amount was provided by the insurance companies based on the terms of the underlying insurance contract.\n\nDeposits\n\nThe estimated fair values of demand deposits are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the consolidated balance sheet date. The estimated fair values of fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current incremental interest rates being offered on certificates of deposit to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities of the outstanding certificates of deposit.\n\nShort-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt\n\nFor variable-rate borrowings that reprice frequently, estimated fair values are based on carrying values. The estimated fair values of fixed-rate borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on the Company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Credit-Related Commitments\n\nOff-balance sheet credit related commitments are generally of short-term nature. The contract amount of such commitments approximates their estimated fair value since the commitments are comprised primarily of unfunded loan commitments which are generally priced at market at the time of funding.\n\nThe estimated fair values, and related carrying or notional amounts, of the Company’s financial instruments at the dates indicated are as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **December 31, 2023**  \n​| ​| **Carrying**|  ​| **Estimated Fair Value**  \n _(dollars in thousands)_| **Amount**| **Level 1**| **Level 2**| **Level 3**| **Total**  \n**Financial Assets**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nCash and cash equivalents| ​| $|  129,893| ​| $|  129,893| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  129,893  \nInvestment securities held-to-maturity| ​| ​|  299,515| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  258,617| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  258,617  \nLoans, net| ​|  2,723,740| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  2,590,535| ​|  2,590,535  \nAccrued interest receivable| ​|  15,700| ​|  15,700| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  15,700  \nBank-owned life insurance| ​|  33,236| ​|  —| ​|  33,236| ​|  —| ​|  33,236  \n**Financial Liabilities**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nNoninterest-bearing deposits| ​| $|  728,082| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  728,082| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  728,082  \nInterest-bearing deposits| ​|  1,955,967| ​|  —| ​|  1,955,967| ​|  —| ​|  1,955,967  \nTime deposits| ​|  411,562| ​|  —| ​|  408,910| ​|  —| ​|  408,910  \nShort-term borrowings| ​|  314,170| ​|  314,170| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  314,170  \nLong-term debt| ​|  58,956| ​|  —| ​|  57,437| ​|  —| ​|  57,437  \nAccrued interest payable| ​|  6,826| ​|  6,826| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  6,826  \n  \n​\n\n159\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **December 31, 2022**  \n​| ​| **Carrying**|  ​| **Estimated Fair Value**  \n _(dollars in thousands)_| **Amount**| **Level 1**| **Level 2**| **Level 3**| **Total**  \n**Financial Assets**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nCash and cash equivalents| ​| $|  58,242| ​| $|  58,242| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  58,242  \nInvestment securities held-to-maturity| ​| ​|  321,902| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  270,912| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  270,912  \nLoans, net| ​|  2,412,848| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  2,311,956| ​|  2,311,956  \nAccrued interest receivable| ​|  12,869| ​|  12,869| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  12,869  \nBank-owned life insurance| ​|  33,991| ​|  —| ​|  33,991| ​|  —| ​|  33,991  \n**Financial Liabilities**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nNoninterest-bearing deposits| ​| $|  860,987| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  860,987| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  860,987  \nInterest-bearing deposits| ​|  1,842,138| ​|  —| ​|  1,842,138| ​|  —| ​|  1,842,138  \nTime deposits| ​|  212,359| ​|  —| ​|  208,550| ​|  —| ​|  208,550  \nShort-term borrowings| ​|  378,080| ​|  378,080| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  378,080  \nLong-term debt| ​|  58,843| ​|  —| ​|  56,116| ​|  —| ​|  56,116  \nAccrued interest payable| ​|  2,426| ​|  2,426| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  2,426  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n160\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nNOTE 30 Parent Company Only Financial Statements\n\nThe condensed financial statements of Alerus Financial Corporation (parent company only) are presented below.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\n\nNone.\n\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nThe Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2023, the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nEvaluation of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. As an emerging growth company, management’s report on internal control over financial reporting was not subject to attestation by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with the JOBS Act.\n\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.\n\nInternal control over financial reporting of the Company includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the Company; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\nBecause of inherent limitations in any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected, including the possibility of the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time.\n\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework in 2013. Based on this assessment, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer assert that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on the specified criteria.\n\n163\n\n[Table of Contents](#ALRS-20231231X10K_HTM_TOC)\n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nThere has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial report.\n\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\n\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, none of the Company’s directors or executive officers adopted or terminated any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.\n\nITEM 9C.

Employee must notify Company in writing of any Event that constitutes Good Reason hereunder within thirty days following Employee’s initial knowledge of the existence of such Event or such Event shall not constitute Good Reason under this Agreement. Employee must provide prior written notification in accordance with Section 4 of his intention to terminate his employment for Good Reason and the Termination Date and Company shall have thirty days from the date of receipt of such notice to effect a cure of the condition constituting Good Reason, and, upon cure thereof by the Company, such event shall no longer constitute Good Reason.  \n---|---  \ng.| Retirement Age shall mean the attainment of age 65.  \n---|---  \nh.| Specified Employee shall mean an employee who at the time of termination of employment is a key employee of the Company, if any stock of the Company is publicly traded on an established securities market or otherwise.

Thereafter, the term of this Agreement will automatically renew each day after the Effective Date for one additional day so that the term of the Agreement shall always be twenty four months. Notwithstanding the forgoing, prior to a Change in Control, this Agreement may be terminated upon 120 days’ written notice of intent not to renew by either party; after a Change in Control, this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the second anniversary of the closing on the event constituting the Change in Control.  \n---|---  \n3.| **NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**  \n---|---  \na.| Except as permitted in writing by the Company, the Employee shall not at any time divulge, furnish or make accessible to anyone, or use in any way other than in the ordinary course of the business of the Company or its Affiliates, any confidential, proprietary, or secret knowledge or information of the Company or its Affiliates that the Employee has acquired or will acquire about the Company or its Affiliates, whether developed by himself or herself or by others, concerning (i) any trade secrets; (ii) any confidential, proprietary, or secret designs, programs, processes, formulae, plans, devices, or material (whether or not patented or patentable) directly or indirectly useful in any aspect of the business of the Company or of its Affiliates; (iii) any customer or supplier lists; (iv) any confidential, proprietary, or secret development or research work; (v) any strategic or other business, marketing, or sales plans; (vi) any financial data or plans; or (viii) any other confidential, proprietary, or secret information about any aspect of the business of the Company or of its Affiliates (collectively “Confidential Information”).  \n---|---  \nb.| The Employee acknowledges that the knowledge and information described above constitutes a unique and valuable asset of the Company and represents a substantial investment of time and expense by the Company and that any disclosure or other use of such knowledge or information other than for the sole benefit of the Company or its Affiliates would be wrongful and would cause irreparable harm to the Company. The Employee shall not intentionally commit any act that would materially reduce the value of such knowledge or information to the Company or its Affiliates. The Employee's obligations under this Agreement to maintain the confidentiality of the Company's confidential, proprietary, and secret information are in addition to any obligations of the Employee under applicable statutory or common law. The obligations of the Employee under this Section 3 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the termination of the Employee’s employment with the Company.  \n---|---  \nc.| The foregoing obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to any knowledge or information that: (i) is now or subsequently becomes generally publicly known,  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n3\n\n​\n\nother than as a direct or indirect result of the breach of this Agreement; (ii) is independently made available to the Employee in good faith by a third party who has not violated a confidential relationship with the Company or its Affiliates or any other entity; or (iii) is required to be disclosed by law or legal process.\n\nd.| If the Employee breaches any of the covenants in this Section 3, the Employee’s right to any of the payments specified in Section 5 after the date of the breach shall be forever forfeited and the right of the Employee’s designated beneficiary or estate to any payments under this Agreement shall likewise be forever forfeited. This forfeiture is in addition to and not instead of any injunctive or other relief that may be available to the Company.  \n---|---  \n4.| **TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT**. During the Term, the Employee’s employment with the Company shall terminate upon:  \n---|---  \na.| the date specified in written notice from the Company to Employee notifying him of the termination of his employment for any reason, provided that if Employee’s employment is terminated by the Company without Cause (defined below), then the Company shall provide Employee at least thirty days’ notice of termination or pay in lieu of notice;  \n---|---  \nb.| Employee providing to the Company not less than sixty nor more than ninety days’ prior written notice of his resignation of employment, including for Good Reason, effective at the end of such period, provided that the Company may in its sole discretion elect to relieve Employee from his duties and place him on paid leave during all or any portion of the notice period; or  \n---|---  \nc.| Employee’s death or Disability.  \n---|---  \n5.| **SEVERANCE PAYMENTS.**  \n---|---  \na.| Except as provided in Section 5(b), upon the termination of Employee’s employment by the Company other than for Cause prior to a Change in Control, the Employee shall be entitled to an amount equal to the aggregate of _one_ times: (i) the annual rate of base salary then being paid to the Employee, plus (ii) the average of the past three years short term bonus pay, plus (iii) the Company’s portion of 12 months’ premiums under any health, disability and life insurance plan or program in which the Employee was entitled to participate immediately prior to the Termination Date (the aggregated amount, the “Severance Pay”), which shall be paid to Employee by the Company over a period of 12 months from the Termination Date in accordance with the Company’s regular payroll cycle, commencing on the first regular payroll date of the Company that occurs more than 60 days after the Termination Date (and including any installment that would have otherwise been paid on regular payroll dates during the period of 60 days following the Termination Date), provided the conditions specified in Section 5(c) have been satisfied.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n4\n\n​\n\nb.| Notwithstanding Section 5(a) and subject to the limitation in Section 5(e), if (i) the Employee’s employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or by the Employee for Good Reason, and (ii) the Termination Date occurs within 24 months immediately following a Change in Control, the Employee shall receive two times the Severance Pay calculated in accordance with Section 5(a), which shall be paid to Employee by the Company in a lump sum on the later of 60th day following the Termination Date or the closing on the event constituting the Change in Control, provided the conditions specified in Section 5(c) have been satisfied.  \n---|---  \nc.| Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 5(a) and (b), the Company will not be obligated to make any payments to or on behalf of Employee under Section 5(a) and (b), as applicable, unless (i) Employee signs a release of claims in favor of the Company in a form as prepared by the Company (the “ _Release_ ”) and delivered to Employee no later than five business days after the Termination Date, (ii) all applicable consideration periods and rescission periods provided by law with respect to the Release have expired without Employee rescinding the Release, and (iii) Employee is in strict compliance with the terms of this Agreement as of the dates of the payments. The cessation of these payments will be in addition to, and not as an alternative to, any other remedies at law or in equity available to the Company, including without limitation the right to seek specific performance or an injunction.  \n---|---  \nd.| If, when the Employee’s termination of employment occurs, the Employee is a specified employee within the meaning of section 409A of the Code, and if the Severance Pay would be considered deferred compensation under section 409A of the Code, and finally if an exemption from the six-month delay requirement of section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code is not available, the Employee’s Severance Pay payments for the first six months following separation from service shall be paid to the Employee in a single lump sum on the first day of the seventh month after the month in which the Employee’s separation from service occurs.  \n---|---  \ne.| In the event that the vesting, acceleration and payment of any equity awards or other compensation or benefits, together with all other payments and the value of any benefit received or to be received by the Employee under this Agreement would result in all or a portion of such payment being subject to excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, then the amounts due under Section 5(b) that the Company shall pay to the Employee shall be either (i) the full payment or (ii) such lesser amount determined by the Company in accordance with this Section 5(e) that would result in no portion of the payment being subject to excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code (the “Excise Tax”), whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable Federal, state, and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by the Employee, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of the payment notwithstanding that all or some portion of the payment may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code. In the event the amounts due under Section are reduced, the amounts shall be reduced in the following order of priority: first, with respect to any amount that  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n5\n\n​\n\ndoes not constitute the “deferral of compensation” under Section 409A of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder, disregard the acceleration in the time of payment and then disregard the acceleration of vesting as a result of a Change in Control and second, with respect to any amount that constitutes the “deferral of compensation” under Section 409A of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder, disregard the acceleration in the time of payment and then disregard the acceleration of vesting as a result of a Change in Control first with respect to Company funded amounts and then the Employee’s deferrals, in each case only to the extent necessary to satisfy (ii) above. All determinations required to be made under this Section 5(e) shall be made by a nationally recognized accounting firm that is the Company’s outside auditor immediately prior to the event triggering the payments that are subject to the Excise Tax (the “Accounting Firm”). The Company shall cause the Accounting Firm to provide detailed supporting calculations of its determinations to the Company and Employee. Notice must be given to the Accounting Firm within 15 business days after an event entitling Employee to an amount due under this Agreement. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. The Accounting Firm’s determinations must be made with substantial authority (within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code). For the purposes of all calculations under Section 280G of the Code and the application of this Section 5.1, all determination as to present value shall use 120 percent of the applicable Federal rate (determined under Section 1274(d) of the Code) compounded based on the nature of the payment, as in effect on the Date of Termination, but if not otherwise specified, compounded on a semiannual basis. The determination by the Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the Company and the Employee.\n\nf.| If Employee’s employment with the Company is terminated by the Company for Cause or for any reason not covered by Section 5(a) or 5(b), then the Company shall pay to Employee only his base salary and any accrued but unused vacation or PTO earned through the Termination Date.  \n---|---  \ng.| In addition to the benefits otherwise provided in Section 5, the Employee shall be entitled to the following benefits and payments upon the Employee’s termination of employment: (i) the payment of the Employee’s base salary and any other form or type of compensation earned, vested and payable through the Date of Termination; (ii) the right to receive all benefits to which the Employee is vested on the Date of Termination in accordance with the terms under the Company pension and welfare benefit plans or any successor of such plan and any other plan or agreement relating to retirement benefits; and (iii) the right to exercise and to receive all rights in which the Employee is vested on the Date of Termination, in accordance with the terms of all awards under any Company stock purchase and stock incentive plans or programs, or any successor to any such plans or programs.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n6\n\n​\n\n6.| **POST TERMINATION OBLIGATIONS.**  \n---|---  \na.| Upon the Employee's termination of employment for any reason, or at any time upon the Company's request, the Employee shall promptly deliver to the Company all Company and Affiliate records and all Company and Affiliate property in the Employee’s possession or the Employee’s control, including without limitation manuals, books, blank forms, documents, letters, memoranda, notes, notebooks, reports, printouts, computer disks, computer tapes, source codes, data, tables or calculations, and all copies thereof; documents that in whole or in part contain any Confidential Information of the Company or its Affiliates and all copies thereof; and keys, access cards, access codes, passwords, credit cards, personal or laptop computers, telephones, PDAs, smart phones, and other electronic equipment belonging to the Company or an Affiliate.  \n---|---  \nb.| Unless otherwise requested by the Company in writing, upon Employee’s termination of employment with the Company for any reason Employee shall automatically resign as of the Termination Date from all titles, positions and appointments Employee then holds with the Company and any and all Affiliates, whether as an officer, director, trustee, fiduciary or employee (without any claim for compensation related thereto), and Employee hereby agrees to take all actions necessary to effectuate such resignations.  \n---|---  \nc.| During the Term and thereafter during the 24 month period following termination of employment for any reason, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Employee shall not make any statement that is disparaging or reflects negatively upon the Company or its Affiliates, or any of their officers, directors or employees, to, or that is likely to come to the attention of, (a) any customer, vendor, supplier, distributor or other trade related business relation of the Company or any of its Affiliates, (b) any employee of the Company or its Affiliates, or (c) any member of the media. Nothing herein shall prevent the Employee from responding truthfully to any inquiry from a governmental entity, engaging in any protected activities and/or from communicating with the Board and/or those employees with a need to know about personnel issues involving Company officers, directors and/or employees.  \n---|---  \nd.| Following termination of Employee’s employment with the Company for any reason, Employee will, upon reasonable request of the Company or its designee and provided the Company is not in material breach of any provision of this Agreement, respond to inquiries and cooperate with the Company in connection with the transition of his duties and responsibilities for the Company for up to six months following the Termination Date; and be reasonably available at mutually convenient times, with or without subpoena, to be interviewed, review documents or things, give depositions, testify, or engage in other reasonable activities in connection with any litigation or investigation, with respect to matters that Employee then has or may have knowledge of by virtue of his employment by or service to the Company or any of its Affiliates. In connection with such cooperation requested by the Company, the Company shall reimburse Employee  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n7\n\n​\n\nfor reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred as a result of his compliance with his obligations, and, with respect to such cooperation provided by Employee during any period for which he is not receiving payments under Section 5(a), the Company shall compensate Employee at a daily rate comparable to his regular base salary rate in effect as of the Termination Date. The Company will endeavor to schedule such activities taking into account other obligations Employee may have and so as not to materially interfere with Employee’s then-current employment or other business activities.\n\n7.| **REMEDIES.** Employee agrees that if Employee fails to fulfill Employee’s obligations under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the obligations set forth in Section 3, the damages to the Company or any of its Affiliates would be very difficult or impossible to determine. Therefore, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to the Company at law, in equity or by statute, Employee hereby consents to the specific enforcement by the Company of this Agreement through an injunction or restraining order issued by an appropriate court, without the necessity of proving actual damages, and Employee hereby waives as a defense to any equitable action the allegation that the Company has an adequate remedy at law. The provisions of this Section shall not diminish the right of the Company to claim and recover damages or to obtain any equitable remedy in addition to injunctive relief to which the Company may otherwise be entitled. The Employee understands and agrees that the Employee will also be responsible for all costs and attorney’s fees incurred by the Company in enforcing any of the provisions of this Agreement including, but not limited to, expert witness fees and deposition costs.  \n---|---  \n8.| **SEVERABILITY.** If, for any reason, any Section or portion of this Agreement shall be held by a court to be invalid or unenforceable, it is agreed that such holding shall not affect any other section or portion of this Agreement. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.  \n---|---  \n9.| **ENTIRE AGREEMENT.** This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Company and the Employee concerning the subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements between the parties, including, without limitation, the Management Agreement, executed February 14, 2006 and amended December 31, 2008. No rights are granted to the Employee under this Agreement other than those specifically set forth herein.  \n---|---  \n10.| **NO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT.** This Agreement is not an employment policy or contract. It does not give the Employee the right to remain an employee of the Company, nor does it interfere with the Company’s right to discharge the Employee. It also does not  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n8\n\n​\n\nrequire the Employee to remain an employee or interfere with the Employee’s right to separate from service at any time.\n\n11.| **AMENDMENTS.** The parties agree that no modification of the Agreement may be made except by means of a written agreement signed by the parties. However, if the Company determines to its reasonable satisfaction that an alteration or amendment of this Agreement is necessary or advisable so that the Agreement complies with the Code or any other applicable tax law, then, upon written notice to Employee, the Company may unilaterally amend this Agreement in such manner and to such extent as the Company reasonably considers necessary or advisable to ensure compliance with the Code or other applicable tax law. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to limit the Company’s right to terminate this Agreement at any time and without stated cause.  \n---|---  \n12.| **ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHTS; SPENDTHRIFT CLAUSE.** None of the Employee, the Employee’s estate, or the Employee’s beneficiary shall have any right to sell, assign, transfer, pledge, attach, encumber, or otherwise convey the right to receive any payment hereunder. To the extent permitted by law, benefits payable under this Agreement shall not be subject to the claim of any creditor of the Employee, the Employee’s estate, or the Employee’s designated beneficiary or subject to any legal process by any creditor of the Employee, the Employee’s estate, or the Employee’s designated beneficiary.  \n---|---  \n13.| **BINDING EFFECT.** This Agreement shall bind the Employee, the Company, and their beneficiaries, survivors, executors, successors and assigns, administrators, and transferees.  \n---|---  \n14.| **SUCCESSORS; BINDING AGREEMENT.** By an assumption agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Employee, the Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform this Agreement had no succession occurred.  \n---|---  \n15.| **TAX WITHHOLDING**. If taxes are required by the Code or other applicable tax law to be withheld by the Company from payments under this Agreement, the Company shall withhold any taxes that are required to be withheld.  \n---|---  \n16.| **GOVERNING LAW.** This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of North Dakota.  \n---|---  \n17.| **NOTICES.** All notices, requests and demands given to or made pursuant hereto shall be in writing and shall be delivered or mailed to any such party at its address which:  \n---|---  \na.| In the case of the Company shall be:  \n---|---  \n  \nAlerus Financial Corporation\n\n401 DeMers Avenue\n\nPO Box 6001\n\nGrand Forks, North Dakota 56206-6001\n\n​\n\n9\n\n​\n\nAttention: General Counsel\n\n​\n\nb.| In the case of the Employee shall be:  \n---|---  \n  \nEither party may, by notice hereunder, designate a changed address. Any notice, if mailed properly addressed, postage prepaid, registered or certified mail, shall be deemed to have been given on the registered date or that date stamped on the certified mail receipt.\n\n​\n\n18.| **SEVERABILITY.** In the event that any portion of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, it is hereby agreed that such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the other portions of this Agreement and that the remaining covenants, terms and conditions or portions hereof shall remain in full force and effect, and any court of competent jurisdiction may so modify the objectionable provision as to make it valid, reasonable and enforceable.  \n---|---  \n19.| **COMPLIANCE WITH CODE SECTION 409A**. The Company and the Employee intend that their exercise of authority or discretion under this Agreement shall comply with section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent that any benefit under this Agreement that is nonqualified deferred compensation (within the meaning of section 409A of the Code) payable upon Employee’s termination of employment, such payment(s) shall be made only upon Employee’s “Separation from Service” pursuant to the default definition in Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-1(h).  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the day and year first above written.\n\n​\n\nDate:| 2/26/2024| /s/ Forrest Wilson  \n---|---|---  \n​| ​| ​| Employee  \n​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| ​| Accepted for Alerus Financial Corporation:  \nDate:| 2/26/2024| ​| By: /s/ Katie Lorenson  \n​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| ​| Its President and Chief Executive Officer  \n  \n​\n\n10\n\nExhibit 21.1\n\n**LIST OF SUBSIDIARIES OF ALERUS FINANCIAL CORPORATION**\n\n**Subsidiary**| **Organized Under Laws****of**  \n---|---  \nExcelsior Financial Statutory Trust I| Minnesota  \nExcelsior Financial Statutory Trust II| Minnesota  \nAlerus Financial, National Association| United States of America  \nSubsidiaries of Alerus Financial, National Association:Retirement Planning Services, Inc.Alerus LIHTC Fund, LLC| ColoradoNorth Dakota  \n  \n​\n\n**Exhibit 23.1**\n\n​\n\n![Graphic](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/08/0001558370-24-002829_alrs-20231231xex23d1001.jpg)\n\n**CliftonLarsonAllen LLP****CLAconnect.com**\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n**CONSENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM**\n\n​\n\nWe consent to the incorporation by reference of our report dated March 10, 2023, with respect to the consolidated balance sheet of Alerus Financial Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the two years ended December 31, 2022, which appears in the December 31, 2023 annual report on Form 10-K of Alerus Financial Corporation and Subsidiaries and in the Registration Statements of Alerus Financial Corporation and Subsidiaries No. 333-233824 on Form S-8, No. 333-274509 on Form S-3, and No. 333-262267 on Form S-4/A.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n/s/ CliftonLarsonAllen LLP\n\n​\n\n**CliftonLarsonAllen LLP**\n\n​\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n\nMarch 8, 2024\n\n​\n\n**Exhibit 23.2**\n\n​\n\n**Consent of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm**\n\n​\n\nWe consent to the incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement (No. 333-233824) on Form S-8 and the Registration Statement (No. 333-274509) on Form S-3 of Alerus Financial Corporation of our report dated March 8, 2024, relating to the consolidated financial statements of Alerus Financial Corporation, appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K of Alerus Financial Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n​\n\n/s/ RSM US LLP\n\n​\n\nDes Moines, Iowa\n\nMarch 8, 2024\n\n**Exhibit 31.1**\n\n**Certification of Chief Executive Officer Pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-14(a)/15d-14(a) as Adopted Pursuant to**\n\n**Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002**\n\nI, Katie A.

Based on my knowledge, this Report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this Report;\n\n3.  Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this Report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this Report;\n\n4.  The Registrant’s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:\n\na)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the Registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this Report is being prepared;\n\nb)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;\n\nc)  Evaluated the effectiveness of the Registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this Report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this Report based on such evaluation; and\n\nd)  Disclosed in this Report any change in the Registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Registrant’s fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrant’s internal control over financial reporting; and\n\n5.

This Policy is designed to comply with, and shall be interpreted consistent with, Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “**Exchange Act** ”), Rule 10D-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act (“**Rule 10D-1** ”) and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5608 (the “**Listing Standards** ”).\n\n**2.****Administration****.** Except as specifically set forth herein, this Policy shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “**Administrator** ”). The Administrator is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate or advisable for the administration of this Policy. Any determinations made by the Administrator shall be final and binding on all affected individuals and need not be uniform with respect to each individual covered by the Policy. In the administration of this Policy, the Administrator is authorized and directed to consult with the full Board or such other committees of the Board, such as the Audit Committee, as may be necessary or appropriate as to matters within the scope of such other committee’s responsibility and authority. Subject to any limitation at applicable law, the Administrator may authorize and empower any officer or employee of the Company to take any and all actions necessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose and intent of this Policy (other than with respect to any recovery under this Policy involving such officer or employee).\n\n**3.****Definitions****.** As used in this Policy, the following definitions shall apply:\n\na.“**Accounting Restatement** ” means an accounting restatement of the Company’s financial statements due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period.\n\nb.“**Applicable Period** ” means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, as well as any transition period (that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years (except that a transition period that comprises a period of at least nine months shall count as a completed fiscal year). The “date on which the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement” is the earlier to occur of (a) the date the Board concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement or (b) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement, in each case regardless of if or when the restated financial statements are filed.\n\nc.“**Covered Executives** ” means the current and former executive officers of the Company and its subsidiaries, as determined by the Administrator in accordance with the definition of executive officer set forth in Rule 10D-1 and the Listing Standards.\n\nd.“**Erroneously Awarded Compensation** ” has the meaning set forth in Section 6 of this Policy.\n\ne.A “**Financial Reporting Measure** ” is any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, and any measure that is derived wholly or in part from such measure. Financial Reporting Measures include but are not limited to the following (and any measures derived from the following): Company stock price; total shareholder\n\nExecutive Clawback Policy. Approved 8/23/2023\n\n​\n\nreturn (“**TSR** ”); revenues; net income; operating income; profitability of one or more reportable segments; financial ratios; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations; liquidity measures (e.g., working capital, operating cash flow); return measures (e.g., return on invested capital, return on assets); earnings measures (e.g., earnings per share); any of such financial reporting measures relative to a peer group, where the Company’s financial reporting measure is subject to an Accounting Restatement; and tax basis income. A Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the Company’s financial statements or included in a filing with the Securities Exchange Commission.\n\nf.“**Incentive-Based Compensation** ” means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure. Incentive-Based Compensation is “received” for purposes of this Policy in the Company’s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of such Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period.\n\ng.“**Misconduct** ” means (i) where a Covered Executive is a party to any agreement with the Company that sets forth a definition of “cause” (or a substantially similar concept), conduct by the Covered Executive which satisfies such definition of “cause,” and (ii) where a Covered Executive is not a party to any agreement with the Company that sets forth a definition of “cause” (or a substantially similar concept), a determination in the sole discretion of the Administrator that the Covered Executive has engaged in (A) fraud or misconduct that was materially injurious to the Company or its affiliates or the business or reputation of any such entity; (B) an act or acts constituting a felony which are substantially detrimental to the Company or its reputation, (C) any action or inaction detrimental to the Company or its reputation that results in regulatory enforcement action, whether or not such enforcement action is subject to direct enforcement under 12 U.S.C § 1818(i)(l), by any regulatory authorities having authority over the Company, or (D) any violation of the Covered Executive’s obligations under the Covered Executive’s employment, change in control, severance or similar agreement.\n\nh.“**Time-Based Compensation** ” means any compensation, whether equity-based or cash-based, which is provided, directly or indirectly, by the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is not granted, earned, or vested, based on the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure. Time-Based Compensation is “received” for purposes of this Policy in the Company’s fiscal period during which any vesting or other time-based service period lapses with respect to such compensation, not when settlement or payment with respect thereto occurs.\n\n**4.****Covered Executives; Incentive-Based Compensation and Time-Based Compensation****.** This Policy applies to Incentive-Based Compensation and Time-Based Compensation received by a Covered Executive (a) after beginning services as a Covered Executive; (b) if that person served as a Covered Executive at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation or the vesting period for such Time-Based Compensation; and (c) while the Company had a listed class of securities on a national securities exchange.\n\n**5.****Required Recoupment****.** In the event the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, the Company shall promptly recoup the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation received by any Covered Executive, as calculated pursuant to Section 6 hereof. In the event the Covered Executive is determined to have engaged in Misconduct, the Company shall promptly recoup the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation received by any Covered Executive, as calculated pursuant to Section 6 hereof.\n\n**6.****Erroneously Awarded Compensation: Amount Subject to Recovery****.**\n\na.The amount of “**Erroneously Awarded Compensation** ” subject to recovery under the Policy, as determined by the Administrator:\n\n​\n\nExecutive Clawback Policy. Approved 8/23/2023\n\n​\n\ni.with respect to the occurrence of any _Accounting Restatement_ , is the amount of (1) Incentive-Based Compensation received by the Covered Executive during the Applicable Period that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that would have been received by the Covered Executive had it been determined based on the restated amounts, _and_ (2) Time-Based Compensation received during the Applicable Period by the Covered Executive that exceeds the amount of Time-Based Compensation that would have been received, as determined in the reasonable discretion of the Administrator, by the Covered Executive had it been determined based on the restated amounts; and\n\nii.with respect to of the occurrence of any _Misconduct_ , is the amount of (1) any or all Incentive-Based Compensation or Time-Based Compensation received during the three (3) year period immediately preceding the occurrence of such occurrence of Misconduct, _and_ (2) any or all Incentive-Based Compensation or Time-Based Compensation awarded after such occurrence of Misconduct if, in the Administrator’s sole discretion, such compensation would not have been awarded had such Misconduct been known to the Administrator prior to any such award.\n\nb.Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall be computed by the Administrator without regard to any taxes paid by the Covered Executive in respect of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation.\n\nc.With respect to any compensation plans or programs that take into account Incentive-Based Compensation or Time-Based Compensation, the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation subject to recovery hereunder includes, but is not limited to, the amount contributed to any notional account based on Erroneously Awarded Compensation and any earnings accrued to date on that notional amount.\n\nd.For Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or TSR: (a) the Administrator shall determine the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or TSR upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was received; and (b) the Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to The Nasdaq Stock Market (“**Nasdaq** ”).\n\n**7.****Method of Recoupment****.** The Administrator shall determine, in its sole discretion, the timing and method for promptly recouping Erroneously Awarded Compensation hereunder, which may include without limitation (a) seeking reimbursement of all or part of any cash or equity-based award, (b) cancelling prior cash or equity-based awards, whether vested or unvested or paid or unpaid, (c) cancelling or offsetting against any planned future cash or equity-based awards, (d) forfeiture of deferred compensation, subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and (e) any other method authorized by applicable law or contract. Subject to compliance with any applicable law, the Administrator may affect recovery under this Policy from any amount otherwise payable to the Covered Executive, including amounts payable to such individual under any otherwise applicable Company plan or program, including base salary, bonuses or commissions and compensation previously deferred by the Covered Executive.\n\na.In connection with the occurrence of any _Accounting Restatement_ , the Company is authorized and directed pursuant to this Policy to recoup Erroneously Awarded Compensation in compliance with this Policy unless the Compensation Committee of the Board has determined that recovery would be impracticable solely for the following limited reasons, and subject to the following procedural and disclosure requirements:\n\ni.The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on expense of enforcement, the Administrator must make a reasonable attempt to recover such erroneously awarded compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover and provide that documentation to Nasdaq;\n\n​\n\nExecutive Clawback Policy. Approved 8/23/2023\n\n​\n\nii.Recovery would violate home country law of the issuer where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law of the issuer, the Administrator must satisfy the applicable opinion and disclosure requirements of Rule 10D-1 and the Listing Standards; or\n\niii.Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.\n\nb.In connection with the occurrence of any _Misconduct_ , the Company is authorized and directed pursuant to this Policy to recoup Erroneously Awarded Compensation in compliance with this Policy unless the Compensation Committee of the Board has determined, in its sole discretion, that recovery would be impracticable.\n\nc.If any Covered Executive fails or refuses to repay any Incentive Compensation and/or Time-Based Compensation that is subject to recovery by the Company pursuant to this Policy, the Covered Executive shall be solely liable for any and all of the Company’s costs and expenses (including, but not limited to legal fees) incurred in pursuing and obtaining such repayment.\n\n**8.****No Indemnification of Covered Executives****.** Notwithstanding the terms of any indemnification or insurance policy or any contractual arrangement with any Covered Executive that may be interpreted to the contrary, the Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executives against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, including any payment or reimbursement for the cost of third-party insurance purchased by any Covered Executives to fund potential clawback obligations under this Policy.\n\n**9.****Indemnification of Administrator****.** Any members of the Administrator, and any other members of the Board who assist in the administration of this Policy, shall not be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation made with respect to this Policy and shall be fully indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent under applicable law and Company policy with respect to any such action, determination or interpretation. The foregoing sentence shall not limit any other rights to indemnification of the members of the Board under applicable law or Company policy.\n\n**10.****Effective Date; Retroactive Application****.** This Policy shall be effective as of October 2, 2023 (the “**Effective Date** ”). The terms of this Policy shall apply to any Incentive-Based Compensation or Time-Based Compensation that is received by Covered Executives on or after the Effective Date, even if such Incentive-Based Compensation or Time-Based Compensation was approved, awarded, granted or paid to Covered Executives prior to the Effective Date. Without limiting the generality of Section 6 hereof, and subject to applicable law, the Administrator may affect recovery under this Policy from any amount of compensation approved, awarded, granted, payable or paid to the Covered Executive prior to, on or after the Effective Date.\n\n**11.****Amendment; Termination; Filing Requirement****.** The Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to reflect final regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 10D of the Exchange Act and to comply with any rules or standards adopted by a national securities exchange on which the Company’s securities are listed. The Board may terminate this Policy at any time. A copy of this Policy and any amendments thereto shall be posted on the Company’s website and filed as an exhibit to the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K.\n\n**12.****Other Recoupment Rights****.** The Board intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The Board may require that any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement entered into on or after the Effective Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require a Covered Executive to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the\n\n​\n\nExecutive Clawback Policy. Approved 8/23/2023\n\n​\n\nCompany pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company.\n\n**13.****Successors****.** This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.\n\n* * *\n\n​\n\nExecutive Clawback Policy. Approved 8/23/2023\n\n​\n\n**CLAWBACK POLICY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND CONSENT**\n\nI, the undersigned, agree and acknowledge that I am fully bound by, and subject to, all of the terms and conditions of the Clawback Policy of Alerus Financial Corporation (as may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “**Policy** ”) and its application to any of my prior and future compensation as may be covered by such Policy. In the event of any inconsistency between the Policy and the terms of any employment agreement (or similar agreement) to which I am a party, or the terms of any compensation plan, program or agreement under which any compensation has been granted, awarded, earned or paid, the terms of the Policy shall govern. In the event it is determined by the Administrator that any amounts granted, awarded, earned or paid, to me (whether or not deferred) must be forfeited or reimbursed to the Company, I will promptly take any action necessary to effectuate such forfeiture and/or reimbursement. I further agree and acknowledge that I am not entitled to indemnification or right of advancement of expense in connection with any enforcement of the Policy. Any capitalized terms used in this Acknowledgment without definition shall have the meaning set forth in the Policy.\n\nAcknowledged and agreed as of:.| ​  \n---|---  \n​| ​  \nBy:   \n​| ​  \nName:| ​  \n​| ​  \nTitle:| ​  \n  \n​\n\nExecutive Clawback Policy.
