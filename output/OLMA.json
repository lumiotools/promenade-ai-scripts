(“Olema” or “Olema Oncology”, Nasdaq: OLMA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of targeted therapies for breast cancer and beyond, today announced a new clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Novartis in frontline metastatic breast cancer. Olema has also entered into a securities purchase agreement for the private placement of approximately $250.0 million of common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock with new and existing institutional and accredited investors (the “Private Placement”).\n\n\"We are now fully enabled to initiate our planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, OPERA-02, for palazestrant in combination with ribociclib in frontline ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. Our new agreement with Novartis, which includes sufficient ribociclib drug supply for the planned approximately 1,000 patient trial, is a major milestone. When combined with our Private Placement of $250.0 million of common stock and pre-funded warrants with high-quality, long-term investors, Olema now expects to have the necessary resources to execute OPERA-02, the Phase 1/2 study of OP-3136, and the ongoing Phase 3 OPERA-01 monotherapy trial,” said Sean P. Bohen, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Olema Oncology. “We remain on track to share topline data from OPERA-01 in 2026 and we are excited to present our latest data from the ongoing Phase 1b/2 study of palazestrant in combination with ribociclib at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) next week.”\n\n**_New Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement Enables Phase 3 OPERA-02 Trial_** Under the terms of the agreement, Novartis will provide Olema with ribociclib drug supply for the planned, Olema-sponsored, Phase 3 OPERA-02 trial of palazestrant in combination with ribociclib in ER+/HER2- frontline advanced or metastatic breast cancer. All clinical data and inventions from the trial will be jointly owned while Olema maintains global commercial and marketing rights to palazestrant.\n\n**_Private Placement Funds Expanded Clinical Development Activities_** The Private Placement is expected to close on or about December 4, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The financing included participation by new and existing investors Adage Capital Partners LP, Bain Capital Life Sciences, BVF Partners L.P., Driehaus Capital Management, Janus Henderson Investors, Paradigm BioCapital Advisors, Wellington Management, Woodline Partners LP, and a large investment manager. Pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement, Olema will issue 19,928,875 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $9.08 per share and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,604,163 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $9.0799 per pre-funded warrant, for gross proceeds of approximately $250.0 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. The pre-funded warrants will have an exercise price of $0.0001 per share of common stock, be immediately exercisable and remain exercisable until exercised in full. The Private Placement is being conducted in accordance with applicable Nasdaq rules and was priced using the average Nasdaq official closing price of Olema’s common stock for the five trading days ended November 27, 2024.\n\nJefferies is acting as lead placement agent with J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Citigroup, LifeSci Capital, Oppenheimer & Co., and H.C. Wainwright & Co. acting as placement agents in the Private Placement.\n\nOlema intends to use the net proceeds from the Private Placement, together with its current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, to fund the OPERA-02 trial, the Phase 1/2 study of OP-3136, and its ongoing Phase 3 OPERA-01 monotherapy trial of palazestrant, and for working capital and general corporate purposes.\n\nThe securities described above have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any state’s securities laws, and are being issued and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration provided for under the Securities Act. Accordingly, these securities may not be offered or sold in the United States, except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Olema has agreed to file a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) registering the resale of the shares of common stock issued and sold in the Private Placement. Any offering of the securities under the resale registration statement will only be made by means of a prospectus.\n\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\n\n**About Palazestrant (OP-1250)** Palazestrant (OP-1250) is a novel, orally available small molecule with dual activity as both a complete estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist (CERAN) and selective ER degrader (SERD). It is currently being investigated in patients with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic ER-positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer. In preclinical studies, palazestrant completely blocks ER-driven transcriptional activity in both _ESR1_ wild-type and mutant forms of breast cancer. In Olema’s ongoing clinical trials for advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer, palazestrant has demonstrated anti-tumor activity along with attractive pharmacokinetics and exposure, favorable tolerability, and combinability with CDK4/6 inhibitors. Palazestrant has been granted U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Fast Track designation for the treatment of ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer that has progressed following one or more lines of endocrine therapy with at least one line given in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. It is being evaluated both as a single agent in an ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial, OPERA-01, and in Phase 1/2 combination studies with CDK4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib and ribociclib), a PI3Ka inhibitor (alpelisib), and an mTOR inhibitor (everolimus).\n\n**About Olema Oncology** Olema Oncology is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to transforming the standard of care and improving outcomes for women living with cancer. Olema is advancing a pipeline of novel therapies by leveraging our deep understanding of endocrine-driven cancers, nuclear receptors, and mechanisms of acquired resistance. Olema’s lead product candidate, palazestrant (OP-1250), is a proprietary, orally available complete estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist (CERAN) and a selective ER degrader (SERD), currently in a Phase 3 clinical trial called OPERA-01. In addition, Olema is developing a potent KAT6 inhibitor (OP-3136). Olema is headquartered in San Francisco and has operations in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** _Statements contained in this press release regarding matters that are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

(“Olema”, “Olema Oncology”, Nasdaq: OLMA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of targeted therapies for breast cancer and beyond, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a corporate update.\n\n“We look forward to presenting updated data from our ongoing Phase 2 clinical study of palazestrant in combination with ribociclib in metastatic breast cancer patients at SABCS in December. The OPERA-01 Phase 3 clinical trial of palazestrant as a monotherapy in second/third-line patients continues to advance and we remain on track for top-line readout in 2026,” said Sean P. Bohen, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Olema Oncology. “At ENA 2024, we presented three new, robust preclinical data sets. Palazestrant demonstrated combinability and enhanced tumor suppression with both everolimus and capivasertib. OP-3136, our potent and selective KAT6 inhibitor, demonstrated robust anti-tumor activity as a single agent, as well as synergy and enhanced anti-tumor activity in combination with palazestrant. These data reinforce our belief in the potential of OP-3136 as an exciting new therapy for breast and other cancers, and we remain on track to submit the IND application before year end.”\n\n**Recent Progress**\n\n  * Continued enrollment of patients in OPERA-01, the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of palazestrant as a monotherapy in second/third-line ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer.\n  * Presented preclinical data for OP-3136 and palazestrant at the 36th EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics (ENA 2024) in Barcelona, Spain.\n  * Initiated Phase 1b/2 clinical study of palazestrant in combination with everolimus.\n  * Successfully completed Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies for OP-3136.\n\n\n\n**Anticipated Upcoming Milestones**\n\n  * Present updated Phase 2 data showing palazestrant in combination with ribociclib at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) in December 2024.\n  * Submit the IND application for OP-3136 to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before year-end; initiate the Phase 1 clinical study for OP-3136 in early 2025.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results** Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, were $214.8 million.\n\nNet loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $34.6 million, as compared to $21.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loss for the third quarter was primarily related to increased spending on clinical development and research activities as a result of late-stage clinical trials for palazestrant and the advancement of our KAT6 inhibitor program, as well as general and administrative (G&A) activities. The increase was partially offset by higher interest income earned from marketable securities.\n\nGAAP research and development (R&D) expenses were $33.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $19.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily related to increased spending on clinical operations and development-related activities as we continue to advance palazestrant through late-stage clinical trials, research-related activities associated with the advancement of our KAT6 inhibitor program, and personnel related costs, including an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $1.5 million.\n\nNon-GAAP R&D expenses were $28.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which excluded $4.3 million non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $16.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, excluding $2.8 million non-cash stock-based compensation expense. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release can be found at the end of this press release.\n\nGAAP G&A expenses were $4.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $3.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in G&A expenses was primarily due to increased spending on corporate-related costs and an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense of less than $0.1 million.\n\nNon-GAAP G&A expenses were $3.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, excluding $1.3 million non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP G&A expenses were $2.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, excluding $1.3 million non-cash stock-based compensation expense.

As used in this release, non-GAAP R&D expense is defined by Olema as GAAP R&D expense excluding stock-based compensation expense, and non-GAAP G&A expense is defined by Olema as GAAP G&A expense excluding stock-based compensation expense. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\n\n**Forward Looking Statements** Statements contained in this press release regarding matters that are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “expect,” “goal,” “may,” “potential,” “upcoming,” “will” and similar expressions (as well as other words or expressions referencing future events, conditions or circumstances) are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements include those related to the timelines for initiation and enrollment for potential clinical studies and for results of clinical trials of palazestrant (OP-1250) and OP-3136, each as a monotherapy and in combination trials, Olema’s financial condition and resources, results of operations, cash position, potential beneficial characteristics including but not limited to safety, tolerability, activity, efficacy and therapeutic effects of palazestrant, the potential of palazestrant to advance the standard of care for women living with cancer, combinability with other drugs, palazestrant, or OP-3136, and the sufficiency and timing of Olema’s preclinical program, including the potential beneficial characteristics of its KAT6 inhibitor compounds and the timing of a potential IND application and advancement into clinical development for OP-3136. Because such statements deal with future events and are based on Olema’s current expectations, they are subject to various risks and uncertainties, and actual results, performance or achievements of Olema could differ materially from those described in or implied by the statements in this press release. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” in Olema’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and future filings and reports that Olema makes from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as required by law, Olema assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, including in the event that actual results differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.\n\n**Olema Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**  \n---  \n**Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets Data**  \n _(in thousands)_  \n**September 30,**| **December 31,**  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities| $| 214,763| $| 261,807  \n**Total assets**| **230,173**| **276,945**  \nTotal current liabilities| 30,700| 21,621  \nTotal liabilities| 31,262| 23,050  \nTotal stockholders’ equity| 198,911| 253,895  \n**Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity**| **$**| **230,173**| **$**| **276,945**  \n  \n**Olema Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**  \n---  \n**Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations**  \n**(In thousands, except share and per share data)**  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended June 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nOperating expenses:  \nResearch and development (1)| $| 33,226| $| 19,453| $| 92,218| $| 60,268  \nGeneral and administrative (2)| 4,395| 3,889| 13,272| 14,277  \n**Total operating expenses**| **37,621**| **23,342**| **105,490**| **74,545**  \nLoss from operations| (37,621| )| (23,342| )| (105,490| )| (74,545| )  \nOther income:  \nInterest income| 2,928| 1,919| 9,388| 4,774  \nOther income (expense)| 138| (79| )| 195| (112| )  \nTotal other income| 3,066| 1,840| 9,583| 4,662  \n**Net loss**| **$**| **(34,555**| **)**| **$**| **(21,502**| **)**| **$**| **(95,907**| **)**| **$**| **(69,883**| **)**  \nNet loss per share, basic and diluted| $| (0.60| )| $| (0.48| )| $| (1.80| )| $| (1.66| )  \nWeighted average shares used to compute net loss per share, basic and diluted| 57,262,803| 44,977,161| 53,194,081| 41,999,978  \n**Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Information**  \n _(In thousands)_  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended June 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**(1) Research and development reconciliation**  \nGAAP research and development (3)| $| 33,226| $| 19,453| $| 92,218| $| 60,268  \nLess: share-based compensation expense| 4,280| 2,801| 11,925| 8,858  \n**Non-GAAP research and development**| **$**| **28,946**| **$**| **16,652**| **$**| **80,293**| **$**| **51,410**  \n**(2) General and administrative reconciliation**  \nGAAP general and administrative| $| 4,395| $| 3,889| $| 13,272| $| 14,277  \nLess: share-based compensation expense| 1,346| 1,304| 4,334| 4,047  \n**Non-GAAP general and administrative**| **$**| **3,049**| **$**| **2,585**| **$**| **8,938**| **$**| **10,230**  \n(3) Research and development expenses for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 include a $5.0 million milestone payment in connection to the Aurigene Agreement.  \n  \n**IR and Media Contact** Courtney O’Konek, Vice President, Corporate Communications[media@olema.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=h443kxKIB4uMPm04HOo0mynmyajHsa3MZWvYfo0H-hLUs-HapPEv-TLquYKEeP8tVjlM4W8IezMAjCGX9E0C5Q==)\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/OTlmZWMxMjktMDA0Zi00ZjQxLTljNmUtNjU2Y2IyOTAwYjQzLTEyMTUwNjg=/tiny/Olema-Pharmaceuticals-Inc-.png)\n\nRequest Email Alerts\n\nBy clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts. \n\n  * Strictly Necessary Cookies\n\n#### Strictly Necessary Cookies\n\n  * Performance Cookies\n\n#### Performance Cookies\n\n  * Targeting Cookies\n\n#### Targeting Cookies\n\n\nCookies Settings\n\nSave Choices\n\nReject AllAccept All Cookies\n\n[![Powered by Onetrust](https://cdn.cookielaw.org/logos/static/powered_by_logo.svg)](https://www.onetrust.com/products/cookie-consent/)\n\n![Company Logo](https://cdn.cookielaw.org/logos/static/ot_company_logo.png)\n\n## Privacy Preference Center\n\nWhen you visit any website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies.
