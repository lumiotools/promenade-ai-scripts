The Board reviews the\nGroup’s internal reports in order to assess performance and allocate resources. The Board has\ndetermined the operating segments based on these reports.\nThe Group is principally engaged in manufacturing and trading of hospitality supplies products\n(“Hospitality Supplies Business”), trading of operating supplies and equipment (“OS&E\nBusiness”), and manufacturing and trading of health care and hygienic products (“Health Care\nand Hygienic Products Business”). From a geographical perspective, the Board assesses the\nperformance based on the Group’s revenue by geographical location in which the customer is\nlocated. There are three reporting segments: (i) Hospitality Supplies Business; (ii) OS&E\nBusiness; and (iii) Health Care and Hygienic Products Business.\nThe Board assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of segment\nprofit before income tax, share of profit of an associated company and share of profit/(loss) of\njoint ventures.\nInformation provided to the Board is measured in a manner consistent with that of the\ncondensed consolidated interim financial information.\nSales between segments are carried out at normal commercial terms. Depreciation and\namortisation charges are apportioned with reference to respective segment revenue from\nexternal customers. Assets and liabilities of the Group are allocated by reference to the principal\nmarkets in which the Group operates.\n8\n9\nlacihpargoeG\nsrehtO\nssenisuB\nstcudorP\ncineigyH\ndna\neraC\nhtlaeH\nssenisuB\nE&SO\nssenisuB\nseilppuS\nytilatipsoH\nehT
