Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nNov 07, 2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/9001/pdf)\n\nALISO VIEJO, Calif., Nov. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **(NASDAQ: RXST)** -- RxSight, Inc., an ophthalmic medical device company dedicated to providing high-quality customized vision to patients following cataract surgery, today reported financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Key Quarterly Highlights**\n\n  * Reported third quarter 2024 revenue of $35.3 million, an increase of 59% compared to the third quarter of 2023, reflecting: \n    * The sale of 24,554 Light Adjustable Lenses (LAL™/LAL+™), representing an 80% increase in procedure volume compared to the third quarter of 2023; and\n    * The sale of 78 Light Delivery Devices (LDD™s), representing a 18% increase in unit sales compared to the third quarter of 2023 and expanding the installed base to 888 LDDs at the end of the quarter, representing a 51% increase compared to the end of the third quarter of 2023.\n  * The company raised its 2024 full-year revenue guidance to the top of its previous guidance range, increased its gross margin guidance and lowered its operating expense guidance.\n\n\n\n“We are pleased to report another strong quarter driven by ongoing demand and enthusiasm for the RxSight system,” said Dr. Ron Kurtz, Chief Executive Officer and President. “With 78 LDDs sold this quarter and sustained growth in LAL sales, we continue to see recognition of the transformative power of adjustability and the significant value it provides to both patients and doctors. We believe our third-quarter results position us for a strong finish to 2024 and for continued success in the years to come.”\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Results**\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, total revenue was $35.3 million, an increase of 59% compared to $22.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. Revenue growth was driven by a 79% increase in LAL revenue and a 28% increase in LDD revenue, compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nGross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was $25.2 million or 71.4% of revenue, an increase of $11.5 million or 84% compared to gross profit of $13.7 million or 61.9% of revenue for the third quarter of 2023. The year over year increase in gross profit was driven by continued growth in the percentage of LAL sales as a proportion of total sales, lower cost of sales for both the LDD and LAL, and sustained pricing stability for company’s capital equipment.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $34.4 million, a 31% increase from $26.2 million in the third quarter of 2023, on an increase in revenue of 59%, reflecting the company’s ongoing investments to grow its LDD installed base and support increased LAL sales volume while managing its operating expenses.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the company reported a net loss of $(6.3) million, or $(0.16) per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $(12.4) million, or $(0.35) per basic and diluted share in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted net earnings in the third quarter of 2024 were $214 thousand, or $0.00 per diluted share, compared to an adjusted net loss of $(6.9) million, or $(0.19) per basic and diluted share in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024, were $237.1 million compared to $233.3 million on June 30, 2024.\n\n**2024 Guidance**\n\nThe company revised its 2024 full-year revenue, gross margin and operating expense guidance as follows:\n\n  * Revenue at the top of previously provided guidance range of $139.0 million to $140.0 million, representing implied growth of approximately 57% compared to 2023;\n  * Gross margin in the range of 70% to 71%, up from previous guidance range of 68% to 70%; and\n  * Operating expenses at the low end of its previously provided guidance range of $135.0 to $136.0 million, including non-cash stock-based compensation expense, now also expected at the lower end of the previous guidance range of $29.0 to $30.0 million.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nOn Thursday, November 7, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, the company will host a conference call to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results. To participate in the conference call, please dial (888) 596-4144 or (646) 968-2525 and enter the conference code: 7406253.

For example, we exclude stock-based compensation expense and loss on extinguishment of debt because these expenses are non-cash in nature and we believe excluding these items provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and allows investors the ability to make more meaningful comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies.\n\nWe believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\n\n**Adjusted Net Earnings (Loss) and Adjusted Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share**\n\nAdjusted net earnings (loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net earnings (loss) adjusted for (i) stock-based compensation and (ii) loss on extinguishment of term loan. We believe adjusted net earnings (loss) provides investors with useful information on period-to-period performance as evaluated by management and comparison with our past financial performance and is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry, as this metric generally eliminates the effects of certain items that may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\n\nReconciliations of net earnings (loss) to adjusted net earnings (loss) and the presentation of adjusted net earnings (loss) per share, basic and diluted, are as follows:\n\n**RxSIGHT, INC.** **GAAP To NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS (UNAUDITED)** (In thousands, except share and per share amounts)  \n---  \n**Three months ended September 30,**| **For the nine months ended September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Common Stock**  \nNumerator:  \nNet loss available to stockholders, basic and diluted| $| (6,338| )| $| (12,415| )| $| (21,517| )| $| (39,431| )  \nAdd:  \nStock-based compensation| 6,552| 4,071| 17,353| 11,321  \nLoss on extinguishment of term loan| —| 1,407| —| 1,769  \nAdjusted net income (loss) available to common stockholders, basic and diluted:| $| 214| $| (6,937| )| $| (4,164| )| $| (26,341| )  \nDenominator:  \nWeighted-average shares outstanding, basic| 39,788,621| 35,662,397| 38,367,759| 33,947,331  \nWeighted-average shares outstanding, diluted| 45,748,177| 35,662,397| 38,367,759| 33,947,331  \nAdjusted net earnings (loss) per share, basic| $| 0.01| $| (0.19| )| $| (0.11| )| $| (0.78| )  \nAdjusted net earnings (loss) per share, diluted| $| 0.00| $| (0.19| )| $| (0.11| )| $| (0.78| )  \n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/MTQwOWRkOWQtOGE0Mi00YTk5LTgzODAtOWViZTJlMjUzYmUyLTEyMjE2OTg=/tiny/RxSight-Inc-.png)\n"
