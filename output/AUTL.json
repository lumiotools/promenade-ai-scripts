Anyforward-looking statements are based on management’s current views and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties\nthatcould cause actual results,performance, or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements.Actual results and the timing of events could differ\nmaterially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of various risks and uncertainties, which include, without limitation: Autolus' ability to maintain\nregulatory approval of AUCATZYL; its ability to execute its commercialization strategy for AUCATZYL; its ability to develop, manufacture and commercialize its other product candidates\nand the timing or likelihood of expansion of AUCATZYL into additional markets or geographies; Autolus' ability to establish and expand a commercial infrastructure and to successfully\nlaunch, market and sell AUCATZYL; actions of regulatory agencies, which may affect the initiation, timing and progress of clinical trials or future regulatory approval; the labelling for\nAUCATZYL/obe-cel in any future indication or patient population; the potential for payors to delay, limit or deny coverage for AUCATZYL; Autolus' ability to obtain, maintain and enforce\nintellectual property protection for AUCATZYL or any product candidates it is developing; the results of clinical trials are notalways being predictive of future results; the cost, timing and\nresults of clinical trials; that many product candidates do not become approved drugs on atimely or cost effective basis or at all; the ability to enroll patients in clinical trials;andpossible\nsafety and efficacy concerns.

ICANS, including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients\nreceiving AUCATZYL. T-cell malignancies have occurred following treatment of hematologic malignancies\nwith BCMA- and CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapies.\n• In the FELIX trial, severe, including life-threatening and fatal infections occurred in patients after AUCATZYL\ninfusion. The non-COVID-19 infections of all grades occurred in 67% (67/100) of patients. Grade 3 or\nhigher non-COVID-19 infections occurred in 41% (41/100) of patients.\n• Please see full Prescribing Information, including BOXED WARNING and Medication Guide.\n4\nAutolus is positioned for commercial execution and market expansion\nLeading the CAR T space with differentiated technology supported by in-house manufacturing capabilities\n$\nAUCATZYL®: a potentially Pipeline expansion Scalable manufacturing Strategic Strong cash\nbest-in-class CAR T strategy andin-house facility collaborations position\n• AUCATZYL® approved for • Expand obe-cel • Demonstrated reliable • Strategic multi-platform • Cash and cash equivalents\nthe treatment of r/r adult opportunity in B cell clinical trial supply R&D collaboration with $657M end of Q3 2024\nALL malignancies, (96% target dose reached BioNTech\nautoimmune diseases & in FELIX pivotal study) • Fully funds obe-cel\n• First CAR T approved life cycle strategy • Established technology launch in adult ALL and\nwithout a Risk Evaluation – SLE • New commercial cell collaborations with allows for autoimmune\nMitigation Strategy – B-NHL indications manufacturing facility Moderna, BMS and program acceleration\n(REMS) program – Bi-specific therapies approved by FDA and Cabaletta\n(CD19 /CD22; CD19/BCMA) MHRA; planned annual\n• MAAs under review with capacity 2,000+ batches • Long-standing academic\nEMA and MHRA • Expand to additional collaboration with\nindications with novel University College London\nCAR T therapies, alone\nor with partners\nAbbreviations and notes: r/r ALL – relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia; B-NHL – B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma; SLE – systemic lupus erythematosus 5\nAUTOLUS’ FIRST APPROVED PRODUCT\nAUCATZYL®\nA standalone, potentially best-in-class\nCD19 CAR T cell product\nWe believe AUCATZYL® has a unique mechanism of action\nClinical data demonstrate increased activity and reduced toxicity\nDifferentiated CD19 binder Fast off-rate\nShorter half-life of interaction\ncompared to binders used in\n]\n1\nCD19 binder\nMS [1 -- ] 1-S\n1-\n[M\nOther CD19 Binders Obe-cel Binder approved products\nKa K :a\nwith fast off-rate\n:ee\nt a RR t -a • obe-cel = 9.8 seconds\n-On\nn\nO • Kymriah® = 21 minutes\nOffO fRf Raattee: K:d [KS-1 d] [S-1]\nPotential for improved potency, reduced toxicity Enhanced cytotoxicity and proliferation\n• Avoided over-activation\n→ Reduced toxicities\nof CAR T cells g\nn n\nilliK o\nit\n• Increased CAR T peak lle\na\nr\ne\n→ Improved persistence C f\nexpansion r o\nilo\nm r P\nu\nT\n• Avoided exhaustion Improved engraftment %\n→\nof CAR T-cells Improved persistence\nGhorashian et al.
