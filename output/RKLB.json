The launch was the company's second in less than 24 hours. Image credit: Rocket Lab and Rory Gannaway\n\nThe “Ice AIS Baby” mission lifted-off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand at 4:55 pm on 25 November NZDT (03:55 UTC), successfully deploying five satellites to a 643 km low Earth orbit. The mission was Rocket Lab’s 14 th mission of 2024 and 56 th launch overall. It also brought the total count of satellites deployed by Rocket Lab to 203, further cementing Electron’s position as the leading small launch vehicle globally. The launch took place just 21 hours and 55 minutes after Rocket Lab completed a successful mission from Launch Complex 2 in Virginia, setting a new company record for fastest turnaround between launches. \n\nRocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck said: “Two successful launches less than 24 hours apart from pads in different hemispheres. That’s unprecedented capability in the small launch market and one we’re immensely proud to deliver at Rocket Lab. Customers like Kinéis are unlocking the potential of space and we’re excited to give them the keys to do so with frequent, dedicated, and reliable small launch opportunities.” \n\nKinéis CEO Alexandre Tisserant, says: “The Kinéis teams have once again demonstrated their technical capabilities as satellite operators by taking control of these five new satellites at a sustained launch rate. This achievement would not have been possible without Rocket Lab’s Electron precision in placing our satellites in their planned positions. With 15 Kinéis satellites now in orbit, we’re one step closer to the full deployment of our dedicated IoT constellation for transmitting data in near-real time, anywhere on the globe. Congratulations to all our teams, who are doing an incredible job - and, let’s not forget, a European first! We’re equally enthusiastic about our second mission, AIS. In a rapidly consolidating market, Kinéis is establishing itself as a sovereign European player, combining technological expertise and strategic independence. With our new AIS offering, we provide maritime players with enhanced visibility over their fleets, while ensuring higher data reliability.” \n\nThe “Ice AIS Baby” mission was the third of five dedicated Electron launches for Kinéis, a company backed by private and public investors including the French government’s space agency CNES (Centre National d'Études Spatiales) and CLS (Collecte Localisation Satellites), an international space-based solutions provider, to improve global IoT connectivity. The Kinéis constellation is designed to make it possible to connect and locate any connected object anywhere in the world, enabling data transmission to users in near-real time, at low bit rates and with very low energy consumption. By enabling internet connection to the Earth’s most remote locations, Kinéis constellation can support forest fire detection, water resource management, infrastructure and energy network monitoring, transport and logistics tracking, and much more. \n\n**Launch images:** [https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjBSWqi](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fflic.kr%2Fs%2FaHBqjBSWqi&esheet=54157493&newsitemid=20241124966388&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fflic.kr%2Fs%2FaHBqjBSWqi&index=1&md5=ca88498e3dc757e3e2c20ffca04bf671)\n\n**Launch webcast:** [www.youtube.com/live/i081vyh3WO0?si=qfXyY5ejvJZwscP0](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Flive%2Fi081vyh3WO0%3Fsi%3DqfXyY5ejvJZwscP0&esheet=54157493&newsitemid=20241124966388&lan=en-US&anchor=www.youtube.com%2Flive%2Fi081vyh3WO0%3Fsi%3DqfXyY5ejvJZwscP0&index=2&md5=d593a819e25dbb15833f0bd61bfe76f2)\n\n**+ About Rocket Lab** Founded in 2006, Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company with an established track record of mission success.

The first two missions were successfully launched by Electron in June and September 2024. \n\nRocket Lab founder and CEO, Peter Beck, says: “We’ve already successfully launched two missions for Kinéis and looking forward to making it three later this month. Electron has put control in the hands of small satellite constellation operators like Kinéis, giving them the ability to control launch schedule and orbits to deploy and manage their satellites precisely the way they want to. This is what dedicated launch is all about and we’re proud to operate the only small rocket delivering this consistently and reliably.” \n\nKinéis CEO, Alexandre Tisserant, says: “Kinéis continues to deploy its 25-satellite constellation on schedule. Efforts are being maintained by the technical teams who are operating our first 10 nanosatellites in flight and will be managing the positioning of the 5 new ones. This delicate operation is supported by the precision injection of our satellites into their positions by Rocket Lab's Electron launcher. In addition to IoT, we're delighted to announce the launch of a new service, satellite AIS, dedicated to the global maritime domain, a highly reliable sovereign offer, available in 2025. Ready for launch!” \n\nThe mission is one of several Electron launches scheduled for lift-off before the end of the year, with 12 Electron launches already completed successfully in 2024, making this Rocket Lab’s busiest launch year to date. \n\n**About Rocket Lab:**\n\nFounded in 2006, Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company with an established track record of mission success. We deliver reliable launch services, satellite manufacture, spacecraft components, and on-orbit management solutions that make it faster, easier, and more affordable to access space. Headquartered in Long Beach, California, Rocket Lab designs and manufactures the Electron small orbital launch vehicle, a family of flight proven spacecraft, and the Company is developing the large Neutron launch vehicle for constellation deployment. Since its first orbital launch in January 2018, Rocket Lab’s Electron launch vehicle has become the second most frequently launched U.S. rocket annually and has delivered 190+ satellites to orbit for private and public sector organizations, enabling operations in national security, scientific research, space debris mitigation, Earth observation, climate monitoring, and communications. Rocket Lab’s family of spacecraft have been selected to support NASA missions to the Moon and Mars, as well as the first private commercial mission to Venus. Rocket Lab has three launch pads at two launch sites, including two launch pads at a private orbital launch site located in New Zealand and a third launch pad in Virginia. \n\n**About Kinéis:**\n\nCreated in 2018, Kinéis is a satellite operator and global connectivity provider. It inherited 40 years of expertise in the Argos system, founded by CNES (French space agency) and historically operated by CLS (Collecte Localisation Satellites). Its mission is to develop reliable technology that provides easy access to useful satellite data. To make life easier for professionals and individuals and encourage them to use its products and services, Kinéis locates and connects objects wherever they are on the planet. Thanks to its technological innovation capabilities, Kinéis forges links between New Space and IoT and connects hundreds of customers with satellite IoT. In Q2 2021, Kinéis won two projects funded by the European program Eurostars: Forestens (forest fire prevention) and Catset (a decision support toolset eartag for extensive cattle farming). \n\nThanks to its constellation of 25 nanosatellites, Kinéis can connect any object from anywhere in the world and transmit useful data from these objects to users in near real time. This data is a decision-making tool that can be used to optimize activities while reducing risks, thanks to three essential functions: tracking, monitoring and alerting. \n\nKinéis' space connectivity applications are used in a number of fields that represent major challenges for mankind, its activities and its environment today: natural risk prevention (detection of forest fires, floods, pollution, etc.), monitoring of infrastructures and energy networks (detection of anomalies, predictive maintenance, etc.), transport and logistics monitoring, agriculture, traceability of wild and farmed animals, and monitoring of commercial and leisure maritime activities. \n\nThe Kinéis constellation also integrates the AIS (Automatic Identification System), a maritime automatic identification system for ships operating on VHF (Very High Frequency) radio frequencies, which enables ships and surveillance systems to know the identity, position, direction and status of ships at sea. \n\nKinéis' satellite-based AIS (S-AIS) is a high-performance system (requiring no ground infrastructure) that complements terrestrial AIS, enabling ships to be monitored worldwide, even in international waters not accessible by terrestrial AIS. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements contained in this press release other than statements of historical fact, including, without limitation, statements regarding our launch and space systems operations, launch schedule and window, safe and repeatable access to space, Neutron development, operational expansion and business strategy are forward-looking statements. The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “potential,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “strategy,” “future,” “could,” “would,” “project,” “plan,” “target,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, though not all forward-looking statements use these words or expressions. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including but not limited to the factors, risks and uncertainties included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, as such factors may be updated from time to time in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), accessible on the SEC’s website at [www.sec.gov](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=54151566&newsitemid=20241112096940&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sec.gov&index=1&md5=45da13dade1b53b54abd97d806b19fae) and the Investor Relations section of our website at [www.rocketlabusa.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rocketlabusa.com&esheet=54151566&newsitemid=20241112096940&lan=en-US&anchor=www.rocketlabusa.com&index=2&md5=5360175d02479d82b0dc7d014caf6fc6), which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements made in this press release.

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, contained in this presentation, including statements regarding our expectations of financial results for the fourth quarter of\n2024, strategy, future operations, future financial position, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management, are forward-looking statements. Words such as, but not limited to, “anticipate,” “aim,” “believe,”\n“contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “design,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “suggest,” “strategy,” “target,” “will,” “would,” and similar expressions or\nphrases, or the negative of those expressions or phrases, are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These forward-looking statements are\nbased on Rocket Lab’s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (many of which are beyond Rocket\nLab’s control), or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Many factors could cause actual future events to\ndiffer materially from the forward-looking statements in this release, including risks related to delays and disruptions in expansion efforts; delays in the development of our Neutron rocket; our dependence on a limited number of\ncustomers; the harsh and unpredictable environment of space in which our products operate which could adversely affect our launch vehicle and spacecraft; increased competition in our industry due in part to rapid\ntechnological development; technological change in our industry which we may not be able to keep up with or which may render our services uncompetitive; average selling price trends; general economic uncertainty and\nturbulence which could impact our customers’ ability to pay what we are owed; failure of our launch vehicles, spacecraft and components to operate as intended either due to our error in design, in production or through no fault\nof our own; launch schedule disruptions; supply chain disruptions, product delays or failures; design and engineering flaws; launch failures; natural disasters and epidemics or pandemics; any inability to effectively integrate\nrecently acquired assets;a US government shutdown or delays in government funding; changes in governmental regulations including with respect to trade and export restrictions, or in the status of our regulatory approvals or\napplications; or other events that force us to cancel or reschedule launches, including customer contractual rescheduling and termination rights; risks that acquisitions may not be completed on the anticipated time frame or at all\nor do not achieve the anticipated benefits and results; and the other risks detailed from time to time in Rocket Lab’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including under the heading “Risk Factors” in\nRocket Lab’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024 and elsewhere. There can be no assurance that the future developments affecting Rocket\nLab will be those that we have anticipated. Except as required by law, Rocket Lab is not undertaking any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or\notherwise.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our unaudited consolidated financial statements presented on a basis consistent with GAAP, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses, research and\ndevelopment expenses, and non-GAAP net selling, general and administrative expenses. These supplemental measures exclude the effects of (i) stock-based compensation expense; (ii) amortization of purchased intangible\nassets and favorable lease; (iii) non-cash income tax benefits and expenses (iv) depreciation; (v) transaction costs; (vi) change in fair value of contingent consideration; (vii) performance reserve escrow; (viii) provision for income\ntaxes; (ix) (Gain) loss on foreign exchange; (x) accretion of marketable securities purchased at a discount; (xi) (gain) loss on disposal of assets; and (xii) employee retention credit. We also supplement our unaudited historical\nstatements and forward-looking guidance with the measure of adjusted EBITDA, where adjustments to EBITDA include share-based compensation, warrant expense related to customers and partners, foreign exchange gains or\nlosses, acquisition related performance reserve and escrow, loss on extinguishment of debt, interest expense, net and other non-recurring gains or losses. These non-GAAP measures should only be viewed in conjunction with\ncorresponding GAAP measures. We compensate for the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of our performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in\naccordance with and do not serve as an alternative for the presentation of our GAAP financial results. We are providing this information to enable investors to perform more meaningful comparisons of our operating results in a\nmanner similar to management's analysis of our business.
