In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Lucid's expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this communication. Lucid anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Lucid's assessments to change. However, while Lucid may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Lucid specifically disclaims any obligation to do so.

Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Business Metrics**\n\nCondensed consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with US GAAP (\"GAAP\") as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our condensed consolidated financial results. Lucid's non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders, Adjusted Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders, and Free Cash Flow, which are discussed below.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss attributable to common stockholders before (1) interest expense, (2) interest income, (3) provision for income taxes, (4) depreciation and amortization, (5) stock-based compensation, (6) restructuring charges, (7) change in fair value of common stock warrant liability, (8) change in fair value of equity securities of a related party, (9) change in fair value of derivative liabilities associated with redeemable convertible preferred stock (related party), and (10) accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock (related party). Lucid believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to Lucid's management and investors about Lucid's financial performance.\n\nAdjusted Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders is defined as net loss attributable to common stockholders excluding (1) stock-based compensation, (2) restructuring charges, (3) change in fair value of common stock warrant liability, (4) change in fair value of equity securities of a related party, (5) change in fair value of derivative liabilities associated with redeemable convertible preferred stock (related party), and (6) accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock (related party).\n\nLucid defines and calculates Adjusted Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders as Adjusted Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders divided by weighted-average shares outstanding attributable to common stockholders.\n\nLucid believes that Adjusted Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders and Adjusted Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders financial measures provide investors with useful information to evaluate performance of its business excluding items not reflecting ongoing operating activities.\n\nFree Cash Flow is defined as net cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures. Lucid believes that Free Cash Flow provides useful information to Lucid's management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to Lucid's historical performance. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting, and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to Lucid's investors regarding measures of our financial condition and results of operations that Lucid uses to run the business and therefore allows investors to better understand Lucid's performance. However, these non-GAAP financial and key performance measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\n\nNon-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under GAAP when understanding Lucid's operating performance. In addition, other companies, including companies in Lucid's industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of Lucid's non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures as tools for comparison. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is presented below.\n\n**LUCID GROUP, INC.**  \n---  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**  \n**(Unaudited)**  \n**(in thousands,

The standard Stealth Appearance features dark polished and painted finishes on exterior surfaces and trim. For those who prefer brighter trim, the optional Platinum Appearance applies a silver luster to exterior accents and trim.\n\nThe Lucid Gravity is offered with five interior themes, each of which incorporates sustainable and premium materials to evoke a different part of California's iconic landscape.\n\n  * Mojave PurLuxe (standard) is inspired by the spirit of the Mojave Desert at nighttime; seats are upholstered in PurLuxe, a bio-PVC derived from soy waste products, while other parts of the interior are designed with black ash wood and textiles made from 100% recycled polyester yarn.\n  * Mojave PurLuxe Premium adds heated and ventilated 18-way power front seats with massage functionality and features trim in walnut wood and eco-friendly suede-like synthetic material.\n  * Yosemite PurLuxe Premium is infused with the spirit of the awe-inspiring Yosemite National Park. The heated and ventilated 18-way power front seats with massage functionality are trimmed in light, earth-toned upholstery, echoing the granite monolith, with trim in black and walnut wood.\n  * Tahoe Leather draws from the warmth of Lake Tahoe.

The heated and ventilated 18-way power front seats with massage functionality are trimmed in Nappa full-grain and premium natural grain leather in deep terracotta tones, inspired by the fertile soil of the region. Additional trim is in eco-friendly suede-like material and carbon oak wood.\n\n\n\nThe Lucid Gravity comes standard with two rows of seats for up to five occupants.

A three-chamber air suspension offers even greater agility with stabilized cornering compared to the standard air suspension system. Rear wheel steering, also included in the Dynamic Handling Package, increases convenience and vehicle maneuverability with a tighter turning radius at low speeds and greater stability and agility at higher speeds.\n\nThe optional Technology Package adds several features that are new for Lucid Gravity. An all-new augmented reality head-up display (AR HUD), designed in-house by Lucid, transforms the vehicle windshield by projecting navigation and other critical information directly in the driver's line of sight to the road ahead. Dynamic ambient interior lighting can be individually customized for a personal immersive interior environment. Lucid's Sanctuary Mode takes this experience further, enveloping passengers in a cocoon of tranquility inspired by California's natural wonders. Finally, the Technology Package also adds 120V power outlets in the frunk, vehicle interior, and rear cargo area. These outlets not only enhance outdoor adventures, but they also provide a reliable backup power source during emergencies.\n\nLucid Gravity customers can also choose to upgrade from the standard Surreal Sound 10-speaker audio system to Surreal Sound Pro, a 22-speaker audio system with spatial capability further enhanced with Dolby Atmos, enabling a truly immersive multi-direction soundscape.\n\nThe optional Comfort & Convenience Package elevates the Lucid Gravity experience, adding auto-cinching soft-close doors, a heated steering wheel, heated windshield wipers, heated second row seats, rear side window sunshades, acoustic laminated privacy glass, active cabin air filtration, and rear center console display screen.\n\nAn optional tow package enables the Lucid Gravity Grand Touring to tow up to 6,000 pounds.3 The package includes a tow bar, receiver, and an integrated wiring harness with trailer socket connector.\n\nAdditional information about Lucid Gravity pricing, ordering, and deliveries for markets outside the U.S. will be released later.\n\n**About Lucid Group**Lucid (NASDAQ: LCID) is a Silicon Valley-based technology company focused on creating the most advanced EVs in the world.
