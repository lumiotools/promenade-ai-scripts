Announces Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results and Recent Highlights\n\nNovember 11, 2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/18411/pdf)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS, Nov. 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nuwellis, Inc. (Nasdaq: NUWE), a medical device company focused on transforming the lives of people with fluid overload, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Recent Highlights:**\n\n  * Received a 297% CMS reimbursement increase to $1,639 for Aquadex facility fee, effective January 1, 2025.\n  * Revenue of $2.4 million.\n  * Pediatrics revenue growth of 28% compared to the prior year quarter.\n  * Gross margin of 70%, compared to 57.3% in the prior-year quarter.\n  * Total operating cost reduction of 30% compared to the prior-year quarter.\n  * New study published in Current Problems in Cardiology highlighted statistically significant reduction in Heart Failure readmissions at 60 days when using Aquadex.\n  * Added three new pediatric accounts and two new adult accounts.\n  * Received $5.1 million in gross proceeds through the November exercise of outstanding warrants.\n\n\n\n“We commend the hard work and dedication of the Nuwellis team, fueling steady market adoption of our Aquadex ultrafiltration therapy, with revenue in the third quarter 2024 led by console sales and new account wins in our Pediatric customer category, which posted 28% annual growth,” said Nestor Jaramillo, President and CEO of Nuwellis. “We continue to see momentum with new accounts steadily opening on increasing awareness of the efficacy and supporting clinical evidence for Aquadex ultrafiltration therapy in the adult and pediatric customer categories. We believe these newly published clinical results will have a positive impact in growing our business and supporting Aquadex in becoming the standard of care for fluid removal when diuretics are ineffective. Following the closing of the quarter, we received notice of a 297% increase to $1,639 per day in reimbursement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) which greatly expands the outpatient marketplace for fluid removal. This reimbursement increase is effective January 1, 2025.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $2.4 million, a 2% decrease compared to the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year decrease is attributable to a decrease in consumables utilization, a decrease in US console sales offset by a one-time increase in SeaStar Medical Quelimmune sales.\n\nGross margin was 70% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 57.3% in the prior-year quarter. The increase was primarily driven by higher manufacturing volumes of consumables and lower fixed overhead manufacturing expenses.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) for the third quarter of 2024 decreased to $2.7 million, compared to $3.4 million in the prior-year quarter. The decrease in SG&A expense was primarily realized through efficiency initiatives enacted in the second half of 2023.\n\nThird quarter research and development (R&D) expenses were $486 thousand, compared to $1.1 million in the prior-year quarter. The decrease in R&D expense was primarily due to reduced consulting fees and compensation related expenses.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $3.2 million, a 30% decrease compared to $4.5 million in the prior-year quarter as we continue to realize savings from operating efficiency initiatives enacted in the second half of 2023.\n\nOperating loss for the third quarter of 2024 decreased to $1.5 million compared to an operating loss of $3.2 million in the prior-year quarter.\n\nNet income attributable to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2024 was $2.4 million, or a gain of $1.74 per basic and diluted common share, compared to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $3.4 million, or a loss of $63.27 per basic and diluted common share in the prior-year quarter. Third quarter net income improvement was primarily the result of the revaluation of a prior period warrant liability, resulting in a $3.9 million dollar benefit.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had no debt, cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.9 million, and approximately 1.9 million common shares outstanding. Shareholder equity was $3.2 million, which we intend to submit to Nasdaq in support of our continued listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast at 9:00 AM ET today to discuss its financial results and provide an update on the Company’s performance.\n\nTo access the live webcast, please visit the Investors page of the Nuwellis website at [https://ir.nuwellis.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=oPhVCIoXcm3LD61QZ32ymA6eZDi1s8oVopoJ_jp7ECMoCFrNGJSZcC_pFco62iGVZpOgqzxuJbvUNJBtTxBbfbhKwDmtQ-jbgNw7gC1UbYY=).

Effective January 1, 2025, the payment rate will increase 397% from $413 to $1,639 per day.\n\nNestor Jaramillo, President and CEO of Nuwellis, expressed his excitement about the new payment rate, stating, \"We are thrilled with the CMS' decision to reassign the code for Aquadex SmartFlow therapy, increasing the reimbursement rate for Aquadex SmartFlow therapy. This change underscores the clinical importance and cost-effectiveness of our ultrafiltration technology and will expand patient access to this life-saving therapy. It is well understood that providing care in an outpatient setting can be a better means to manage disease and prevent costly emergency hospitalizations.

The decision by CMS marks a significant milestone in the recognition of the value and effectiveness of Aquadex SmartFlow ultrafiltration therapy for treating fluid overload in heart failure patients. The reassignment to APC 5242 will provide a reimbursement pathway for ultrafiltration therapy delivered in an outpatient setting, which will help expand the number of patients who are able to receive the therapy as part of a sub-acute or chronic disease management program.\n\n**About Nuwellis** Nuwellis, Inc.

Significant fluid overload if left untreated increases time in the ICU, time on the ventilator and overall hospital length of stay as well as mortality of our patients. Previously, we relied on medical management including diuretics or medications to improve urine output or conventional dialysis modalities like hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy to remove excess fluid. We are excited to have access to Aquadex therapy, which offers a new and innovative way to manage fluid overload in our sickest pediatric patients. Having this advanced option means we can better support children with heart and kidney disease, improve their outcomes, and provide them with a better quality of life.”\n\nNuwellis’ President and CEO, Nestor Jaramillo, also commented on the partnership. “We are thrilled to partner with University of Iowa Health Care Stead Family Children’s Hospital, Dr. Merrill, and his team to be part of their mission to provide world-class care to children. This collaboration reflects our commitment to expanding access to life-saving fluid management solutions for hospitals across the country and growing our pediatric business. By working together, we are helping more patients receive the care they need when it matters most.”\n\nThe Aquadex SmartFlow system is designed to safely remove excess fluid in patients suffering from fluid overload, a condition that often accompanies heart failure, kidney disease, and other critical conditions. This system is an important tool in pediatric care, where precise fluid management is crucial to improving patient outcomes.\n\n**About Nuwellis** Nuwellis, Inc.

The study analyzed data from 30 patients who underwent this therapy during the program's first year. The primary objective was to assess whether ultrafiltration with Aquadex could reduce the high readmission rates commonly observed in patients with refractory ADHF.\n\nKey findings from the study include:\n\n  * **Significant Volume Loss and Weight Reduction:** Patients experienced significant volume loss and weight reduction without adverse renal effects.\n  * **Significant Reduction in Heart Failure Readmissions:** The study found a statistically significant reduction in rehospitalization rates for heart failure at 60 days from the initiation of ultrafiltration therapy compared to the pre-ultrafiltration period (16.7% vs. 26.7%, p=0.013). The total number of ADHF readmissions in the 30 days following ultrafiltration therapy decreased by 40%, and by 59% in the subsequent 60 days.\n  * **Stable Renal Function:** Serum creatinine levels at 72 hours post-ultrafiltration did not change significantly (-0.01 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.26, 0.23).\n\n\n\nDr. Jefferies expressed his enthusiasm for the study's findings, stating, \"The results of our study showed success with ultrafiltration in the mainstream setting with reproducible results of significant volume loss without adverse effect, mitigation of recurrent HF admissions and remarkable subjective clinical benefits. The significant reduction in rehospitalization rates, combined with the safety profile observed, marks a notable advancement in the management of acutely decompensated heart failure.\"\n\n\"This study underscores the value of ultrafiltration therapy with Aquadex in managing fluid overload in hospitalized heart failure patients,\" commented Nestor Jaramillo, President and CEO of Nuwellis. \"The positive outcomes reported in this community-based hospital setting demonstrate the broader applicability and effectiveness of Aquadex, which is critical as we continue to expand access to this life-saving therapy in multiple academic and community healthcare centers across the country.\"\n\nMr. Jaramillo added, \"These study results should be of interest to the many physicians and hospital administrators seeking to reduce the losses associated with heart failure patient care. The statistically significant outcomes reported in this study further reinforce the value of Aquadex. This new evidence comes as we marked 30% revenue growth in our core business, as reported in our second quarter earnings release.\"\n\nTreating heart failure patients is a complex and costly endeavor. In the U.S., over 6.5 million people suffer from this condition, leading to $60 billion in annual healthcare costs.1 One million of these patients are hospitalized each year due to fluid overload, spending an average of 8 days in the hospital at a cost of $24,000 per patient.1,2 DRGs do not fully cover these costs, and a 24% national readmission rate can result in a 2-3% penalty on all Medicare expenses for hospitals. The results of this new research highlight the crucial role that Aquadex ultrafiltration therapy can play in reducing hospitalization and readmission rates, as well as patient length of stay. By doing so, hospitals can save approximately $3,975 per patient and reduce hospitalization mortality.3,4\n\nThe full study is available in the [October issue of _Current Problems in Cardiology_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SdMqPXYgykP6Rf4g7j1ErykTlCEaz8kxYdxUH3bq6-ZFXHSXmTmnbeW1xNwjJA90bmt55qBBC0gk1iDxbh3W6GuPjqk-Alvc-i9eug18qPQfcAPmbayh7EPv_9tJaLeG0PrU2g85yJ4tcmjU-N0BYvGgC-vcXNzcFa3vHTZJOq1_TPnBD-8mf88Rl8fbHcWnm2ZxMimVggpWoQ4jaSP1yA==).

Announces Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nAugust 13, 2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/18271/pdf)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS, Aug. 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nuwellis, Inc. (Nasdaq: NUWE), a medical technology company focused on transforming the lives of people with fluid overload, today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n  * Revenue of $2.2 million, a 6% increase over the second quarter of 2023.\n  * Critical Care revenue growth of 28% compared to the prior year quarter; Heart Failure consumables utilization growth of 35% over the prior-year quarter. \n  * Gross margin of 67.2%, compared to 55.3% in the prior-year quarter.\n  * Total operating cost reduction of 38% compared to the prior-year quarter.\n  * Expanded Aquadex® to pediatric patients at one of the largest hospital networks in Florida.\n  * Announced purchase agreement with a 50-hospital network in Texas for Aquadex Ultrafiltration Therapy.\n\n\n\n“Our second quarter 2024 results continue to demonstrate market traction for our Aquadex ultrafiltration therapy, with revenue growth driven by steady increases in consumables utilization, particularly in Critical Care and Heart Failure, supported by our growing body of clinical evidence that highlights the benefits of Aquadex for patients experiencing fluid overload who have not responded to traditional diuretic treatments. Of note, our higher margin consumables business continues to fuel manufacturing efficiencies, resulting in strong gross margin gains compared to the year ago period,” said Nestor Jaramillo, President and CEO of Nuwellis. “Bolstering our positive momentum in 2024, we are also excited to now expand our Pediatric product offerings with QUELIMMUNE™, providing our growing Pediatric network with a new therapy for acute kidney injury (AKI) and sepsis. This novel therapy comes to Nuwellis from our exclusive license and distribution agreement with SeaStar Medical Holding Corporation.” \n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $2.2 million, a 6% increase compared to the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year increase is attributable to a 30% increase in heart failure and critical care consumables utilization. Pediatrics had a 25% decline in utilization due to patient census.\n\nGross margin was 67.2% for the second quarter of 2024, compared to 55.3% in the prior-year quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher manufacturing volumes of consumables in the current year period and lower fixed overhead manufacturing expenses.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) for the second quarter of 2024 decreased to $3.2 million, compared to $4.7 million in the prior-year quarter. The decrease in SG&A expense was primarily realized through efficiency initiatives enacted in the second half of 2023. \n\nSecond quarter research and development (R&D) expenses were $558 thousand, compared to $1.5 million in the prior-year quarter. The decrease in R&D expense was primarily due to reduced consulting fees and compensation-related expenses. \n\nTotal operating expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were $3.8 million, a 38% decrease compared to $6.2 million in the prior-year quarter as we continue to realize savings from operating efficiency initiatives enacted in the second half of 2023.\n\nOperating loss for the second quarter of 2024 decreased to $2.3 million compared to an operating loss of $5.0 million in the prior-year quarter.\n\nNet loss attributable to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2024 was $7.7 million, or a loss of $18.85 per basic and diluted common share, compared to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $4.8 million, or a loss of $127.65 per basic and diluted common share in the prior-year quarter.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had no debt, cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.0 million, and approximately 516 thousand common shares outstanding. On July 25, Nuwellis closed a registered direct offering and concurrent private placement with gross proceeds of $2.0 million before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast at 9:00 AM ET today to discuss its financial results and provide an update on the Company’s performance.\n\nTo access the live webcast, please visit the Investors page of the Nuwellis website at [https://ir.nuwellis.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=cHyOO5-xVxg2-anipsEKDeiqoT1rq357R9fhRDxFsXSkf__BAWfsfz0lk2fXh1mdavagXrsbaV-pUA7_1TakcwHKi1RIDfrlV_ZLsiwOeww=).
