Seamlessly integrating advanced reclining technology into the modular, sectional system, known as Sactionals, the Reclining Seat delivers unparalleled comfort and flexibility while maintaining the sleek, sophisticated aesthetic that _[Lovesac](https://www.lovesac.com/)_ is known for.\n\n[ ![Customers can choose between preferred Seat depths, arm and back styles, along with 150+ washable, changeable, and customizable Covers](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2562701/LOVESAC_Best_sectional_modern_couch_recliner.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2562701/LOVESAC_Best_sectional_modern_couch_recliner.html)\n\nThe Reclining Seat, like all Sactionals innovations, allows customers to continue to customize both new and existing Sactionals setups, whether purchased yesterday, a year ago or a decade prior. Designed with stealth functionality in mind, the Sactionals Reclining Seat maintains the modern appearance of Sactionals while offering a fully integrated reclining mechanism that remains invisible when not in use. Unlike traditional recliners that are limited to specific spots within a couch or sectional, the Sactionals Reclining Seat can be positioned virtually anywhere in a configuration, including in the middle, at the end, or even side-by-side. Customers can also transform a single Reclining Seat to either Deep or Standard seating depths to optimize comfort and style – a customization component unique to Lovesac. In fact, Sactionals owners can now create a couch with as many Reclining Seats as they want – further solidifying the promise that every seat within Sactionals is the best seat in the house. \n\n\"At Lovesac, our customers expect innovation that works behind the scenes and breaks the rules of traditional furniture. The Sactionals Reclining Seat delivers,\" said Shawn Nelson, Founder & CEO at Lovesac. \"Just like the StealthTech Sound + Charge System, the Reclining Seat delivers all the benefits of advanced technology while keeping it elegantly hidden, operating smoothly and silently. It's the perfect marriage of form and function, offering the comfort of a recliner without disrupting the clean, contemporary aesthetic of Sactionals.\"\n\nIn addition to its modular flexibility, the Reclining Seat's wall-hugging recline capabilities allow it to fully recline when positioned right up against a wall – unlike traditional reclining chairs and couches that require some clearance to recline – making it ideal for smaller living spaces. Backed by a lifetime guarantee on the frame the Reclining Seat ensures long-lasting satisfaction.\n\nIn line with the celebrated Sactionals experience, the Reclining Seat offers fully customizable and changeable styles. Customers can choose between preferred Seat depths, arm and back styles, along with 150+ washable, changeable, and customizable Covers, allowing them to update up their Sactionals at any time, for life.\n\nThe Sactionals Reclining Seat will be available for purchase starting November 20, 2024.

Gross margin decreased 80 basis points to 59.0% of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 from 59.8% of net sales in the prior year period primarily driven by a decrease of 110 basis points in product margin driven by higher promotional discounting and an increase of 50 basis points in outbound transportation and warehousing costs, partially offset by a decrease of 80 basis points in inbound transportation costs. \n  * SG&A expense increased $9.9 million, or 15.4%, in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year period due to investments in payroll, equity-based compensation, professional fees, rent, and infrastructure. \n  * Advertising and marketing expense decreased $3.2 million, or 12.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily due to costs related to our 25th anniversary campaign in FY24 not repeating in FY25. \n  * Operating loss was $8.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to $1.0 million in the prior year period. Operating margin was (5.3)% of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to (0.7)% of net sales in the prior year period. \n  * Net loss was $5.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 or $(0.38) net loss per common share compared to $0.6 million or $(0.04) net loss per common share in the prior year period. During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $1.8 million, compared to less than $0.1 million in the prior year period. The change in benefit is primarily driven by higher net loss before taxes and an increase in the effective tax rate. \n\n\n\n**Highlights for the Year-to-date Period Ended August 4, 2024:**\n\n  * Net sales decreased $6.5 million, or 2.2%, in the first half of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily driven by a decrease of 10.0% in omni-channel comparable net sales, partially offset by the net addition of 31 new showrooms compared to the prior year period. \n  * Gross profit increased $1.4 million, or 0.9%, in the first half of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year period. Gross margin increased 170 basis points to 56.8% of net sales in the first half of fiscal 2025 from 55.1% of net sales in the prior year period primarily driven by a decrease of 420 basis points in inbound transportation costs, partially offset by an increase of 130 basis points in outbound transportation and warehousing costs and a decrease of 120 basis points in product margin driven by higher promotional discounting. \n  * SG&A expense increased $21.7 million, or 18.0%, in the first half of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year period due to investments in payroll, professional fees, equity-based compensation, infrastructure, and rent. \n  * Advertising and marketing expense decreased $2.1 million, or 4.9% in the first half of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily due to costs related to our 25th anniversary campaign in FY24 not repeating in FY25. \n  * Operating loss was $26.2 million in the first half of fiscal 2025 compared to $6.7 million in the prior year period. Operating margin was (9.1)% of net sales in the first half of fiscal 2025 compared to (2.3)% of net sales in the prior year period. \n  * Net loss was $18.8 million in the first half of fiscal 2025 or $(1.21) net loss per diluted share compared to $4.8 million or $(0.31) net loss per diluted share in the prior year period. During the first half of fiscal 2025, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $6.0 million, compared to $1.3 million for the prior year period. The change in benefit is primarily driven by higher net loss before taxes and an increase in the effective tax rate. \n\n\n\n**Other Financial Highlights as of August 4, 2024:**\n\n  * The cash and cash equivalents balance as of August 4, 2024 was $72.1 million as compared to $54.7 million as of July 30, 2023. There was no balance on the Company’s line of credit as of August 4, 2024 and July 30, 2023. The Company’s availability under the line of credit was $36.0 million as of August 4, 2024 and July 30, 2023. As previously announced, on July 29, 2024, we amended the credit agreement to add an uncommitted accordion feature that allows the Company, subject to certain customary conditions, to increase the size of the revolving credit facility by $10 million and, among other things, extend the maturity date of the loans made under the Amendment from September 30, 2024 to July 29, 2029. \n  * Total merchandise inventory was $88.3 million as of August 4, 2024 as compared to $105.0 million as of July 30, 2023 principally related to a planned stock inventory decrease of $14.1 million coupled with a decrease in freight capitalization of $3.5 million related to the decrease in inbound freight expense. \n\n\n\n**Outlook:**\n\nThe Company provides guidance of select information related to the Company’s financial and operating performance, and such measures may differ from year to year. The projections are as of this date and the Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement this information.\n\nThe Company expects the following for the full year of fiscal 2025:\n\n  * Net sales in the range of $700 million to $735 million.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA1 in the range of $52 million to $59 million.\n  * Net income in the range of $17 million to $21 million.\n  * Diluted income per common share in the range of $1.01 to $1.26 on approximately 16.9 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\n  * Fiscal 2025 will contain 52 weeks versus Fiscal 2024 which contained an additional “53rd week” in the fourth quarter. \n\n\n\nThe Company currently expects the following for the third quarter of fiscal 2025:\n\n  * Net sales in the range of $152 million to $160 million.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA1 in the range of a loss of $3 million to income of $1 million.\n  * Net loss in the range of $4 million to $8 million.\n  * Basic loss per common share in the range of $0.28 to $0.50 on approximately 15.6 million estimated weighted average shares outstanding.\n\n\n\n1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. See “Non-GAAP Information” and “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included in this press release.\n\n**Conference Call Information:**\n\nA conference call to discuss the financial results for the second quarter ended August 4, 2024 is scheduled for today, September 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of certain non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These items include management fees, equity-based compensation expense, write-offs of property and equipment, deferred rent, financing expenses and certain other charges and gains that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance. We have reconciled this non-GAAP financial measure with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure within the schedules attached hereto. Statements regarding our expectations as to fiscal 2025 Adjusted EBITDA do not include certain charges and costs. These items include equity-based compensation expense and certain other charges and gains that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance. We are not able to provide a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures without unreasonable effort because of the uncertainty and variability of the nature and amount of these future charges and costs. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing of certain events that have not yet occurred and are out of the Company’s control.\n\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures not only provide its management with comparable financial data for internal financial analysis but also provide meaningful supplemental information to investors. Specifically, these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better understand the performance of our business, facilitate a more meaningful comparison of our actual results on a period-over-period basis and provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We have provided this information as a means to evaluate the results of our ongoing operations alongside GAAP measures such as gross profit, operating income (loss) and net income (loss). Other companies in our industry may calculate these items differently than we do. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as net income (loss) or net income (loss) per share as a measure of financial performance, cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP.\n\n**Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other legal authority.

We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of certain non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These items include management fees,\nequity-based compensation expense, write-offs of property and equipment, deferred rent, financing expenses and certain other charges and gains that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance. We have reconciled this\nnon-GAAP financial measure with the most directly comparable GAAP financial in our 10-K filing.\nWe have also presented herein certain forward-looking statements about the Company’s future financial performance that include non-GAAP (or “as-adjusted”) financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA. This non–GAAP financial measure is\nderived by excluding certain amounts, expenses or income, from the corresponding financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from this non-GAAP financial measure is a\nmatter of management judgment and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts recognized in a given period. We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of the aforementioned\nforward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of such GAAP measures, which could be\nsignificant in amount.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures not only provide its management with comparable financial data for internal financial analysis but also provide meaningful supplemental information to investors. However, other companies\nin our industry may calculate these items differently than we do. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as net income\n(loss) or net income (loss) per share as a measure of financial performance, cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. 2\nKey Business Highlights\nProven omni-channel advantage with strong Mid-luxury positioning target customer is 25 to 45\necommerce performance, highly productive year-old “young parent want-it-alls” with our key\nshowrooms, and strong channel partnerships customer between 35 to 39 years old\nHome furniture and technologybrand with heritage Attractive financial profile with 57.3% reported gross\nof disruptive innovation margin for FY2024\nConcentrated SKU count combined with redundant Focus on sustainability, having repurposed more than\nmanufacturing spread across multiple geographies, 160 million plastic water bottles\nallows for delivery of customers’ orders within days\n3\nLOVE’s Unique Product Philosophy: Designed For Life\nChangeable\nMaintainable\nMoveable\nRearrangeable\nUpgradable\nWaste-less We intend to become one of the biggest, the most innovative, and\nthe most beloved furniture brands in the world.\n4\nLovesac at a Glance\nFY2024 Key Financial Metrics\nNET SALES NET SALES GROWTH\n$700.3 million 7.5%\n(91% of Net Sales = Sactionals) (5 YEAR CAGR of 33.4%)\nGROSS PROFIT GROSS MARGIN\n$401.0 million 57.3%\nADJ.

We are pleased with the incredible reception we have seen with the product innovation we have delivered recently through our PillowSac Accent Chair as well as our newly launched AnyTable. We are excited to continue to build on the momentum we are driving through expanding our offering, and while we are prudently planning for the second half of the year given the category headwinds, we believe we are well positioned to deliver on our objectives for both the near- and long-term.”\n\n**Key Measures for the Second Quarter and First Half of Fiscal 2025 Ending August 4, 2024:**(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we opened 10 additional showrooms and closed 2 showrooms. \n  * Gross profit remained flat in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year period. Gross margin decreased 80 basis points to 59.0% of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 from 59.8% of net sales in the prior year period primarily driven by a decrease of 110 basis points in product margin driven by higher promotional discounting and an increase of 50 basis points in outbound transportation and warehousing costs, partially offset by a decrease of 80 basis points in inbound transportation costs. \n  * SG&A expense increased $9.9 million, or 15.4%, in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year period due to investments in payroll, equity-based compensation, professional fees, rent, and infrastructure. \n  * Advertising and marketing expense decreased $3.2 million, or 12.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily due to costs related to our 25th anniversary campaign in FY24 not repeating in FY25. \n  * Operating loss was $8.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to $1.0 million in the prior year period. Operating margin was (5.3)% of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to (0.7)% of net sales in the prior year period. \n  * Net loss was $5.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 or $(0.38) net loss per common share compared to $0.6 million or $(0.04) net loss per common share in the prior year period. During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $1.8 million, compared to less than $0.1 million in the prior year period. The change in benefit is primarily driven by higher net loss before taxes and an increase in the effective tax rate. \n\n\n\n**Highlights for the Year-to-date Period Ended August 4, 2024:**\n\n  * Net sales decreased $6.5 million, or 2.2%, in the first half of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily driven by a decrease of 10.0% in omni-channel comparable net sales, partially offset by the net addition of 31 new showrooms compared to the prior year period. \n  * Gross profit increased $1.4 million, or 0.9%, in the first half of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year period. Gross margin increased 170 basis points to 56.8% of net sales in the first half of fiscal 2025 from 55.1% of net sales in the prior year period primarily driven by a decrease of 420 basis points in inbound transportation costs, partially offset by an increase of 130 basis points in outbound transportation and warehousing costs and a decrease of 120 basis points in product margin driven by higher promotional discounting. \n  * SG&A expense increased $21.7 million, or 18.0%, in the first half of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year period due to investments in payroll, professional fees, equity-based compensation, infrastructure, and rent. \n  * Advertising and marketing expense decreased $2.1 million, or 4.9% in the first half of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily due to costs related to our 25th anniversary campaign in FY24 not repeating in FY25. \n  * Operating loss was $26.2 million in the first half of fiscal 2025 compared to $6.7 million in the prior year period. Operating margin was (9.1)% of net sales in the first half of fiscal 2025 compared to (2.3)% of net sales in the prior year period. \n  * Net loss was $18.8 million in the first half of fiscal 2025 or $(1.21) net loss per diluted share compared to $4.8 million or $(0.31) net loss per diluted share in the prior year period. During the first half of fiscal 2025, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $6.0 million, compared to $1.3 million for the prior year period. The change in benefit is primarily driven by higher net loss before taxes and an increase in the effective tax rate. \n\n\n\n**Other Financial Highlights as of August 4, 2024:**\n\n  * The cash and cash equivalents balance as of August 4, 2024 was $72.1 million as compared to $54.7 million as of July 30, 2023. There was no balance on the Company’s line of credit as of August 4, 2024 and July 30, 2023. The Company’s availability under the line of credit was $36.0 million as of August 4, 2024 and July 30, 2023. As previously announced, on July 29, 2024, we amended the credit agreement to add an uncommitted accordion feature that allows the Company, subject to certain customary conditions, to increase the size of the revolving credit facility by $10 million and, among other things, extend the maturity date of the loans made under the Amendment from September 30, 2024 to July 29, 2029. \n  * Total merchandise inventory was $88.3 million as of August 4, 2024 as compared to $105.0 million as of July 30, 2023 principally related to a planned stock inventory decrease of $14.1 million coupled with a decrease in freight capitalization of $3.5 million related to the decrease in inbound freight expense. \n\n\n\n**Outlook:**\n\nThe Company provides guidance of select information related to the Company’s financial and operating performance, and such measures may differ from year to year. The projections are as of this date and the Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement this information.\n\nThe Company expects the following for the full year of fiscal 2025:\n\n  * Net sales in the range of $700 million to $735 million.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA1 in the range of $52 million to $59 million.\n  * Net income in the range of $17 million to $21 million.\n  * Diluted income per common share in the range of $1.01 to $1.26 on approximately 16.9 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\n  * Fiscal 2025 will contain 52 weeks versus Fiscal 2024 which contained an additional “53rd week” in the fourth quarter. \n\n\n\nThe Company currently expects the following for the third quarter of fiscal 2025:\n\n  * Net sales in the range of $152 million to $160 million.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA1 in the range of a loss of $3 million to income of $1 million.\n  * Net loss in the range of $4 million to $8 million.\n  * Basic loss per common share in the range of $0.28 to $0.50 on approximately 15.6 million estimated weighted average shares outstanding.\n\n\n\n1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. See “Non-GAAP Information” and “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included in this press release.\n\n**Conference Call Information:**\n\nA conference call to discuss the financial results for the second quarter ended August 4, 2024 is scheduled for today, September 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of certain non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These items include management fees, equity-based compensation expense, write-offs of property and equipment, deferred rent, financing expenses and certain other charges and gains that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance. We have reconciled this non-GAAP financial measure with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure within the schedules attached hereto. Statements regarding our expectations as to fiscal 2025 Adjusted EBITDA do not include certain charges and costs. These items include equity-based compensation expense and certain other charges and gains that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance. We are not able to provide a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures without unreasonable effort because of the uncertainty and variability of the nature and amount of these future charges and costs. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing of certain events that have not yet occurred and are out of the Company’s control.\n\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures not only provide its management with comparable financial data for internal financial analysis but also provide meaningful supplemental information to investors. Specifically, these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better understand the performance of our business, facilitate a more meaningful comparison of our actual results on a period-over-period basis and provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We have provided this information as a means to evaluate the results of our ongoing operations alongside GAAP measures such as gross profit, operating income (loss) and net income (loss). Other companies in our industry may calculate these items differently than we do. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as net income (loss) or net income (loss) per share as a measure of financial performance, cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP.\n\n**Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other legal authority.
