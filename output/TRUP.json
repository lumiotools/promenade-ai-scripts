These forward-looking\nstatements are based upon the current expectations and beliefs of Trupanion’s management as of the date of this press\nrelease, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those\ndescribed in the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements made in this press release are based on\ninformation available to Trupanion as of the date hereof, and Trupanion has no obligation to update these forward-\nlooking statements.\nIn particular, the following factors, among others, could cause results to differ materially from those expressed or\nimplied by such forward-looking statements: the ability to achieve or maintain profitability and/or appropriate levels of\ncash flow in future periods; the ability to keep growing our membership base and revenue; the accuracy of assumptions\nused in determining appropriate member acquisition expenditures; the severity and frequency of claims; the ability to\nmaintain high retention rates; the accuracy of assumptions used in pricing medical plan subscriptions and the ability to\naccurately estimate the impact of new products or offerings on claims frequency; actual claims expense exceeding\nestimates; regulatory and other constraints on the ability to institute, or the decision to otherwise delay, pricing\nmodifications in response to changes in actual or estimated claims expense; the effectiveness and statutory or\nregulatory compliance of our Territory Partner model and of our Territory Partners, veterinarians and other third parties\nin recommending medical plan subscriptions to potential members; the ability to retain existing Territory Partners and\nincrease the number of Territory Partners and active hospitals; compliance by us and those referring us members with\nlaws and regulations that apply to our business, including the sale of a pet medical plan; the ability to maintain the\nsecurity of our data; fluctuations in the Canadian currency exchange rate; the ability to protect our proprietary and\nmember information; the ability to maintain our culture and team; the ability to maintain the requisite amount of risk-\nbased capital; our ability to implement and maintain effective controls, including to remediate material weaknesses in\ninternal controls over financial reporting; the ability to protect and enforce Trupanion’s intellectual property rights; the\nability to successfully implement our alliance with Aflac; the ability to continue key contractual relationships with third\nparties; third-party claims including litigation and regulatory actions; the ability to recognize benefits from investments\nin new solutions and enhancements to Trupanion’s technology platform and website; our ability to retain key\npersonnel; and deliberations and determinations by the Trupanion board based on the future performance of the\ncompany or otherwise.\nFor a detailed discussion of these and other cautionary statements, please refer to the risk factors discussed in filings\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including but not limited to, Trupanion’s Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and any subsequently filed reports on Forms 10-Q, 10-K and 8-K.\nAll documents are available through the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval system at\nhttps://www.sec.gov or the Investor Relations section of Trupanion’s website at https://investors.trupanion.com.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTrupanion’s stated results may include certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures\nmay not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in its industry as other\ncompanies in its industry may calculate or use non-GAAP financial measures differently. In addition, there are\nlimitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in\naccordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude\nexpenses that may have a material impact on Trupanion’s reported financial results. The presentation and utilization of\nnon-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable\nfinancial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Trupanion urges its investors to review the reconciliation of its\nnon-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in its consolidated financial\nstatements, and not to rely on any single financial or operating measure to evaluate its business. These reconciliations\nare included below and on Trupanion’s Investor Relations website.\n3\nBecause of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments\nthat can impact a company’s non-cash expenses, Trupanion believes that providing various non-GAAP financial\nmeasures that exclude stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization expense allows for more\nmeaningful comparisons between its operating results from period to period. Trupanion offsets new pet acquisition\nexpense with sign-up fee revenue in the calculation of net acquisition cost because it collects sign-up fee revenue from\nnew members at the time of enrollment and considers it to be an offset to a portion of Trupanion’s new pet acquisition\nexpense. Trupanion believes this allows it to calculate and present financial measures in a consistent manner across\nperiods. Trupanion’s management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures and the related financial measures\nderived from them are important tools for financial and operational decision-making and for evaluating operating\nresults over different periods of time.\n4\nTrupanion, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(in thousands, except share data)\nThree Months Ended September 30,

Non-cash\nitems, such as stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization, are also excluded. Acquisition cost, development\nexpenses, gain (loss) from investment in joint venture, stock-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization are expected\nto remain recurring expenses for the foreseeable future, but are excluded from this metric to measure scale in other areas of the\nbusiness. Management believes acquisition costs primarily represent the cost to acquire new subscribers and are driven by the amount of\ngrowth we choose to pursue based primarily on the amount of our adjusted operating income period over period. Accordingly, this measure\nis not indicative of our core operating income performance. We also exclude development expenses, gain (loss) from investment in joint\nventure, stock-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization because some investors may not view those items as\nreflective of our core operating income performance.\nManagement uses adjusted operating income and the margin on adjusted operating income to understand the effects of scale in its non-\nacquisition cost and development expenses and to plan future advertising expenditures, which are designed to acquire new pets. Management\nuses this measure as a principal way of understanding the operating performance of its business exclusive of acquisition cost and new product\nexploration and development initiatives. Management believes disclosure of this metric provides investors with the same data that the Company\nemploys in assessing its overall operations and that disclosure of this measure may provide useful information regarding the efficiency of our\nutilization of revenues, return on advertising dollars in the form of new subscribers and future use of available cash to support the continued\ngrowth of our business.\n12\nThe following tables reflect the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nNet loss $ (11,289) $ (42,530)\nExcluding:\nStock-based compensation\nexpense\n23,906 25,228\nDepreciation and amortization\nexpense\n12,542 9,445\nInterest income (9,412) (6,169)\nInterest expense 11,071 8,380\nOther non-operating expenses — —\nIncome tax benefit (43) (472)\nNon-recurring transaction or\nrestructuring expenses\n— 4,175\n(Gain) loss from equity method\ninvestment\n(33) (110)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 26,742 $ (2,053)\nThree Months Ended\nSep. 30, Jun. 30, Mar. 31, Dec. 31, Sep. 30, Jun. 30, Mar. 31, Dec. 31,\n2024 2024 2024 2023 2023 2023 2023 2022\nNet income (loss) $ 1,425 $ (5,862) $ (6,852) $ (2,163) $ (4,036) $ (13,714) $ (24,780) $ (9,285)\nExcluding:\nStock-based compensation\nexpense\n8,127 8,381 7,398 6,636 6,585 6,503 12,140 8,412\nDepreciation and amortization\nexpense\n4,381 4,376 3,785 3,029 2,990 3,253 3,202 2,897\nInterest income (3,232) (3,135) (3,045) (2,842) (2,389) (2,051) (1,729) (1,614)\nInterest expense 3,820 3,655 3,596 3,697 3,053 2,940 2,387 1,587\nOther non-operating expenses — — — — — —\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 39 (44) (38) 130 (43) (238) (191) (15)\nNon-recurring transaction or\nrestructuring expenses\n— — 8 65 4,102 193\n(Gain) loss from equity method\ninvestment\n(33) — (110) — — —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 14,527 $ 7,371 $ 4,844 $ 8,487 $ 6,058 $ (3,242) $ (4,869) $ 2,175\n13\nContacts:\nInvestors:\nLaura Bainbridge, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications\nGil Melchior, Director, Investor Relations\nInvestor.Relations@trupanion.com\n14"

Average revenue per new pet is calculated from total premium for all new pets enrolled for the period divided by the total number of new subscription pet months in the\nperiod. Total new subscription pet months in a period represents the sum of all new subscription pets enrolled for each month during the period.\n• Margin per pet. Margin per pet is calculated based on subscription revenue less cost of revenue from our subscription business segment for the36 months prior to the period end date excluding stock-\nbased compensation expense, sign-up fee revenue and the change in deferred revenue between periods. This amount is also reduced by the fixed expenses related to our subscription business, less\nstock-based compensation, based on revenues. The percent margin of this profit is multiplied by quarterly average revenue per new pet.\n• Internal rate of return per average subscription pet (IRR) is calculated assuming the new subscription pets we enroll during the period will behave like an average subscription pet over the last 36 months,\nand represents the discount rate that results in the net present value of all estimated future cash flows generated over an average enrolled pet’s implied subscriber life, to be equal to zero. Cash outflows\nfrom an average pet include average pet acquisition cost for the applicable period. Cash outflows also include a monthly capital charge, which we estimate as 1% of the average quarterly revenue per\nnew pet. Cash inflows from an average pet calculated based margin per pet multiplied by average revenue per new pet for the applicable period.\n• Trailing 3-year Retention. Trailing 3-year retention is measured as the monthly retention rate of enrolled subscription pets for each applicable period averaged over the 36 months prior to the period end\ndate. As such, our average monthly retention rate as of September 30, 2024 is an average of each month’s retention from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2024. We calculate monthly retention as\nthe number of pets that remain after subtracting all pets that cancel during a month, including pets that enroll and cancel within that month, divided by the total pets enrolled at the beginning of that\nmonth.\nDefinitions – Prior Methodology\n• Total subscription pets enrolled. Total subscription pets enrolled reflects the number of pets in active memberships at the end of each period presented. We monitor total subscription pets enrolled\nbecause it provides an indication of the growth of our subscription business.\n• Average revenue per pet. Average revenue per pet is calculated as amounts billed in a given period for subscriptions divided by the total number of subscription pet months in the period. Total\nsubscription pet months in a period represents the sum of all subscription pets enrolled for each month during the period. We monitor monthly average revenue per pet because it is an indicator of the\nper pet unit economics of our subscription business.\n• Lifetime value of a pet, including fixed expenses. Lifetime value of a pet, including fixed expenses, is calculated based on subscription revenue less cost of revenue from our subscription business segment\nfor the 12 months prior to the period end date excluding stock-based compensation expense related to cost of revenue from our subscription business segment, sign-up fee revenue and the change in\ndeferred revenue between periods. This amount is also reduced by the fixed expenses related to our subscription business, which are the pro-rata portion of general and administrative and technology\nand development expenses, less stock-based compensation, based on revenues. This amount, on a per pet basis, is multiplied by the implied average subscriber life in months. Implied average subscriber\nlife in months is calculated as the quotient obtained by dividing one by one minus the average monthly retention rate. We monitor lifetime value of a pet, including fixed expenses, to estimate the value\nwe might expect from new pets over their implied average subscriber life in months, if they behave like the average pet in that respective period. When evaluating the amount of pet acquisition\nexpenses we may want to incur to attract new pet enrollments, we refer to the lifetime value of a pet, including fixed expenses, as well as our estimated internal rate of return calculation for an average\npet, which also includes an estimated surplus capital charge, to inform the amount of acquisition spend in relation to the estimated payback period.\n• Average pet acquisition cost. Average pet acquisition cost (PAC) is calculated as net acquisition cost divided by the total number of new subscription pets enrolled in that period. Net acquisition cost, a\nnon-GAAP financial measure, is calculated in a reporting period as new pet acquisition expense, excluding stock-based compensation expense, other business segment expense, offset by sign-up fee\nrevenue. We exclude stock-based compensation expense because the amount varies from period to period based on number of awards issued and market-based valuation inputs. We offset sign-up fee\nrevenue because it is a one-time charge to new members collected at the time of enrollment used to partially offset initial setup costs, which are included in new pet acquisition expenses. We exclude\nother business segment pet acquisition expense because that does not relate to subscription enrollments. We monitor average pet acquisition cost to evaluate the efficiency in acquiring new members\nand measure effectiveness based on our targeted return on investment.\n• Internal rate of return per average subscription pet (IRR) is calculated assuming the new subscription pets we enroll during the period will behave like an average subscription pet, and represents the\ndiscount rate that results in the net present value of all estimated future cash flows generated over an average enrolled pet’s implied subscriber life, to be equal to zero. Cash outflows from an average\npet include average pet acquisition cost for the applicable period. Cash outflows also include a monthly capital charge, which we estimate as 1% of the average monthly average revenue per pet for\nthe four quarters preceding the period end date. Cash inflows from an average pet are calculated based on subscription revenue less cost of revenue from our subscription business segment for the 12\nmonths prior to the period end date excluding stock-based compensation expense related to cost of revenue from our subscription business segment, sign-up fee revenue and the change in deferred\nrevenue, minus fixed expenses related to our subscription business, which are the pro-rata portion of general and administrative and technology and development expenses, less stock-based\ncompensation, based on revenues.\n• Average monthly retention. Average monthly retention is measured as the monthly retention rate of enrolled subscription pets for each applicable period averaged over the 12 months prior to the period\nend date. As such, our average monthly retention rate as of September 30, 2024 is an average of each month’s retention from October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024. We calculate monthly\nretention as the number of pets that remain after subtracting all pets that cancel during a month, including pets that enroll and cancel within that month, divided by the total pets enrolled at the\nbeginning of that month. We monitor average monthly retention because it provides a measure of member satisfaction and allows us to calculate the implied average subscriber life in months."

All\nstatements other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements. These include, but are\nnot limited to, statements regarding our future operations, key operating metrics, opportunities and financial\nperformance, pricing and veterinary industry inflation, and our ability to remediate our material weaknesses.\nThese statements involve a high degree of known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause\nactual results to differ materially from those discussed. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and\nuncertainties are included in today's earnings release, as well as the Company's most recent reports,\nincluding Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nToday's presentation contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that Management uses to\nevaluate the Company's performance, including without limitation, cost of paying veterinary invoices,\nvariable expenses, fixed expenses, adjusted operating income, acquisition costs, internal rate of return,\nAdjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. When we use the term adjusted operating income or margin, it is\nintended to refer to our non-GAAP operating income or margin before new pet acquisition and development\nexpenses.\nUnless otherwise noted, all margins and expenses will be presented on a non-GAAP basis, and excluding\nstock-based compensation expense and depreciation expense. These non-GAAP measures are in addition\nto, and not a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with the U.S. GAAP.\nInvestors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most\ndirectly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in today's press release or on Trupanion's Investor\nRelations website under the Quarterly Earnings tab.\nLastly, I would like to remind everyone that today's conference call is also available via webcast on\nTrupanion's Investor Relations website. A replay will also be available on the site.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Margi.\nMargi Tooth\nThanks Gil, and good afternoon, everyone.\nI'm pleased to share the results of a very strong quarter. Most notably, growth in our subscription adjusted\noperating income accelerated by 66% over the prior year period. Our subscription adjusted operating\nmargin reached 14% in the quarter, the highest level since quarter one of 2022, which represents a 390\nbasis point year-over-year improvement. The biggest driver of this result was the achievement of our value\nproposition to 71%, a milestone we were pleased to reach against the backdrop of the greatest veterinary\ninflation seen in a generation.\nOver the past 18 months, as inflation rolled through hospitals across North America, the team has been\nworking hard to restore the margins in our core subscription business. Getting back on track required us to\ntake some significant rate increases to return to our target value proposition and pull back on our acquisition\ninvestments until our pricing and the cost of care were more closely aligned. With strong levels of rate now\nbeing earned through our book and ongoing expense discipline across the operations, we are well\npositioned to achieve a 15% subscription adjusted operating margin for Q4.\n2\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

This has been our guiding objective for many years, and as we move ever closer, it will\ncontinue to be our target to ensure that as a low-cost operator, we can offer our members lifetime coverage\nat the highest value proposition in the market. It takes collective commitment from the teams to operate so\nclose to our long-term model P&L, and after months of significant margin pressure, we are now approaching\na sustainable margin position and turning to growth from a position of strength.\nOur operating model requires us to be efficient, lean, vertically integrated, and focused. This allows us to\nreduce frictional costs, which in turn creates a white-glove member experience, high lifetime value, and\ngreater sums of capital to spend on growth acceleration. Our biggest markets today, Canada and the United\nStates, are still dramatically underpenetrated at approximately 4%. The opportunity is enormous, and with\nthe humanization of our pets continuing, the demand and need to enable access to care increases with it.\nBack to our results. Revenue for our subscription segment grew 20% in Q3. In terms of our cost of paying\nveterinary invoices, while the trends in July were slightly better than anticipated, August and September\nwere roughly aligned with prior quarters, leaving the full quarter reflecting a minor deceleration of about 1\npercentage point versus the first half of the year. As a result, we continue to assume 15% veterinary\ninflation.\nOver the last 12 months, about half of our book has received a pricing increase of 20% or more, and\nretention for this group continues to perform well and is trending up year-over-year, despite many receiving\nconsecutive double-digit adjustments to their new monthly premium. We credit this improvement largely to\nthe focus of the team, evolving communications, and enhancing member experience.\nOur retention for those with increases below 20% also performed well, despite a larger proportion of\nmembers now experiencing price increases in the high teens. The strength in both cohorts demonstrates\nthe value and resilience of our product and our member experience. Our efforts now are shifting back to\nthe retention of our members in their first year, which is trending below our expectations. Enhancement of\nthis experience is underway and will continue, as the size of this cohort should become larger over time.\nIt's worth noting the nature of any member experience changes take time to take full effect across an entire\ncohort.\nI'm pleased, however, to share some tangible results today regarding the evolution of our technology\nplatform. With our claims migration nearly complete, we are seeing significantly improved service levels,\ncontinued increases in invoices paid directly to the hospital, and record levels of claims automation, all key\nelements of an exceptional member experience. Additionally, and importantly, we saw efficiencies in our\ninvoice processing costs, which hit a new low as a percentage of subscription revenue. I am eager to see\nthe benefits this new system will bring to first-year retention and all aspects of our business and member\nexperience.\nNow, turning to our new pet growth. In the third quarter, we spent $16.8 million, an increase of 4% over the\nprior year period, to enroll approximately 65,800 new subscription pets. This resulted in an average pet\nacquisition cost of $243 and an estimated internal rate of return of 36%. Of particular note this quarter, we\nsaw a healthy sequential increase in the number of active hospitals, defined as hospitals that enrolled at\nleast one pet in the prior 90 days.\nMoving to our broader portfolio, our newer initiatives, including our powered by suite of products with Chewy\nand Aflac; our medium and low ARPU products, Furkin and PHI Direct; and our products in continental\nEurope, comprised approximately 15% of our gross new pet ads in the quarter, and only 10% of our pet\nacquisition spend.\n3\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

This launch opens the opportunity for us to bring Trupanion's unique high-value\nproduct to another underpenetrated market.\nAs we now look forward, it will be important to gain momentum in new pet enrollments. While we will not\nsacrifice our IRR and free cash flow targets to do so, we intend to deploy an increasing amount of our\nadjusted operating income to acquire pets in the upcoming quarters. After spending so little for the past 12\nmonths, we expect the impact of dining-up investment to take some time to truly accelerate growth, and we\nhave room for improvement in our execution. With an increasing lifetime value and the timing lag of our\nspending, we anticipate per-pet spend to increase on a dollar basis as we ramp back up to higher pet ads.\nOur truly unique offering in the industry presents a much-needed, reliable solution in making pet care\naffordable. Our approach to comprehensive coverage, specifically within the core Trupanion product,\nensures pets receive the care they need without delay, resulting in higher customer and veterinary\nsatisfaction, as well as exceptional lifetime value. We are proud to lead the industry.\nThe Company embraces its role as a leader in this category with purpose and passion, and for years we\nhave been at the forefront of industry discussions to drive fundamental change to the way medical insurance\nfor pets is perceived. While still very much a fledgling industry, we are seeing a shift in how we're viewed\nand regulated, most notably with the adoption of model law across an increasing number of states in the\nU.S., and the recent news of the NAIC changes to the underwriting risk factors applied to the risk-based\ncapital requirements calculation.\nThis change alone is a huge development for us, significantly lowering a barrier we experienced historically\nand ultimately resulting in more funds to grow. These changes are the primary driver of our estimated\ncapital requirements decreasing by 24% since the end of 2023. We anticipate there will be an additional\nreduction to our capital requirements next year from the already announced 2025 factors. These ongoing\ndevelopments give us greater confidence in the long-term recognition of our industry and the nature of its\nrisks.\nBefore I hand over to Fawwad, I'd like to share news of a very meaningful milestone for Trupanion. In a\nshort time, we expect to cross $3 billion in paid veterinary invoices within our subscription segment. It took\nus 20 years to pay out the first billion, a little less than three years to pay out the second, and now less than\ntwo years to pay the third billion. Crossing this milestone is a testament to the very real impact we're making\nand the breadth of our coverage, helping and saving countless pets' lives. This achievement is not just a\nmilestone. It's a celebration of the purpose that drives Trupanion every day and a reminder of the progress\nwe're making.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Fawwad to provide a detailed overview of our Q3 results.\nFawwad Qureshi\nThanks, Margi, and good afternoon, everyone.\nToday, I'll share additional details on our Q3 performance as well as provide our outlook for the fourth\nquarter and full year 2024.\nWe had another strong quarter, with total revenue and adjusted operating income coming in ahead of\nexpectations. Total revenue for the quarter was $327.5 million, up 15% year-over-year. Within our\nsubscription business, revenue was $219 million, up 20% year-over-year. Total monthly average revenue\nper pet for the quarter was $74.27, up 13% over the prior year period.\n4\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription. There may be material errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in the\nreporting of the substance of the conference call. This transcript is being made available for information purposes only.\n1-888-562-0262 1-604-929-1352 www.viavid.com\nTrupanion, Inc. – Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call, October 30, 2024\nWithin our core Trupanion brand, ARPU expanded even faster, at 14% year-over-year. Total subscription\npets increased 6% year-over-year to over 1,032,000 pets as of September 30. This includes over 48,000\npets in Europe, which are currently underwritten by third parties.\nAverage monthly retention for the trailing 12 months was 98.29%, down versus the third quarter last year,\nwhich was 98.55%. On a trailing three-month basis, retention was down from the second quarter this year\nand approximately in line with the first quarter. The subscription business cost of paying veterinary invoices\nwas $155.5 million, resulting in a value proposition of 71%, down from 75.9% in the prior year period.\nWe achieved our 71% target value proposition a quarter earlier than expected. The drivers of this\nimprovement were margin expansion from our ongoing pricing actions, continued efficiency in our cost of\nprocessing invoices, and the trends in veterinary inflation that Margi referred to. The quarter also benefited\nfrom prior period development of $0.5 million, or approximately 20 basis points of revenue.\nAs a percentage of subscription revenue, variable expenses were 9.4%, down from 9.5% a year ago. Fixed\nexpenses as a percentage of revenue were 5.6%, up from 4.4% in the prior year period in line with our\nexpectations. This is the result of ongoing investments in our technology and controls infrastructure. After\nthe cost of paying veterinary invoices, variable expenses, and fixed expenses, we calculate our adjusted\noperating income.\nOur subscription business delivered adjusted operating income of $30.8 million, an increase of 66% from\nlast year. Subscription adjusted operating margin was 14% of subscription revenue. This is up from 10.1%\nin the prior year and represents approximately 390 basis points of margin expansion as pricing takes hold.\nThis represents the highest adjusted operating margin in two and a half years, and the highest Q3 since\n2021.\nNow, I'll turn to our other business segment, which is comprised of revenue from other products and\nservices that generally have a B2B component and a lower margin profile than our subscription business.\nOur other business revenue was $108.5 million for the quarter, an increase of 5% year-over-year. The\ndecelerating growth within this segment is expected as one of our partners, Pets Best, continues to enroll\npets with their new underwriter.\nAdjusted operating income for this segment was $1.8 million, a decrease of 65% from last year, driven by\nlower gross margin and higher fixed expenses. The lower gross margin is consistent with our revised\nagreement with Pets Best, which has lower capital requirements and a different margin profile. In total,\nadjusted operating income was $32.6 million in Q3, up 37% from Q3 last year and ahead of our\nexpectations.\nIn Q3, our higher margin subscription business comprised approximately 94% of our adjusted operating\nincome. This is up from 84% for the full year in 2023. As Margi mentioned earlier, we acquired approximately\n65,800 new subscription pets in the quarter and deployed $16.8 million to do so. Excluding the approximate\n3,700 new European pets that are underwritten by a third party, this translated into an average pet\nacquisition cost of $243 per pet in the quarter, up from $212 in the prior year period. The estimated internal\nrates of return on this spend was 36% in the quarter, in line with our targets of 30% to 40%.\nWe also invested $1.5 million in the quarter in development costs. Stock-based compensation expense\nwas $8.1 million during the quarter.\nWe reported net income for the quarter of $1.4 million, or $0.03 per basic and diluted share, compared to\na net loss of $4 million, or $0.10 per basic and diluted share, in the prior year period. This represents a\nyear-over-year improvement of $5.5 million.\n5\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

Capital expenditures totaled $1.9 million, down from $4.4 million in Q3 last year. As a\nresult, free cash flow was $13.4 million, a $6.4 million improvement from the prior year's third quarter.\nOn our third quarter 2023 earnings call, we introduced an annual free cash flow target at 2.5% of revenue.\nI am pleased to report that we are making fantastic progress towards this goal, and have now generated\n$30 million of free cash flow over the last four quarters. This represents an improvement of $48 million over\nthe prior four quarters.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $293.1 million in cash and short-term investments.\nOutside of our insurance entities, we held $36.4 million in cash and short-term investments, with an\nadditional $15 million available under our credit facility. At the end of the quarter, we maintained $274.6\nmillion of capital surplus at our insurance subsidiaries, which was $139.9 million more than the estimated\nrisk-based capital requirement of $134.7 million. Excess capital has increased by $75.8 million year-to-date\ndue to the NAIC changes that Margi spoke about, the retained earnings in our insurance companies, and\nthe slowing growth in our other business.\nI'll now turn to our outlook. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance, which is now expected to be\nin the range of $1.281 billion to $1.286 billion, representing 16% growth at the midpoint. We are narrowing\nthe range for subscription revenue, which is now expected to be between $856 million and $858 million.\nThe midpoint of the range is increasing and represents 20% growth year-over-year.\nWe are also increasing our adjusted operating income guidance to take into account our overperformance\nin the third quarter. Our total adjusted operating income for the full year is now expected to be between\n$114 million and $117 million. This raises the midpoint of the range, representing 38% year-over-year\ngrowth.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, total revenues are expected to be in the range of $333 million to $338 million,\nrepresenting 13% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Subscription revenue is expected to be in the\nrange of $227 million to $229 million, or 19% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.\nTotal adjusted operating income is expected to be in the range of $35 million to $38 million. We continue\nto target a 15% subscription adjusted operating margin for Q4. As a reminder, our revenue projections are\nsubject to conversion rate movements predominantly between the U.S. and Canadian currencies. For the\nfourth quarter of 2024, we used a 74% conversion rate in our projections, which was the approximate rate\nat the end of September.\nWith that, I'll hand it back to Margi.\nMargi Tooth\nThank you, Fawwad.\nBefore we move to questions, we'd like to thank the investors and analysts that made the trip over to Seattle\nto join us at our Investor Day in September. It was a valuable opportunity for us to hear about the key risks\nand questions that are top of mind for investors. We hope you found the occasion to hear from our team\nequally valuable.\nWith that, we'll open it up for questions.\nOperator\n6\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, you may press star,\nthen one on your telephone keypad. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before\npressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you'd like to withdraw your question,\nplease press star, then two. We do ask that you limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up. At this\ntime, we'll pause for just a moment to assemble our roster.\nToday's first question comes from Maria Ripps with Canaccord. Please go ahead.\nMaria Ripps\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking my questions. First, I know you're not providing 2025 guidance at this\npoint, but what are some key considerations as we think about adjusted operating income margin for next\nyear, given better-than-expected trends here in the near term? If inflation remains consistent or maybe even\ndecelerates a little bit from here, could we see subscription adjusted to our margin exceed your 15% target?\nFawwad Qureshi\nYes, this is Fawwad. I can take the question. Thanks for asking. Yes, a couple of things just in terms of the\nway we're thinking about 2025. Of course, we're going through the process of planning 2025 now. That'll\nend as we close out the year, and then we'll provide the formal guidance in our Q4 call. I think a couple of\nthings that we're looking at that are macro factors, of course, given that pricing has led, from a source of\nrevenue perspective, the majority of our revenue growth this year. Pricing and seeing the retention\nmaintained and stabilized, that's going to be an important factor.\nThen, obviously, from an expense management perspective, we've done a very good job. This quarter in\nparticular, we came in very close to what we had expected from a fixed and variable expense perspective.\nMaintaining the discipline around that are also going to be factors. Then, of course, those things that are\noutside of our control, the largest being inflation.\nMaria Ripps\nGot it. That's very helpful. Then a quick follow-up. As you continue to ramp your pet acquisition spend, what\nportion of the incremental spend should be allocated to onboarding more territory partners versus digital or\nany other channels? Then are there any channels or geographies that you're leaning into more aggressively\nthan you've done in the past?\nMargi Tooth\nYes. Hi, Maria. When we think about the increase in our pet acquisition dollars, we'll be really focused\nlargely on the conversion element of what we're doing. We've been generating some really nice lead volume\nfrom the vet channel and other channels that have worked within our ecosystem for some time. Territory\npartners, we have a very big group of territory partners. I think it's a record size that we have today. So, not\nlooking to expand that group of individuals. But we will be looking at deploying a lot more from a digital\nperspective and looking to help drive education in terms of why Trupanion, why insurance, and helping to\ninform people as they make that conscious decision.\nAny channels we're going to lean into differently to historical activity? Not really. We'll just incrementally\nstart pushing both from a lead perspective, a conversion point of view, and then looking at that first year as\nwell. Across the board, those pet acquisition dollars will start to build up in a number of different areas as\nwe look to expand that pet count.\nOperator\n7\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

Our next question today comes from John Barnidge with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nJohn Barnidge\nGood afternoon. Thank you for the opportunity. Could you maybe walk us through some of these capital\nrelief from NAIC changes in pet insurance? What are your expectations to that impact? You talked about\nfactors being changed for next year. Has the growth penalty been removed? Trying to understand that a bit\nbetter. Thank you.\nFawwad Qureshi\nYes, I can take that. Thanks for the question. A couple of things. We talked in our last quarter call about the\nNAIC factor changes and just the overall increase in our excess relative to the required levels. We began\nthe year $64 million overcapitalized relative to that requirement. We're now just shy of $140 million, $139.9\nmillion was the reported number. We've effectively doubled relative to the requirement. I spoke about it last\nquarter in terms of contributions. The NAIC factor change has been the most significant driver, along with\nthe decline in the growth rate of Pets Best. If you think about proportional contribution, the change in the\nrequirements, think of that as a little more than half. Then the remaining part, a little less than half, is the\nretained profits. As we continue to grow the business, per the requirements of our MGA agreement, we\ncontribute. It's a combination of those two.\nI think I can speak specifically to the factor changes to give a little bit of context on those. There are more\nimpactful changes related to, if you look at the specific guidelines, the risk lines, both 4 and Line 8. These\nare updates that don't occur every year. These were more infrequent. There are annual changes that\nhappen, and that's noted on Line 1. If you look at the disclosure and the specific documentation around it,\nthat hopefully gives you a little more illumination in terms of the change. It's the Line 4 and the Line 8\nchanges. Again, those don't happen regularly. Those are the biggest contributors to the reduction in the\nrequirement.\nJohn Barnidge\nThank you for that. Then my follow-up question, is there any update on the material weaknesses from\nearlier in the year? Are you able to size the remediation costs in the quarter for that? Thank you.\nFawwad Qureshi\nYes, there's a couple things I can say about that, now that we've progressed through the year. As a reminder\nto everyone, as part of the 2023 annual audit, we did have a finding of two material weaknesses. Auditors\nprovide two opinions. They provide one on controls and one on financials. In our case, the issues were on\nthe control side. As we've spoken about, we've taken this extremely seriously. It's remained a top priority\nthroughout the year. You see the increase in fixed expense, both year-over-year, and looking back over the\nlast two quarters. That's been investments we've made to enhance our controls regimen and obviously\nproceed with the remediation process. We brought PwC in also to help advise.\nWhen you think about this process we're going through, there are really three phases. The first is you define\nthe scope. You try to determine what systems are in scope and what systems are out of scope. The second\nis to actually design those controls. Then the third, which is the phase we're in right now, is to operate those\ncontrols. Depending on the type of control, they have to be in place for a period of time. In some cases,\nthey have to operate successfully for months. In some cases, they're quarterly controls. We're in that third\nphase. I would say our scoping and design phases. Those are largely complete. We expect to receive EUI's\naudit opinion sometime in February, commensurate with the filing of our 10-K.\n8\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

I've spoken about it before. I think it's important to emphasize\nthat we look at this not just as an investment in the remediation of these issues, but actually an investment\nin building an infrastructure of controls that will position the Company to be able to grow what we hope is\nthe next billion of revenue. On an ongoing basis, this is going to be something that we're going to maintain.\nFixed expenses have been elevated as a result of that. I think one of the things that is good about or\nremarkable about the model P&L is, because we set budgets as a percent of revenue, fixed expense at\n5%, it gives us an opportunity to grow into that expense base. We'll be looking to do that over the coming\nyear.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question today comes from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Vazquez\nHi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on maybe the 2025 question, but I'll ask\nit a little bit differently, given now that a lot of some of your important operating metrics are stabilized, some\nof them improving, like profitability. You can start to turn the wheels back on on the growth algorithm here.\nThe question being, can you talk to us a little bit more about the sequential cadence of when you start to\nspend some of that money, where do we see it in the P&L, and how long does it take to start seeing some\nof that impacting the P&L over the coming quarters and into ‘25?\nMargi Tooth\nYes. Hi, Brandon. Thanks for the question. We're excited this past quarter. It's the first quarter in six we've\nbeen able to increase our pet acquisition spend as the margin has bounced back out from compression,\nand really pleased to be in a position now to start accelerating that pet count. To your point, what we would\nexpect to see is a little bit of time for that incremental PAC investment to start to drive the market, both from\nan education perspective but also not forgetting the overall lead generation and the first-year retention.\nWe turned down our spend, if we look back at historical performance, we turned down our spend for the\nfirst time in Q1 of 2023. It took us four quarters before that spend really started to lose its efficacy in the\nmarket. We would expect to see a similar build back up again in terms of the delay from the initial PAC\nspend and then helping to really move the funnel. I'd expect in time to see that pet count start to build nicely\nas we have more investment in the market.\nThe great news is we have the tailwind of the ARPU today. We have the loss ratio right where it needs to\nbe in terms of that 71%. We're now moving into a period where those adjusted operating income dollars\nare greater. It allows us to deploy more to invest. We will do so very diligently as we've addressed before\nwithin our guardrails and with our 2.5% free cash flow target of revenue as well. Overall, I think it's going to\ntake us a little bit of time but I'd fully expect higher pet count in 2025 as we increase those dollars over time.\nBrandon Vazquez\nOkay. Great, thank you. Then maybe as my follow-up. Margi, you had made a comment about I think it was\nthe month of July was trending a little bit lower or more favorable to you guys in terms of that inflation. I'm\njust curious if you could talk a little bit about what are you seeing in end markets right now? It's an interesting\ncomment that things were a little lower and then they rebounded. Also, just a follow-up on that, did that\nimpact the P&L for either a good guy or a bad guy in the quarter that we should just keep in mind? Thank\nyou.\n9\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

In July, as I did mention, you're right, Brandon, we did see a different cadence in terms of our\ninvoices, our cost of care. That didn't maintain at a lower level for August and September which netted out\nbeing slightly lower than our 15% for the full quarter. We haven't seen enough data to suggest that we\nshould be adjusting our assumption when it comes to inflation and so we're still seeing a 15% as we cruise\ninto Q4. Largely anticipate that's because of the problem that Trupanion's product solves, that people are\ngoing into pet hospitals and they're not waiting for their pet to be seen, so it's what we would expect and\nwhat the audience were working with.\nI think in terms of the impact in the P&L's quarter, that naturally leads into the loss ratio. We hit that 71%.\nThat was ahead of expectations which is good, and we would expect as we go into the back half of the year\nwe've got some nice ARPU flow through. We've seen, as we said we would, that buildup of the ARPU\ngrowth at record levels so given that that's still flowing through into Q4 then we feel very good about the\nrest of this quarter.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question today comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJosh Shanker\nThank you for taking my call. Good afternoon to everyone. I want to talk about retention a little bit and\nsometimes you give us some detail about retention by cohort. I'm wondering if the percentage of Trupanion\ncustomers who are receiving a 20% or greater increase has gone up from where it went a year ago? And,\nif you can talk to your projections about when you think the retention should bottom and begin to go the\nother way.\nMargi Tooth\nYes. Hi, Josh. Ultimately, we're quite pleased with retention performance, and to your point we have always\nlooked to the cohorts for attention in three different buckets to really help us articulate the message at that\npoint in time for our member. With such a high rate flow coming through, frankly, at unprecedented levels,\nwe would have expected a shift down and we have seen that for sure. Through the course of these rate\nincreases though, just to put it in perspective, we've added around $10 million in revenue from those rates\nthat we've gained back over the past four quarters which has offset the $2 million or so that we would\notherwise have retained had we not pushed those rates through. But ultimately as a cost plus model we\nneed to make sure we're pricing appropriately.\nI think in terms of the number of people in that bucket, there's around 50% of our members that have had\na 20% plus increase. To put that into perspective for you, in 2022 that number was 7.6% of our book. A\nmassive shift in people getting that higher rate increase and for many of them it's been a compounding\nincrease. I would say as we look towards the tail end of this quarter and into Q1 of 2025, that number in\nthat upper bucket is starting to reduce which would give me confidence that as we move back into what is\nmore of a traditional renewal cycle of under 20% increase, we would see our retention rate improve with\nthat. We've been through a lot over the last couple of years. The members have stuck with us. I think it's\ntestament to the value that we create for them when we provide them. As the average size increase drops\nto 15% versus 25%, I'd expect retention to improve with it.\nJosh Shanker\n10\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

That's very good clarifying. Appreciate it as well.\nMargi Tooth\nThank you.\nOperator\nOur next question today comes from Jon Block at Stiefel. Please go ahead.\nJon Block\nGreat, thanks guys. Good afternoon. Maybe I'll start. I think it was the other North American products had\n6,400 gross ads and in the slides it still shows not at scale yet. Margi, maybe you can just help me. What's\nthe variable to help you with the returns? I think the retention rate there is 95% and change. That's got to\nget to 97%, 98%. The PACS 158. Does that need to go down to 125 or 130? What's the key there to help\nyou get those suite of products off the returns and into the 30% to 40% IRR guardrails? If you're willing to\ntell us the timing behind obtaining it, that would be great and then I'll have a follow-up.\nMargi Tooth\nYes, sure. Hi, Jon. When we think about the other North American subscription products, you hit the nail\non the head. First of all, we've got to make sure that we've got the retention rate. We deliberately kept\nanchoring back that PAC investment so we could actually see how good is that member experience. It's\nobviously very different for all of those different products than the core Trupanion product. Really learning\nhow to build on a retention rate that doesn't lean into the vet channel and necessarily high use of that\nproduct.\nSimilarly, as we look at pet acquisition, each of them are different channels, different distribution outlets for\nus. Leaning into how do we acquire those pets efficiently? How do we do what many of our competitors do\nin the direct consumer space efficiently? We’re still learning how to do it. I will tell you though, as we've\nseen margin compression, we've really pulled back our spend in those areas, as you can see. Much less\nspend in Q3 than we had say a year ago in these products as we're really looking at taking the margin that\nwe have and reinvesting it where we get the highest rates of return, which today is in our core Trupanion\nproducts.\nTaking a little bit longer because of the margin compression to really pull those levers from a growth\nperspective with the other products. That being said, it gives us options and choices and we're making\nsome nice progress, but I don't anticipate seeing them ramp up in the next quarter or two as we really get\nto grips with the core Trupanion growth instead.\nJon Block\n11\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

That was very helpful. Thank you. Then just maybe the second question. For the quarter, it just\ndepends on how you look at gross ads, but I've got your gross ads down modestly and that was down off\na mid-single-digit comp. I think it's one of the first times you were down off a negative comp and I get it.\nYou guys have been somewhat more passive and you wanted to wait until the pricing was back before\nhitting the gas, but now the MLR is back, right? It's intact. How do you think you fared versus market maybe\nover the past, I don't know, six to 12 months?\nMore importantly, the question I get is why would it take 12 months for you to ramp back up? It seems like\nyou're buying yourself a little bit of time and saying, hey, don't expect a whole lot until, I don't know, I mean,\nare you even insinuating late ‘25? You've got the MLR back at 71, your capital requirements are not under\nduress. Why would it take almost a year until we start to see that really work its way through the gross ad\nnumber? Thank you.\nMargi Tooth\nYes, so this is the first quarter we've seen our pet acquisition spend grow after six quarters of it being flat\nor down, frankly, year-over-year. It's the first time we've really pushed more aggressively into pet\nacceleration. I will say that typically as a team that has historically been focused on growth, when you pivot\nthat team from being in a pretty much a defensive position to an offensive position, you're going to start to\nsee some changes in how they deploy incremental pack dollars. I'll tell you that execution is, as always, a\nchallenge for any business. I think when you're growing quickly, making sure we're leaning into how do you\ntake those incremental pack dollars and invest them wisely, invest them in the right areas at the right time.\nThis is the first quarter, I'm really pleased that we're in a position now to take that as a tailwind and start to\npush in with more adjusted operating income spend.\nTo your point, we have a lot of runway ahead of us with both our capital and the adjusted operating income\nthat we're generating. We will start to be more aggressive. I don't know if it will take a full year, but the\nexample I gave a little earlier is when we think about how long it took for that PAC spend to really decelerate,\nthere is an expectation it will take a little bit of time for it to accelerate as we put the foot on the gas there.\nWe're definitely deploying more. We'll continue to be more aggressive with that PAC spend.\nThe first quarter in, we were being incredibly measured with how we were deploying and where we were\ndeploying, making sure we can understand what the impact of those incremental dollars are. As we go into\nthe rest of this year and into 2025, we expect that number to get bigger in terms of acquisition spend\nbecause we can. With that, I anticipate the pack count to come.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question today comes from Katie Sakys with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nKatie Sakys\nHi. Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to circle back first to the timing on growth, and maybe I'll ask it a\nlittle bit differently. I think at the September Investor Day, Margi, you had mentioned expectations to see\nthe total pets enrolled number hit an inflection point at the beginning of 2025 and begin to grow again. I'm\njust curious, it sounds like maybe that's not exactly the expectation anymore. What has changed in the last\nmonth and a half, two months to shift your view there?\nMargi Tooth\n12\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription. There may be material errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in the\nreporting of the substance of the conference call. This transcript is being made available for information purposes only.\n1-888-562-0262 1-604-929-1352 www.viavid.com\nTrupanion, Inc. – Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call, October 30, 2024\nI wouldn't say the view has shifted, and perhaps it's characterization of the September meeting. But\ndefinitely for us, we're learning how to redeploy some of the pet spend. Just to kind of put that into more\ncontext, when we think about what the team has been doing for the last 18 months, they've been adding\npets, but not at the pace that Trupanion is typically used to adding pets. They've gone into quite a defensive\nmode in terms of how they're operating, how they're thinking about content, and how they're deploying PAC\ndollars. Typically, we would have a combination of investment across the whole gamut of tactics and\ninitiatives across the marketing suite of things. Whether that's display, advertising, whether it's above the\nline, whether it's in-person events, you name it, we did it.\nAs we pulled all of that back, it takes a while to build that brand back up in the market. What we're learning\nis the efficacy of the brand in 2023, as we started to peel back and pare down that PAC spend, it took a\nlong time for that really to wear down, which is great. That's also off the back of 36 consecutive quarters of\nincreased pet acquisition spend. When you turn that back off, I'm anticipating it will take some time to build\nback up. We're going to do it in a measured way, and Q3 was the first quarter we were able to be a little\nmore aggressive with our spending. We hit that 36% IRR. I think the team did a very good job of managing\nthat. As we see the margin continue and get those results for Q3, we're very happy with that 71%. That's\nbeen a lot of hard work, and that AOI increase is huge for us. It gives us a tailwind to be a little bit more\nboisterous, if you will, with our pet acquisition spend in Q4 and also, frankly, in 2025.\nIt's not going to happen overnight because we're always deploying within those guardrails, and that is not\neasy. Growth at this level is not something that you can just flick a switch and get turned on, but definitely\nfrom a brand building point of view, I'd expect to see the compounding effect of that increased investment\npayoff into 2025.\nKatie Sakys\nOkay, fair enough. Then maybe touching on ARPU, congrats to you guys. It's definitely ticked up quite a bit\nthis quarter. That 13%, is that something that we can expect to continue to see going into 2025 as we put\nnumbers into our models?\nFawwad Qureshi\nYes, I think a couple things I could say on that. As I stated earlier, of course, pricing has played the biggest\nrole in terms of sources of revenue this year, and some of that pricing is going to continue through next\nyear. I think our expectation is ARPU accelerates in Q4, and based on the trends and the expectations\nwe've seen from a forecasting standpoint, so I think you'll see more contribution from ARPU. I think, again,\nnot to talk about 2025 in detail, but our expectation would be that both pricing and pet count would be\ncontributors, and I feel good that you'll get the tailwind from pricing increases continuing to go through,\nprovided that we can continue to be disciplined about retention. Then there's the potential, as Margi talked\nabout, of re-accelerating investment and growth, and we feel good from a financial and overall capitalization\nstandpoint that we have the ability, we have the financial wherewithal to do that. That's what we're thinking\nabout.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question today comes from Wilma Burdis with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nWilma Burdis\nHey, good afternoon, everyone. Were there any one-time benefits in the loss ratio in the quarter in\nsubscription?\n13\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

Hi, Wilma. In Q3, yes, we did see a one-time benefit of about $500,000, so think of it as 20 basis points\nof improvement. Just so you have the comparison, so in Q2, I talked about a $2.1 million benefit, and that\nwas about 100 basis points of improvement.\nWilma Burdis\nOkay. Thank you. Then could you just talk a little bit about this core subscription loss ratio came down or\nimproved quite a bit quarter-over-quarter, and then the other business moved the opposite direction. I\nunderstand the other business is a flat margin, but maybe just talk to us a little bit about the pieces there.\nThanks.\nFawwad Qureshi\nSure. Obviously, I'll start with the subscription. Obviously, we've been pleased with the performance in the\nquarter. We're happy to have achieved a 71% quarter early. I think as we talked about, the overall\nperformance is seems largely tied to performance in July. We saw lower overall frequency, and then that\ntrend abated somewhat as we went through the quarter, so that was the biggest factor in terms of\nimprovement.\nI think the other piece that we haven't talked about is continuing to drive claims expense processing down.\nThis is something actually the Company has been working on over the last couple of years and just driving\nefficiency there, so that's been a bright spot as well. Part of that is the benefit of technology, so having\ncompleted or largely completed the transition to the Vision Claims platform, that's been a contributor to\nhigher productivity.\nShifting to the other business, so the loss ratio did increase. It was 71.2% last quarter. It went up again to\n76.1%. Pets Best, similar to what we've experienced, is seeing inflation and putting pricing through. In this\ncase, we had a favorable reserve development in Q2, similar to what I talked about in the subscription\nbusiness. Of course, for us, as you recall, any changes to loss ratio, including any impacts to reserving,\nthey don't influence the margin we earn on the business because, of course, the agreement is loss sensitive.\nIf loss ratio improves, as it did last quarter, they participate in the upside. If loss ratio worsens, they\nexperience the downside.\nFrom an AOI standpoint, I spoke in Q1 when AOM was about 1.6%, that we would largely be in that range\ngoing forward. We're 1.6% in Q1. We were 1.7% last quarter. We were again 1.7% this quarter.\nOperator\nThank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session and today's conference call. We thank\nyou all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a wonderful evening.\n14\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

And thanks to Trupanion, shelter organizations and pet parents nationwide, this loveable 18-week-old Pomsky now has a new home. Bass was adopted during Trupanion’s Tricked Out for Treats Pet-tacular.\n\n“I’m overjoyed we were able to help Bass find a new home. The bond between people and their pets is such a special one. At Trupanion, our mission is to protect that bond by supporting pet parents and ensuring the health of their pets. It was wildly entertaining to see all the pets and pet parents in their costumes but more than anything else, the Tricked Out for Treats contest really reinforced why Trupanion’s mission is so important,” said Margi Tooth, CEO and President of Trupanion.\n\nMore than 77,000 people, 2,000 pets and 120 shelters and rescue organizations participated in the Tricked Out for Treats Pet-tacular. Participants were able to submit pictures of their pets in Halloween costumes, compete for prizes and vote for pets in eight different categories.\n\n**About Tricked out for Treats Pet-tacular**\n\nTrupanion’s Tricked out for Treats Pet-tacular ran throughout October. Pet parents, shelters and rescue organizations were able to enter cats and dogs into eight different categories. Including “Solo Stunner” for pet close ups, “Clinic Charmer” spotlighting pets and veterinary team members, and “Adorable Adoptable” for pets up for adoption.\n\nBass was entered into the “Adorable Adoptable” category by Tiny N Tall Rescue Inc. in St. Charles, Illinois.\n\n“When we saw the Tricked Out for Treats Pet-tacular contest we knew we had to participate. Finding new avenues for public exposure for our adoptable pets is hard, so finding one that was fun and cute looked like such a great opportunity. We’re so glad Bass has found a forever home,” said the volunteers of Tiny N Tall Rescue Inc.\n\nPets entered into the Tricked Out for Treats Pet-tacular contest were highlighted during a livestream event on October 30.\n\nThe livestream is available to watch on YouTube at the link below.\n\n[Trupanion’s Tricked Out for Treats Pet-tacular | 2024 Pet Costume Contest](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=WQ35i4Vb2arMVJLNUgYpofNWQbgwyU7wnRQRi_OISALfyxTtnwJJZJZp_MRv-acqB8irldwDQLBgBB_tl5cGFEYl07a32VJpAD9kC0qnwZ6z6p3f5VeKPkFulcU3JwPiJikz1ujd5Vh_eGC_GySyzTOohQSnY64VJmnyHTtHdyPrp21wp-cjr7JYbK0QULHsLz0zSDB4X0n3RjiphyT5vg==)\n\n**Tricked Out for Treats Category Winners**\n\nWinners (Picks of the Patch) are listed by category, name and location.\n\n  * Adorable Adoptable: Bryce – Boerne, TX\n  * Clinic Charmers: Figaro – Bel Air, MD\n  * Kitty Korner: Poco Taz, Dearborn, MI\n  * Me and My Human: Teddy – Ottawa, ON\n  * Pick of the Litter: Twix – Beverly Hills, CA\n  * Senior Sweeties: Ash – Egg Harbor Township, NJ\n  * Solo Stunners: Teeling – Ottawa, ON\n  * Squad Goals: Littlefoot, Maverick, Chomper and Phoenix – Saginaw, MI\n\n\n\nA photo gallery of the winners and all the animals entered into the Tricked Out for Treats Pet-tacular is available at the link below\n\n[Vote for the Top Pet Costume! - Tricked Out for Treats](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_6aG9suO8tRs9F8SChIe3jmHvicV6Z8UKl-xKiQmScH6QdDU92O6chZwmbRvDWiz8lhQBuif3tg22IqtI_kKfQngehdmtPWPNgrMqt9AIAQImaucurvU342wYDxiO9bLMyVUfv7G8kvKUYvXGsumNK1qdP6VL2sacoq-frMGrPM=)\n\nBass\n\n![Trupanion and Tiny N Tall Rescue Inc.](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/47debaa5-3601-45e1-bec4-ba47cea5e851/image.jpg)\n\nBass is an 18-week-old Pomsky who loves kids and is learning to sit.\n\n**About Trupanion**\n\nTrupanion is a leader in medical insurance for cats and dogs throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, Puerto Rico and Australia with over 1,000,000 pets enrolled.

Trupanion urges its investors to review the reconciliation of its\nnon-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in its consolidated financial\nstatements, and not to rely on any single financial or operating measure to evaluate its business. These reconciliations\nare included below and on Trupanion’s Investor Relations website.\n3\nBecause of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments\nthat can impact a company’s non-cash expenses, Trupanion believes that providing various non-GAAP financial\nmeasures that exclude stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization expense allows for more\nmeaningful comparisons between its operating results from period to period. Trupanion offsets new pet acquisition\nexpense with sign-up fee revenue in the calculation of net acquisition cost because it collects sign-up fee revenue from\nnew members at the time of enrollment and considers it to be an offset to a portion of Trupanion’s new pet acquisition\nexpense. Trupanion believes this allows it to calculate and present financial measures in a consistent manner across\nperiods. Trupanion’s management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures and the related financial measures\nderived from them are important tools for financial and operational decision-making and for evaluating operating\nresults over different periods of time.\n4\nTrupanion, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(in thousands, except share data)\nThree Months Ended September 30,

Non-cash\nitems, such as stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization, are also excluded. Acquisition cost, development\nexpenses, gain (loss) from investment in joint venture, stock-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization are expected\nto remain recurring expenses for the foreseeable future, but are excluded from this metric to measure scale in other areas of the\nbusiness. Management believes acquisition costs primarily represent the cost to acquire new subscribers and are driven by the amount of\ngrowth we choose to pursue based primarily on the amount of our adjusted operating income period over period. Accordingly, this measure\nis not indicative of our core operating income performance. We also exclude development expenses, gain (loss) from investment in joint\nventure, stock-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization because some investors may not view those items as\nreflective of our core operating income performance.\nManagement uses adjusted operating income and the margin on adjusted operating income to understand the effects of scale in its non-\nacquisition cost and development expenses and to plan future advertising expenditures, which are designed to acquire new pets. Management\nuses this measure as a principal way of understanding the operating performance of its business exclusive of acquisition cost and new product\nexploration and development initiatives. Management believes disclosure of this metric provides investors with the same data that the Company\nemploys in assessing its overall operations and that disclosure of this measure may provide useful information regarding the efficiency of our\nutilization of revenues, return on advertising dollars in the form of new subscribers and future use of available cash to support the continued\ngrowth of our business.\n12\nThe following tables reflect the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nNet loss $ (11,289) $ (42,530)\nExcluding:\nStock-based compensation\nexpense\n23,906 25,228\nDepreciation and amortization\nexpense\n12,542 9,445\nInterest income (9,412) (6,169)\nInterest expense 11,071 8,380\nOther non-operating expenses — —\nIncome tax benefit (43) (472)\nNon-recurring transaction or\nrestructuring expenses\n— 4,175\n(Gain) loss from equity method\ninvestment\n(33) (110)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 26,742 $ (2,053)\nThree Months Ended\nSep. 30, Jun. 30, Mar. 31, Dec. 31, Sep. 30, Jun. 30, Mar. 31, Dec. 31,\n2024 2024 2024 2023 2023 2023 2023 2022\nNet income (loss) $ 1,425 $ (5,862) $ (6,852) $ (2,163) $ (4,036) $ (13,714) $ (24,780) $ (9,285)\nExcluding:\nStock-based compensation\nexpense\n8,127 8,381 7,398 6,636 6,585 6,503 12,140 8,412\nDepreciation and amortization\nexpense\n4,381 4,376 3,785 3,029 2,990 3,253 3,202 2,897\nInterest income (3,232) (3,135) (3,045) (2,842) (2,389) (2,051) (1,729) (1,614)\nInterest expense 3,820 3,655 3,596 3,697 3,053 2,940 2,387 1,587\nOther non-operating expenses — — — — — —\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 39 (44) (38) 130 (43) (238) (191) (15)\nNon-recurring transaction or\nrestructuring expenses\n— — 8 65 4,102 193\n(Gain) loss from equity method\ninvestment\n(33) — (110) — — —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 14,527 $ 7,371 $ 4,844 $ 8,487 $ 6,058 $ (3,242) $ (4,869) $ 2,175\n13\nContacts:\nInvestors:\nLaura Bainbridge, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications\nGil Melchior, Director, Investor Relations\nInvestor.Relations@trupanion.com\n14"
