(Nasdaq:LYFT) today announced financial results for the third\nquarter ended September 30, 2024.\n“Our team delivered one of the strongest quarters in Lyft history, following the many new innovations we’ve\nbrought to drivers and riders so far this year,\" said CEO David Risher. “Going forward, our work with best-of-breed\npartners and the autonomous future we’re building will give people even more reasons to choose Lyft every time.”\n“Operational excellence underpins the health of our marketplace and remains a long-term driver of our business,”\nsaid CFO Erin Brewer. “In Q3, we delivered across the board with both driver hours and Active Riders reaching all-\ntime highs, surpassing the prior quarter records.”\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\n• Gross Bookings of $4.1 billion was up 16% year-over-year.\n• Revenue of $1.5 billion was up 32% year-over-year.\n• Net loss of $(12.4) million, which includes a restructuring charge of $36.4 million taken during the quarter,\ncompared to $(12.1) million in Q3’23.\n• Net loss as a percentage of Gross Bookings was (0.3)%, which was flat year-over-year.\n• Adjusted EBITDA of $107.3 million compared to $92.0 million in Q3’23.\n◦ Adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of Gross Bookings was 2.6%, which was flat year-over-\nyear.\n• Net cash provided by operating activities of $264.0 million compared to $2.3 million in Q3’23.\n◦ For the trailing twelve months, net cash provided by operating activities was $739.9 million.\n• Free cash flow of $242.8 million compared to $(30.0) million in Q3’23.\n◦ For the trailing twelve months, free cash flow was $641.2 million.\nThird Quarter 2024 Operational Highlights\n• Record Active Riders of 24.4 million: up 9% year-over-year.\n• Record Rides of 217 million: up 16% year-over-year.\n• Autonomous partnerships: Lyft to join forces with Mobileye, May Mobility, and Nexar to connect riders to\nautonomous vehicles. Starting in 2025, riders in Atlanta will have the opportunity to be matched with an AV\nwhen hailing a ride on Lyft.\n• DoorDash x Lyft: signed a strategic partnership with the local delivery leader in the U.S., offering exclusive\nbenefits to riders that link their DashPass accounts. Millions of DashPass members in the U.S. now have\nanother reason to choose Lyft every time.\n• Further driver earnings improvements: drivers can count on their earnings being increased any time a\nride takes 5 minutes longer than estimated, or for dropping off a rider that takes them out of their way\nwithout a ride back. Drivers also now see the estimated dollar per hour rate upfront for each ride.\nFourth Quarter 2024 Outlook\n• Gross Bookings of approximately $4.28 billion to $4.35 billion, up 15% to 17% year-over-year\n• Adjusted EBITDA of $100 million to $105 million and an Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a\npercentage of Gross Bookings) of approximately 2.3% to 2.4%.\nUpdated FY’24 Outlook\n• Rides growth in the mid-teens year-over-year.\n• Gross Bookings to grow approximately 17% year-over-year.\n• Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) of approximately 2.3%, up from\nthe prior outlook of 2.1%.\n• Free cash flow to exceed $650 million.\nWe have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalent to our non-GAAP outlook or a GAAP reconciliation as a\nresult of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of reconciling items such as stock-based\ncompensation and income tax. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their\ncorresponding GAAP equivalent is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that\nthe reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical\nreconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this release. For more information regarding\nthe non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this earnings release, please see \"GAAP to non-GAAP\nReconciliations\" below.\nFinancial and Operational Results through the Third Quarter of 2024\nThree Months Ended\nSept. 30, 2024 Jun. 30, 2024 Sept. 30, 2023\n(in millions, except for percentages)\nActive Riders 24.4 23.7 22.4\nRides 216.7 205.3 187.4\nGross Bookings $ 4,108.4 $ 4,018.9 $ 3,554.1\nRevenue $ 1,522.7 $ 1,435.8 $ 1,157.6\nNet income (loss) $ (12.4) $ 5.0 $ (12.1)\nNet income (loss) as a percentage of Gross Bookings (0.3) % 0.1 % (0.3) %\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 264.0 $ 276.2 $ 2.3\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 107.3 $ 102.9 $ 92.0\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) 2.6 % 2.6 % 2.6 %\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) $ 118.1 $ 98.9 $ 92.3\nFree cash flow $ 242.8 $ 256.4 $ (30.0)\nNote: Information on our key metrics and non-GAAP financial measures is also available on our Investor Relations page.\nDefinitions of Key Metrics\nActive Riders\nThe number of Active Riders is a key indicator of the scale of our user community. Lyft defines Active Riders as all\nriders who take at least one ride during a quarter where the Lyft Platform processes the transaction. An Active\nRider is identified by a unique phone number. If a rider has two mobile phone numbers or changed their phone\nnumber and that rider took rides using both phone numbers during the quarter, that person would count as two\nActive Riders. If a rider has a personal and business profile tied to the same mobile phone number, that person\nwould be considered a single Active Rider. If a ride has been requested by an organization using our Concierge\noffering for the benefit of a rider, we exclude this rider in the calculation of Active Riders, unless the ride is\naccessible in that rider’s Lyft App.\nRides\nRides represent the level of usage of our multimodal platform. Lyft defines Rides as the total number of rides\nincluding rideshare and bike and scooter rides completed using our multimodal platform that contribute to our\nrevenue. These include any Rides taken through our Lyft App. If multiple riders take a private rideshare ride,\nincluding situations where one party picks up another party on the way to a destination, or splits the bill, we count\nthis as a single rideshare ride. Each unique segment of a Shared Ride is considered a single Ride. For example, if\ntwo riders successfully match in Shared Ride mode and both complete their Rides, we count this as two Rides. We\nhave largely shifted away from Shared Rides, and now only offer Shared Rides in limited markets. Lyft includes all\nRides taken by riders via our Concierge offering, even though such riders may be excluded from the definition of\nActive Riders unless the ride is accessible in that rider’s Lyft App.\nGross Bookings\nGross Bookings is a key indicator of the scale and impact of our overall platform. Lyft defines Gross Bookings as\nthe total dollar value of transactions invoiced to rideshare riders including any applicable taxes, tolls and fees\nexcluding tips to drivers. It also includes amounts invoiced for other offerings, including but not limited to: Express\nDrive vehicle rentals, bike and scooter rentals, and amounts recognized for subscriptions, bike and bike station\nhardware and software sales, media, sponsorships, partnerships, and licensing and data access agreements.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings)\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA\nfor a period by Gross Bookings for the same period. For the definition of Adjusted EBITDA, refer to “Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures”.\nWebcast\nLyft will host a webcast today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) to discuss these financial results\nand business highlights. To listen to a live audio webcast, please visit our Investor Relations page at https://\ninvestor.lyft.com/. The archived webcast will be available on our Investor Relations page shortly after the call.\nAbout Lyft\nWhether it’s an everyday commute or a journey that changes everything, Lyft is driven by our purpose: to serve and\nconnect. In 2012, Lyft was founded as one of the first ridesharing communities in the United States. Now, millions of\ndrivers have chosen to earn on billions of rides. Lyft offers rideshare, bikes, and scooters all in one app — for a\nmore connected world, with transportation for everyone.\nAvailable Information\nLyft announces material information to the public about Lyft, its products and services and other matters through a\nvariety of means, including filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, public conference\ncalls, webcasts, the investor relations section of its website (investor.lyft.com), its X accounts (@lyft and\n@davidrisher), its Chief Executive Officer’s LinkedIn account (linkedin.com/in/jdavidrisher) and its blogs (including:\nlyft.com/blog, lyft.com/hub, and eng.lyft.com) in order to achieve broad, non-exclusionary distribution of information\nto the public and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of\n1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking\nstatements generally relate to future events or Lyft's future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you\ncan identify forward looking statements because they contain words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"expects,\"\n\"plans,\" \"anticipates,” “going to,” \"could,\" \"intends,\" \"target,\" \"projects,\" \"contemplates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\"\n\"predicts,\" \"potential\" or \"continue\" or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that\nconcern Lyft's expectations, strategy, priorities, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this release\ninclude, but are not limited to, Lyft’s guidance and outlook, including for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024,\nand the trends and assumptions underlying such guidance and outlook, and Lyft’s plans and expectations,\nincluding statements about autonomous partnerships and our strategic partnership with DoorDash and the benefits\nsuch partnerships will provide. Lyft’s expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and\nactual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from those projected, including risks related to the macroeconomic environment and risks regarding our\nability to forecast our performance due to our limited operating history and the macroeconomic environment and\nthe risk that our partnerships may not materialize as expected. The forward-looking statements contained in this\nrelease are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in Lyft's filings with\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter\nended June 30, 2024 that was filed with the SEC on August 7, 2024 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the\nquarter ended September 30, 2024 that will be filed with the SEC by November 12, 2024. The forward-looking\nstatements in this release are based on information available to Lyft as of the date hereof, and Lyft disclaims any\nobligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. This press release discusses\n\"customers.\" For rideshare, there are two customers in every car - the driver is Lyft's customer, and the rider is the\ndriver's customer. We care about both.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement Lyft's financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles\nin the United States of America, or GAAP, Lyft considers certain financial measures that are not prepared in\naccordance with GAAP, including Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin\n(calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) and free cash flow. Lyft defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income\n(loss) adjusted for interest expense, other income (expense), net, provision for (benefit from) income taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, payroll tax expense related to stock-based\ncompensation and sublease income, as well as, if applicable, restructuring charges, costs related to acquisitions\nand divestitures and costs from transactions related to certain legacy auto insurance liabilities. Adjusted EBITDA\nmargin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by\nGross Bookings for the same period and is considered a key metric. Lyft defines Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as net\nincome (loss) adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense (net of any\nbenefit), and payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation, as well as, if applicable, restructuring\ncharges and transaction costs related to certain legacy auto insurance liabilities and cost related to acquisitions\nand divestitures. Lyft defines free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less\npurchases of property and equipment and scooter fleet.\nLyft subleases certain office space and earns sublease income. Sublease income is included within other income,\nnet on the condensed consolidated statement of operations, while the related lease expense is included within\noperating expenses and loss from operations. Lyft believes the adjustment to include sublease income in Adjusted\nEBITDA is useful to investors by enabling them to better assess Lyft’s operating performance, including the benefits\nof recent transactions, by presenting sublease income as a contra-expense to the related lease charges that are\npart of operating expenses.\nIn November 2022, April 2023 and September 2024, Lyft committed to plans of termination as part of efforts to\nreduce operating expenses. Lyft believes the costs associated with these restructuring efforts do not reflect\nperformance of Lyft’s ongoing operations. Lyft believes the adjustment to exclude the costs related to restructuring\nfrom Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is useful to investors by enabling them to better assess\nLyft’s ongoing operating performance and provide for better comparability with Lyft’s historically disclosed\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) amounts.\nLyft uses its non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of\nour performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the\neffectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial\nperformance. Free cash flow is a measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our operating\nperformance and trends. We believe free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides our management\nwith information about our ability to generate or use cash to enhance the strength of our balance sheet, further\ninvest in our business and pursue potential strategic initiatives. Free cash flow has certain limitations, including that\nit does not reflect our future contractual commitments and it does not represent the total increase or decrease in\nour cash balance for a given period. Free cash flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary\nuse and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs.\nLyft’s definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be\nlimited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Furthermore, these measures have\ncertain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated\nstatement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be\nconsidered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nContacts\nAurélien Nolf, Investor

          "content": "November 6, 2024\nQ3 Fiscal\n2024 Earnings\nSupplemental Data\nThis presentation and the accompanying oral presentation contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of\n1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or\nForward Lyft's future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward looking statements because they contain words such as \"may,\"\n\"will,\" \"should,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,” “going to,” \"could,\" \"intends,\" \"target,\" \"projects,\" \"contemplates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential\" or\n\"continue\" or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern Lyft's expectations, strategy, priorities, plans or intentions.\nLooking Forward-looking statements in this presentation and the accompanying oral presentation include, but are not limited to, statements regarding Lyft’s future\nfinancial and operating performance, including its outlook for the fourth quarter of 2024 and fiscal year 2024, demand for Lyft’s products and services and\nthe markets in which Lyft operates, including seasonality trends, expected partnership-driven growth, expected trends in insurance costs and impact on\nStatements Lyft’s business, the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business, results of operations, and the markets in which we operate, expansion of our\noperations in Canada, statements regarding autonomous partnerships and our strategic partnership with DoorDash, rider and driver activity, including driver\nsupply, and levels of rideshare and bike and scooter rides on the Lyft platform and future incentive levels, and litigation and regulatory matters. Lyft’s\nexpectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties that could\n& Non-GAAP\ncause actual results to differ materially from those projected, including the macroeconomic environment, including inflation, and the impact of these\nfactors and other market factors on operating expenses, including insurance costs, the sufficiency of Lyft’s unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and\nshort-term investments, as well as risks associated with the outcome of litigation and regulatory matters. The forward-looking statements contained in this\nFinancial\npresentation are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in Lyft's filings with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”), including in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the\nquarter ended September 30, 2024 that will be filed with the SEC. The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on information available to\nMeasures Lyft as of the date of this presentation, and Lyft disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. This\npresentation and the accompanying oral presentation discuss \"customers.\" For rideshare, there are two customers in every car - the driver is Lyft's\ncustomer, and the rider is the driver's customer. We care about both.\nIn addition to financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), this presentation and the\naccompanying oral presentation include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of\nGross Bookings, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per share, non-GAAP operating expenses, and free cash flow. These non-GAAP\nmeasures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in\naccordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for\nanalysis of other GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included at the end of\nthis presentation. We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures presented in the\naccompanying oral presentation, or a GAAP reconciliation, as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as\nstock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not\navailable without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future\nGAAP results.\nGross profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenue. Gross margin is defined as gross profit divided by revenue for the same period.\nThis presentation and the accompanying oral presentation also contain statistical data, estimates and forecasts that are based on independent industry\npublications or other publicly available information, as well as other information based on our internal sources. This information involves many assumptions\nand limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such information. We have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of\nthe information contained in the industry publications and other publicly available information. Accordingly, we make no representations as to the accuracy\nor completeness of that information nor do we undertake to update such information after the date of this presentation. 2\nResults &\nGuidance\n3\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nAnother Strong Quarter\nQ3’24\nGross Rides: Active Riders: Adjusted\nBookings: 217 million, 24.4 million, EBITDA\n$4.1 billion, +16% YoY and +9% YoY and an margin\n+16% YoY an all-time all-time high (% of Gross\nhigh Bookings):\n2.6%\n4\nGross Bookings\n(in millions)\n$4,108\n$4,019\n$3,724 $3,693\n$3,554\n$3,446\n$3,051\nQ3’24 Gross\nBookings:\n$4.1 billion,\n+16% YoY\n$1,523\n$1,436\n$1,158 $1,225 $1,277\n$1,001 $1,021\nQ1‘23 Q2‘23 Q3‘23 Q4‘23 Q1‘24 Q2‘24 Q3‘24\nGross Bookings Revenue\n55\nRides\n(in millions)\n216.7\n205.3\n190.8\n187.4 187.7\n177.9\nQ3’24 Rides:\n153.0\n217 million,\n++1100%% ++1177%% ++2200%% +26% +23% +15% +16% +16% YoY and an\nYYooYY YYooYY YYooYY YoY YoY YoY YoY\nall-time high\nQ1‘23 Q2‘23 Q3‘23 Q4‘23 Q1‘24 Q2‘24 Q3‘24\n66\nActive Riders\n(in millions)\n24.4\n23.7\n22.4 22.4\n21.9 Q3’24\n21.5\n19.6\nActive Riders:\n24.4 million,\n+10% +8% +10% +10% +12% +10% +9%\nYoY YoY YoY YoY YoY YoY YoY\n+9% YoY and an\nall-time high\nQ1‘23 Q2‘23 Q3‘23 Q4‘23 Q1‘24 Q2‘24 Q3‘24\n77\nAdj.

Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can\nidentify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,”\n“contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our\nexpectations, strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include statements about:\n• our future financial performance, including our expectations regarding our revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, capital expenditures, our\nability to determine insurance, legal and other reserves and our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive free cash flows;\n• our restructuring actions, including the costs of such actions and the impact of such actions on our business and financial performance;\n• the sufficiency of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our liquidity needs;\n• the demand for our platform or for Transportation-as-a-Service networks in general;\n• our ability to attract and retain drivers and riders;\n• our ability to develop new offerings and bring them to market in a timely manner and make enhancements to our platform;\n• our ability to compete with existing and new competitors in existing and new markets and offerings;\n• our prices and pricing methodologies and our expectations for the impact of pricing on our competitive position and our financial results;\n• our expectations regarding outstanding and potential litigation, including with respect to the classification of drivers on our platform;\n• our expectations regarding the effects of existing and developing laws and regulations, including with respect to the classification of drivers on our\nplatform, taxation, privacy and data protection;\n• our ability to manage and insure risks associated with our Transportation-as-a-Service network, including auto-related and operations-related risks,\nand our expectations regarding insurance costs and estimated insurance reserves;\n• our expectations regarding new and evolving markets and our efforts to address these markets;\n• our ability to develop and protect our brand;\n• our ability to maintain the security and availability of our platform;\n• our expectations and management of future growth and business operations;\n• our expectations concerning relationships with third-parties;\n• our ability to maintain, protect and enhance our intellectual property;\n• our expectations concerning macroeconomic conditions, including the impact of inflation, uncertainty in the global banking and financial services\nmarkets and public health crises;\n• our ability to service our existing debt; and\n• our ability to successfully acquire and integrate companies and assets.\nWe caution you that the foregoing list may not contain all of the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nYou should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and prospects. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors,\nincluding those described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and\nrapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an\nimpact on the forward-looking statements\n1\nTable of Contents\ncontained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We cannot assure you that the results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be\nachieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.\nThe forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We\nundertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the\nplans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward-\nlooking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures or investments we may make.\nIn addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon\ninformation available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements,\nsuch information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all\npotentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.\n2\nTable of Contents\nPART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 1.

of Contents\nLyft, Inc.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(unaudited)\n1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation\nOrganization and Description of Business\nLyft, Inc. (the “Company” or “Lyft”) is incorporated in Delaware with its headquarters in San Francisco, California. The Company operates multimodal\ntransportation networks in the United States and Canada that offer access to a variety of transportation options through the Company’s platform and mobile-based\napplications. This network enables multiple modes of transportation including the facilitation of peer-to-peer ridesharing by connecting drivers who have a vehicle with\nriders who need a ride. The Lyft Platform provides a marketplace where drivers can be matched with riders via the Lyft App where the Company operates as a\ntransportation network company (“TNC”).\nTransportation options through the Company’s platform and mobile-based applications are substantially comprised of its ridesharing marketplace that connects\ndrivers and riders in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada, Lyft’s network of bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”), and the Express Drive\nprogram, where drivers can enter into short-term rental agreements with the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Flexdrive Services, LLC (“Flexdrive”), or a third\nparty for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the Lyft Platform. In addition, the Company makes the ridesharing marketplace available to\norganizations through Lyft Business offerings, such as the Concierge and Lyft Pass programs, and generates revenue from licensing and data access agreements\nassociated with the data from the Company's platform, subscription fees, revenue from bikes and bike station hardware and software sales and revenue from\narrangements to provide advertising services.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States (“GAAP”) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules and regulations for interim reporting and include the accounts of the\nCompany and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The information included in this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31,\n2023, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company uses the U.S. dollar predominantly as the functional currency of its foreign subsidiaries. For foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the\nfunctional currency, gains and losses from remeasurement of foreign currency balances into U.S. dollars are included on the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations. For the foreign subsidiary where the local currency is the functional currency, translation adjustments of foreign currency financial statements into U.S.\ndollars are recorded to a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nThe consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 included herein was derived from the audited financial statements as of that date. The accompanying\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual audited consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion\nof management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to state fairly the Company’s financial position, results of\noperations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the periods presented, but are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be\nanticipated for any future annual or interim period.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues\nand expenses during the reporting periods. The Company bases its estimates on various factors and information which may include, but are not limited to, history and\nprior experience, expected future results, new related events and economic conditions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets\nand liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nSignificant items subject to estimates and assumptions include those related to losses resulting from insurance claims inclusive of insurance related accruals,\nfair value of financial assets and liabilities, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, leases, indirect tax obligations, legal contingencies, valuation allowance for\ndeferred income taxes and the valuation of stock-based compensation.\n11\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company generates its revenue from its multimodal transportation networks that offer access to a variety of transportation options through the Lyft\nPlatform and mobile-based applications. Substantially all, or approximately 85% or more, of the Company’s revenue is generated from its ridesharing marketplace that\nconnects drivers and riders and is recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (“ASC 606”). In addition, the Company generates\nrevenue in accordance with ASC 606 from licensing and data access, subscription fees, revenue from bikes and bike station hardware and software sales and revenue\nfrom arrangements to provide advertising services to third parties, which are not significant components of the Company's condensed consolidated revenues. The\nCompany also generates rental revenue from Flexdrive and its network of Light Vehicles which is recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification\nTopic 842 (“ASC 842”).\nThe table below presents the Company’s revenues as included on the condensed consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue from contracts with customers (ASC 606) $ 1,387,825 $ 1,069,939 $ 3,919,393 $ 2,963,594\nRental revenue (ASC 842) 134,867 87,611 316,346 215,410\nTotal revenue $ 1,522,692 $ 1,157,550 $ 4,235,739 $ 3,179,004\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606)\nThe Company recognizes revenue for its rideshare marketplace in accordance with ASC 606. The Company generates revenue from service fees and\ncommissions (collectively, “fees”) paid by drivers for use of the Lyft Platform and related activities to connect drivers with riders to facilitate and successfully complete\nrides via the Lyft App where the Company operates as a TNC. The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of each ride. Drivers enter into terms of service\n(“ToS”) with the Company in order to use the Lyft Driver App. Under the ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of\nthe Lyft Platform and related activities from the fare and related charges it collects from riders on behalf of drivers. The Company is acting as an agent in facilitating the\nability of a driver to provide a transportation service to a rider. The Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting the fee owed to the Company from a driver as\nrevenue, and not the gross amount collected from the rider.\nAs the Company’s customary business practice, a contract exists between the driver and the Company when the driver’s ability to cancel the ride lapses, which\ntypically is upon pickup of the rider. The Company’s single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of a\nsuccessful transportation service for riders. The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of a ride as its performance obligation is satisfied upon the completion\nof the ride. The Company collects the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers using the rider’s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism\nand retains its fees before making the remaining disbursement to drivers; thus, the driver’s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from subscription fees paid to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over\nthe applicable subscription period in accordance with ASC 606. The Company also recognizes revenue from bikes, bike station hardware and software sales when\ncontrol is transferred to the customer in accordance with ASC 606.\nThe Company generates revenue from licensing and data access agreements. The Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling its promise to provide\nrideshare data and access to Flexdrive vehicles and bears the fulfillment risk, and the responsibility of providing the data, over the license period. The Company is\nacting as a principal in delivering the data and access licenses and presents revenue on a gross basis. Consideration allocated to each performance obligation, the data\ndelivery and vehicle access, is determined by assigning the relative fair value, which approximates the stand alone selling price, to each of the performance obligations.\nRevenue is recorded upon delivery of the rideshare data and ratably over the quarter for access to fleet vehicles as the Company’s respective performance obligation is\nsatisfied upon the delivery of each. These revenues are not significant to the Company's consolidated revenue.\nThe Company has arrangements to provide advertising services to third parties that are interested in reaching users of the Company's platform. These\narrangements generally require the Company to provide advertising services over a fixed period of time for which revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual\nperiod. These revenues are not significant to the Company's consolidated revenue.\n12\nTable of Contents\nRental Revenue (ASC 842)\nThe Company generates rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive and its network of Light Vehicles. Rental revenues are recognized for rental and rental\nrelated activities where an identified asset is transferred to the customer and the customer has the ability to control that asset in accordance with ASC 842.\nThe Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through its independently managed subsidiary, Flexdrive, comprised of both owned vehicles and vehicles\nleased from third-party leasing companies. The Company either leases or subleases vehicles to drivers, and as a result, the Company considers itself to be the\naccounting lessor or sublessor, as applicable, in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. Fleet operating costs include monthly fixed lease payments and other\nvehicle operating or ownership costs, as applicable. For vehicles that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a\ngross basis on the condensed consolidated financial statements. Drivers who rent vehicles are charged rental fees, which the Company collects from the driver by\ndeducting such amounts from the driver’s earnings on the Lyft Platform.\nThe Company owns and operates its Light Vehicles in some cities and operates city-owned Light Vehicles in other cities. Though the specific terms of\narrangements with cities vary, the Company earns operations fees from cities or shares revenue generated by the systems with cities. Light Vehicle revenue is accounted\nfor under ASC 842 for single-use rides. A single-use ride allows the user to select a specific Light Vehicle at the time the arrangement is entered into and provides the\nuser the right to control the selected Light Vehicle for the desired term of the arrangement.\nDue to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive and Light Vehicle transactions, the Company classifies these rentals as operating leases. Revenue generated from\nsingle-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicle riders is recognized upon completion of each related ride. Revenue generated from Flexdrive is recognized evenly over the\nrental period, which is typically seven days or less.\nEnterprise and Trade Receivables\nThe Company collects any fees owed for completed transactions on the Lyft Platform primarily from the rider’s authorized payment method. Uncollected fees\nare included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and represent receivables from (i) participants in the Company’s\nenterprise programs (“Enterprise Users”), where the transactions have been completed and the amounts owed from the Enterprise Users have either been invoiced or are\nunbilled as of the reporting date; and (ii) riders where the authorized payment method is a credit card but the fare amounts have not yet settled with third-party payment\nprocessors. Under the ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the Lyft Platform and related activities from the\nfare and related charges it collects from riders on behalf of drivers. Accordingly, the Company has no trade receivables from drivers. The portion of the fare receivable\nto be remitted to drivers is included in accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company records an allowance for credit losses for fees owed for completed transactions that may never settle or be collected in accordance with\nAccounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses”. The allowance for credit losses reflects the Company’s current estimate of\nexpected credit losses inherent in the enterprise and trade receivables balance. In determining the expected credit losses, the Company considers its historical loss\nexperience, the aging of its receivable balance, current economic and business conditions, and anticipated future economic events that may impact collectability. The\nCompany reviews its allowance for credit losses periodically and as needed, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible.\nThe Company’s receivable balance, which consists primarily of amounts due from Enterprise Users and Light Vehicle partners, was $318.8 million and $315.0\nmillion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company’s allowance for credit losses was $12.5 million and $9.8 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nIncentive Programs\nThe Company offers incentives to attract drivers, riders and Light Vehicle riders to use the Lyft Platform. Drivers generally receive cash incentives while riders\nand Light Vehicle riders generally receive free or discounted rides under such incentive programs. Incentives provided to drivers and Light Vehicle riders, the customers\nof the Company, are accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price. As the riders are not the Company’s customers, incentives provided to riders are generally\nrecognized as sales and marketing expense except for certain pricing programs described below.\nDriver Incentives\nThe Company offers various incentive programs to drivers, including minimum guaranteed payments, volume-based discounts and performance-based bonus\npayments. These driver incentives are similar to retrospective volume-based rebates and represent variable consideration that is typically settled within a week. The\nCompany reduces the transaction price by the\n13\nTable of Contents\nestimated amount of the incentives expected to be paid upon completion of the performance criteria by applying the most likely outcome method. Therefore, such driver\nincentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue. Driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue if the Company does not receive a distinct good or service in\nexchange for the payment or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received. Driver incentives for referring new drivers or riders are\naccounted for as sales and marketing expense. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the payment or the established fair value of the benefit\nreceived. The fair value of the benefit is established using amounts paid to third parties for similar services.\nRideshare Rider Incentives\nThe Company has several rideshare rider incentive programs, which are offered to encourage rider activity on the Lyft Platform. Generally, the rider incentive\nprograms are as follows:\n(i) Market-wide marketing promotions. Market-wide promotions reduce the fare charged by drivers to riders for all or substantially all rides in a specific\nmarket. This type of incentive effectively reduces the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for that specific market and the gross fare\ncharged by the driver to the rider, and thereby results in a lower fee earned by the Company. Accordingly, the Company records this type\nof incentive as a reduction to revenue at the date it records the corresponding revenue transaction.\n(ii) Targeted marketing promotions. Targeted marketing promotions are used to promote the use of the Lyft Platform to a targeted group of riders. An\nexample is a promotion where the Company offers a number of discounted rides (capped at a given number of rides) which are valid only during a\nlimited period of time to a targeted group of riders. The Company believes that the incentives that provide consideration to riders to be applied to a\nlimited number of rides are similar to marketing coupons. These incentives differ from the market-wide marketing promotions because they do not\nreduce the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for a specific market. During the promotion period, riders not utilizing an incentive would\nbe charged the full fare. These incentives represent marketing costs. When a rider redeems the incentive, the Company recognizes revenue equal to\nthe transaction price and the cost of the incentive is recorded as sales and marketing expense.\n(iii) Rider referral programs. Under the rider referral program, the referring rider (the referrer) earns referral coupons when a new rider (the referee)\ncompletes their first ride on the Lyft Platform. The Company records the incentive as a liability at the time the incentive is earned by the referrer with\nthe corresponding charge recorded to sales and marketing expense. Referral coupons typically expire within one year. The Company estimates\nbreakage using its historical experience. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the rider referral coupon liability was not material.\nLight Vehicle Rider Incentives\nIncentives offered to Light Vehicle riders were not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, in relation to the driver, rider and Light Vehicle rider incentive programs, the Company recorded\n$162.1 million and $571.3 million as a reduction to revenue, respectively, and $112.2 million and $264.0 million as sales and marketing expense, respectively. For the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023, in relation to the driver, rider and Light Vehicle riders incentive programs, the Company recorded $241.2 million and\n$854.8 million as a reduction to revenue, respectively, and $43.1 million and $90.0 million as sales and marketing expense, respectively.\nInvestments\nDebt Securities\nThe Company’s accounting for its investments in debt securities is based on the legal form of the security, the Company’s intended holding period for the\nsecurity, and the nature of the transaction. Investments in debt securities include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds, and U.S. government and\nagency securities. Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value.\nThe Company considers an available-for-sale debt security to be impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost basis. The entire\ndifference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale debt securities is recognized on the condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations as an impairment if, (i) the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and (ii) the Company intends to sell or is more likely than not\nrequired to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If neither criterion is met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value is due to\ncredit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which the security’s fair value is less than amortized cost, changes to the\nrating of the security by third-party rating agencies,\n14\nTable of Contents\nand adverse conditions specific to the security, among other factors. If the Company’s assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the credit loss is measured based on\nthe Company’s best estimate of the cash flows expected to be collected. When developing its estimate of cash flows expected to be collected, the Company considers all\navailable information relevant to the collectability of the security, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nCredit loss impairments are recognized through an allowance for credit losses adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the debt securities on the balance sheet\nwith an offsetting credit loss expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Impairments related to factors other than credit losses are recognized as\nan adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the security and an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. As of September 30,\n2024, the Company had not recorded any credit impairments. The Company determines realized gains or losses on the sale of debt securities on a specific identification\nmethod.\nThe Company’s investments in debt securities include:\n(i) Cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents include certificates of deposits, commercial paper and corporate bonds that have an original maturity of\n90 days or less and are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.\n(ii) Short-term investments. Short-term investments are comprised of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and corporate bonds, which mature in\ntwelve months or less. As a result, the Company classifies these investments as current assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance\nsheets.\n(iii) Restricted investments. Restricted investments are comprised of debt security investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate\nbonds and U.S. government and agency securities which are held in trust accounts at third-party financial institutions pursuant to certain contracts\nwith insurance providers.\nNon-marketable Equity Securities\nThe Company has elected to measure its investments in non-marketable equity securities at cost, with remeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence\nof observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. The Company qualitatively assesses whether indicators of impairment\nexist. Factors considered in this assessment include the investees’ financial and liquidity position, access to capital resources, and macroeconomic conditions, among\nothers. If an impairment exists, the Company estimates the fair value of the investment by using the best information available, which may include cash flow\nprojections or other available market data, and recognizes a loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the investment on the condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an\nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would\nuse in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a\nrecurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to\nmeasure fair value:\nLevel 1 Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs\nother than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by\ncorrelation or other means.\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be\nconsistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.\nThe carrying values of the Company’s accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the short period of\ntime to payment.\nInsurance Reserves and Insurance-related Accruals\nThe Company utilizes both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions,\nto insure or reinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury\nprotection under state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and\nclaims that have been incurred but not yet reported and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments.\nLiabilities are determined on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, and changes in claims experience, including consideration of\nnew information and application of loss development factors, and frequency and severity assumptions, among other inputs and assumptions for the insurance reserves\n15\nTable of Contents\nand insurance-related accruals. On an annual basis or more frequently as determined by management, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for\nappropriateness with claims reserve valuations.\nInsurance claims may take years to completely settle, and the Company has available limited historical loss experience because of the limited operational\nhistory. The Company makes certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factors as the most\nsignificant assumption related to the insurance reserves and the frequency and severity assumptions as the most significant assumptions related to insurance-related\naccruals, and utilizes actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the\nclaim remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in\na prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be\nmaterial. However, while the Company believes that the insurance reserve and insurance-related accrual amounts are adequate, the ultimate liabilities may be in excess\nof, or less than, the amounts provided. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liabilities and when amounts will be paid may significantly\nvary from the estimated amounts provided for on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. For example, disruptive factors may distort data, metrics and patterns and\nresult in rapid increases in insurance cost and reserve deficiency. These disruptive factors can include recent economic conditions and ongoing global events such as the\nhigh inflationary environment, increased litigation, higher than expected losses across the commercial auto industry and trends in markets in which the Company\noperates, including the potential insolvency of other insurance providers covering drivers in the market. The Company continues to review its insurance estimates in a\nregular, ongoing process as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and settled, and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.\nLeases\nIn accordance with ASC 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception by assessing whether the arrangement\ncontains an identified asset and whether the lessee has the right to control such asset. The Company determines the classification and measurement of its leases upon\nlease commencement. The Company enters into certain agreements as a lessor and either leases or subleases the underlying asset in the agreement to customers. The\nCompany also enters into certain agreements as a lessee. If any of the following criteria are met, the Company classifies the lease as a financing lease (as a lessee) or as\na direct financing or sales-type lease (both as a lessor):\n• The lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term;\n• The lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise;\n• The lease term is for 75% or more of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, unless the commencement date falls within the last 25% of\nthe economic life of the underlying asset;\n• The present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds 90% of the fair value of the underlying asset; or\n• The underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term.\nLeases that do not meet any of the above criteria are accounted for as operating leases.\nLessor\nThe Company’s lease arrangements include vehicle rentals to drivers or renters under the Flexdrive program and Light Vehicle rentals to single-use riders. Due\nto the short-term nature of these arrangements, the Company classifies these leases as operating leases. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease\ncomponents, such as insurance or roadside assistance provided to the lessee, in its lessor lease arrangements. Lease payments are primarily fixed and are recognized as\nrevenue in the period over which the lease arrangement occurs. Taxes or other fees assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with\neach lease revenue-producing transaction and collected by the Company from the lessee are excluded from the consideration in its lease arrangements. The Company\nmitigates residual value risk of its leased assets by performing regular maintenance and repairs, as necessary, and through periodic reviews of asset depreciation rates\nbased on the Company's ongoing assessment of present and estimated future market conditions.\nLessee\nThe Company’s leases include real estate property to support its operations and Flexdrive vehicles that may be used by drivers to provide ridesharing services\non the Lyft Platform. For leases with a term greater than 12 months, the Company records the related right-of-use asset and lease liability at the present value of lease\npayments over the term. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options.\n16\nTable of Contents\nThe Company does not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts for real estate property leases, but has elected to do so for vehicle leases when non-lease\ncomponents exist in these arrangements. For certain leases, the Company also applies a portfolio approach to account for right-of-use assets and lease liabilities that are\nsimilar in nature and have nearly identical contract provisions.\nThe Company’s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount the\nlease payments based on information available at lease commencement. The Company determines its incremental borrowing rate based on the rate of interest that the\nCompany would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.\nLease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments are included in the Company’s lease liability calculation. Operating leases are\nincluded in operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities — current and operating lease liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Lease\ncosts for the Company's operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis primarily within operating expenses over the lease term. Finance leases are included in\nproperty and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Finance lease assets are amortized\non a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term in cost of revenue on the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations. The interest component of finance leases is included in cost of revenue on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and recognized using the\neffective interest method over the lease term. Variable lease payments are recognized primarily in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those\npayments is incurred.\nSimilar to other long-lived assets discussed below, the Company measures recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future\nundiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If the carrying value of the assets are not recoverable, the impairment recognized is\nmeasured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. For leased assets, such circumstances would include the decision to leave a\nleased facility prior to the end of the minimum lease term or subleases for which estimated cash flows do not fully cover the costs of the associated lease. The Company\ncommitted to a decision to exit and sublease or cease use of certain facilities to align with the Company’s anticipated operating needs and incurred impairment charges\nrelated to real estate operating right-of-use assets of $2.5 million and $13.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. There was\nno such charge during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 12 “Restructuring” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for\nfurther information.\nVariable Interest Entities\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, Consolidation (“ASC 810”), the Company evaluates its ownership, contractual and other\ninterests in entities to assess whether it has a variable interest in entities in which it has a financial relationship and, if so, whether or not those entities are variable\ninterest entities (“VIEs”). These evaluations are complex, involving judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective\ninformation, among other factors. For an entity to qualify as a VIE, ASC 810 requires the Company to determine if the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE,\nand, if so, to consolidate such entity into its condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company consolidates VIEs in which it has a controlling financial interest and is therefore deemed the primary beneficiary. A controlling financial interest\nwill have both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the VIE activities that most significantly impact economic performance; and (b) the obligation to\nabsorb the VIE losses and the right to receive benefits that are significant to the VIE. Periodically, the Company reevaluates its ownership, contractual and other\ninterests in entities to determine whether any changes in its interest or relationship with an entity impacts the determination of whether it is still the primary beneficiary\nof such entity. The Company has determined that it was the primary beneficiary of one VIE as of September 30, 2024.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2022-03, \"Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) Fair Value Measurement of Equity\nSecurities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions\", which clarifies guidance in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, when measuring the fair value of an equity\nsecurity to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security and to introduce new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to contractual\nsale restrictions that are measured at fair value in accordance with Topic 820. Effective on January 1, 2024, the Company adopted this standard, which did not have a\nmaterial impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n17\nTable of Contents\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\", which amends\nand enhances the disclosure requirements for reportable segments. All disclosure requirements under this standard will also be required for public entities with a single\nreportable segment. The new standard will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard on the consolidated financial\nstatements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, \"Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\", which requires companies to provide disaggregated\ninformation about a reporting entity's effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The new requirements will be effective for public\nbusiness entities for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard on the consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nIn March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules under SEC Release No. 33-11275, \"The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for\nInvestors\", which requires registrants to provide certain climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports. As it pertains to the financial\nstatements, the final rules require the financial statement footnotes to include certain disclosures regarding the amounts of expenses (or capitalized costs) incurred that\nrelate to severe weather events and other natural conditions, as well as other disclosures regarding the material impact on financial estimates and assumptions of severe\nweather events and other natural conditions or disclosed targets or transition plans. It also requires disclosure of financial statement amounts related to carbon offsets\nand renewable energy credits. In April 2024, the SEC issued an order staying these rules pending the completion of judicial review of litigation challenging the validity\nof the rules. The disclosures will be required at the earliest in the Company's annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2025. The Company is\ncurrently evaluating the impact of this on its consolidated financial statements.\n3.

The term deposits are at cost, which approximates fair\nvalue.\nThe remaining maturity of the Company’s investment portfolio was less than one year as of the periods presented. No individual security incurred continuous\nunrealized losses for greater than 12 months.\nThe Company purchases investment grade marketable debt securities which are rated by nationally recognized statistical credit rating organizations in\naccordance with its investment policy. This policy is designed to minimize the Company's exposure to credit losses. As of September 30, 2024, the credit-quality of the\nCompany’s marketable available-for-sale debt securities had remained stable. The unrealized losses recognized on marketable available-for-sale debt securities as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 were primarily related to the continued market volatility associated with uncertain economic outlook. The Company does not intend to sell the\ninvestments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis. The Company is\nnot aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require the Company to change its quarterly assessment of credit losses for any marketable available-for-sale\ndebt security as of September 30, 2024. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized on the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known. No credit losses were recognized as of September 30, 2024 for the Company’s marketable\nand non-marketable debt securities.\n19\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position for which no allowance for credit losses was\nrecorded, aggregated by major security type (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nEstimated Fair Value Unrealized Losses\nCertificates of deposit $ 27,968 $ (312)\nCorporate bonds 47,859 (15)\nCommercial paper 97,592 (1,376)\nU.S. government securities 9,938 (1)\nTotal available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position $ 183,357 $ (1,704)\nAccrued and Other Current Liabilities\nAccrued and other current liabilities consisted of the following as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nInsurance-related accruals(1) $ 721,760 $ 643,147\nLegal and tax related accruals 366,786 296,336\nRide-related accruals 229,717 212,114\nInsurance claims payable and related fees 66,137 52,609\nLong-term debt, current(2) 40,151 25,798\nOther 290,630 278,851\nAccrued and other current liabilities $ 1,715,181 $ 1,508,855\n_______________\n(1) Refer to Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" above for more information on these insurance-related accruals.\n(2) Represents current portion of long-term debt primarily related to the Non-revolving Loan and Master Vehicle Loan.

However, this balance is included within the $1.5 billion of\nrestricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted short-term investments on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets\nUnrestricted cash equivalents and investments(1)\nMoney market funds $ 28,351 $ — $ — $ 28,351\nCertificates of deposit — 179,803 — 179,803\nCommercial paper — 918,531 — 918,531\nCorporate bonds — 29,172 — 29,172\nU.S. government securities — 232,008 — 232,008\nTotal unrestricted cash equivalents and short-term investments 28,351 1,359,514 — 1,387,865\nRestricted cash equivalents and investments(2)\nMoney market funds 44,241 — — 44,241\nCertificates of deposit — 145,109 — 145,109\nCommercial paper — 619,074 — 619,074\nCorporate bonds — 12,411 — 12,411\nU.S. government securities — 224,719 — 224,719\nTotal restricted cash equivalents and investments 44,241 1,001,313 — 1,045,554\nTotal financial assets $ 72,592 $ 2,360,827 $ — $ 2,433,419\n21\nTable of Contents\n_______________\n(1) $179.7 million of cash, $117.6 million of money market deposit accounts and $3.5 million of term deposits are not subject to recurring fair value measurement and therefore excluded from this table.\nHowever, these balances are included within the $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n(2) $1.4 million of restricted cash is not subject to recurring fair value measurement and therefore excluded from this table. However, this balance is included within the $1.0 billion of restricted cash and\ncash equivalents and restricted short-term investments on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not make any transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nThe Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values and the carrying value\nof these non-marketable equity securities are remeasured to fair value based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or similar securities of the same\nissuer (referred to as the measurement alternative) or for impairment. Any changes in carrying value are recorded within other income (expense), net in the condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nThere were $9.1 million and $5.9 million of financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis within other investments on the condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n5. Leases\nReal Estate Operating Leases\nThe Company leases real estate property at approximately 66 locations as of September 30, 2024. These leases are classified as operating leases. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the remaining lease terms vary from approximately two months to six years. For certain leases the Company has options to extend the lease term\nfor periods varying from one month to ten years. These renewal options are not considered in the remaining lease term unless it is reasonably certain that the Company\nwill exercise such options. For leases with an initial term of 12 months or longer, the Company has recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability representing the\nfixed component of the lease payment. Any fixed payments related to non-lease components, such as common area maintenance or other services provided by the\nlandlord, are accounted for as a component of the lease payment and therefore, a part of the total lease cost.\nFlexdrive Program\nThe Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through its independently managed subsidiary, a portion of which are leased from third-party vehicle leasing\ncompanies. These leases are classified as finance leases and are included in property and equipment, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the remaining lease terms vary between three months to four years. These leases generally do not contain any non-lease components and, as such,\nall payments due under these arrangements are allocated to the respective lease component.\n22\nTable of Contents\nLease Position as of September 30, 2024\nThe table below presents the lease-related assets and liabilities recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets (in thousands, except for remaining\nlease terms and percentages):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nOperating Leases\nAssets\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 83,866 $ 98,202\nLiabilities\nOperating lease liabilities, current $ 41,752 $ 42,556\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current 103,779 134,102\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 145,531 $ 176,658\nFinance Leases\nAssets\nFinance lease right-of-use assets(1) $ 86,353 $ 80,933\nLiabilities\nFinance lease liabilities, current(2) 31,595 25,193\nFinance lease liabilities, non-current(3) 60,419 61,321\nTotal finance lease liabilities $ 92,014 $ 86,514\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\nOperating leases 4.1 4.5\nFinance leases 2.8 3.4\nWeighted-average discount rate\nOperating leases 6.8 % 6.7 %\nFinance leases 6.5 % 6.7 %\n_______________\n(1) This balance is included within property and equipment, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and is primarily related to Flexdrive.\n(2) This balance is included within other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and is primarily related to Flexdrive.\n(3) This balance is included within other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and is primarily related to Flexdrive.\n23\nTable of Contents\nLease Costs\nThe table below presents certain information related to the costs for operating leases and finance leases for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating Leases\nOperating lease cost $ 9,451 $ 9,587 $ 28,936 $ 31,076\nFinance Leases\nAmortization of right-of-use assets 8,087 5,395 21,290 14,017\nInterest on lease liabilities 1,503 1,082 4,365 2,143\nOther Lease Costs\nShort-term lease cost 778 920 2,648 2,866\nVariable lease cost (1) 2,332 2,575 7,502 7,665\nTotal lease cost $ 22,151 $ 19,559 $ 64,741 $ 57,767\n_______________\n(1) Consists primarily of common area maintenance and taxes and utilities for real estate leases.\nSublease income was $0.9 million and $3.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $1.2 million and $3.7 million\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Sublease income is included within other income, net on the condensed consolidated statement\nof operations. The related lease expense for these leases is included within operating expenses on the condensed consolidated statement of operations.\nThe table below presents certain supplemental information related to the cash flows for operating and finance leases recorded on the condensed consolidated\nstatements of cash flows (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 45,647 $ 44,579\nOperating cash flows from finance leases 3,997 2,284\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases 35,403 35,935\n24\nTable of Contents\nUndiscounted Cash Flows\nThe table below reconciles the undiscounted cash flows for each of the first five years and total of the remaining years to the lease liabilities recorded on the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):\nOperating Leases Finance Leases Total Leases\nRemainder of 2024 $ 8,710 $ 9,403 $ 18,113\n2025 50,121 35,720 85,841\n2026 35,149 32,112 67,261\n2027 29,948 14,627 44,575\n2028 19,900 10,010 29,910\nThereafter 23,744 — 23,744\nTotal minimum lease payments 167,572 101,872 269,444\nLess: amount of lease payments representing interest (22,041) (9,858) (31,899)\nPresent value of future lease payments 145,531 92,014 237,545\nLess: current obligations under leases (41,752) (31,595) (73,347)\nLong-term lease obligations $ 103,779 $ 60,419 $ 164,198\nFuture lease payments receivable in car rental transactions under the Flexdrive program are not material since the lease term is less than a month.\n6. Commitments and Contingencies\nNoncancellable Purchase Commitments\nIn March 2018, the Company entered into a noncancellable arrangement with Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), a web-hosting services provider, under which\nthe Company had an obligation to purchase a minimum amount of services from this vendor through June 2021. The parties modified the aggregate commitment\namounts and timing in January 2019, May 2020 and February 2022. Under the most recent amended arrangement, the Company committed to spend an aggregate of at\nleast $350 million between February 2022 and January 2026, with a minimum amount of $80 million in each of the four contractual periods, on services with AWS. As\nof September 30, 2024, the Company has made payments of $321.6 million under the amended arrangement.\nIn May 2019, the Company entered into a noncancellable arrangement with the City of Chicago, with respect to the Divvy bike share program, under which\nthe Company has an obligation to pay approximately $7.5 million per year to the City of Chicago through January 2028 and to spend a minimum of $50 million on\ncapital equipment for the bike share program through January 2028. The parties modified the commitment amounts and timing in April 2023 to reduce the Company's\ntotal payment obligation by $12 million and to supply a maximum of $12 million on capital equipment for the bike share program through 2024. As of September 30,\n2024, the Company has made payments totaling $33.6 million as well as capital equipment investments totaling $60.5 million under the arrangements.\nLetters of Credit\nThe Company maintains certain stand-by letters of credit from third-party financial institutions in the ordinary course of business to guarantee certain\nperformance obligations related to leases, insurance policies and other various contractual arrangements. None of the outstanding letters of credit are collateralized by\ncash. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had letters of credit outstanding of $73.0 million and $60.2 million, respectively.\nIndemnification\nThe Company enters into indemnification provisions under agreements with other parties in the ordinary course of business, including certain business\npartners, investors, contractors, parties to certain acquisition or divestiture transactions and the Company’s officers, directors, and certain employees. The Company has\nagreed to indemnify and defend the indemnified party’s claims and related losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party resulting from actual or threatened third-\nparty claims because of the Company’s activities or, in some cases, non-compliance with certain representations and warranties made by the Company. It is not possible\nto determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to the Company’s limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique\nfacts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recorded on the condensed consolidated statements of operations in connection with the\nindemnification provisions have not been material.\n25\nTable of Contents\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory and governmental inquiries and\ninvestigations in the ordinary course of business, including suits by drivers, riders, renters, third parties and governmental entities (individually or as class actions)\nalleging, among other things, various wage and expense related claims, violations of state or federal laws, improper disclosure of the Company’s fees, rules or policies,\nthat such fees, rules or policies violate applicable law, or that the Company has not acted in conformity with such fees, rules or policies, as well as proceedings related\nto product liability, antitrust, its acquisitions, securities issuances, business practices, or public disclosures about the Company or the Company's business. In addition,\nthe Company has been, and is currently, named as a defendant in a number of litigation matters related to allegations of accidents or other trust and safety incidents\ninvolving drivers or riders using the Lyft Platform.\nThe outcomes of the Company’s legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For certain matters for which a material\nloss is reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses is not possible nor is the Company able to estimate the loss or range of losses that could\npotentially result from the application of nonmonetary remedies. For matters where the Company has recorded a probable and estimable loss, until the final resolution\nof the matter, there may be exposure to a material loss in excess of the amount recorded.\nIndependent Contractor Classification Matters\nWith regard to independent contractor classification of drivers on the Lyft Platform, the Company is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration\nproceedings, administrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the\nclassification of these drivers as independent contractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, the Company has violated various labor and other laws that\nwould apply to driver employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent contractors are subject to change and divergent\ninterpretations by various authorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for the Company.\nFor example, California Assembly Bill 5 (now codified in part at Cal. Labor Code sec. 2775) codified and extended an employment classification test set forth\nby the California Supreme Court that established a new standard for determining employee or independent contractor status. The passage of this bill led to additional\nchallenges to the independent contractor classification of drivers using the Lyft Platform. For example, on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General and the City\nAttorneys of Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco filed a lawsuit against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers on the companies’ respective\nplatforms as independent contractors in violation of Assembly Bill 5 and California’s Unfair Competition Law, and on August 5, 2020, the California Labor\nCommissioner filed lawsuits against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers on the companies’ respective platforms as independent contractors,\nseeking injunctive relief and material damages and penalties. On August 10, 2020, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction, forcing the Company and\nUber to reclassify drivers in California as employees until the end of the lawsuit. Subsequently, voters in California approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that\nprovided a framework for drivers utilizing platforms like Lyft to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law. Proposition 22 went into effect\non December 16, 2020. On April 20, 2021, the court granted the parties’ joint request to dissolve the preliminary injunction in light of the passage of Proposition 22. On\nMay 5, 2021, the California Labor Commissioner filed a petition to coordinate its lawsuit with the Attorney General lawsuit and three other cases against the Company\nand Uber. The coordination petition was granted and the coordinated cases have been assigned to a judge in San Francisco Superior Court. On December 19, 2022, the\nCalifornia Attorney General’s and California Labor Commissioner’s cases were stayed in San Francisco Superior Court pending the appeal of a Superior Court order\ndenying Lyft’s and Uber’s motions to compel arbitration. On September 28, 2023, the California Court of Appeal issued a decision upholding the trial court’s order\ndenying Lyft’s and Uber’s motions to compel arbitration. On November 7, 2023, the Company filed a petition requesting that the California Supreme Court review the\nCourt of Appeal’s decision; the petition was denied on January 17, 2024, and the case was remitted to San Francisco Superior Court on January 29, 2024. The stay was\nlifted by the trial court on July 2, 2024, and the parties are exploring mediation. On October 7, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the Company's petition for writ of\ncertiorari.\nOn January 12, 2021, a group of petitioners led by labor union SEIU filed a separate lawsuit in the California Supreme Court against the State of California\nalleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional under the California Constitution. The California Supreme Court denied review on February 3, 2021. SEIU then filed a\nsimilar lawsuit in Alameda County Superior Court on February 11, 2021. Protect App-Based Drivers & Services (PADS) — the coalition that established and operated\nthe official ballot measure committee that successfully advocated for the passage of Proposition 22 — intervened in the Alameda lawsuit. On August 20, 2021, after a\nmerits hearing, the Alameda Superior Court issued an order finding that Proposition 22 is unenforceable. Both the California Attorney General and PADS filed appeals\nto the California Court of Appeal. On March 13, 2023, the California Court of Appeal upheld Proposition 22 as constitutional, while severing two provisions that relate\nto future amendments of Proposition 22. On April 21, 2023, SEIU filed a petition for review to the California Supreme Court. On June 28, 2023, the California Supreme\nCourt granted SEIU’s petition for review and briefing was completed on June 3, 2024. The California Supreme Court held oral argument on May 21, 2024 and ordered\nthe matter submitted for decision on June 3, 2024.\n26\nTable of Contents\nOn July 25, 2024, the California Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal and unanimously upheld Proposition 22 as constitutional.\nCertain adverse outcomes of such actions would have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, including\ndamages, penalties and potential suspension of operations in impacted jurisdictions, including California. The Company’s chances of success on the merits are still\nuncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated. Such regulatory scrutiny or action may create different or conflicting obligations from\none jurisdiction to another.\nSeparately, on July 14, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a lawsuit against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers as\nindependent contractors under Massachusetts law, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Trial took place from May 13, 2024 to June 3, 2024. On June 27, 2024,\nthe parties reached a resolution to dismiss the litigation with prejudice and Massachusetts drivers have begun receiving new benefits and maintained their flexibility as\nindependent contractors. The amount accrued for these matters is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nThe Company is currently involved in a number of putative class actions, thousands of individual claims, including those brought in arbitration or compelled\npursuant to the Company's Terms of Service to arbitration, matters brought, in whole or in part, as representative actions under California’s Private Attorneys General\nAct, Labor Code Section 2698, et seq., alleging that the Company misclassified drivers as independent contractors and other matters challenging the classification of\ndrivers on the Company’s platform as independent contractors. The Company is also defending against allegations that the Company has failed to properly classify\ndrivers and provide those drivers with sick leave and related benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company’s chances of success on the merits are still\nuncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.\nThe Company disputes any allegations of wrongdoing and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. However, results of litigation,\narbitration and regulatory actions are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these driver claims, individually or in the aggregate, could have a\nmaterial impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of these matters can have\nan adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nUnemployment Insurance Assessment\nThe Company is involved in administrative audits with various state employment agencies, including audits related to driver classification, in California,\nOregon, Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The Company believes that drivers are properly classified as independent contractors and plans\nto vigorously contest any adverse assessment or determination. The Company’s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain. The Company accrues for liabilities\nthat may result from assessments by, or any negotiated agreements with, these employment agencies when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, and the expense\nis recorded to general and administrative expenses.\nIn 2018, the New Jersey Department of Labor & Workforce Development (“NJDOL”) opened an audit reviewing whether drivers were independent\ncontractors or employees for purposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through March 31, 2018. The NJDOL issued an\nassessment on June 4, 2019 and subsequently issued an updated assessment on March 31, 2021. On August 2, 2024, the NJDOL issued a revised assessment, which is\nbased upon a different methodology. The assessment was calculated through April 30, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interests owed\nfrom 2014 through 2017. The Company filed a petition to challenge the assessment, and is awaiting a hearing. The Company has also submitted payment for the\nprincipal revised amount of the assessment to stop interest from accruing on this amount. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, the Company\nrecorded an accrual for this matter reflected within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024.\nIn 2021, the New York State Department of Labor (“NYSDOL”) opened an audit reviewing whether drivers were independent contractors or employees for\npurposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply for 2019. The NYSDOL subsequently extended the audit back to 2016. On December 22,\n2022, the Company received an assessment for the 2016 to 2019 time period and on December 27, 2023, the Company received a revised assessment covering 2016 to\n2020. The Company has appealed these assessments. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, the Company recorded an accrual for this matter reflected\nwithin accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024.\nIn June 2022, the California Employment Development Department (\"EDD\") opened an audit reviewing whether drivers were independent contractors or\nemployees for purposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2018 to 2020. The EDD issued an assessment on June 9, 2023 and\nsubsequently issued an updated assessment on\n27\nTable of Contents\nJune 27, 2023. The Company filed a petition to challenge the assessment. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, the Company recorded an accrual for\nthis matter reflected within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024.\nIndirect Taxes\nThe Company is under audit by various domestic tax authorities with regard to indirect tax matters. The subject matter of indirect tax audits primarily arises\nfrom disputes on tax treatment and tax rates applied to the sale of the Company’s services in these jurisdictions. The Company accrues indirect taxes that may result\nfrom examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable and the expense is recorded to general\nand administrative expenses.\nPatent Litigation\nThe Company is currently involved in legal proceedings related to alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, the Company receives correspondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to sell or license such property and/or\nasserting infringement of such property. The Company disputes any allegation of wrongdoing and intends to defend itself vigorously in these matters. The Company’s\nchances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.\nOther Class Actions and Consumer Matters\nFrom time to time, the Company becomes involved in putative class actions, investigations, and other matters alleging violations of consumer protection, civil\nrights, and other laws; antitrust and unfair competition laws such as California’s Cartwright Act, Unfair Practices Act and Unfair Competition Law; and the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act, or the ADA, among others. In July 2024, the Company went to trial in federal court in New York to defend against a class action alleging ADA\nand New York law violations with respect to the Company's wheelchair accessible vehicle (\"WAV\") offerings, seeking injunctive and other relief, in Lowell v. Lyft, Inc.\nOn September 30, 2024, the district court ruled that plaintiffs failed to sustain their burden of proof that the modifications they proposed at trial would result in\nnationwide WAV service. The district court dismissed the suit and entered judgment in favor of the Company. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on October 29,\n2024. The Company disputes any allegations of wrongdoing and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. The Company’s chances of success on\nthe merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) alleged violations of Section 5 of the FTC Act in connection with certain advertising claims to drivers. The Company\nreached a settlement with the government to resolve this matter, which was approved by a court on November 1, 2024.\nPersonal Injury and Other Safety Matters\nIn the ordinary course of the Company’s business, various parties have from time to time claimed, and may claim in the future, that the Company is liable for\ndamages related to accidents or other incidents involving drivers, riders or renters using or who have used services offered on the Lyft Platform, as well as from third\nparties. The Company is currently named as a defendant in a number of matters related to accidents or other incidents involving drivers, riders, renters and third parties.\nThe Company believes it has meritorious defenses, disputes the allegations of wrongdoing and intends to defend itself vigorously in these matters. There is no pending\nor threatened claim that has arisen from these accidents or incidents that individually, in the Company’s opinion, is likely to have a material impact on its business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations; however, results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to such accidents or\nincidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, on January 17, 2020,\nthe Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, granted the petition of multiple plaintiffs to coordinate their claims relating to alleged sexual assault or\nharassment by drivers on the Lyft Platform, and a Judicial Council Coordinated Proceeding has been created before the Superior Court of California, County of San\nFrancisco, where the claims of multiple plaintiffs are currently pending. Regardless of the outcome of these or other matters, litigation can have an adverse impact on\nthe Company because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors. Although the Company\nintends to vigorously defend against these lawsuits, its chances of success on the merits are still uncertain as these matters are at various stages of litigation and present\na wide range of potential outcomes. The Company accrues for losses that may result from these matters when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.\nSecurities Litigation\n28\nTable of Contents\nBeginning in April 2019, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts against the Company, its directors, certain\nof its officers, and certain of the underwriters named in the registration statement relating to the Company’s initial public offering (“IPO”) alleging violation of\nsecurities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with the IPO. All of these matters are now resolved except for the derivative actions,\nwhich were consolidated into one action in federal court in California. A proposed settlement was filed in the derivative action on July 23, 2024, and the court granted\npreliminary approval on October 16, 2024. A hearing on final settlement approval is set for February 6, 2025.\nOn February 13, 2024, the Company published a press release announcing our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 that was furnished\nwith our Current Report on Form 8-K filed that same day. The press release contained a clerical error relating to the Company's forward-looking, non-GAAP directional\ncommentary for fiscal year 2024 (the “Clerical Error”). The Clerical Error was promptly corrected on the Company's earnings call and in an updated press release, and\nthe Company filed an amended 8-K. Shortly after, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") requested information relating to the Clerical Error. The\nCompany cooperated and responded voluntarily to the requests.

The resulting fair value is amortized beginning\non the grant date over the requisite service periods of each individual tranche.\nAll PSUs are subject to a continuous service condition in addition to certain performance criteria.\nThe fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs that vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $268.5 million and\n$224.9 million, respectively. In connection with RSUs that vested in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company withheld 848,001 shares and remitted\ncash payments of $12.5 million on behalf of the RSU holders to the relevant tax authorities.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation cost was $237.4 million. The Company expects to recognize this expense over the remaining\nweighted-average period of 1.1 years. Generally, RSUs granted after March 28, 2019 vest on the satisfaction of a service-based condition only. The Company\nrecognizes compensation expense for such RSUs upon a straight-line basis over their requisite service periods.\nCommon Stock Repurchase\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2029 Notes in February 2024, the Company repurchased 3,142,678 shares of its Class A common stock from investors in\nprivately negotiated transactions for an aggregate repurchase price of approximately $50.0 million. The shares were repurchased at fair value and the entire repurchase\nprice was allocated to the repurchase of the shares. The par value of the shares retired is charged against common stock and the remaining repurchase price is allocated\nto additional paid-in capital on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company retired the shares upon repurchase.\n2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn March 2019, the Company’s board of directors adopted, and the Company’s stockholders approved, the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”).\nThe initial ESPP went into effect on March 27, 2019 and was amended on July 26, 2021 and July 18, 2022. Subject to any limitations contained therein, the ESPP\nallows eligible employees to contribute, through payroll deductions, up to 15% of their eligible compensation to purchase the Company’s Class A common stock at a\n35\nTable of Contents\ndiscounted price per share. The ESPP provides for consecutive, overlapping 12-month offering periods, subject to certain reset provisions as defined in the plan.\nA total of 6,000,000 shares of Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2023, 13,414,259 additional\nshares of Class A common stock were reserved for issuance under the ESPP. On January 1, 2024, an additional 3,998,056 shares of Class A common stock were\nreserved for issuance under the ESPP. As of September 30, 2024, 5,717,872 shares of Class A common stock have been purchased under the 2019 ESPP. The number of\nshares reserved under the 2019 ESPP automatically increases on the first day of each calendar year beginning on January 1, 2020 in a number of shares equal to the\nleast of (i) 7,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, (ii) one percent of the outstanding shares of all classes of the Company’s common stock on the last day of the\nimmediately preceding fiscal year, or (iii) an amount determined by the administrator of the 2019 ESPP.\n9. Income Tax\nThe Company's tax provision and the resulting effective tax rate for interim periods is determined based upon its estimated annual effective tax rate adjusted\nfor the effect of discrete items arising in that quarter.\nThe Company's provision for income taxes has not been historically significant to the business as the Company has incurred operating losses to date. The\nprovision for income taxes consists of federal and state taxes in the U.S. and foreign taxes in jurisdictions in which the Company conducts business.\nThe Company recorded income tax expense (benefit) of $(0.7) million and $3.8 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\nand $0.1 million and $5.5 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate was 5.20% and (10.69)% for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and (0.92)% and (1.77)% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax\nrate differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the valuation allowances on the Company's deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that some or all\nof the Company's deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax benefits as part of the income tax provision and include accrued\ninterest and penalties with the related income tax liability on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets. To date, the Company has not recognized any\ninterest and penalties in its condensed consolidated statements of operations, nor has it accrued for or made payments for interest and penalties. The Company has no\nunrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nThe Company regularly assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some, or all, of\nits deferred tax assets will not be realizable in the future. In making that assessment, the Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, in the\njurisdictions in which it operates. As of September 30, 2024, the Company maintains its valuation allowance against its U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets.\nThe Company intends to maintain the valuation until there is sufficient positive evidence to support the reversal of the valuation allowance for U.S. federal and state tax\npurposes.\n10. Net Loss Per Share\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The\ndiluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period. For diluted net loss per share, the\ndilutive effect of outstanding awards is reflected by application of the treasury stock method and convertible securities by application of the if-converted method, as\napplicable. For purposes of this calculation, stock options, RSUs, PSUs, the 2029 Notes, the 2025 Notes, and stock purchase rights granted under the Company’s ESPP\nare considered to be common stock equivalents but are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share when including them has an anti-dilutive effect. Basic\nand diluted net loss per share are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights.\n36\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share data):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss $ (12,426) $ (12,100) $ (38,947) $ (314,011)\nWeighted-average shares used in computing net loss per share, basic and\ndiluted 412,229 389,307 406,785 381,697\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted $ (0.03) $ (0.03) $ (0.10) $ (0.82)\nThe following potentially dilutive outstanding shares were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the periods presented because\nincluding them would have had an anti-dilutive effect, or issuance of such shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions which were not satisfied by the\nend of the period (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRestricted stock units 15,340 21,520 15,340 21,520\n2025 Notes(1) 10,178 19,471 10,178 19,471\n2029 Notes(1) 21,821 — 21,821 —\nPerformance based restricted stock units 15,050 14,300 15,050 14,300\nESPP 1,467 385 1,467 385\nStock options 203 790 203 790\nTotal 64,059 56,466 64,059 56,466\n_______________\n(1) In connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Company entered into the Capped Calls, which were not included for purposes of calculating the number of diluted shares outstanding, as their effect\nwould have been anti-dilutive. The Capped Calls are expected to reduce the potential dilution to the Company's Class A common stock (or, in the event a conversion of the Notes are settled in cash, to\nreduce the cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion of the Notes the Company's Class A common stock price exceeds the conversion price of the Notes. Refer to Note 7\n“Debt” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information.\n11. Related Party Transactions\nThe Company's transactions with related parties were immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n12. Restructuring\nSeptember 2024 Restructuring Plan\nIn September 2024, the Company announced a restructuring plan related to its bikes and scooters transportation mode as part of its efforts to align strategic\npriorities and reduce operating costs. The plan involved the disposal of certain types of bikes and scooters and the termination of approximately 1% of the Company's\nemployees. As a result of the restructuring plan, in the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded $13.4 million in fixed asset disposals, $10.8 million in other current\nassets disposals and other costs, $10.6 million in accelerated depreciation of fixed assets and $1.5 million in employee severance and other employee costs. As a result\nof the above, the Company incurred restructuring charges of $36.4 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The restructuring plan has been substantially\ncompleted and there may be immaterial restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nThe following table summarizes the above restructuring related charges by line item within the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations\nwhere they were recorded in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (in thousands):\n37\nTable of Contents\nSeverance and Other Other Current Assets\nEmployee Costs Fixed Asset Disposals Disposals and Other Costs Accelerated Depreciation Total\nCost of revenue $ — $ 13,427 $ 10,812 $ 9,957 $ 34,196\nOperation and support 396 — — — 396\nResearch and development 1,009 — — 172 1,181\nSales and marketing — — — — —\nGeneral and administrative 120 — — 485 605\nTotal $ 1,525 $ 13,427 $ 10,812 $ 10,614 $ 36,378\nApril 2023 Restructuring Plan\nIn April 2023, the Company announced a restructuring plan as part of its efforts to reduce operating costs. The plan involved the termination of approximately\n1,072 employees, representing 26% of the Company's employees. As a result of the restructuring plan, in the second quarter of 2023, the Company recorded\n$47.2 million in employee severance and other employee costs and $9.7 million in net stock-based compensation expense related to equity compensation for employees\nimpacted by the plan of termination. The Company also recorded $6.3 million in impairment charges, fixed asset write-offs, accelerated depreciation and other costs to\nreal estate operating lease right-of-use assets, which was primarily related to the cease use of certain facilities. As a result of the above, the Company incurred net\nrestructuring charges of $63.3 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The restructuring plan has been completed as of the quarter ended June 30, 2023.\nThe following table summarizes the above restructuring related charges by line item within the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations\nwhere they were recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 (in thousands):\nRight-of-Use Asset\nSeverance and Other Impairments and Other\nStock-Based Compensation Employee Costs Costs Accelerated Depreciation Total\nCost of revenue $ 667 $ 3,204 $ — $ — $ 3,871\nOperation and support 259 3,054 5,268 669 9,250\nResearch and development 4,539 21,254 — — 25,793\nSales and marketing 1,045 5,191 — — 6,236\nGeneral and administrative 3,213 14,535 400 — 18,148\nTotal $ 9,723 $ 47,238 $ 5,668 $ 669 $ 63,298\nNovember 2022 Restructuring Plan\nIn November 2022, the Company announced a restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses. As a result of the restructuring plan, in the fourth quarter of\n2022, the Company recorded $29.5 million in employee severance and other employee costs and $9.5 million in net stock-based compensation expense related to equity\ncompensation for employees impacted by the plan of termination.\nThe Company’s plan of termination also included restructuring charges related to a decision to exit and sublease or cease use of certain facilities to align with\nthe Company’s anticipated operating needs. The Company reassessed its real estate asset groups and estimated the fair value of the space to be subleased using current\nmarket conditions. Where the carrying value of the individual asset groups exceeded their fair value, an impairment charge was recognized for the difference. During\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, this included $55.3 million in impairment charges related to real estate operating lease right-of-use assets, $23.9 million in\naccelerated depreciation of certain fixed assets and $2.1 million in write-off fixed assets not yet placed into service. As a result of the above, the Company incurred net\nrestructuring charges of $120.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2022.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the Company finalized the exit of certain leases as part of the plan of termination and the Company completed a transaction for the\ndivestiture of certain assets related to the Company’s first party vehicle services business. As a result, the Company recorded $10.5 million in impairment charges\nrelated to the cease use of certain facilities to real estate operating lease right-of-use assets and other costs, which included $9.1 million of future payments associated\nwith exiting certain facilities. The Company also incurred employee related charges, which include employee severance, benefits and stock-based compensation in the\nfirst quarter of 2023. As a result of the above, the Company incurred net restructuring charges of $24.4 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The restructuring\nplan has been completed as of the quarter ended March\n38\nTable of Contents\n31, 2023.\nThe following table summarizes the above restructuring related charges by line item within the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations\nwhere they were recorded in the quarter ended March 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nRight-of-Use Asset\nSeverance and Other\nStock-Based Compensation Impairments and Other Accelerated Depreciation Total\nEmployee Costs\nCosts\nCost of revenue $ — $ 1,101 $ — $ — $ 1,101\nOperation and support 205 3,127 9,453 305 13,090\nResearch and development — 20 2,534 — 2,554\nSales and marketing — 14 — — 14\nGeneral and administrative — 64 7,604 16 7,684\nTotal $ 205 $ 4,326 $ 19,591 $ 321 $ 24,443\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were $0.6 million in restructuring-related liabilities. As of December 31, 2023, there were no restructuring-related liabilities.\n13. Variable Interest Entities\nVIEs Related to Light Vehicles\nAs part of its acquisition of PBSC, the Company acquired several joint ventures (“JVs”) which were deemed to be variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in\naccordance with ASC 810 Consolidation on the acquisition date. The Company determined that PBSC is the primary beneficiary of one of the acquired VIEs, in which\nit owns an 80% equity interest, as PBSC has the power to direct the majority of the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance, the\nobligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits. As PBSC is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interest, revenues and\noperating results are included in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Subsequent to the acquisition, PBSC entered into additional joint ventures deemed to\nbe VIEs which were accounted for under the equity method which were immaterial.\nThe acquisition date fair value of the VIEs acquired as part of the PBSC acquisition was $22.2 million, which exceeded the carrying value and was recorded\nwithin other investments in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nOther than the VIE of which PBSC owns an 80% equity interest, the Company has determined that PBSC does not direct the activities that would significantly\naffect the economic performance of these VIEs. Therefore, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs. As a result, the Company accounts for its\ninvestment in these VIEs under the equity method, and they are not consolidated into the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, the\nCompany recognizes its proportionate share of the reported profits or losses of these VIEs in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations, and as an adjustment to its investment in VIEs in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The profits and losses of these unconsolidated VIEs were not\nmaterial to the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nThe maximum potential financial statement loss the Company would incur if these VIEs were to default on all their obligations would be the loss of the\ncarrying value of these investments as well as any current or future investments, if any, PBSC were to make which was immaterial as of September 30, 2024.\nOther VIEs\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company contributed a business to a privately held company in exchange for an equity interest and a seat on the board\nof directors of such company. This privately held company was determined to be a VIE for which the Company lacks the power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the entity's economic performance. As the Company is not the primary beneficiary, it does not consolidate the VIE. However, due to the Company's\nability to exercise significant influence, the investment will be accounted for under the equity method. The investment was recorded at its initial fair value of\n$12.9 million and represents the Company's maximum exposure to the VIE. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there was no change in the Company's claim\non the net assets of the investment and therefore, the Company did not recognize an equity method gain or loss nor was there an impairment of the investment.\n39\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements included in\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Report”). As discussed in the section titled “Note About Forward-\nLooking Statements,” the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to such\ndifferences include those identified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our\n2023 Annual Report. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. Our fiscal year ends December\n31.\nOur Business\nLyft, Inc. (the “Company” or “Lyft”) started a movement to revolutionize transportation. In 2012, we launched our peer-to-peer marketplace for on-demand\nridesharing and have continued to pioneer innovations. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United States and Canada. We have\nan important purpose, which is to serve and connect. We strive to get riders out into the world so they can live their lives together, and to provide drivers a way to work\nthat gives them control over their time and money.\nOur ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the “Lyft App”) in cities across the United States and in select cities\nin Canada. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the “Lyft Platform”) that powers rides and connections\nevery day. We leverage our technology platform, the scale and density of our user network and insights from a significant number of rides to improve our ridesharing\nmarketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. We’ve also taken steps to ensure our network is well positioned to benefit from technological innovation in mobility.\nOur offerings on the Lyft App include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light\nVehicles”) for shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is generated from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We collect service fees and commissions from\ndrivers for their use of our ridesharing marketplace. As drivers accept more rider leads, Gross Bookings and Rides increase, driving more revenue. We also generate\nrevenue from licensing and data access agreements, the sale of bikes and bike station software and hardware sales, advertising services, riders renting Light Vehicles,\ndrivers renting vehicles through Express Drive and by making our ridesharing marketplace available to organizations through our Lyft Business offerings, such as our\nConcierge and Lyft Pass programs.\nRiders and drivers want and value choice, and we believe there remains an opportunity for growth in our marketplace. In July 2024, we launched price lock, a\nnew subscription offering that caps the price of a rider's regular and scheduled rides during the rider's chosen pickup time. In February 2024, we made the commitment\nto drivers that after external fees are subtracted, their guaranteed share of rider payments will be 70% or more each week. In September 2023, we launched Women+\nConnect, a new feature that offers women and nonbinary drivers the option to turn on a preference within the Lyft App to prioritize matches with nearby women and\nnonbinary riders and in 2024, we extended Women+ Connect nationwide. We are focused on delivering a great rideshare experience and will continue to innovate for\ndrivers and riders, creating an increasingly differentiated service over time. We are committed to building a durable, healthy and profitable business for riders, drivers\nand shareholders. In the second quarter of 2024, we achieved net income for the first time in our operating history.\nAdditionally, we aim to advocate through our commitment to social and environmental responsibility. Through our Lyft Up initiatives, we’re working to make\nsure people have access to affordable, reliable transportation to get where they need to go - no matter their income or zip code. We can’t talk about work that serves\ncustomer needs and social goals without mentioning our responsibility to our shared environment - the air we breathe and the resilience of communities we serve. We’re\nworking to make the Lyft Platform more sustainable by helping drivers transition to electric vehicles (“EVs”), riders take more sustainable transportation modes, and\nbusinesses reduce their carbon footprint. We’ve achieved significant growth in EV rides on our platform by investing in EV driver incentives, expanding the Express\nDrive EV rental program, helping drivers access discounted fast charging and advocating for smart EV policy.\nWe believe many users are loyal to Lyft because of our values, brand and commitment to social and environmental responsibility. Our values, brand and focus\non customer experience are key differentiators for our business. We continue to believe that users are increasingly choosing services, including a transportation network,\nbased on brand affinity and value alignment and we aim to make it easy for both drivers and riders to choose Lyft every time.\n40\nTable of Contents\nRecent Developments\nRestructuring Activities\nOn September 4, 2024, we announced a restructuring plan of our bikes and scooters transportation mode as part of our efforts to align strategic priorities and\nreduce operating costs. As a result, we incurred restructuring charges of $36.4 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 12 “Restructuring” to the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding this reduction in workforce.\nTransactions Related to the Issuance of the 2029 Notes\nIn February 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to our Revolving Credit Agreement to, among other things: (a) solely for the purposes of the financial\ncovenant test, replace total leverage with total net leverage, which allows the Company to subtract the lesser of (i)(x) to the extent free cash flow for the most recently\nended trailing four quarters is greater than $100.0 million, $300.0 million and (y) otherwise, $200.0 million and (ii) the amount of unrestricted cash and cash\nequivalents (as defined in Amendment No. 2 to the Revolving Credit Agreement) on its condensed consolidated balance sheets as of the calculation date and (b) permit\nthe Company to repurchase up to a specified amount of the Company’s common stock with the proceeds of a convertible note offering.\nIn February 2024, we completed an offering of $460 million aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers\npursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We used the net proceeds of the offering to (1) repurchase a portion of our 2025 Notes\nconcurrently with the pricing of the offering in separate and privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of the 2025 Notes, (2) pay the cost of the 2029\nCapped Calls and (3) purchase approximately $50 million of the Class A common stock from institutional investors through one of the initial purchasers of the 2029\nNotes or its affiliate, acting as Lyft’s agent, at a price per share equal to the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on\nthe date of the pricing of the 2029 Notes. Refer to Note 7 “Debt” and Note 8 \"Common Stock\" to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information\nregarding these transactions.\n41\nTable of Contents\nFinancial and Operational Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2023 to 2024 % Change\n(in millions, except percentages)\nGAAP Financial Measures\nRevenue $ 1,522.7 $ 1,157.6 32%\nTotal costs and expenses $ 1,579.4 $ 1,197.7 32%\nLoss from operations $ (56.7) $ (40.2) (41)%\nNet loss $ (12.4) $ (12.1) (2)%\nNet loss as a percentage of revenue (0.8)% (1.0)%\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ 264.0 $ 2.3 11,378%\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities $ (6.7) $ (134.1) 95%\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (35.4) $ (22.7) (56)%\nKey Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nActive Riders 24.4 22.4 9%\nRides 216.7 187.4 16%\nGross Bookings $ 4,108.4 3,554.1 16%\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) $ 107.3 $ 92.0 17%\nNet loss as a percentage of Gross Bookings (0.3)% (0.3)%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) 2.6 % 2.6 %\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss)(1) $ 118.1 $ 92.3 28%\nFree cash flow(1)(2) $ 242.8 $ (30.0) 909%\n___________\n(1) For more information regarding our use of our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.\n(2) Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and scooter fleet.\n42\nTable of Contents\nDefinitions of Key Metrics\nActive Riders\nThe number of Active Riders is a key indicator of the scale of our user community.\nWe define Active Riders as all riders who take at least one ride during a quarter where the Lyft Platform processes the transaction. An Active Rider is identified\nby a unique phone number. If a rider has two mobile phone numbers or changed their phone number and that rider took rides using both phone numbers during the\nquarter, that person would count as two Active Riders. If a rider has a personal and business profile tied to the same mobile phone number, that person would be\nconsidered a single Active Rider. If a ride has been requested by an organization using our Concierge offering for the benefit of a rider, we exclude this rider in the\ncalculation of Active Riders unless the ride is accessible in that rider’s Lyft App.\nThe increase in the number of Active Riders in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was\ndue primarily to our focus on rider engagement, improved retention and overall marketplace health.\nRides\nRides represent the level of usage of our multimodal platform.\nWe define Rides as the total number of rides including rideshare and bike and scooter rides completed using our multimodal platform that contribute to our\nrevenue. These include any Rides taken through our Lyft App. If multiple riders take a private rideshare ride, including situations where one party picks up another\nparty on the way to a destination, or splits the bill, we count this as a single rideshare ride. Each unique segment of a Shared Ride is considered a single Ride. For\nexample, if two riders successfully match in Shared Ride mode and both complete their Rides, we count this as two Rides. We have largely shifted away from Shared\nRides, and now only offer Shared Rides in limited markets. We include all Rides taken by riders via our Concierge offering, even though such riders may be excluded\nfrom the definition of Active Riders unless the ride is accessible in that rider’s Lyft App.\nThe increase in Rides in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due primarily to our\nimproved marketplace health, which resulted in an increase in Active Riders and increased ride frequency.\nGross Bookings and Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings)\nGross Bookings is a key indicator of the scale and impact of our overall platform.\nWe define Gross Bookings as the total dollar value of transactions invoiced to rideshare riders including any applicable taxes, tolls and fees, excluding tips to\ndrivers. Gross Bookings also includes amounts invoiced for other offerings, including but not limited to: Express Drive vehicle rentals, bike and scooter rentals, and\namounts recognized for subscriptions, bike and bike station hardware and software sales, media, sponsorships, partnerships, and licensing and data access agreements.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by Gross Bookings for the same\nperiod. For the definition of Adjusted EBITDA, refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.\nThe increase in Gross Bookings in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due primarily\nto Rides growth which benefited from increased ride frequency, which is demonstrated by Rides growth exceeding Active Riders growth, and continued improvements\nin marketplace health.\nNet loss as a percentage of Gross Bookings and Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) in the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 were relatively flat due primarily to Rides growth as well as our cost-restructuring\nefforts initiated in previous years which helped us to partially offset the impact of higher variable costs, including certain insurance costs, investments in rider\nengagement and higher legal expenses to net loss and Adjusted EBITDA.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of condensed\nconsolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses\nand related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nActual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial\nstatement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected.\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2023, except as described below.\n43\nTable of Contents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for recently issued accounting\npronouncements not yet adopted as of the date of this report.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue consists of revenue recognized from fees paid by drivers for use of our Lyft Platform offerings, Concierge platform fees from organizations that use\nour Concierge offering, subscription fees paid by riders to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform, revenue from bikes and bike station hardware and\nsoftware sales, revenue from licensing and data access agreements and revenue from arrangements to provide advertising services to third parties that are interested in\nreaching users of our platform. Revenue derived from these offerings is recognized in accordance with ASC 606 as described in the Critical Accounting Estimates\nabove and in Note 2 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue also consists of rental revenues recognized through leases or subleases primarily from Flexdrive and our network of Light Vehicles, which includes\nrevenue generated from single-use ride fees paid by riders of Light Vehicles. Revenue derived from these offerings is recognized in accordance with ASC 842 as\ndescribed in the Critical Accounting Estimates above and in Note 2 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nWe offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration or if we\ncannot reasonably estimate the fair value of goods or services received.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs directly related to revenue generating transactions through our multimodal platform which primarily includes\ninsurance costs, payment processing charges, and other costs. Insurance costs consist of insurance generally required under TNC and city regulations for ridesharing,\nand bike and scooter rentals and also includes occupational hazard insurance for drivers. Payment processing charges include merchant fees, chargebacks and failed\ncharges. Other costs included in cost of revenue are hosting and platform-related technology costs, personnel-related compensation costs, depreciation, amortization of\ntechnology-related intangible assets, asset write-off charges and costs related to Flexdrive, which include vehicle lease expenses and remarketing gains and losses\nrelated to the sale of vehicles. Gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenue.\nOperations and Support\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs of local operations teams and teams who provide phone, email and\nchat support to users, Light Vehicle fleet operations support costs, driver background checks and onboarding costs, fees paid to third-parties providing operations\nsupport, facilities costs and certain car rental fleet support costs. Light Vehicle fleet operations support costs include general repairs and maintenance, and other\ncustomer support activities related to repositioning bikes and scooters for rider convenience, cleaning and safety checks.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs and facilities costs. Research and development costs are\nexpensed as incurred.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of rider incentives, personnel-related compensation costs, driver incentives for referring new drivers or riders,\nadvertising expenses, rider refunds and marketing partnerships with third parties. Sales and marketing costs are expensed as incurred.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs, professional services fees, certain insurance costs that are\ngenerally not required under TNC regulations, certain loss contingency expenses including legal accruals and settlements, insurance claims administrative fees, policy\nspend, depreciation, facilities costs and other corporate costs. General and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest incurred on our 2025 Notes and 2029 Notes, as well as the related amortization of deferred debt issuance costs\nand debt discount. Interest expense also includes interest incurred on our Non-revolving Loan and our Master Vehicle Loan.\n44\nTable of Contents\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, sublease income and restricted and unrestricted short-term\ninvestments.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nOur provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists of federal and state taxes in the U.S. and foreign taxes in jurisdictions in which we conduct business. As\nwe expand the scale of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. and foreign taxation of such activities may increase our overall provision for\n(benefit from) income taxes in the future.\nWe have a valuation allowance for our U.S. deferred tax assets, including federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs. We expect to maintain\nthis valuation allowance until it becomes more likely than not that the benefit of our federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our historical condensed consolidated statements of operations data:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nRevenue $ 1,522,692 $ 1,157,550 $ 4,235,739 $ 3,179,004\nCosts and expenses\nCost of revenue 888,255 644,500 2,463,135 1,800,091\nOperations and support 117,462 118,763 336,238 325,338\nResearch and development 104,447 109,229 303,277 460,745\nSales and marketing 215,779 129,947 537,621 355,055\nGeneral and administrative 253,436 195,290 742,332 653,228\nTotal costs and expenses 1,579,379 1,197,729 4,382,603 3,594,457\nLoss from operations (56,687) (40,179) (146,864) (415,453)\nInterest expense (7,362) (6,209) (22,262) (17,793)\nOther income (expense), net 50,941 34,399 133,941 124,689\nLoss before income taxes (13,108) (11,989) (35,185) (308,557)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes (682) 111 3,762 5,454\nNet loss $ (12,426) $ (12,100) $ (38,947) $ (314,011)\n45\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the components of our condensed consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nCosts and expenses\nCost of revenue 58.3 55.7 58.2 56.6\nOperations and support 7.7 10.3 7.9 10.2\nResearch and development 6.9 9.4 7.2 14.5\nSales and marketing 14.2 11.2 12.7 11.2\nGeneral and administrative 16.6 16.9 17.5 20.5\nTotal costs and expenses 103.7 103.5 103.5 113.1\nLoss from operations (3.7) (3.5) (3.5) (13.1)\nInterest expense (0.5) (0.5) (0.5) (0.6)\nOther income (expense), net 3.3 3.0 3.2 3.9\nLoss before income taxes (0.9) (1.0) (0.8) (9.7)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes — — 0.1 0.2\nNet loss (0.8)% (1.0)% (0.9)% (9.9)%\nComparison of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023\nRevenue\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\n(in thousands, except for percentages)\nRevenue $ 1,522,692 $ 1,157,550 32 % $ 4,235,739 $ 3,179,004 33 %\nRevenue increased $365.1 million, or 32%, in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due\nprimarily to an increase of 16% in Rides and 9% in Active Riders as we benefited from increased ride frequency, which is demonstrated by Rides growth exceeding\nActive Riders growth, and continued improvements in marketplace health. Investments in driver supply, which are recorded as a reduction to revenue, decreased by\n$79.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same quarter in the prior year as driver supply on the platform benefited from organic\ngrowth and drivers spending more time on the platform.\nRevenue increased $1.1 billion, or 33%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due\nprimarily to an increase of 18% in Rides as we benefited from continued improvements in marketplace health. Investments in driver supply, which are recorded as a\nreduction to revenue, decreased by $283.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year.\nWe expect revenue will fluctuate based upon factors such as ride volume, driver supply, pricing, incentives and seasonality specifically related to our network\nof Light Vehicles.\nCost of Revenue\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\n(in thousands, except for percentages)\nCost of revenue $ 888,255 $ 644,500 38 % $ 2,463,135 $ 1,800,091 37 %\nCost of revenue increased $243.8 million, or 38%, in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe increase was due primarily to a $187.0 million increase in insurance costs driven by recent economic factors including the high inflationary environment, increased\nlitigation, and higher than expected paid losses across the commercial auto industry as well as an increase in ride volume. There was also a $34.2 million increase in\nrestructuring costs related to the restructuring events in the third quarter of 2024, consisting of (i) $13.4 million in fixed asset\n46\nTable of Contents\ndisposals, (ii) $10.8 million in other current assets disposals and other costs and (iii) $10.0 million in accelerated depreciation of fixed assets, and a $24.0 million\nincrease in transaction fees driven by higher ride volume.\nCost of revenue increased $663.0 million, or 37%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe increase was due primarily to a $571.4 million increase in insurance costs driven by recent economic factors including the high inflationary environment, increased\nlitigation, and higher than expected paid losses across the commercial auto industry as well as an increase in ride volume. There was also a $61.8 million increase in\ntransaction fees driven by higher ride volume and a $29.2 million increase in restructuring costs in 2024 compared to 2023.\nWe expect to see cost of revenue increase in the near term on a year-over-year basis due to higher insurance costs driven by the renewals of our third party\ninsurance agreements.\nOperations and Support\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\n(in thousands, except for percentages)\nOperations and support $ 117,462 $ 118,763 (1)% $ 336,238 $ 325,338 3 %\nOperations and support expenses were relatively flat in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30,\n2023. Operations and support expenses included a $5.2 million decrease in facilities costs and a $3.5 million decrease in Light Vehicle fleet operations support costs.\nThese decreases were partially offset by a $3.4 million increase in Flexdrive related costs.\nOperations and support expenses increased $10.9 million, or 3%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to increases of $16.9 million in driver onboarding costs and rider and driver support costs, $13.2 million in Light\nVehicle fleet operations support costs and $10.3 million Flexdrive related costs. These increases were partially offset by a $19.7 million decrease in facilities costs, a\n$6.4 million decrease in stock-based compensation, a $4.2 million decrease in personnel-related costs and a $3.9 million decrease in depreciation driven by\nrestructuring events initiated in prior years, which included reductions in headcount and the cease use of certain facilities.\nResearch and Development\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\n(in thousands, except for percentages)\nResearch and development $ 104,447 $ 109,229 (4)% $ 303,277 $ 460,745 (34)%\nResearch and development expenses decreased $4.8 million, or 4%, in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.

Because Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin\n(calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) facilitate internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use these measures\nfor business planning purposes. Net loss is the most directly comparable financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA.\nWe calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss, adjusted for:\n• interest expense;\n• other income (expense), net;\n• provision for (benefit from) income taxes;\n• depreciation and amortization;\n• stock-based compensation;\n• payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation;\n• sublease income;\n• restructuring charges, if any;\n• net amount from claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement, if any;\n• transaction costs related to certain legacy auto insurance liabilities, if any; and\n• costs related to acquisitions and divestitures, if any.\n49\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by Gross Bookings for the\nsame period.\nWe announced restructuring plans in the fourth quarter of 2022, second quarter of 2023 and third quarter of 2024 to reduce operating expenses and align\nstrategic priorities. We believe the costs associated with the restructurings are distinguishable from ongoing operating costs and do not reflect current or expected\nperformance of our ongoing operations. We believe the adjustment to exclude the costs related to restructuring from Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors by\nenabling them to better assess our ongoing operating performance and provide for better comparability with our historically disclosed Adjusted EBITDA amounts.\nRefer to Note 12 “Restructuring” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding these restructuring plans.\nWe sublease certain office space and earn sublease income. Sublease income is included within other income, net on our condensed consolidated statement of\noperations, while the related lease expense is included within operating expenses and loss from operations. We believe the adjustment to include sublease income to\nAdjusted EBITDA is useful to investors by enabling them to better assess our operating performance, including the benefits of recent transactions, by presenting\nsublease income as a contra-expense to the related lease charges within our operating expenses.\nFor more information regarding the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) and a\nreconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, see the section titled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss)\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) is a measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends. Net loss is the most\ndirectly comparable financial measure to Adjusted Net Income (Loss).\nWe define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as net loss adjusted for:\n• amortization of intangible assets;\n• stock-based compensation;\n• payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation;\n• restructuring charges, if any;\n• net amount from claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement, if any;\n• transaction costs related to certain legacy auto insurance liabilities, if any;\n• costs related to acquisitions and divestitures, if any; and\n• impairment charges, if any.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is a measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe free cash flow is a useful\nindicator of liquidity that provides our management, board of directors, and investors with information about our ability to generate or use cash to enhance the strength\nof our balance sheet, further invest in our business and pursue potential strategic initiatives.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and scooter fleet.\nFree cash flow has certain limitations, including that it does not reflect our future contractual commitments and it does not represent the total increase or\ndecrease in our cash balance for a given period. Free cash flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of\nour ability to fund our cash needs. For more information regarding the limitations of free cash flow and a reconciliation of net cash provided by (used in) operating\nactivities to free cash flow, see the section titled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation\nof our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors\nconcerning our financial performance. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition,\nother companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Furthermore, these measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain\nexpenses that are reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations that are\n50\nTable of Contents\nnecessary to run our business.

The year over year improvement to net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from\n$(314.0) million to $(38.9) million was a result of\n52\nTable of Contents\nincrease in our revenues and the actions we have taken to reduce our operating expenses. Net loss was also offset by non-cash adjustments for stock-based\ncompensation expense of $254.8 million, which decreased year over year due to a reduction in headcount driven by the restructuring activities initiated in prior years,\nand depreciation and amortization expense of $115.2 million. The changes in working capital were primarily driven by insurance, which saw (i) an increase in our\ninsurance reserves due to a rise in commercial auto insurance rates on a per mile basis compared to the prior year, an increase in ride volume in 2024 compared to\nprevious periods and strategic risk management decisions to retain additional risk in certain markets, (ii) an increase in accounts payable which was primarily due to the\ntiming of insurance claim payments and (iii) an increase in insurance-related accruals. There was also an increase in certain loss contingencies including legal and tax\naccruals. These were partially offset by (i) increases to prepaid expenses for deposits related to our annual insurance renewals and (ii) a decrease to our operating lease\nliabilities related to ordinary payments for our real estate operating leases.\nCash used in operating activities was $141.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This consisted primarily of a net loss of $314.0 million.\nThis was offset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $392.9 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $85.4 million. The changes in working\ncapital were primarily driven by (i) a decrease in our insurance reserves as insurance payments outpaced accruals in the period and (ii) increases to prepaid expenses for\ndeposits related to our annual insurance renewals. These were offset by impairments of operating lease right-of-use assets as part of the restructuring activities initiated\nin the fourth quarter of 2022.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $323.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable\nsecurities of $3.0 billion partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $2.7 billion.\nCash provided by investing activities was $706.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which primarily consisted of proceeds from sales and\nmaturities of marketable securities of $3.1 billion. This was partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $2.4 billion.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities was $102.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which primarily consisted of repayment of loans of $61.8\nmillion and principal payments on finance lease obligations of $35.4 million. This also included a net cash inflow of $0.2 million related to transactions related to the\nissuance of our 2029 Notes which included $460.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes and expenditures of $350.0 million related to the settlement\nof the 2025 Notes, $50.0 million related to the repurchase of Class A common stock, $47.9 million related to the purchase of capped calls and $11.9 million in payments\nof debt issuance costs.\nCash used in financing activities was $106.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which primarily consisted of repayment of loans of $60.5\nmillion and principal payments on finance lease obligations of $35.9 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of approximately $770.3 million and short-term investments of\napproximately $1.2 billion, exclusive of restricted cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.5 billion, and a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal\namount of $420.0 million as described below. Cash and cash equivalents consisted of institutional money market funds, certificates of deposits, commercial paper,\ncorporate bonds and U.S. government and agency securities that have an original maturity of less than three months and are readily convertible into known amounts of\ncash. Also included in cash and cash equivalents are certain money market deposit accounts and cash in transit from payment processors for credit and debit card\ntransactions. Short-term investments consisted of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds, term deposits and U.S. government and agency securities,\nwhich mature in 12 months or less. Restricted cash, cash equivalents and investments consisted primarily of amounts held in separate trust accounts and restricted bank\naccounts as collateral for insurance purposes. That portion of our cash and cash equivalents that is not invested is held at several large financial institutions and our\ninvestments are focused on the preservation of capital, fulfillment of our liquidity needs, and maximization of investment performance within the parameters set forth in\nour investment policy and subject to market conditions. The investment policy sets forth credit rating minimums, permissible allocations, and limits our exposure to\nspecific investment types. We believe these policies mitigate our exposure to any risk concentrations.\nOn November 3, 2022, we entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with certain lenders which provides for a $420 million senior secured revolving secured\ncredit facility (\"Revolving Credit Facility\") maturing on the earlier of (i) November 3, 2027 and (ii) February 13, 2025, if, as of such date, our Liquidity (as defined in\nthe Revolving Credit Agreement) minus the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes outstanding on such date is less than $1.25 billion. We are obligated to pay\ninterest on loans under the Revolving Credit Facility and other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including an upfront fee and an unused\ncommitment fee. The interest rate for the Revolving Credit Facility is determined based\n53\nTable of Contents\non calculations using certain market rates as set forth in the Revolving Credit Agreement. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility contains restrictions on payments\nincluding cash payments of dividends. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to the amount of the facility, with a sublimit of $168 million for the\nissuance of letters of credit. We entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Revolving Credit Facility on December 12, 2023 and Amendment No. 2 on February 21, 2024\nwhich amended the existing agreement to, among other things: (a) solely for the purposes of the financial covenant test, replace total leverage with total net leverage,\nwhich allows us to subtract the lesser of (i)(x) to the extent free cash flow for the most recently ended trailing four quarters is greater than $100.0 million, $300.0\nmillion and (y) otherwise, $200.0 million and (ii) the amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (as defined in the Amended Agreement) on our condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets as of the calculation date and (b) permit us to repurchase up to a specified amount of our common stock with the proceeds of a convertible\nnote offering.\nWe collect the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers at the time the ride is delivered using the rider’s authorized payment method, and we\nretain any fees owed to us before making the remaining disbursement to drivers. Accordingly, we maintain no accounts receivable from drivers. Our contracts with\ninsurance providers require reinsurance premiums to be deposited into trust accounts with a third-party financial institution from which the insurance providers are\nreimbursed for claims payments. Our restricted reinsurance trust investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $1.2 billion and $837.3 million,\nrespectively.\nWe have $1.9 billion in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024. We also have the ability to borrow an\naggregate principal amount of up to $420.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, none of which has been drawn as of September 30, 2024, and $73.0 million in\nletters of credit were issued under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. We believe that this provides sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital,\ninclusive of short-term commitments such as the current portion of our convertible senior notes, and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months. In the\nquarter ended September 30, 2024, we reported a fourth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow and in the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we achieved net income\nfor the first time in our operating history. We plan to continue to actively manage and optimize our cash balances and liquidity, capital expenditures, working capital and\noperating expenses. In particular, we continue to actively monitor the impact of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, including tightening credit markets,\ninflation and changing interest rates and have made adjustments to our expenses and cash flow which include headcount reductions announced in the third quarter of\n2024, second quarter of 2023 and fourth quarter of 2022. We have also incurred restructuring charges related to the exit and sublease or cease use of certain facilities to\nalign with our anticipated operating needs in the first quarter of 2023. Refer to Note 12 “Restructuring” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for\ninformation regarding these reductions in workforce.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, the effectiveness of our efforts to align our expenses\nwith our current operating needs and short-term commitments, our ability to attract and retain drivers and riders on our platform, the continuing market acceptance of\nour offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, actual insurance payments for which we have made reserves, and the\nexpansion of sales and marketing activities. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services and technologies.\nFor example, we intend to invest further in EVs in order to achieve compliance with the California Clean Miles Standard which sets the target that 90% of rideshare\nmiles in California must be in EVs by the end of 2030; the Massachusetts’ Climate Bill; New York City's goal to get to 100% of rideshare rides in EVs or wheelchair\naccessible vehicles by 2030, and the City of Toronto’s push to bring the industry to 100% electric by 2030. From time to time, we have and we may in the future seek\nadditional equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures, strategic initiatives or investments and our ongoing operations, or to refinance our existing or future\nindebtedness. In the event that we decide, or are required, to seek additional financing from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or\nat all. The terms of any additional financings or refinancings may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility. If we raise additional funds through further\nissuances of equity or equity-linked securities, our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of us, and any new securities we issue could\nhave rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAs of September 30, 2024, there have been no other material changes from the contractual obligations and commitments previously disclosed in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates. Such fluctuations to date have not\nbeen significant.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1.9 billion, which consisted primarily of\ninstitutional money market funds, certificates of deposits, commercial paper,\n54\nTable of Contents\ncorporate bonds, U.S. government and agency securities, and term deposits, which each carry a degree of interest rate risk, and restricted cash, cash equivalents and\nrestricted investments of $1.5 billion. As of September 30, 2024, we had long-term debt of $1.0 billion, 39% of which consisted of the fixed-rate 2025 Notes we issued\nin May 2020, and 45% of which consisted of the fixed-rate 2029 Notes we issued in February 2024. A hypothetical 100 basis points change in interest rates would not\nhave a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of\nthe period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of\nsuch date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our\ninternal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,\nnot absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,\nand the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide\nabsolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-\nmaking can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some\npersons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future\nconditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due\nto inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n55\nTable of Contents\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nSee discussion of Legal Proceedings in Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with\nall of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations” and our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our Class A common stock. Our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not\nbelieve are material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. In that event,\nthe market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. For the purposes of this “Item 1A. Risk Factors”\nsection, “riders are passengers who request rides from drivers in our ridesharing marketplace and renters of a shared bike, scooter or automobile.\nRisk Factor Summary\nOur business

volatility of the trading price of our Class A common stock;\n• provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult; and\n• exclusive forum provisions in our bylaws.\nRisks Related to General Economic Factors\nA deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur business and results of operations are subject to global economic conditions. Deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, including slower growth or\nrecession, inflation and related high interest rates, increases to fuel and other energy costs or vehicle costs, changes in the labor market or decreases in consumer\nspending power or confidence, are likely to result in decreased discretionary spending and reduced demand for our platform. Further, changes in corporate spending,\nincluding cost-cuts and layoffs, may adversely impact business travel, commuting and other business-related expenditures and impact our Lyft Business customers. In\naddition, uncertainty and volatility in the banking and financial services sectors, inflation and high interest rates, increased fuel and other energy costs, increased labor\nand benefits costs and increased insurance costs have, and may continue to, put pressure on economic conditions, which has led, and could lead, to greater operating\nexpenses. For example, inflation has increased in recent years and is expected to further increase medical costs and vehicle repair costs, including increased prices of\nnew and used vehicle parts, which has resulted in increases in our insurance costs. Similarly, these factors, as well as increased fuel costs, increase our costs as well as\ncosts for drivers on our platform. Many of these factors are out of our control and make it difficult to accurately forecast gross bookings, revenues and operating results,\nparticularly in the long-term, and could negatively affect our ability to meet our target operating performance and our (and our strategic partners’) ability to make\ndecisions about future investments and strategies. Further, we may need to make changes to our business to respond to these conditions and be able to compete\neffectively. For example, as a result of the increase in gas prices at certain points in 2022, in order to support drivers on our platform, we implemented a temporary per\nride fuel surcharge in most markets, which we removed in September 2022. Similarly, we have adjusted our pricing in response to competitive pressures caused by\nchanges in our marketplace, which has in the past contributed to a decline in our revenue and may cause a decline in revenue in future quarters. An economic downturn\nresulting in a prolonged recessionary period would likely have a further adverse effect on our revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, economic downturns or other unexpected events.\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, hurricane, tornado, flood or significant power outage, could disrupt our operations, mobile networks,\nthe Internet or the operations of our third-party technology providers. In particular, our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region\nknown for seismic activity and increasingly for fires. The impact of climate change may increase these risks. In addition, any public health crises, such as the COVID-\n19 pandemic, other epidemics, political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war and other political or social instability and other geopolitical developments, or other\ncatastrophic events, whether in the United States or abroad, could adversely affect our operations or the economy as a whole. For example, we have offices and\nemployees in Belarus and Ukraine that have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the current war in the region, including displacement of our employees.\nThe impact of any natural disaster, act of terrorism or other disruption to us or our third-party providers’ abilities could result in driver supply and rider demand\nimbalances, decreased demand for our offerings or a delay in the provision of our offerings, or increase our costs and operating expenses, which could adversely affect\nour business, financial condition and results of operations. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be\ninadequate.\nRisks Related to Operational Factors\nOur limited operating history and our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter.\nWhile we have primarily focused on ridesharing since our ridesharing marketplace launched in 2012, our business continues to evolve. We regularly expand\nour platform features, offerings and services and change our pricing methodologies. Through the acquisition of PBSC Urban Solutions Inc. (\"PBSC\") in May 2022, we\nexpanded our business to include licensing\n58\nTable of Contents\nof certain of our technology and sales of bikes and stations. In recent periods, we have also reevaluated and changed our cost structure and focused our business model.\nFor example, in February 2023, we closed the sale of our vehicle service center business. Our evolving business, industry and markets make it difficult to evaluate our\nfuture prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. Risks and challenges we have faced and expect to face include our ability to:\n• forecast our gross bookings, revenue and operating results and budget for and manage our expenses;\n• attract new qualified drivers and new riders, and retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders in a cost-effective manner;\n• effectively and competitively price our services and determine appropriate pricing methodologies;\n• successfully develop new platform features, offerings and services to enhance the experience of users;\n• comply with existing and new or modified laws and regulations applicable to our business;\n• manage our platform and our business assets and expenses in light of economic and other developments, including changes in rider behavior and demand for\nour services;\n• plan for and manage capital expenditures for our current and future offerings, including our network of Light Vehicles and certain vehicles in the Express\nDrive program, and manage our supply chain and supplier relationships related to our current and future offerings;\n• develop, manufacture, source, deploy, sell, maintain and ensure utilization of our assets, including our network of Light Vehicles and certain vehicles in the\nExpress Drive program;\n• anticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in market dynamics in the markets in which we operate;\n• maintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\n• effectively manage our growth and business operations;\n• successfully expand our geographic reach and manage our international operations;\n• hire, integrate and retain talented people at all levels of our organization; and\n• right-size our real estate portfolio.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above as well as those described elsewhere in\nthis “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have an evolving financial\nmodel and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future gross bookings, revenue, expenses and earnings may not be as accurate as they would\nbe if we had a static financial model or operated in a more predictable market. We have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties\nfrequently experienced by growing companies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties,\nwhich we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially\nfrom our expectations and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur financial performance in recent periods may not be indicative of future performance, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nPrior to COVID-19, we grew rapidly. In 2020, due to COVID-19 and the related government and public health measures, our revenue declined significantly.\nAlthough our revenue has since recovered, the timeline for a full recovery of rideshare demand, driver supply and other aspects of our business in each of our markets is\nuncertain. Accordingly, our recent revenue growth rate and financial performance, including prior to the effects of COVID-19, the decline related to COVID-19 and\nrecent growth rates compared to periods in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, may not be indicative of our future performance. Further, we have incurred net losses\neach year since our inception, and we expect that our financial performance, including Adjusted EBITDA, will continue to fluctuate in future periods. We can provide\nno assurances that we will achieve or maintain Adjusted EBITDA profitability in the future, on a quarterly or annual basis, or that we will achieve or maintain\nprofitability on a GAAP basis.\nWhile we remain focused on operating efficiently, our expenses will likely increase in the future as we develop and launch new offerings and platform features,\nexpand in existing and new markets and continue to invest in our platform and customer engagement. In addition, certain costs, such as insurance and driver pay and\nincentives have increased or fluctuated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, macroeconomic factors and the development and maturation of our business and the\nrideshare industry, and may continue to do so. We may be unable to accurately predict these costs and our investments may not\n59\nTable of Contents\nresult in increased revenue or growth in our business. For example, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs and expenses associated with the\npassage of Proposition 22 in California, HB 2076 in Washington, and elsewhere, and implementation of operational changes as part of agreements with the New York\nand Massachusetts Attorneys General, including providing drivers in these states with new earnings opportunities and protections, including contributions towards on-\nthe-job injury insurance, other benefits and minimum guaranteed earnings. In addition, various jurisdictions have introduced legislation setting high earnings standards\nand increasing other costs to the business including insurance. Due to various factors, including inflation, we anticipate that our insurance costs will continue to increase\nand will impact our profitability. Furthermore, we have expanded over time to include more asset-intensive offerings such as our network of Light Vehicles and\nFlexdrive. These offerings and programs require significant capital investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance, depreciation, asset life and\nasset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets, such offerings are otherwise not successful or we decide to shut\ndown any such offerings, our investments may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition to the above, a\ndetermination in, resolution of, or settlement of, any legal proceeding related to driver classification matters may require us to significantly alter our existing business\nmodel and operations (including potentially suspending or ceasing operations in impacted jurisdictions), increase our costs and impact our ability to add qualified\ndrivers to our platform and grow our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our ability to\nachieve or maintain profitability in the future. Additionally, stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs and other equity awards is expected to continue to be a\nsignificant expense for the foreseeable future, and as of September 30, 2024, we had $237.4 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to all\nunvested awards, net of estimated forfeitures, that will be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.1 years. Any failure to increase our revenue\nsufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent\nbasis. If we are unable to successfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\nAs our business evolves, our revenue growth rates and results of operations will fluctuate due to a number of reasons, which may include changes in the\nmacroeconomic environment, slowing demand for our offerings, increasing competition or changes in market dynamics, a decrease in the growth of our overall market\nor market saturation, public health crises, increasing regulatory costs and challenges and resulting changes to our business model and our failure to capitalize on growth\nopportunities. If we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant losses in the future and may not be\nable to achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nThe market for TaaS networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting levels of supply and demand and frequent\nintroductions of new services and offerings. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new entrants in the market that may be well-\nestablished and enjoy greater resources or other strategic or technological advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to competitive challenges in a\ntimely manner, our competitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience fluctuations or a decline in market share, a decline in gross\nbookings, revenue or growth stagnation that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our market share has fluctuated over time\nand we have had to take actions, such as price cuts, that have negative impacts on our financial results in the short term, either because of decreased revenue or\nincreased investments, or both, that we believe will benefit our company in the long term.\nOur main ridesharing competitor in the United States and Canada is Uber, though we also compete with other transportation network companies and taxicab\nand livery companies, as well as traditional automotive manufacturers and technology companies. Our main competitors in bike and scooter sharing include Lime, Bird,\nFifteen, nextbike and Dott. We also compete with other manufacturers of bike and scooter sharing equipment for sales of such equipment, particularly in markets\noutside of the United States.\nAdditionally, there are other non-U.S.-based TaaS network companies, bike and scooter sharing companies, consumer vehicle rental companies, non-\nridesharing transportation network companies and traditional automotive manufacturers that may expand into the United States and Canada. There are also a number of\ncompanies developing autonomous vehicle technology and TaaS offerings that either are competing with us or may compete with us in the future, including Alphabet\n(Waymo), Amazon (Zoox), Aurora, Baidu, General Motors (Cruise), Motional, and Tesla as well as many other technology companies and automobile manufacturers\nand suppliers. We anticipate continued challenges from current competitors as well as from new entrants into the TaaS market.\nCertain of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, research and development, manufacturing and other\nresources, greater name recognition, longer operating histories or a larger user base than we do. They may be able to devote greater resources to the development,\npromotion and sale of offerings and offer lower prices than we do, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Further, they may have greater resources to\ndeploy towards\n60\nTable of Contents\nthe research, development and commercialization of new technologies, including autonomous vehicle technology or Light Vehicles, or they may have other financial,\ntechnical or resource advantages. These factors may allow our competitors or potential competitors to derive greater gross bookings, revenue and profits from their\nexisting user bases, attract and retain qualified drivers and riders at lower costs, offer more attractive pricing on their platforms or respond more quickly to new and\nemerging technologies, revenue opportunities and trends. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative or strategic relationships, or consolidate,\namongst themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources and offerings.\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, and if we are unable to compete\nsuccessfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur results of operations vary and are difficult to predict from period-to-period, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nOur results of operations have historically varied from period-to-period and we expect that our results of operations will continue to do so for a variety of\nreasons, many of which are outside of our control and difficult to predict. Because our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-\nyear, the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. We have presented many of the factors that may cause our results of\noperations to fluctuate in this “Risk Factors” section. Fluctuations in our results of operations may cause such results to fall below our financial guidance or other\nprojections, or the expectations of analysts or investors, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nThe ridesharing market and the market for our other offerings, such as our network of Light Vehicles, are still in relatively early stages of growth and development\nand if such markets do not continue to grow, grow more slowly than we expect or fail to grow as large or otherwise develop as we expect, our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nPrior to COVID-19, the ridesharing market grew rapidly, but it is still relatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to\ngrow, if at all. In addition, the market for our other offerings, such as our network of Light Vehicles, is relatively new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether demand\nfor bike and scooter sharing will continue to grow and achieve wide market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of people to\nwidely adopt ridesharing and our other offerings across a variety of use cases. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we paused our Shared Rides offerings, and we\nwere temporarily restricted from operating our scooter share program in one jurisdiction due to public health and safety measures. We had to suspend or discontinue\nthese offerings from time to time due to various concerns. In the event of significant public health concerns, such as COVID-19, or other events beyond our control, we\nmay be required or believe it is advisable to suspend such offerings again. If the public does not perceive ridesharing or our other offerings as beneficial, or chooses not\nto adopt them as a result of concerns regarding public health or safety, affordability, longer-term behavioral and social shifts due to the COVID-19 pandemic, or for\nother reasons, whether as a result of incidents on our platform or on our competitors’ platforms, health concerns, or otherwise, then the market for our offerings may not\nfurther develop, may develop more slowly than we expect or may not achieve the growth potential we expect. Additionally, from time to time we re-evaluate the\nmarkets in which we operate and the performance of our offerings, and we have discontinued and may in the future discontinue operations in certain markets as a result\nof such evaluations. For example, we now offer Shared Rides exclusively in connection with business-to-business partnerships and only in select markets. Any of the\nforegoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers on our platform, or to increase the utilization of our platform by existing drivers, our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers who satisfy our screening criteria and procedures and\nto increase their utilization of our platform. To attract and retain qualified drivers, we have, among other things, offered sign-up and referral bonuses and provided\naccess to third-party vehicle rental programs for drivers who do not have or do not wish to use their own vehicle. Drivers are generally able to switch between our\nplatform and competing platforms. If we do not continue to provide drivers with flexibility on our platform, compelling opportunities to increase earnings and other\nincentive programs, such as demand-based bonuses, that are comparable or superior to those of our competitors and other companies in the app-based work industry or\nother industries, or if drivers become dissatisfied with our programs and benefits or our requirements for drivers, including requirements regarding the vehicles they\ndrive, we may fail to attract new drivers, retain current drivers or increase their utilization of our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, strikes\nor other work stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a shortage of available\ndrivers relative to rider demand in certain markets and offered increased incentives to improve driver supply. Our revenue and results of operations have in prior periods\nbeen negatively impacted by supply incentives, and to the extent that driver availability remains limited and we offer increased incentives to improve supply, our\nrevenue and results of operations may be negatively impacted in the future. Additionally, following the\n61\nTable of Contents\npassage of Proposition 22 in California, drivers have been able to access the earning opportunities described in the ballot measure. In addition, in connection with\nsettlements with the New York and Massachusetts Attorneys General, the Company is continuing to implement certain operational changes that entail increased costs.\nFurther, other jurisdictions have adopted or may adopt similar laws and regulations, and we may reach similar or other settlements with other jurisdictions, any of which\nmay increase our expenses. Litigation seeking to reclassify drivers as employees is pending and/or threatened in multiple jurisdictions, including as described in the\n“Legal Proceedings” subheading in Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q. If such litigation is successful in one or more jurisdictions, we may be required to classify drivers as employees rather than independent contractors in those\njurisdictions, and we may incur significant expenses to resolve the matters at issue in the litigation. If this occurs, we may need to develop and implement an\nemployment model that we have not historically used or to cease operations, whether temporarily or permanently, in affected jurisdictions. We may face specific risks\nrelating to our ability to onboard drivers as employees, our ability to partner with third-party organizations to source drivers and our ability to effectively utilize\nemployee drivers to meet rider demand.\nIf drivers are unsatisfied with our partners, including our third-party vehicle rental partners, our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and to increase\ntheir utilization of our platform could be adversely affected. Further, incentives we provide to attract drivers could fail to attract and retain qualified drivers or fail to\nincrease utilization, or could have other unintended adverse consequences. In addition, changes in certain laws and regulations, including immigration, labor and\nemployment laws or background check requirements, may result in a shift or decrease in the pool of qualified drivers, which may result in increased competition for\nqualified drivers or higher costs of recruitment, operation and retention. As part of our business operations or research and development efforts, data on the vehicle may\nbe collected and drivers may be uncomfortable or unwilling to drive knowing that data is being collected. Other factors outside of our control, such as concerns about\npersonal health and safety, increases in the price of gasoline, vehicles or insurance, or concerns about the availability of government or other assistance programs if\ndrivers continue to drive on our platform, may also reduce the number of drivers on our platform or their utilization of our platform, or impact our ability to onboard\nnew drivers. If we fail to attract qualified drivers on favorable terms, fail to increase their utilization of our platform or lose qualified drivers to our competitors, we may\nnot be able to meet the demand of riders, including maintaining a competitive price of rides to riders, and our business, financial condition and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract new riders, or to increase utilization of our platform by existing riders, our business, financial condition and results of\noperations could be harmed.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract new riders, retain existing riders and increase utilization of our platform by current riders.\nRiders have a wide variety of options for transportation, including personal vehicles, rental cars, taxis, public transit and other ridesharing and bike and scooter sharing\nofferings. Rider preferences may also change from time to time. To expand our rider base, we must appeal to new riders who have historically used other forms of\ntransportation or other ridesharing or bike and scooter sharing platforms. We believe that our paid marketing initiatives have been and will continue to be critical in\npromoting awareness of our offerings, which in turn drives new rider growth and rider utilization. However, our reputation, brand and ability to build trust with existing\nand new riders may be adversely affected by complaints and negative publicity about us, our offerings, our policies, including our pricing algorithms and pricing\npolicies, the quality of our service, including timely pick-ups, drivers on our platform, or our competitors, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents.\nFurther, if existing and new riders do not perceive the transportation services provided by drivers on our platform to be reliable, safe and affordable, or if we fail to offer\nnew and relevant offerings and features on our platform, we may not be able to attract or retain riders or to increase their utilization of our platform. As we continue to\nexpand into new geographic areas, we will be relying in part on referrals from our existing riders to attract new riders, and therefore we must ensure that our existing\nriders remain satisfied with our offerings. In addition, we have experienced and may continue to experience seasonality in both ridesharing and Light Vehicle rentals\nduring the winter months, which may harm our ability to attract and retain riders during such periods. We have experienced volatility in the health of our overall\nmarketplace, and demand for our platform has not returned to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels in all markets. We cannot predict whether these impacts will continue,\nincluding longer term. If we fail to continue to grow our rider base, retain existing riders or increase the overall utilization of our platform by existing riders, we may\nnot be able to provide drivers with an adequate level of ride requests, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In\naddition, if we do not achieve sufficient utilization of our asset-intensive offerings such as our network of Light Vehicles, our business, financial condition and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely substantially on our wholly-owned subsidiary and deductibles to insure auto-related risks and on third-party insurance policies to insure and reinsure our\noperations-related risks. If our insurance or reinsurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance providers are unable to meet their\nobligations, we may not be able\n62\nTable of Contents\nto mitigate the risks facing our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom the time a driver becomes available to accept rides in the Lyft Driver App until the driver logs off and is no longer available to accept rides, we, through\nour wholly-owned insurance subsidiary and deductibles, often bear substantial financial risk with respect to auto-related incidents, including auto liability, uninsured\nand underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to\ncertain limits. To comply with certain United States and Canadian province insurance regulatory requirements for auto-related risks, we procure a number of third-party\ninsurance policies which provide the required coverage in such jurisdictions. In nearly all U.S. states, our insurance subsidiary reinsures a portion, which may change\nfrom time to time, of the auto-related risk from some third-party insurance providers. In connection with our reinsurance and deductible arrangements, we deposit funds\ninto trust accounts with a third-party financial institution from which some third-party insurance providers are reimbursed for claims payments. If we fail to comply\nwith state insurance regulatory requirements or other regulations governing insurance coverage, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\nadversely affected. If any of our third-party insurance providers or administrators who handle the claim on behalf of the third-party insurance providers become\ninsolvent, they could be unable to pay any claims that we make.\nWe also procure third-party insurance policies to cover various operations-related risks including employment practices liability, workers’ compensation,\nbusiness interruptions, cybersecurity and data breaches, crime, directors’ and officers’ liability and general business liabilities, including product liability. For certain\ntypes of operations-related risks or future risks related to our new and evolving offerings, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire insurance. In addition,\nwe may not obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate such operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolving offerings, and we may have to pay\nhigh premiums, self-insured retentions or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain. Additionally, if any of our insurance or reinsurance providers becomes insolvent, it\ncould be unable to pay any operations-related claims that we make. Certain losses may be excluded from insurance coverage including, but not limited to losses caused\nby intentional act, pollution, contamination, virus, bacteria, terrorism, war and civil unrest.\nThe amount of one or more auto-related claims or operations-related claims has exceeded and could continue to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage\nlimits, for which we have borne and could continue to bear a portion of the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-insured\nretentions or otherwise paid by our insurance subsidiary. Insurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles for many types of coverages and for a variety of\ncommercial risks and are likely to do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expenses could increase, or we may decide to raise our deductibles or self-\ninsured retentions when our policies are renewed or replaced to manage pricing pressure. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\naffected if (i) cost per claim, premiums or the number of claims significantly exceeds our historical experience, (ii) we experience a claim in excess of our coverage\nlimits, (iii) our insurance providers fail to pay on our insurance claims, (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided, (v) the number of claims and\naverage claim cost under our deductibles or self-insured retentions differs from historic averages, (vi) an insurance policy is canceled or non-renewed, or (vii) other\ninsurance providers for drivers on our platform become insolvent.\nOur actual losses may exceed our insurance reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe establish insurance reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported and any related estimable expenses, and we\nperiodically evaluate and, as necessary, adjust our actuarial assumptions and insurance reserves as our experience develops or new information is learned. We employ\nvarious predictive modeling and actuarial techniques and make numerous assumptions based on available historical experience and industry statistics to estimate our\ninsurance reserves. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related judgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult, subjective and speculative.\nWhile an independent actuarial firm periodically reviews our reserves for appropriateness and provides claims reserve valuations, a number of external factors can\naffect the actual losses incurred for any given claim, including but not limited to the length of time the claim remains open, increases in healthcare costs, increases in\nautomotive costs (including rental vehicles), legislative and regulatory developments, judicial developments and unexpected events such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSuch factors can impact the reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid as well as the actuarial assumptions used to estimate the reserves for claims incurred but not\nyet reported and any related estimable expenses for current and historical periods. The automotive insurance industry has experienced rising costs due to, among other\nthings, inflation, supply chain challenges, and the increasing cost of medical care, which has driven an increase in actual losses in recent periods, and we expect these\ncosts to continue to drive increased actual losses. Additionally, we have encountered in the past, and may encounter in the future, instances of insurance fraud, which\ncould increase our actual insurance-related costs. For any of the foregoing reasons, our actual losses for claims and related expenses may deviate, individually or in the\naggregate, from the insurance reserves reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements. If we determine that our estimated insurance reserves are\ninadequate, we may be required to increase such reserves at the time of the determination, which could\n63\nTable of Contents\nresult in an increase to our net loss in the period in which the shortfall is determined and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. For\nexample, we have in the past experienced adverse development where we have needed to increase historical reserves attributable to liabilities in prior periods.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party insurance service providers for our auto-related insurance claims, and if such providers fail to service insurance claims\nto our expectations or we do not maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party insurance service providers to service our auto-related claims. If any of our third-party insurance service providers\nfails to service claims to our expectations, discontinues or increases the cost of coverage or changes the terms of such coverage in a manner not favorable to drivers or\nto us, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage or services on reasonable terms in an acceptable time frame or at all. If we cannot find\nalternate third-party insurance service providers on terms acceptable to us, we may incur additional expenses related to servicing such auto-related claims using internal\nresources.\nIn recent periods, the automotive insurance industry has experienced rising costs due to, among other things, inflation, supply chain challenges, and the cost of\nmedical care, which has harmed our business, financial condition and results of operations, including through increased insurance renewal costs, and we expect it to\ncontinue to negatively impact the automotive insurance industry and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have, from time to time, sold portions of retained insurance risk to third-parties, including as described in the “Insurance Reserves” subheading in Note 6,\nSupplemental Financial Statement Information to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. These transactions may cause us\nto incur additional expenses in the total cost of this risk, and we are subject to recapture of the risk if any third party reinsurer were to default on their reinsurance\nobligation.\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party insurance service providers could adversely affect our reputation and brand and could potentially lead\nto increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reputation, brand and the network effects among the drivers and riders on our platform are important to our success, and if we are not able to maintain and\ncontinue developing our reputation, brand and network effects, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that building a strong reputation and brand as a safe, reliable and affordable platform and continuing to increase the strength of the network effects\namong the drivers and riders on our platform are critical to our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders. The successful development of our reputation,\nbrand and network effects will depend on a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. Negative perception of our platform or company may harm our\nreputation, brand and networks effects, including as a result of:\n• complaints or negative publicity about us, drivers on our platform, riders, our product offerings, our ability to deliver on product promises, pricing or our\npolicies and guidelines, including our practices and policies with respect to drivers, or the ridesharing industry, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated\nincidents;\n• illegal, negligent, reckless or otherwise inappropriate behavior by drivers or riders or third parties, or concerns about the safety of our platform or ridesharing\nin general;\n• a failure to provide drivers with a sufficient level of ride requests, charge drivers fees and commissions that are competitive or provide drivers with competitive\nfares and incentives;\n• a failure to offer riders competitive ride pricing and pick-up times or the desired range of ride types;\n• actual or perceived disruptions of or defects in our platform, such as privacy or data security breaches or incidents, site outages, payment disruptions or other\nincidents that impact the reliability of our offerings;\n• litigation over, or investigations by regulators into, our platform or our business, including any adverse resolution of such litigation or investigations;\n• users’ lack of awareness of, or compliance with, our policies, changes to our policies that are negatively received, or a failure to enforce our policies in a\nmanner perceived as effective, fair and transparent;\n64\nTable of Contents\n• a failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our stated values and mission, including modification or discontinuation of our community or\nsustainability programs, illegal or otherwise inappropriate behavior by our management team or other employees or contractors, or negative perception of our\ntreatment of employees;\n• inadequate or unsatisfactory user support service experiences;\n• negative responses by drivers or riders to new offerings on our platform;\n• accidents, defects or other negative incidents involving autonomous vehicles or Light Vehicles on our platform or Light Vehicles sold to third parties;\n• political or social policies or activities, including our response to employee sentiment related to these matters; or\n• any of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects the public’s perception of us or our industry as a\nwhole.\nIf we do not successfully maintain and develop our brand, reputation and network effects and successfully differentiate our offerings from competitive\nofferings, our business may not grow, we may not be able to compete effectively and we could lose existing qualified drivers or existing riders or fail to attract new\nqualified drivers or new riders, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes we may make to\nenhance and improve our offerings and balance the needs and interests of the drivers and riders on our platform may be viewed positively from one group’s perspective\n(such as riders) but negatively from another’s perspective (such as drivers), or may not be viewed positively by either drivers or riders. If we fail to balance the interests\nof drivers and riders or make changes that they view negatively, drivers and riders may stop using our platform, take fewer rides or use alternative platforms, any of\nwhich could adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIllegal, improper or otherwise inappropriate activity of users, whether or not occurring while utilizing our platform, has and could continue to expose us to liability\nand harm our business, brand, financial condition and results of operations.\nIllegal, improper or otherwise inappropriate activities by users, including the activities of individuals who may have previously engaged with, but are not then\nreceiving or providing services offered through, our platform or individuals who are intentionally impersonating users of our platform could adversely affect our brand,\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. These activities may include criminal activity such as assault, theft, unauthorized use of credit and debit cards or\nbank accounts, as well as other misconduct such as sharing of rider or driver accounts. While we have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify\nand address the risk of these types of activities, these measures may not adequately address, and are unlikely to prevent, all illegal, improper or otherwise inappropriate\nactivity by these parties from occurring in connection with our offerings. Such conduct has and could continue to expose us to liability or adversely affect our brand or\nreputation. At the same time, if the measures we have taken to guard against these illegal, improper or otherwise inappropriate activities, such as our requirement that all\ndrivers undergo annual background checks or our two-way rating system and related policies, are too restrictive and inadvertently prevent qualified drivers and riders\notherwise in good standing from using our offerings, or if we are unable to implement and communicate these measures fairly and transparently or are perceived to have\nfailed to do so, the growth and retention of the number of qualified drivers and riders on our platform and their utilization of our platform could be negatively impacted.\nFurther, any negative publicity related to the foregoing, whether such incident occurred on our platform, on our competitors’ platforms, or on any ridesharing platform,\ncould adversely affect our reputation and brand or public perception of the ridesharing industry as a whole, which could negatively affect demand for platforms like\nours, and potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential and existing drivers, and if such providers fail to furnish and/or provide accurate\ninformation, or if such providers are unable to complete background checks or are delayed in completing background checks because of data access restrictions,\nsoftware outages, cyber attacks, or otherwise, or if we do not maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial condition and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen the records of potential and existing drivers to help identify those that are not qualified to utilize\nour platform pursuant to applicable laws or our internal standards. Our business has been and may continue to be adversely affected to the extent we cannot attract or\nretain qualified drivers as a result of such providers being unable to complete certain background checks, or being significantly delayed in completing certain\nbackground checks, because of data access restrictions, software outages, cyber attacks, unforeseen court or Department of Motor Vehicle closures, or otherwise, or to\nthe extent that they do not meet their contractual obligations, our expectations or the requirements of applicable laws or regulations. If any of our third-party\nbackground check providers terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to find an\nalternate provider, and may\n65\nTable of Contents\nnot be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable time frame. If we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms\nacceptable to us, we may not be able to timely onboard potential drivers, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to qualified drivers. Further, if the\nbackground checks conducted by our third-party background check providers do not meet our expectations or the requirements under applicable laws and regulations,\nunqualified drivers may be permitted to provide rides on our platform, and as a result, our reputation and brand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to\nincreased regulatory or litigation exposure.\nWe are also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing drivers on our platform. If we or drivers on\nour platform fail to comply with applicable laws, rules and legislation, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\naffected.\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to safety incidents or data security breaches or\nincidents, could adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to our pricing could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders.\nDemand for our offerings is highly sensitive to the price of rides, the rates for time and distance driven, incentives paid to drivers and the fees we charge\ndrivers. Many factors, including operating costs, legal and regulatory requirements or constraints and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing\nstrategies including increased incentives for drivers, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-\npriced or a broader range of offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders at a\nlower cost than we do. This includes the use of algorithms to set dynamic prices for riders and earnings for drivers that are dependent on various factors, such as the\nroute, time of day, and pick-up and drop-off locations of riders. From time to time, we have made pricing changes and spent significant amounts on marketing and both\nrider and driver incentives, and we expect that, from time to time, we will be required, through competition, regulation or otherwise, to reduce the price of rides for\nriders, increase the incentives we pay to drivers on our platform or reduce the fees we charge the drivers on our platform, or to increase our marketing and other\nexpenses to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders in response to competitive pressures. These actions may adversely affect our business and financial results and\nmay not have the desired benefits. At times, in certain geographic markets, we have offered, and may continue to offer, driver incentives that cause the total amount of\nthe fare that a driver retains, combined with the driver incentives a driver receives from us, to increase, at times meeting or exceeding the amount of gross bookings we\ngenerate for a given ride. Furthermore, the economic sensitivity of drivers and riders on our platform may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing\nmethodologies may not enable us to compete effectively in these locations. Local regulations may affect our pricing in certain geographic locations, which could\namplify these effects. For example, state and local laws and regulations regarding pricing limitations during government declared States of Emergency have imposed\nlimits on prices for certain services, and state and local laws and regulations have imposed minimum earnings standards for drivers, which, at times, have caused us to\nincrease prices in certain markets, including California, New York and Washington. We have tested or launched, and expect to in the future test or launch, new pricing\nstrategies and initiatives, such as our earnings commitment, subscription packages and driver or rider loyalty programs. We have also modified, and expect to in the\nfuture modify, existing pricing methodologies, such as our up-front pricing policy. To the extent any strategies, initiatives or modifications to our pricing methodologies\nlead to real or perceived harm to driver earnings, our ability to attract or retain qualified drivers may be adversely affected. Any of the foregoing actions may not\nultimately be successful in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and riders or may result in loss of market share, negative public perception and harm to our\nreputation.\nWhile we continue to maintain that drivers on our platform are independent contractors in legal and administrative proceedings, our arguments may ultimately\nbe unsuccessful. A determination in, resolution of, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that classifies a driver\nutilizing a ridesharing platform as an employee, may require us to revise our pricing and earnings methodologies, or make other changes to our business and operations,\nto account for such a change to driver classification. Proposition 22 in California, HB 2076 in Washington and agreements with the New York and Massachusetts\nAttorneys General have enabled us to provide additional earning opportunities to drivers in those states, including guaranteed earnings. The transition has required, and\nwill continue to require, additional costs and we expect to face other challenges as we transition drivers to these new models, including changes to our pricing. We have\nalso tested or launched, and may in the future test or launch, certain changes to the rates, fees and payment structure for drivers on our platform, which may not\nultimately be successful in attracting and retaining qualified drivers. Moreover, while the California Supreme Court rejected a constitutional challenge to Proposition 22\non July 25, 2024, other potential litigation to overturn Proposition 22, litigation over Lyft’s compliance with Proposition 22, or the reclassification of drivers on our\nplatform as employees could reduce the available supply of drivers as drivers leave the platform due to the changes in flexibility under an employment model, or other\nchanges we may need to make to our business and operations. While we do and will attempt to optimize ride prices and balance supply and demand in our ridesharing\nmarketplace, our\n66\nTable of Contents\nassessments may not be accurate. We have experienced in the past and may experience in the future underpricing or overpricing of our offerings due to changes we\nmake to the technology used in our pricing. In addition, if the offerings on our platform change, then we may need to revise our pricing methodologies. As we continue\nto launch new and develop existing asset-intensive offerings such as our network of Light Vehicles and certain vehicles in our Express Drive program, factors such as\nmaintenance, debt service, depreciation, asset life, supply chain efficiency and asset replacement may affect our pricing methodologies. In addition, we have established\nenvironmental programs that may also affect our pricing. Any such changes to our pricing methodologies or our ability to efficiently price our offerings could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to efficiently grow and further develop our network of Light Vehicles, which may not grow as we expect or become profitable over time, and\nmanage the related risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWhile some major cities have widely adopted bike and scooter sharing, there can be no assurance that new markets we enter will accept, or existing markets\nwill continue to accept, bike and scooter sharing, and even if they do, that we will be able to execute on our business strategy or that our related offerings will be\nsuccessful in such markets. For example, although we have exclusive rights to operate bike or scooter sharing programs in certain jurisdictions, we have faced\ncompetition in contravention of such rights and have incurred costs to defend against such challenges. A negative determination in other legal disputes regarding bike\nand scooter sharing, including an adverse determination regarding our existing rights to operate, could adversely affect our competitive position and results of\noperations. Additionally, we may from time to time be denied permits to operate, or be temporarily restricted from operating due to public health and safety measures,\nour bike share program or scooter share program in certain jurisdictions. While we do not expect any denial or suspension in an individual region to have a material\nimpact, these denials or suspensions in the aggregate could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if we are able to successfully develop and\nimplement our network of Light Vehicles, there may be heightened public skepticism of this nascent service offering. In particular, there could be negative public\nperception surrounding bike and scooter sharing, including the overall safety and the potential for injuries occurring as a result of accidents involving an increased\nnumber of bikes and scooters on the road, and the general safety of the bikes and scooters themselves. Such negative public perception may result from incidents on our\nplatform or incidents involving our competitors’ offerings.\nWe design and contract to manufacture bikes and scooters using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective supply of\nbikes and scooters that meets our standards is critical to our operations. We expect to continue to rely on external suppliers in the future. There can be no assurance we\nwill be able to maintain our existing relationships with these suppliers and continue to be able to source our bikes and scooters on a stable basis, at a reasonable price or\nat all. We also design and contract to manufacture certain assets related to our network of Light Vehicles and we rely on a small number of suppliers, and in some\ninstances a sole supplier, for components and manufacturing services. Similarly, we rely on external vendors to provide field services to our bike and scooter operations.\nThere can be no assurance we will be able to maintain our existing relationships with these vendors. Also, from time to time we transition these services in one or more\ngeographies from one vendor to another, and the transition process could interrupt or otherwise adversely affect our operations.\nThe revenue we generate from our network of Light Vehicles fluctuates from quarter to quarter due to, among other things, seasonal factors including weather.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult for us to assess the exact nature or extent of the effects of seasonality on our network of Light Vehicles, however, we\ngenerally experience a decline in demand for our bike and scooter rentals over the winter season and an increase during more temperate and dry seasons. Additionally,\nfrom time to time we may re-evaluate the markets in which we operate and the performance of our network of Light Vehicles, and we have discontinued and may in the\nfuture discontinue operations in certain markets as a result of such evaluations. For example, in July 2022, November 2022, March 2023 and September 2024, we\ndiscontinued our shared scooter programs in San Diego and Los Angeles, discontinued our shared bike and scooter program in Minneapolis, and announced we would\nbe discontinuing our shared scooter program in Washington, D.C. and were exploring alternatives for our shared bike and scooter program in Denver, respectively, due\nto a number of factors including onerous contractual requirements, institutionalized theft, and lack of public investment. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChallenges relating to the supply chain for our Light Vehicles could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe supply chain for our bikes and scooters exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or shortages and our acquisition of PBSC, a producer\nand seller of bikes, has increased that exposure. In the event that our supply of bikes and scooters or key components is interrupted or there are significant increases in\nprices, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Changes in business conditions, force majeure, any public health crises,\nsuch as the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental or regulatory changes and other factors beyond our control have affected and could\n67\nTable of Contents\ncontinue to affect our suppliers’ ability to deliver products and our ability to deploy products to the market, or deliver products to third parties, on a timely basis.\nWe incur significant costs related to the design, purchase, sourcing and operations of our network of Light Vehicles and we expect to continue incurring such\ncosts as we operate our network of Light Vehicles. The prices and availability of bikes and scooters and related products may fluctuate depending on factors beyond our\ncontrol including market and economic conditions, tariffs, changes to import or export regulations and demand. Substantial increases in prices of these assets or the cost\nof our operations would increase our costs and reduce our margins, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further,\ncustoms authorities may challenge or disagree with our classification, valuation or country of origin determinations of our imports. Such challenges could result in tariff\nliabilities, including tariffs on past imports, as well as penalties and interest. Although we have reserved for potential payments of possible tariff liabilities in our\nfinancial statements, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition could be harmed.\nOur bikes and scooters or components thereof, including bikes and scooters and components that we design and contract to manufacture using third-party\nsuppliers, have experienced and may in the future experience quality problems, product issues or acts of vandalism or theft from time to time, which could result in\ndecreased usage of our network of Light Vehicles or loss of our bikes or scooters. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and fix all product issues,\nvandalism or theft of our Light Vehicles. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, litigation or regulatory challenges, including personal injury or products liability\nclaims, and harm to our reputation.\nIf we are unable to efficiently develop, enable, or implement partnerships with other companies to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platforms in a\ntimely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe currently partner and have partnered in the past with several companies to develop autonomous vehicle technology and offerings. Autonomous driving is a\nnew and evolving market, which makes it difficult to predict its acceptance, its growth, and the magnitude and timing of necessary investments and other trends,\nincluding when it may be more broadly or commercially available. Our initiatives may not perform as expected, which would reduce the return on our investments in\nthis area and our current or future partners may decide to terminate or scale back their partnerships with us. For example, in October 2022, one of our autonomous\nvehicle partners announced its wind-down, and as a result we incurred a total impairment charge of $135.7 million consisting of impairments of our non-marketable\nequity investment in such company and other assets. Following the sale of our Level 5 self-driving vehicle division in 2021, we no longer develop our own autonomous\nvehicle technology, so we must develop and maintain partnerships with other companies to offer autonomous vehicle technology on our platforms, and if we are unable\nto do so, or if we do so at a slower pace or at a higher cost or if our technology is less capable relative to our competitors, or if our efforts to optimize our strategy with\nregard to our autonomous vehicle technology development are not successful, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nLikewise, if our current or future autonomous vehicle technology partners are delayed or prevented from developing autonomous vehicle technology, our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. For example, a general decrease in available capital, as well as an increase in regulatory\nscrutiny could delay or prevent the development of autonomous vehicle technology by our partners.\nThe autonomous vehicle industry may not continue to develop, or autonomous vehicles may not be adopted by the market, which could adversely affect our\nprospects, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in the development of autonomous vehicle-related technology for use on our platform. Autonomous driving\ninvolves a complex set of technologies, including the continued development of sensing, computing and control technology. We have relied on building strategic\npartnerships with third-party developers of such technologies, as such technologies are costly and in varying stages of maturity. There is no assurance that these current\nor future partnerships will result in the development of market-viable technologies or commercial success in a timely manner or at all. In order to gain acceptance, the\nreliability of autonomous vehicle technology must continue to advance.\nAdditional challenges to the development and deployment of autonomous vehicle technology, all of which are outside of our control, include:\n• market acceptance of autonomous vehicles;\n• state, federal or municipal licensing requirements, safety standards, and other regulatory measures;\n• necessary changes to infrastructure to enable adoption;\n• concerns regarding electronic security and privacy;\n• levels of investment by developers of autonomous vehicle technology; and\n68\nTable of Contents\n• public perception regarding the safety of autonomous vehicles for drivers, riders, pedestrians and other vehicles on the road.\nThere are a number of existing laws, regulations and standards that may apply to autonomous vehicle technology, including vehicle standards that were not\noriginally intended to apply to vehicles that may not have a human driver. Such regulations continue to rapidly evolve, which may increase the likelihood of complex,\nconflicting or otherwise inconsistent regulations, which may delay our ability to bring autonomous vehicle technology to market or significantly increase the\ncompliance costs associated with this business strategy. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market will accept autonomous vehicles or the timing of such\nacceptance, if at all, and even if it does, that we will be able to execute on our business strategy or that our offerings will be successful in the market. Even if\nautonomous vehicle technology is successfully developed and implemented, there may be heightened public skepticism of this nascent technology and its adopters. In\nparticular, there could be negative public perception surrounding autonomous vehicles, including the overall safety and the potential for injuries or death occurring as a\nresult of accidents involving autonomous vehicles and the potential loss of income to human drivers resulting from widespread market adoption of autonomous\nvehicles. Such negative public perception may result from incidents on our platform, incidents on our partners’ or competitors’ platforms, or events around autonomous\nvehicles more generally. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClaims from riders, drivers or third parties that allege harm, whether or not our platform is in use, adversely affect our business, brand, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations and other legal proceedings relating to injuries to, or deaths of, riders, drivers or third-parties. We\nare also subject to claims alleging that we are directly or vicariously liable for the acts of the drivers on our platform or for harm related to the actions of drivers, riders,\nor third parties, or the management and safety of our platform and our assets, including harm caused by criminal activity. We are also subject to personal injury claims\nwhether or not such injury actually occurred as a result of activity on our platform. For example, platform users and third parties have in the past asserted legal claims\nagainst us in connection with personal injuries related to the actions of a driver or rider who may have previously utilized our platform, but was not at the time of such\ninjury. We have incurred expenses to settle personal injury claims, which we sometimes choose to settle for reasons including expediency, protection of our reputation\nand to prevent the uncertainty of litigating, and we expect that such expenses will continue to increase as our business grows and we face increasing public scrutiny.\nRegardless of the outcome of any legal proceeding, any injuries to, or deaths of, any riders, drivers or third parties could result in negative publicity and harm to our\nbrand, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance policies and programs may not provide sufficient coverage to adequately\nmitigate the potential liability we face, especially where any one incident, or a group of incidents, could cause disproportionate harm, and we may have to pay high\npremiums or deductibles for our coverage and, for certain situations and/or categories of claims, we may not be able to secure coverage at all.\nAs we operate our network of Light Vehicles, we are subject to an increasing number of claims, lawsuits, investigations or other legal proceedings related to\ninjuries to, or deaths of, riders of our Light Vehicles, including potential indemnification claims. In some cases, we could be required to indemnify governmental entities\nor operating partners for claims arising out of issues, including issues that may be outside of our control, such as the condition of the public right of way. Any such\nclaims arising from the use of our Light Vehicles, regardless of merit or outcome, could lead to negative publicity, harm to our reputation and brand, significant legal,\nregulatory or financial exposure or decreased use of our Light Vehicles. Further, the bikes and scooters we design and contract to manufacture using third-party\nsuppliers and manufacturers, including certain assets and components we design and have manufactured for us, have in the past contained and could in the future\ncontain design or manufacturing product issues, which could also lead to injuries or death to riders. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect, prevent, or fix\nall product issues, and failure to do so could harm our reputation and brand or result in personal injury or products liability claims or regulatory proceedings. Any of the\nforegoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Light Vehicles have experienced product issues from time to time, which has in the past resulted in, and, in the future may result in, product recalls and\nremoval from service, injuries, litigation, enforcement actions and regulatory proceedings, and could adversely affect our business, brand, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe design, contract to design and manufacture, sell, and directly and indirectly modify, maintain and repair bikes and scooters for our network of Light\nVehicles. Such bikes and scooters have in the past contained, and, in the future may contain, product issues related to their design, materials or construction, may be\nimproperly maintained or repaired or may be subject to vandalism. These product issues, improper maintenance or repair or vandalism have in the past unexpectedly\ninterfered, and could in the future unexpectedly interfere, with the intended operations of the bikes or scooters, and have resulted, and could in the future result, in other\nsafety concerns, including alleged injuries to riders or third parties. Although we, our contract\n69\nTable of Contents\nmanufacturers, and our third-party service providers test our bikes and scooters before they are deployed onto our network or sold, there can be no assurance we will be\nable to detect or prevent all product issues.\nFailure to detect, prevent, fix or timely report real or perceived product issues and vandalism, or to properly maintain or repair our bikes and scooters has\nresulted or may result in a variety of consequences including product recalls and removal from service, service interruptions, alleged injuries, litigation, enforcement\nactions, including fines or penalties, regulatory proceedings, and negative publicity. Even if injuries to riders or third parties are not the result of any product issues in,\nvandalism of, or the failure to properly maintain or repair our bikes or scooters, we may incur expenses to defend or settle any claims or respond to regulatory inquiries,\nand our brand and reputation may be harmed. Any of the foregoing risks could also result in decreased usage of our network of Light Vehicles and adversely affect our\nbusiness, brand, financial conditions and results of operations.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe expect to continue to grow our business, infrastructure and operations over time. Growth has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on\nour management and our operational and financial infrastructure. While our headcount has grown across the United States and internationally, from time to time we\nhave undertaken restructuring actions to better align our financial model and our business. For example, we have from time to time implemented reductions in force to\nreduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows in light of ongoing economic challenges. We may need to take additional restructuring actions in the future to align our\nbusiness with the market. Steps we take to manage our business operations, including workplace policies for employees, and to align our operations with our strategies\nfor future growth may adversely affect our reputation and brand, our ability to recruit, retain and motivate highly skilled personnel.\nOur ability to manage our growth and business operations effectively and to integrate new employees, technologies and acquisitions into our existing business\nwill require us to continue to expand our operational and financial infrastructure and to continue to retain, attract, train, motivate and manage employees. Continued\ngrowth could strain our ability to develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures, recruit, train\nand retain highly skilled personnel and maintain user satisfaction. Additionally, if we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations, the quality of\nour offerings could suffer, which could negatively affect our reputation and brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny actual or perceived security or privacy breach or incident could interrupt our operations, harm our brand and adversely affect our reputation, brand, business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nOur business involves the collection, storage, transmission and other processing of our users’ personal data and other sensitive data. Additionally, we maintain\nother confidential, proprietary, or otherwise sensitive information relating to our business, including intellectual property, and similar information we receive from third\nparties. Unauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and may in the future gain access, to systems or facilities we maintain or use in our business through\nvarious means, including gaining unauthorized access into our systems or facilities or those of our service providers, partners or users on our platform, or attempting to\nfraudulently induce our employees, service providers, partners, users or others into disclosing rider names, passwords, payment card information or other sensitive\ninformation, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, partners, customers or others\ninto manipulating payment information, resulting in the fraudulent transfer of funds to criminal actors. In addition, users on our platform could have vulnerabilities on\ntheir own devices that are entirely unrelated to our systems and platform, but could mistakenly attribute their own vulnerabilities to us. Further, breaches or incidents\nexperienced by other companies may also be leveraged against us. For example, credential stuffing attacks are common and sophisticated actors can mask their attacks,\nmaking them difficult to identify and prevent. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored or supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them\neven more difficult to detect.\nAlthough we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our users’ data and prevent breaches and incidents, these measures cannot\nguarantee total security or prevent incidents from impacting our platform. Our information technology and infrastructure are subject to cyberattacks, breaches and\nincidents, including ransomware or other malware, which have resulted in and may result in interruptions to our operations or unavailability of our platform. Further,\nthird parties may be able to access our users’ personal information and payment card data that are accessible through those systems. Additionally, as we expand our\noperations, including licensing or sharing data with third parties, have employees or third-party relationships in jurisdictions outside the United States, or expand work-\nfrom-home practices of our employees, our exposure to cyberattacks, breaches and incidents may increase. As a result of conflicts such as the war in Ukraine, there may\nbe a heightened risk of potential cyberattacks by state actors or others. Further, employee and service provider error, malfeasance or other vulnerabilities, bugs or errors\nin the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in an actual or perceived breach or incident. In the past, there have been allegations regarding\nviolations of our policies restricting access to personal information we store, and we may be subject to these types of allegations in the future. Our service providers\nalso face\n70\nTable of Contents\nvarious security threats, and we and our third-party service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate, prevent, respond to, or\nmitigate cyberattacks or security breaches or incidents, and we or they may face difficulties or delays in identifying and responding to cyberattacks, breaches and\nincidents.\nAny actual or perceived breach or incident affecting us or other parties with which we share data or are processing data on our behalf could interrupt our\noperations, result in our platform being unavailable or otherwise disrupted, result in loss, alteration, unavailability or unauthorized use, disclosure or other processing of\ndata, result in fraudulent transfer of funds, harm our reputation and brand, damage our relationships with third-party partners, result in regulatory investigations and\nother proceedings, private claims, demands, litigation and other proceedings, loss of our ability to accept credit or debit card payments, increased card processing fees,\nand other significant legal, regulatory and financial exposure and lead to loss of driver or rider confidence in, or decreased use of, our platform, any of which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any actual or perceived compromise, breach or incident impacting autonomous\nvehicles, whether through our platform or our competitors’, could result in legal, regulatory and financial exposure and lead to loss of rider confidence in our platform,\nwhich could significantly undermine our business. Further, any cyberattacks directed toward, or breaches or incidents impacting, our competitors could reduce\nconfidence in the ridesharing industry as a whole and, as a result, reduce confidence in us.\nWe incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security breaches and other security-related incidents and we expect our costs will increase as we\ncontinue to implement systems and processes designed to prevent and otherwise address security breaches and incidents. In the event of a future breach or incident, we\ncould be required to expend additional significant capital and other resources in an effort to respond to or prevent further breaches or incidents, which may require us to\ndivert substantial resources. Moreover, we could be required or otherwise find it appropriate to expend significant capital and other resources to respond to, notify third\nparties of, and otherwise address the breach or incident and its root cause.\nAdditionally, defending against claims or litigation based on any actual or perceived privacy or security breach or incident, regardless of their merit, could be\ncostly and divert management’s attention. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for such liabilities, that insurance will continue to be\navailable to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more\nlarge claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition\nof large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe primarily rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver our offerings to users on our platform, and any disruption of or interference with our use of Amazon Web\nServices could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently host our platform and support our operations using Amazon Web Services, or AWS, a third-party provider of cloud infrastructure services. We do\nnot have control over the operations of the facilities of AWS that we use. AWS’ facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, cyber attacks,\nterrorist attacks, power outages and similar events or acts of misconduct. Our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. We have\nexperienced, and expect that in the future we will experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors,\nincluding infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints. In addition, any changes in AWS’ service levels may\nadversely affect our ability to meet the requirements of users. Since our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success, sustained or\nrepeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our offerings. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially\nduring peak usage times, as we expand and the usage of our offerings increases. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our reputation and\nbrand and may adversely affect the usage of our offerings.\nOur commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may only terminate the agreement for convenience after\ncomplying with a one-year advance notice requirement. AWS may also terminate the agreement for cause upon a breach of the agreement or for failure to pay amounts\ndue, in each case, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a 30-day cure period. In the event that our agreement with AWS is terminated or we add additional\ncloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience significant costs or downtime in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud infrastructure\nservice providers. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation and brand, reduce the availability or usage of our platform, lead to a significant\nshort term loss of revenue, increase our costs and impair our ability to attract new users, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nOn February 1, 2022 we entered into an addendum to our commercial agreement with AWS, pursuant to which we committed to spend an aggregate of at least\n$350 million between February 2022 and January 2026 on AWS services, with a\n71\nTable of Contents\nminimum amount of $80 million in each of the four years. If we fail to meet the minimum purchase commitment during any year, we may be required to pay the\ndifference, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party and affiliate vehicle rental partners for our Express Drive program, as well as third-party vehicle supply, fleet management and finance\npartners to support our Express Drive program, and if we cannot manage our relationships with such parties and other risks related to our Express Drive program,\nour business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third-party and affiliate vehicle rental partners as well as third-party vehicle supply, fleet management and finance partners to supply vehicles to\ndrivers for our Express Drive program. If any of our third-party vehicle rental partners or third-party vehicle supply, fleet management and finance partners terminates\nits relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, the availability of vehicles for drivers in certain markets could be\nadversely impacted, and we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable time frame.\nSimilarly, in the event that vehicle manufacturers issue recalls that affect the usage or the supply of vehicles or automotive parts is interrupted, including as a result of\npublic health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting vehicles in these partners’ fleets, the supply of vehicles available from these partners could become\nconstrained. In addition, in May 2020, Hertz filed for bankruptcy protection, which affected its ability to meet the requirements of our Express Drive program. If we\ncannot find alternate third-party vehicle rental providers on terms acceptable to us, or these partners’ fleets are impacted by events such as vehicle recalls, we may not\nbe able to meet the driver and consumer demand for rental vehicles, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to qualified drivers and consumers. In addition,\ndue to a number of factors, including our agreements with our vehicle rental partners and our auto-related insurance program, we incur an incrementally higher\ninsurance cost from our Express Drive program compared to the corresponding cost from the rest of our ridesharing marketplace offerings. If Flexdrive, Lyft’s\nindependently managed subsidiary, is unable to manage costs of operating Flexdrive’s fleet and potential shortfalls between such costs and the rental fees collected from\ndrivers, Lyft and Flexdrive may update the pricing methodologies related to Flexdrive’s offering in Lyft’s Express Drive program which could increase prices, and in\nturn adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers through the Express Drive program.\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party and affiliate vehicle rental partners, including publicity related to quality standards or safety concerns,\ncould adversely affect our reputation and brand and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Express Drive program and potential future fleet businesses expose us to certain risks, including reductions in the utilization of vehicles in the fleets.\nFor the Express Drive vehicle rental program for drivers operated by our independently managed subsidiary, Flexdrive, a portion of the fleet is sourced from a\nrange of auto manufacturers. In addition, we have established environmental programs that may limit the range of auto manufacturers or vehicles that Flexdrive sources\nor purchases from. To the extent that any of these auto manufacturers significantly curtail production, increase the cost of purchasing cars or decline to provide cars to\nFlexdrive on terms or at prices consistent with past agreements, despite sourcing vehicles from the used car market and other efforts to mitigate, Flexdrive may be\nunable to obtain a sufficient number of vehicles for Lyft to operate the Express Drive business without significantly increasing fleet costs or reducing volumes.\nSimilarly, where events, such as natural disasters or public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, make operating rental locations difficult or impossible, or\nadversely impact rider demand, the demand for or Flexdrive’s ability to make vehicles available for rent through the Express Drive program has been and could\ncontinue to be adversely affected, resulting in reduced utilization of the vehicles in the fleets.\nAlthough new vehicle inventory supply is improving, Flexdrive has previously experienced and may in the future experience production and delivery delays\nwhich can hinder its ability to meet demand and grow the fleet. New vehicle production delays also lead to holding onto existing vehicles longer which in turn leads to\nincreased costs relating to those vehicles.\nThe costs of the fleet vehicles may also be adversely impacted by the relative strength of the used car market. Flexdrive currently sells vehicles through\nauctions, third-party resellers and other channels in the used vehicle marketplace. Such channels may not produce stable used vehicle prices and Flexdrive has\nexperienced a softening in the used car market. It may be difficult to estimate the residual value of vehicles used in ridesharing, such as those rented to drivers through\nour Express Drive program. If Flexdrive is unable to obtain and maintain the fleet of vehicles cost-efficiently or if Flexdrive is unable to accurately forecast the residual\nvalues of vehicles in the fleet, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n72\nTable of Contents\nWe rely on third-party payment processors to process payments made by riders and payments made to drivers on our platform, and if we cannot manage our\nrelationships with such third parties and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by riders and payments made to drivers on our platform. If any of\nour third-party payment processors terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would need to\nfind an alternate payment processor, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such payment processor in an acceptable time frame. Further, the software\nand services provided by our third-party payment processors may not meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, be compromised or experience outages.\nAny of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions or make timely payments to drivers on our platform, any of\nwhich could make our platform less convenient and attractive to users and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders.\nNearly all rider payments and driver payouts are made by credit card, debit card or through third-party payment services, which subjects us to certain payment\nnetwork or service provider operating rules, to certain regulations and to the risk of fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options to riders that may be subject\nto additional operating rules, regulations and risks. We may also be subject to a number of other laws and regulations relating to the payments we accept from riders,\nincluding with respect to money laundering, money transfers, privacy, data protection and information security. If we fail to comply with applicable rules and\nregulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties, fines or higher transaction fees and may lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment card\ntransactions, which could make our offerings less convenient and attractive to riders. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition and results\nof operations could be adversely affected.\nFor example, if we are deemed to be a money transmitter as defined by applicable regulation, we could be subject to certain laws, rules and regulations\nenforced by multiple authorities and governing bodies in the United States and numerous state and local agencies who may define money transmitter differently. For\nexample, certain states may have a more expansive view of who qualifies as a money transmitter. Additionally, outside of the United States, we could be subject to\nadditional laws, rules and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial services, and if we expand into new jurisdictions, the foreign regulations and\nregulators governing our business that we are subject to will expand as well. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulation and we are not in\ncompliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties in one or more jurisdictions levied by federal, state or local regulators, including state\nAttorneys General, as well as those levied by foreign regulators. In addition to fines, penalties for failing to comply with applicable rules and regulations could include\ncriminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make changes to our business practices or\ncompliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny.\nFor various payment options, we are required to pay fees such as interchange and processing fees that are imposed by payment processors, payment networks\nand financial institutions. These fees are subject to increases, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, our\npayment processors require us to comply with payment card network operating rules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks and which include,\namong other obligations, requirements to comply with security standards. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret\nexisting rules in ways that might prohibit us from providing certain offerings to some users, be costly to implement or difficult to follow, and if we fail or are alleged to\nfail to comply with applicable rules or requirements of payment card networks, we may be subject to fines or higher transaction fees and may lose our ability to accept\nonline payments or other payment card transactions. We have agreed to reimburse our payment processors for fines they are assessed by payment card networks if we or\nthe users on our platform violate these rules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on other third-party service providers and if such third parties do not perform adequately or terminate their relationships with us, our costs may increase\nand our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our relationships with other third-party service providers. For example, we rely on third-party encryption and authentication\ntechnologies licensed from third parties that are designed to securely transmit personal information provided by drivers and riders on our platform. Further, from time to\ntime, we enter into strategic commercial partnerships in connection with the development of new technology, the growth of our qualified driver base, the provision of\nnew or enhanced offerings for users on our platform and our expansion into new markets. If any of our partners terminates its relationship with us, or refuses to renew\nits agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such\nproviders in an acceptable time frame. Similarly, in the event that our strategic partners experience a disruption in their operations, our ability to continue providing\ncertain product offerings could become constrained. If we cannot find alternate partners, we may not be able to meet the demand for these product offerings, and as a\nresult, these offerings and our platform may become less attractive. We also rely on other software and services supplied by third parties, such as communications and\ninternal software, and our business may be\n73\nTable of Contents\nadversely affected to the extent such software and services do not meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, are compromised or experience outages. Any\nof these risks could increase our costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, any negative publicity related to any of\nour third-party partners, including any publicity related to quality standards or safety concerns, could adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially\nlead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. In addition, in certain cases, we rely on these third-party partners to provide certain data that is important to the\nmanagement of our business. Errors in the data, or failure to provide data in a timely manner, could adversely affect our ability to manage our business and could\nimpact the accuracy of our financial reporting.\nWe use and incorporate technology and intellectual property from third parties into our platform, products, and services. We cannot be certain that such\ntechnology, intellectual property, or third parties are not infringing the intellectual property rights of others or that these third parties have sufficient rights to the\ntechnology or intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may operate. Some of our license agreements may be terminated by our licensors for convenience. If\nwe are unable to obtain or maintain rights to any of this technology because of intellectual property infringement claims brought by third parties against our suppliers\nand licensors or against us, or if we are unable to continue to obtain the technology or enter into new agreements on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to\ndevelop our platform or products containing that technology or provide services using that technology could be severely limited and our business could be harmed.\nAdditionally, if we are unable to access necessary technology from third parties, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternate technology, which may require\nsignificant time and effort and may be of lower quality or performance standards and may subject us to certain risks discussed in the preceding paragraph that are\ncurrently borne by third parties. This would limit and delay our ability to provide new or competitive offerings and increase our costs. If alternate technology cannot be\nobtained or developed or if we are unable to develop such alternate technology at commercially reasonable levels of risk, we may not be able to offer certain\nfunctionality as part of our offerings, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur advertising business, Lyft Media, is nascent and subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe have introduced Lyft Media, a media and advertising business from which we earn revenue from third parties who advertise through various offerings on\nour platform. We have limited experience and operating history offering media and advertising on our platform, and our efforts to develop Lyft Media and generate\nrevenue are still in the early stages. We may never generate sufficient revenue to offset our investment or achieve the returns we expect.\nLyft Media and our ability to generate and increase revenue from Lyft Media are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including:\n• our ability to attract and retain advertisers, particularly because our advertisers do not have long-term commitments with us;\n• our ability to deliver advertisements in an effective manner;\n• our ability to compete effectively for advertising spend, including our ability to create products and offerings that are perceived as valuable to advertisers;\n• the impact of seasonal, cyclical or other shifts in advertising spend, including the impact of macroeconomic conditions;\n• the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of our ads to\nmarketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;\n• our failure to increase the number of riders who engage with Lyft Media;\n• changes in our viewer demographics that make us less attractive to advertisers;\n• adverse legal developments relating to advertising, including with respect to ad targeting and measurement tools;\n• our inability to deliver advertisements due to hardware, software or network limitations;\n• changes in third-party policies such as changes to mobile device operating systems that impose heightened restrictions on our access and use of user data by\nallowing users to more easily opt-out of tracking of activity across devices, which may negatively impact the ability to measure, deliver and select ads to be\nserved;\n• regulatory, legislative and industry developments relating to the collection, use and other processing of information and other privacy considerations, including\nregulations related to ad targeting and measurement tools;\n• product changes or advertising inventory management decisions we may make that change the type, size or frequency of advertisements displayed on Lyft\nMedia;\n74\nTable of Contents\n• adverse media reports or other negative publicity involving us, our business or advertisers on our platform that may impact our brand and reputation and the\nwillingness of advertisers to advertise on our platform;\n• any liability, brand or reputational harm from advertisements shown on our platform;\n• any uncertainty related to third party agreements to manage, sell ads, or otherwise to provide services in the Lyft Media ecosystem;\n• advertisers may not agree to reformat or change their advertisements to comply with our guidelines;\n• any driver, rider or third-party dissatisfaction due to advertisements; and\n• our ability to increase or maintain driver adoption and use of Lyft Media products.\nThese and other factors could harm our Lyft Media business and the ability of our Lyft Media business to achieve the return on investment we expect which\ncould harm our business.\nUse of artificial intelligence and machine learning may present additional risks, including risks associated with algorithm development or use, the data sets used,\nand/or a complex, developing regulatory environment.\nWe use artificial intelligence (“AI”) (including machine learning and automated decision making) for our internal work streams and productivity as well as in\nour platform, offerings, services and features, which may present additional risks, including risks inherent in its use. We are making investments in expanding our AI\ncapabilities in our platform, offerings, services and features, including ongoing deployment and improvement of existing machine learning and AI technologies, as well\nas developing new features using AI technologies, including, for example, generative AI. AI algorithms or automated processing of data may be flawed and datasets\nmay be insufficient or contain inaccurate or biased information, which can create discriminatory outcomes. AI algorithms may use third-party inputs with unclear\nintellectual property rights or interests. Intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, of generative and other AI output, have not been fully\ninterpreted by courts or fully addressed by federal or state regulations. The United States and other countries are considering comprehensive legal compliance\nframeworks specifically for AI, which is a trend that may increase now that the European Union has adopted the first such framework in its Artificial Intelligence Act.\nIn addition, there may be additional legislation or regulations from government bodies that similarly impose compliance obligations for AI. Any failure or perceived\nfailure by us or our service providers to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business. AI use or management by us or others, including\ndecisions based on automated processing or profiling, inappropriate or controversial data practices, or insufficient disclosures regarding machine learning, automated\ndecision making, and algorithms, have and could impair the operationality or acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits, regulatory investigations or other\nharm, such as negative impacts to the value of our intellectual property or our brand. These deficiencies could also undermine the decisions, predictions or analysis AI\napplications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and discrimination, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. The rapid\nevolution of AI may require us to allocate additional resources to help implement AI in order to minimize unintended or harmful impacts, and may also require us to\nmake additional investments in the development of proprietary datasets, machine learning models or other systems, which may be costly.\nIf we are not able to successfully develop new offerings on our platform and enhance our existing offerings, our business, financial condition and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to attract new qualified drivers and new riders, retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders and increase utilization of our offerings will\ndepend in part on our ability to successfully create and introduce new offerings and to improve upon and enhance our existing offerings. As a result, we may introduce\nsignificant changes to our existing offerings or develop and introduce new and unproven offerings. If these new or enhanced offerings are unsuccessful, including as a\nresult of any inability to obtain and maintain required permits or authorizations or other regulatory constraints or because they fail to generate sufficient return on our\ninvestments, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, new driver or rider demands regarding service or\nplatform features, the availability of superior competitive offerings or a deterioration in the quality of our offerings or our ability to bring new or enhanced offerings to\nmarket quickly and efficiently could negatively affect the attractiveness of our platform and the economics of our business and require us to make substantial changes to\nand additional investments in our offerings or our business model. In addition, we frequently experiment with and test different offerings and marketing strategies. For\nexample, in September 2023, we launched Women+ Connect, an offering with a goal of increasing women drivers on the platform by helping match women and\nnonbinary drivers with women and nonbinary passengers. In December 2023, we began experiments for a new price lock product, which launched in July 2024. Price\nlock allows riders to purchase a monthly subscription that caps the price for a specified route during a specified one-hour time window. Additionally, in February 2024,\nwe launched a driver earnings commitment where we promise a driver will earn at least 70% of weekly passenger payments after external fees. If a driver’s weekly\nearnings are below the 70% commitment, they will receive a true-up payment for the difference. Any significant inability to deliver on the commitment could lead to\nbrand and reputational harm and create potential legal risk. If these experiments and tests are unsuccessful, or if the offerings and strategies we introduce based on the\nresults of such experiments\n75\nTable of Contents\nand tests do not perform as expected, our ability to attract new qualified drivers and new riders, retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders and maintain or\nincrease utilization of our offerings may be adversely affected.\nDeveloping and launching new offerings or enhancements to the existing offerings on our platform involves significant risks and uncertainties, including risks\nrelated to the reception of such offerings by existing and potential future drivers and riders, increases in operational complexity, unanticipated delays or challenges in\nimplementing such offerings or enhancements, increased strain on our operational and internal resources (including an impairment of our ability to accurately forecast\nrider demand and the number of drivers using our platform), our dependence on strategic commercial partnerships, and negative publicity in the event such new or\nenhanced offerings are perceived to be unsuccessful. We have scaled our business rapidly, and significant new initiatives have in the past resulted in, and in the future\nmay result in, operational challenges affecting our business. In addition, developing and launching new offerings and enhancements to our existing offerings may\ninvolve significant up-front capital investments and such investments may not generate sufficient returns on investment. Further, from time to time we may reevaluate,\ndiscontinue and/or reduce these investments and decide to discontinue one or more offerings. For example, we shut down our vehicle services offering and parking\noffering, which were initially launched in 2021. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and\nriders, our ability to increase utilization of our offerings and our visibility into expected results of operations, and could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. Additionally, since we are focused on building our community and ecosystems for the long-term, our near-term results of operations\nmay be impacted by our investments in the future.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the complexities associated with our multimodal platform, our business, financial condition and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected.\nOur expansion, either through our first party offerings or third-party offerings through our partnerships, into bike and scooter sharing, other modes of\ntransportation and vehicle rental program has increased the complexity of our business. These new offerings have required us to develop new expertise and marketing\nand operational strategies, and have subjected us to new laws, regulations and risks. For example, our Wait & Save offering, which enables riders to opt for a longer\nwait time but pay a lower fare than for a Standard ride, while drivers earn the same as they do for a Standard ride, involves inherent challenges in predicting the future\nlocations of drivers. We also face the risk that our network of Light Vehicles, our Nearby Transit offering, which integrates third-party public transit data into the Lyft\nApp, and other future transportation offerings could reduce the use of our ridesharing offering. Additionally, from time to time we reevaluate our offerings on our\nmultimodal platform and have in the past decided and may again decide to discontinue or modify an offering or certain features. Such actions may negatively impact\nrevenue in the short term and may not provide the benefits we expect in the long term. If we are unable to successfully manage the complexities associated with our\nexpanding multimodal platform, including the effects our new and evolving offerings have on our existing business, our business, financial condition and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nOur metrics and estimates, including the key metrics included in this report, are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies\nin those metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nWe regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our metrics used to evaluate our growth, measure our performance and make strategic\ndecisions. These metrics are calculated using internal company data and have not been evaluated by a third-party. Our metrics may differ from estimates published by\nthird parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology or the assumptions on which we rely, and we may make material\nadjustments to our processes for calculating our metrics in order to enhance accuracy, reflect newly available information, address errors in our methodologies, or other\nreasons, which may result in changes to our metrics. The estimates and forecasts we disclose relating to the size and expected growth of our addressable market may\nprove to be inaccurate. Even if the markets in which we compete meet the size estimates and growth we have forecasted, our business could fail to grow at similar rates,\nif at all. Further, as our business develops, we may introduce, revise or cease reporting certain metrics if we change how we manage our business such that new metrics\nare appropriate, if we determine that revisions are required to accurately or appropriately measure our performance, or if one or more metrics no longer represents an\neffective way to evaluate our business. If investors or analysts do not consider our metrics to be accurate representations of our business or compare our metrics to third\nparty estimates or similarly titled metrics of our competitors or others in our industry that are not calculated on the same basis, or if we discover material inaccuracies in\nour metrics, then the trading price of our Class A common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAny failure to offer high-quality user support may harm our relationships with users and could adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders is dependent in part on the ease and reliability of our offerings, including our ability to provide\nhigh-quality support, including both in-person and remote support. Users on our platform depend on our support organization to resolve any issues relating to our\nofferings, such as being overcharged for a\n76\nTable of Contents\nride, leaving something in a driver’s vehicle or reporting a safety incident. Our ability to provide effective and timely support is largely dependent on our ability to\nattract and retain service providers who are qualified to support users and sufficiently knowledgeable regarding our offerings. As we continue to grow our business and\nimprove our offerings, we will face challenges related to providing quality support services at scale. If we grow our international rider base and the number of\ninternational drivers on our platform, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support in languages other\nthan English. Any failure to provide efficient and effective user support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our\nreputation, brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to deal effectively with fraud could harm our business.\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud, including use of stolen or fraudulent credit card data, claims of\nunauthorized payments by a rider, attempted payments by riders with insufficient funds, fraud committed by drivers, riders or third parties, and fraud committed by\nriders in concert with drivers. Bad actors use increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities, including those involving personal information, such as\nunauthorized use of another person’s identity, account information or payment information and unauthorized acquisition or use of credit or debit card details, bank\naccount information and mobile phone numbers and accounts. Under current card payment practices, we may be liable for rides facilitated on our platform with\nfraudulent credit card data, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction. Despite measures that we have taken to detect and reduce the\noccurrence of fraudulent or other malicious activity on our platform, we cannot guarantee that any of our measures will be effective or will scale efficiently with our\nbusiness. Our inability to adequately detect or prevent fraudulent transactions could harm our reputation or brand, result in litigation or regulatory action and lead to\nexpenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have also incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from fraud and other misuse of our platform by drivers and riders. As an example of losses, we have\npreviously and continue to experience reduced revenue from actual and alleged unauthorized rides fulfilled and miles traveled in connection with our Concierge\noffering. If we are unable to adequately anticipate and address such misuse either through increased controls, platform solutions or other means, our partner\nrelationships, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to effectively balance driver supply and rider demand on our Wait & Save and Priority Pickup offerings, our business, financial condition and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to efficiently balance driver supply and rider demand on our Wait & Save and Priority Pickup offerings and manage the related pricing\nmethodologies and logistics, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Wait & Save enables riders to opt for a longer wait\ntime but pay a lower fare than for a Standard ride, while drivers earn the same as they do for a Standard ride. Priority Pickup enables riders to pay an additional fee for\nprioritized ride matching with the goal of achieving a shorter wait time. Both Priority Pickup and Wait & Save allow for the rider to be matched with the best-located\ndriver and involve inherent challenges in predicting the future location of drivers. Accordingly, if our algorithms are unable to consistently match Wait & Save and\nPriority Pickup riders, or with appropriate drivers, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our pricing methodologies, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWith our up-front pricing methodology, we quote a price to riders of our ridesharing offering before they request a ride. We earn platform and service fees from\ndrivers. Service fees are a set fee per ride. Platform fees are variable fees, based upon the amount paid by a rider, which is generally based on an up-front quoted fare,\nless the amount earned by the driver (which is based on one or both of the following: (a) the actual time and distance for the trip, or (b) an up-front fare), the service fee,\nany applicable driver bonuses or incentives, and any pass-through amounts paid to drivers and third parties. For more information on platform fees, see our Terms of\nService, including the Driver Addendum. As we do not control the driver’s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip, we take on\nrisks related to the driver’s actions which may not be fully mitigated. Additionally, Shared Rides, a limited-scope offering for business-to-business partnerships in select\nmarkets, enables unrelated parties traveling along similar routes to generate a discounted fare at the cost of possibly longer travel times. The fare charged for the Shared\nRide is decoupled from the payment made to the driver as we do not adjust the driver payment based on the success or failure of a match. We may incur a loss from a\ntransaction where an up-front quoted fare paid by a rider is less than the amount we committed to the driver. In addition, riders’ price sensitivity varies by geographic\nlocation, among other factors, and if we are unable to effectively account for such variability in our breadth of offerings or up-front prices, our ability to compete\neffectively in these locations could be adversely affected. From time to time we adjust our prices due to these factors, which may harm our results of operations. We\nalso utilize certain AI and machine-learning technologies and algorithms to optimize our pricing and marketplace. Errors in AI, machine-learning technologies,\nalgorithms, or the inputted data, including insufficient data sets or biased information, or the processing of the data may lead to\n77\nTable of Contents\ndiscriminatory or other adverse outcomes. In July 2024, we launched a new price lock product that allows riders to purchase a monthly subscription that caps the price\nfor a specified route during a specified one-hour time window, subject to a maximum amount of savings in any given month. With the price lock product, if we set the\ncapped prices too low or too high compared to actual on-demand prices, we may incur losses or it may negatively impact subscriber growth. If we are unable to\neffectively manage our pricing methodologies in conjunction with our existing and future pricing and incentive programs and/or products, our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, our business could be harmed.\nWe believe that our company culture, which promotes authenticity, empathy and support for others, has been critical to our success. We face a number of\nchallenges that may affect our ability to sustain our corporate culture, including:\n• failure to identify, attract, reward and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and further our culture, values and mission;\n• the increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\n• our flexible workplace strategies, which enable certain of our employees to work in a hybrid workplace environment or remotely;\n• adherence to our internal policies and core values, including our diversity, equity and inclusion practices and initiatives;\n• competitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision and values;\n• the continued challenges of a rapidly-evolving industry;\n• the impact of our cost reduction initiatives, including reductions in force and other actions we may take to drive operating efficiencies;\n• the increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us;\n• perception of our treatment of employees or our response to employee sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management;\n• the departure of our co-founders from their operational roles and transitions among our executive leadership;\n• the provision of employee benefits in a hybrid and remote work environment; and\n• the integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions.\nFrom time to time, we have undertaken workforce reductions in order to better align our operations with our strategic priorities, manage our cost structure or in\nconnection with acquisitions. For example, in response to the effects of the macroeconomic environment and efforts to reduce operating expenses, we have from time to\ntime implemented reductions in force. These actions may adversely affect employee morale, our culture and our ability to attract and retain personnel. If we are not able\nto maintain our culture, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our key personnel and other highly skilled personnel, and if we fail to attract, retain, motivate or integrate our personnel, our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on the continued service of our senior management team, key technical employees and other highly skilled personnel and on our\nability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain and integrate highly qualified personnel for all areas of our organization. In the second quarter of 2023, our co-\nfounders, Logan Green and John Zimmer, transitioned from their management roles and David Risher, a member of our board of directors, became Chief Executive\nOfficer. We have also experienced transitions in other executive leadership roles, including our President and Chief Financial Officer. We may not be successful in\nattracting and retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs and actions we take in response to economic and other factors impacting our business\nmay harm our reputation or impact our ability to recruit qualified personnel in the future. Also, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our management team, work\nfor us on an at-will basis, and there is no assurance that any such employee will remain with us. Our competitors may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of\nour management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms or at all. If we are\nunable to attract and retain the necessary personnel, particularly in critical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals.\n78\nTable of Contents\nWe face intense competition for highly skilled personnel, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a substantial presence and need for highly\nskilled personnel. This competition has intensified in recent periods, and could continue to intensify for such personnel. To attract and retain top talent, we have had to\noffer, and we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates and existing personnel often consider the value\nof the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. The decline in our stock price and our cost reduction initiatives may adversely affect our ability\nto attract and retain highly qualified personnel, and we may experience increased attrition or we may need to provide additional cash or equity compensation to retain\nemployees. Certain of our employees have received significant proceeds from sales of our equity in private transactions and many of our employees have received and\nmay continue to receive significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets, which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. We may need\nto invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain new employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit, train and integrate\nsuch employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to effectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our\nefficiency, ability to meet forecasts and employee morale, productivity and retention could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users and unfavorable changes in or our failure to comply\nwith existing or future laws governing the Internet and mobile devices.\nOur business depends on users’ access to our platform via a mobile device and the Internet. We may operate in jurisdictions that provide limited Internet\nconnectivity, particularly as we expand internationally. Internet access and access to a mobile device are frequently provided by companies with significant market\npower that could take actions that degrade, disrupt or increase the cost of users’ ability to access our platform. In addition, the Internet infrastructure that we and users\nof our platform rely on in any particular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it. Any such failure in Internet or mobile device\naccessibility, even for a short period of time, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nMoreover, we are subject to a number of laws and regulations specifically governing the Internet and mobile devices that are constantly evolving. Existing and\nfuture laws and regulations, or changes thereto, may impede the growth and availability of the Internet and online offerings, require us to change our business practices\nor raise compliance costs or other costs of doing business. These laws and regulations, which continue to evolve, cover taxation, privacy and data protection,\ninformation security, pricing, copyrights, distribution, mobile and other communications, advertising practices, consumer protections, web and app accessibility,\nantitrust and competition, the provision of online payment services, unencumbered Internet access to our offerings and the characteristics and quality of online\nofferings, among other things. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation and\nbrand, a loss in business and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our apps available to the drivers and riders on our platform, and if we do not effectively\noperate with or receive favorable placements within such application marketplaces and maintain high rider reviews, our usage or brand recognition could decline\nand our business, financial results and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application marketplaces to make our apps available to the\ndrivers and riders on our platform. Any changes in such systems and application marketplaces that degrade the functionality of our apps or give preferential treatment to\nour competitors’ apps could adversely affect our platform’s usage on mobile devices. If such mobile operating systems or application marketplaces limit or prohibit us\nfrom making our apps available to drivers and riders, make changes that degrade the functionality of our apps, increase the cost of using our apps, impose terms of use\nunsatisfactory to us or modify their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors’ placement in such mobile operating systems’\napplication marketplace is more prominent than the placement of our apps, overall growth in our rider or driver base could slow. Our apps have experienced fluctuations\nin the number of downloads in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that certain mobile devices will continue to support our platform or effectively\nroll out updates to our apps. Additionally, in order to deliver high-quality apps, we need to ensure that our offerings are designed to work effectively with a range of\nmobile technologies, systems, networks and standards. We may not be successful in developing or maintaining relationships with key participants in the mobile industry\nthat enhance drivers’ and riders’ experience. If drivers or riders on our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or using our apps on their mobile devices or if we are\nunable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating systems, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n79\nTable of Contents\nWe depend on the interoperability of our platform across third-party applications and services that we do not control.\nWe have integrations with a variety of productivity, collaboration, travel, data management and security vendors. As our offerings expand and evolve,\nincluding to the extent we continue to develop autonomous technology, we may have an increasing number of integrations with other third-party applications, products\nand services. Third-party applications, products and services are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or modify our platform to ensure its\ncompatibility with third-party offerings following development changes. In addition, some of our competitors or technology partners may take actions which disrupt the\ninteroperability of our platform with their own products or services, or exert strong business influence on our ability to, and the terms on which we operate and\ndistribute our platform. As our respective products evolve, we expect the types and levels of competition to increase. Should any of our competitors or technology\npartners modify their products, standards or terms of use in a manner that degrades the functionality or performance of our platform or is otherwise unsatisfactory to us\nor gives preferential treatment to competitive products or services, our products, platform, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\naffected.\nDefects, errors or vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems or other technology systems and those of third-party technology providers, or system failures\nand resulting interruptions in our availability or the availability of other systems and providers, could harm our reputation and brand and adversely impact our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be discovered after the\ncode has been released. We rely heavily on a software engineering practice known as “continuous deployment,” which refers to the frequent release of our software\ncode, sometimes multiple times per day. This practice increases the risk that errors and vulnerabilities are present in the software code underlying our platform. The\nthird-party software that we incorporate into our platform may also be subject to errors or vulnerability. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or from\nthird-party software after release could result in negative publicity, a loss of users or loss of revenue and access or other performance issues. Such vulnerabilities could\nalso be exploited by malicious actors and result in exposure of data of users on our platform, or otherwise result in a security breach or incident. We may need to expend\nsignificant financial and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate or work around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to\ntimely and effectively resolve any such errors, defects or vulnerabilities could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations as well as\nnegatively impact our reputation or brand.\nFurther, our systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software\ndefects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, power losses,\ndisruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware or other events. Our systems\nalso may be subject to break-ins, sabotage, theft and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. Some of our systems are not fully redundant and\nour disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses that may\nresult from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.\nWe have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability or\nreduce or affect the speed or functionality of our offerings. These events have resulted in, and similar future events could result in, losses of revenue or additional costs\nand expenses. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed or other functionality of our offerings could adversely affect our\nbusiness and reputation and could result in the loss of users. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in harm or losses to the users using\nour platform, we may make voluntary payments to compensate for such harm or the affected users could seek monetary recourse or contractual remedies from us for\ntheir losses and such claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address.\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could\nrestrict our ability to provide our offerings.\nOur platform and offerings contain software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under “open source” licenses. Use and distribution of open source\nsoftware may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification or\nother contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for others\nto compromise our platform and offerings.\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of\nopen source software we use, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner,\nwe could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This would allow our competitors to create\nsimilar offerings with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages.\n80\nTable of Contents\nAlternatively, to avoid the public release of the affected portions of our source code, we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some\nor all of our software.\nAlthough we have policies and processes for using open source software to avoid subjecting our platform and offerings to conditions we do not intend, the\nterms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could\nimpose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform and offerings. From time to time, there have been claims challenging\nthe ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by\nparties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source\nsoftware in our platform will be effective. If we are held to have breached or failed to fully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license,\nwe could face infringement or other liability, or be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our offerings on terms that are not\neconomically feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our offerings if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis\nor to make generally available, in source code form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nOur presence outside the United States and our international expansion strategy will subject us to additional costs and risks and our plans may not be successful.\nSince 2017, we have provided and expanded our offerings in international markets. In addition, we have several international offices that support our business.\nWe also transact internationally to source and manufacture bikes and scooters and may increase our business in international regions in the future. Operating outside of\nthe United States may require significant management attention to oversee operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural norms and customs, in\naddition to placing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering and operations teams. We may incur significant operating expenses and may not be\nsuccessful in our international expansion for a variety of reasons, including:\n• recruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintaining our company culture across all of our offices;\n• competition from local incumbents that better understand the local market, may market and operate more effectively and may enjoy greater local affinity or\nawareness;\n• differing demand dynamics, which may make our offerings less successful;\n• public health concerns or emergencies, such as pandemics and other highly communicable diseases or viruses;\n• complying with varying laws and regulatory standards, including with respect to privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, tax, trade compliance, anti-bribery and\nanti-corruption, insurance, and local regulatory restrictions and disclosure requirements;\n• ineffective legal protection of our intellectual property rights in certain countries or theft or unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and\nother confidential business information;\n• obtaining any required government approvals, licenses or other authorizations;\n• varying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\n• currency exchange restrictions or costs and exchange rate fluctuations;\n• political, economic, or social instability, which has caused disruptions in certain of our office locations, including in Belarus and Ukraine as a result of the war;\n• tax policies, treaties or laws that could have an unfavorable business impact; and\n• limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds as well as foreign currency exchange restrictions.\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be\nsuccessful, which may result in shutting down international operations or closing international offices, which could result in additional costs and cash requirements, any\nof which may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations internationally and\nare unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n81\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, international expansion has increased our risks in complying with laws and standards in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, including with respect to\ncustoms, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, political activity, export controls and trade and economic sanctions. Continued international expansion, including possible\nengagement with foreign government entities and organizations as customers for our Light Vehicle offerings, including bike-share products through PBSC, may further\nincrease such compliance risks. We cannot assure you that our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of applicable laws, for which we may be\nultimately held responsible. In particular, any violation of applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery, lobbying, export controls, sanctions and similar laws could result in\nadverse media coverage, investigations, significant legal fees, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil penalties or suspension or debarment from U.S.\ngovernment contracts, and/or substantial diversion of management’s attention, all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors\nOur business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions. Laws, regulations and standards governing issues such as TNCs, livery,\nvehicles for hire, public companies, ridesharing, worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker\nconfidentiality obligations, product liability, defects, recalls, auto maintenance and repairs, personal injury, marketing, advertising, text messaging, subscription\nservices, intellectual property, AI, securities, consumer protection, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, antitrust, arbitration\nagreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, web and mobile application accessibility, autonomous vehicles, bike and scooter sharing, insurance,\nvehicle rentals, money transmittal, non-emergency medical transportation, healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse, environmental health and safety, greenhouse gas\nemissions and EVs, background checks, public health, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, political contributions, lobbying, import and export restrictions, trade and economic\nsanctions, foreign ownership and investment, foreign exchange controls and delivery of goods are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases\ndue to their lack of specificity. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations\nare provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies.\nThe ridesharing industry, Light Vehicle sharing industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. When we introduced a peer-to-\npeer ridesharing marketplace in 2012, the laws and regulations in place at the time did not directly address our offerings. Laws and regulations that were in existence at\nthat time, and some that have since been adopted, were often applied to our industry and our business in a manner that limited our relationships with drivers or\notherwise inhibited the growth of our ridesharing marketplace. We have been proactively working with federal, state and local governments and regulatory bodies to\nensure that our ridesharing marketplace and other offerings are available broadly in the United States and Canada. In part due to our efforts, a large majority of U.S.\nstates have adopted laws related to TNCs to address the unique issues of the ridesharing industry. New laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and\nregulations continue to be adopted, implemented and interpreted in response to our industry and related technologies. As we expand our business into new markets or\nintroduce new offerings into existing markets, regulatory bodies or courts may claim that we or users on our platform are subject to additional requirements, or that we\nare prohibited from conducting our business in certain jurisdictions, or that users on our platform are prohibited from using our platform, either generally or with\nrespect to certain offerings. Certain jurisdictions and governmental entities, including airports, require us to obtain permits, pay fees or comply with certain reporting\nand other operational requirements to provide our ridesharing, bike and scooter sharing, and Flexdrive offerings. These jurisdictions and governmental entities may\nreject our applications for permits, revoke or suspend existing or deny renewals of permits to operate, delay our ability to operate, increase their fees, charge new types\nof fees, or impose fines and penalties, including as a result of errors in, or failures to comply with, reporting or other requirements related to our product offerings. Any\nof the foregoing actions by these jurisdictions and governmental entities could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent financial, political and other events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies, technology companies in general and\ncompanies engaged in dealings with independent contractors, such as ridesharing and delivery companies. Regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new\nregulations that are adverse to our business, or, due to changes in our operations and structure or partner relationships as a result of changes in the market or otherwise,\nthey may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to our business. See the risk factor entitled\n“Challenges to contractor classification of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences to our business.” Such\nregulatory scrutiny or action may create different or conflicting obligations from one jurisdiction to another, and may have a negative outcome that could adversely\naffect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, we have invested and from time to time we will continue to invest resources\nin an attempt to influence or challenge legislation and other regulatory matters pertinent to our operations, particularly those related to the ridesharing industry, which\nmay negatively impact the legal and administrative\n82\nTable of Contents\nproceedings challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independent contractors if we are unsuccessful or lead to additional costs and expenses even if\nwe are successful. These activities may not be successful, and any negative outcomes could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nOur industry is increasingly regulated. We have been subject to intense regulatory pressure from state, provincial and municipal regulatory authorities across\nthe United States and Canada, and a number of them have imposed limitations on ridesharing and bike and scooter sharing, and certain jurisdictions have adopted rules\ngoverning minimum driver earnings for ridesharing platforms. Other jurisdictions in which we currently operate or may want to operate have and could continue to\nconsider legislation regulating driver earnings. We could also face similar regulatory restrictions from foreign regulators as we expand operations internationally,\nparticularly in areas where we face competition from local incumbents. In addition, we may face regulations relating to new or developing technologies. For example,\nthe European Union has adopted the Artificial Intelligence Act, which will impose operational and regulatory requirements relating to the use of AI technologies, and\nother jurisdictions may adopt laws and regulations relating to AI. Adverse changes in laws or regulations at all levels of government or bans on or material limitations to\nour offerings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success, or perceived success, and increased visibility has driven, and may continue to drive, some businesses that perceive our business model negatively\nto raise their concerns to local policymakers and regulators. These businesses and their trade association groups or other organizations have and may continue to take\nactions and employ significant resources to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions where we may have, or seek to have, a market presence in an effort to\nchange such legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to adversely affect or impede our business and the ability of drivers and riders to utilize our platform.\nAny of the foregoing risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChallenges to contractor classification of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences to our business.\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory\nproceedings at the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independent contractors. The tests governing whether a\ndriver is an independent contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact sensitive. Laws and regulations that govern the status and\nmisclassification of independent contractors are subject to changes and divergent interpretations by various authorities which can create uncertainty and unpredictability\nfor us. For more information regarding the litigation in which we have been involved, see the “Legal Proceedings” subheading in Note 6. Commitments and\nContingencies to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Further, in 2021, the U.S. Secretary of Labor\nexpressed his view that in some cases “gig workers should be classified as employees” and that further review was ongoing. On January 10, 2024, the U.S. Department\nof Labor issued a new final rule containing interpretive guidance for the classification of workers as employees or independent contractors, reverting back to a multi-\nfactor “economic realities” test to determine if a worker was properly classified under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”). The rule became effective on\nMarch 11, 2024, and is currently under legal challenges. On June 13, 2023, the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) issued a ruling in Atlanta Opera, reverting\nback to a more expansive federal test for classifying independent contractors under the National Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”), the federal law that governs collective\nbargaining. We continue to maintain that drivers on our platform are independent contractors in such legal and administrative proceedings and intend to continue to\ndefend ourselves vigorously in these matters, as applicable, but our arguments may ultimately be unsuccessful. A determination in, resolution of, or settlement of, any\nlegal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, related to driver classification matters, could harm our business, financial condition and results\nof operations, including as a result of:\n• monetary exposure arising from or relating to alleged failure to withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages and wage and hour laws and requirements (such as\nthose pertaining to failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, or to provide required breaks and wage statements), unlawful deductions, expense\nreimbursement, restitution, statutory and punitive damages, penalties, including related to the California Private Attorneys General Act, and government fines;\n• injunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;\n• claims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation and unemployment;\n• claims of discrimination, harassment and retaliation under civil rights laws;\n• claims under new or existing laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining and other concerted activity;\n83\nTable of Contents\n• other claims, charges or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees, including risks relating to allegations of joint\nemployer liability or agency liability; and\n• harm to our reputation and brand.\nIn addition to the harms listed above, in the event of a determination in, resolution of, or settlement of, any legal proceeding related to driver classification\nmatters, we may decide to, or be required to, significantly alter our existing business model and/or operations (including suspending or ceasing operations in impacted\njurisdictions), our costs may increase, and we may experience adverse impacts on our ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and grow our business, which\ncould have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nWe have been involved in numerous legal proceedings related to driver classification. We are currently involved in several putative class actions, several\nrepresentative actions brought, for example, pursuant to California’s Private Attorneys General Act, several multi-plaintiff actions and thousands of individual claims,\nincluding those brought in arbitration or compelled pursuant to our Terms of Service to arbitration, challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as\nindependent contractors. We are also involved in administrative audits related to driver classification in California, Oregon, Wisconsin, Illinois, New York,\nPennsylvania, and New Jersey. See the section titled “Legal Proceedings” for additional information about these types of legal proceedings.\nClaims by others that we infringed their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business.\nCompanies in the markets in which we operate are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual\nproperty rights. In addition, certain companies and rights holders seek to enforce and monetize patents or other intellectual property rights they own, have purchased or\notherwise obtained. As our business continues to evolve, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows based on the following: increase in public\nprofile, increases in the number of competitors in our markets, our continued development of new technologies, new products and services, and new intellectual\nproperty, as well as potential international expansion. In addition, various products and services of ours host, integrate, or otherwise rely on third party content or\nintellectual property, including our Lyft Media efforts, which provides a platform for third-party promotional advertisements, and our marketing and brand journalism\nefforts. From time to time third parties may assert, and in the past have asserted, claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. See the section titled\n“Legal Proceedings” for additional information about these types of legal proceedings. In addition, third parties have sent us correspondence regarding various\nallegations of intellectual property infringement and, in some instances, have sought to initiate licensing discussions. Although we believe that we have meritorious\ndefenses, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in defending against these allegations or reaching a business resolution that is satisfactory to us. Our\ncompetitors and others may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than us. In addition, we have faced, and may again in the\nfuture face, litigation involving patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product or service revenue and against whom our own\npatents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection. Many potential litigants, including some of our competitors and patent-holding companies, have the\nability to dedicate substantial resources to assert their intellectual property rights. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us\nto incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distract our management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, we risk compromising our confidential\ninformation during this type of litigation. We may be required to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees in connection with a claimant securing a judgment\nagainst us, we may be subject to an injunction or other restrictions that prevent us from using or distributing our intellectual property, or we may agree to a settlement\nthat prevents us from distributing our offerings or a portion thereof, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWith respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek out a license to continue operations found to be in violation of such rights, which\nmay not be available on favorable or commercially reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. Some licenses may be non-exclusive, and\ntherefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If a third-party does not offer us a license to its intellectual property on reasonable\nterms, or at all, we may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology or other intellectual property, which could require significant time (during which\nwe would be unable to continue to offer our affected offerings), effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Any of these events could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\n84\nTable of Contents\nFailure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success is dependent in part upon protecting our intellectual property rights and technology (such as code, information, data, processes and other forms of\ninformation, knowhow and technology), or “intellectual property,” and as we grow, we expect to continue to develop intellectual property that is important for our\nexisting or future business. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to\nestablish and protect our intellectual property. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective, and may vary by\njurisdiction. Even if we do detect violations, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our rights. Any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could\nbe time-consuming and expensive and could divert management attention. While we take precautions designed to protect our intellectual property, it may still be\npossible for competitors and other unauthorized third parties to copy our technology, reverse engineer our data and use our proprietary information to create or enhance\ncompeting solutions and services, which could adversely affect our position in our rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry. Some license provisions that\nprotect against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of our technology may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries.\nThe laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property as do the laws of the United States and effective intellectual property\nprotections may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries. Our domestic and international intellectual property protection and enforcement strategy is\ninfluenced by many considerations including costs, where we have business operations, where we might have business operations in the future, legal protections\navailable in a specific jurisdiction, and/or other strategic considerations. As such, we do not have identical or analogous intellectual property protection in all\njurisdictions, which could risk freedom to operate in certain jurisdictions if we were to expand. As we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized\nuse, copying, transfer and disclosure of proprietary information will likely increase. We may need to expend additional resources to protect, enforce or defend our\nintellectual property rights domestically or internationally, which could impair our business or adversely affect our domestic or international operations. We enter into\nconfidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with our third-party providers and\nstrategic partners. We cannot assure you that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to, and use and distribution of, our platform and proprietary\ninformation. Further, these agreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our\nofferings. Competitors and other third parties may also attempt to access, aggregate, and/or reverse engineer our data which would compromise our trade secrets and\nother rights. We also enter into strategic partnerships, joint development and other similar agreements with third parties where intellectual property arising from such\npartnerships may be jointly-owned or may be transferred or licensed to the counterparty. Such arrangements may limit our ability to protect, maintain, enforce or\ncommercialize such intellectual property rights, including requiring agreement with or payment to our joint development partners before protecting, maintaining,\nlicensing or initiating enforcement of such intellectual property rights, and may allow such joint development partners to register, maintain, enforce or license such\nintellectual property rights in a manner that may affect the value of the jointly-owned intellectual property or our ability to compete in the market.\nWe may be required to spend significant resources in order to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and some violations may be difficult or\nimpossible to detect. Litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in\nthe impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and\ncountersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology\nagainst unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources, could impair the functionality of our\nplatform, delay introductions of enhancements to our platform, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our platform or harm our reputation or\nbrand. In addition, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop and market new offerings or platform features, which may not be\non commercially reasonable terms or at all and could adversely affect our ability to compete.\nOur industry has also been subject to attempts to steal intellectual property, including by foreign actors. We, along with others in our industry, have been the\ntarget of attempted thefts of our intellectual property and may be subject to such attempts in the future. Although we take measures to protect our property, if we are\nunable to prevent the theft of our intellectual property or its exploitation, the value of our investments may be undermined and our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations may be negatively impacted.\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply\nwith such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, could adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nWe receive, transmit, store and otherwise process a large volume of personal information and other data relating to users on our platform, as well as other\nindividuals such as our employees. Numerous local, municipal, state, federal and\n85\nTable of Contents\ninternational laws and regulations address privacy, data protection and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of certain data, including the\nCalifornia Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography\nand Marketing Act, Canada’s Anti-Spam Law, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, or TCPA, the U.S. Federal Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act of 1996, as amended by the HITECH Act, or HIPAA, Section 5(c) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or\nCCPA, and the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which became operative as of January 1, 2023. The scope of data protection laws may continually change,\nthrough new legislation, amendments to existing legislation and changes in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. For example, the\nCPRA requires new disclosures to California consumers and affords such consumers new data rights and abilities to opt-out of certain sharing of personal information.\nThe CPRA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation, which can be applied on a per-consumer basis. Aspects of the CPRA and its interpretation and enforcement\nremain unclear. Additionally, several states in the U.S., including California and other states where we do business, have enacted legislation relating to privacy and\ninformation security, and the U.S. federal government and other states are also contemplating federal and state privacy legislation. These new and modified laws,\nincluding the CPRA, and other changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, particularly any new or modified laws or\nregulations that require enhanced protection of data or new obligations with regard to data retention, transfer or disclosure, could greatly increase the cost of providing\nour offerings, require significant changes to our operations and our data processing practices and policies, may require us to incur additional compliance-related costs\nand expenses, and may even prevent us from providing certain offerings in jurisdictions in which we currently operate and in which we may operate in the future.\nFurther, as we continue to expand our offerings and user base, we may become subject to additional privacy-related laws and regulations. For example, in\nconnection with the sale of our Level 5 self-driving vehicle division to Woven Planet, we have entered into certain data sharing and other agreements with Woven\nPlanet to facilitate and accelerate the development of autonomous vehicle technology. In addition, our Lyft Media efforts provide third party promotional\nadvertisements, including those that may be personalized to users. Changes in the law or regulatory landscape could limit or prohibit activities in regard to any new\nofferings we undertake. Further, the collection and storage of data, including in connection with the use of our Concierge and Lyft Pass for Healthcare offerings by\nhealthcare partners, subjects us to compliance requirements under HIPAA. HIPAA and its implementing regulations contain requirements on covered entities and\nbusiness associates regarding the use, collection, security, storage and disclosure of individuals’ protected health information, or PHI. Contracted healthcare entities\nincluding healthcare providers, health plans, and transportation managers using our Concierge or Lyft Pass for Healthcare offerings are either covered entities or\nbusiness associates under HIPAA. We must also comply with HIPAA as we use and disclose the PHI of riders in our capacity as a business associate of other contracted\nhealthcare covered entities or other contracted business associates of a healthcare covered entity. Compliance obligations under HIPAA include privacy, security and\nbreach notification obligations and could subject us to increased liability for any unauthorized uses or disclosures of PHI determined to be a “breach.” If we knowingly\nbreach the HITECH Act’s requirements, we could be exposed to criminal liability. A breach of our safeguards and processes could expose us to significant civil\npenalties that range from $100 - $50,000 per violation, with an annual maximum per violation calendar year cap of over $2,000,000 for “willful neglect” violations, and\nthe possibility of civil litigation.\nAdditionally, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses in an effort to comply with privacy, data protection and information\nsecurity standards imposed by law, regulation, or contractual obligations. In particular, with laws and regulations such as the CCPA and CPRA imposing new and\nrelatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these and other laws and regulations, we may face\nchallenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effort to do\nso. In particular, with regard to HIPAA, we may incur increased costs as we perform our obligations to our healthcare customers under our agreements with them. As\nwe consider expansion of business offerings and markets and as laws and regulations change, we expect to incur additional costs related to privacy, data protection and\ninformation security standards and protocols imposed by laws, regulations, industry standards or contractual obligations related to such offerings and face additional\nrisks that such expansion could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of such laws, regulations or obligations.\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, it is possible\nthat our practices, offerings or platform could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations or obligations. Our\nfailure, or the failure by our third-party providers or partners, to comply with applicable laws, regulations or other actual or asserted obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection or information security, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or unauthorized loss, unavailability, corruption, use, release or\nother processing of personal information or other driver or rider data, or the perception that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could\ndamage our reputation, discourage new and existing drivers and riders from using our platform or result in fines or proceedings by governmental agencies and private\nclaims and litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n86\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, the perception of concerns relating to privacy, data protection or information security, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and brand and\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, government and regulatory investigations and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government and regulatory investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings in\nthe ordinary course of business, including those involving personal injury, property damage, worker classification, driver earnings, labor and employment, anti-\ndiscrimination, commercial disputes, competition, consumer complaints (e.g., claims brought under the TCPA or other laws), intellectual property disputes, compliance\nwith regulatory requirements, securities laws, and other matters, and we may become subject to additional types of claims, lawsuits, government investigations and\nlegal or regulatory proceedings as our business grows and as we deploy new offerings, including proceedings related to product liability or our acquisitions, data\nprivacy, advertising, securities issuances or business practices. We are also regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations and\nother legal and regulatory proceedings seeking to hold us liable for the actions of independent contractor drivers on our platform. See the section titled “Legal\nProceedings” for additional information about these types of legal proceedings.\nThe results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations or other legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with\ncertainty. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, be harmful to our reputation, require significant\nmanagement attention and divert significant resources. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex and fact-intensive process that requires significant\nsubjective judgment and speculation. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines and\npenalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These proceedings could also result in harm to our reputation and brand,\nsanctions, consent decrees, injunctions or other orders requiring a change in our business practices. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal\nexpenses on behalf of our business, commercial, and government partners and current and former directors and officers.\nA determination in, resolution of, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that involves our industry, could\nharm our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, a determination related to driver classification matters, whether we are party to such\ndetermination or not, could cause us to incur significant expenses or require substantial changes to our business model.\nIn addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our Terms of Service with the drivers and riders and other parties on our platform. These provisions\nare intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or\nfederal court. However, arbitration may become more costly for us or the volume of arbitration may increase and become burdensome, and the use of arbitration\nprovisions may subject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize these\nrisks to our reputation and brand, we have in the past and may continue to limit our use of arbitration provisions or be required to do so in a legal or regulatory\nproceeding, either of which could increase our litigation costs and exposure. For example, effective May 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct\nclaims by users and employees.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as between state and\nfederal law or between U.S. and foreign law, there is a risk that some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to\nexempt certain categories of protection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims are required to be exempted\nfrom arbitration, we could experience an increase in our costs to litigate disputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure\nto potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs we expand our offerings, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, and any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and\nregulations or manage the increased costs associated with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nAs we continue to expand our offerings and user base, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, which may differ or conflict from one\njurisdiction to another. Many of these laws and regulations were adopted prior to the advent of our industry and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate\nor address the unique issues faced by our industry.\nFor example, contracting with healthcare entities and transportation managers representing healthcare entities may subject us to certain healthcare related laws\nand regulations. These laws and regulations may impose additional requirements on\n87\nTable of Contents\nus and our platform in providing access to rides for healthcare partners. Additional requirements may arise related to the collection and storage of data and systems\ninfrastructure design, all of which could increase the costs associated with our offerings to healthcare partners. With respect to healthcare rides matched through the Lyft\nPlatform and provided to Medicaid or Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, we are subject to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse laws that impose penalties for violations.\nSignificant violations of such laws could lead to our loss of Medicaid provider enrollment status and could also potentially result in exclusion from participation in\nfederal and state healthcare programs. Further, we may in certain circumstances be or become considered a government contractor with respect to certain of our\nservices, which would expose us to certain risks such as the government’s ability to unilaterally terminate contracts, the public sector’s budgetary cycles and funding\nauthorization, and the government’s administrative and investigatory processes.\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to our offerings, it is possible that our practices, offerings or\nplatform could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations or obligations. Our failure, or the failure by our third-\nparty providers or partners, to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to our offerings, could harm our reputation and brand,\ndiscourage new and existing drivers and riders from using our platform, lead to refunds of ride fares or result in fines or proceedings by governmental agencies or\nprivate claims and litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial\nstatements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the\nlisting standards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and\nsignificant management oversight. If any of our controls and systems do not perform as expected, we may experience deficiencies in our controls and we may not be\nable to meet our financial reporting obligations.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in the conditions in our business, including increased\ncomplexity resulting from any international expansion, flexible work arrangements, new offerings on our platform or from strategic transactions, including acquisitions\nand divestitures. Further, weaknesses or deficiencies in our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting have been discovered in the past, and\nother weaknesses or deficiencies may be discovered in the future. Our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting are not\nexpected to prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be\ndetected.\nAny failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our results of\noperations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement\nand maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent\nregistered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our\nperiodic reports. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause errors in our reporting. For example, our\nmanagement determined that the clerical error in our forward-looking, non-GAAP directional commentary for fiscal year 2024 contained in our initial press release\nissued on February 13, 2024 resulted in the conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2023 at a reasonable assurance\nlevel. While we have remediated the deficiency that resulted in the error, failure of our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting to\nbe effective could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely adversely affect the market price of our Class\nA common stock. We may also be subject to public scrutiny, regulatory inquiries and legal proceedings if such failure results in an error in our financial reporting. In\naddition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control\nover financial reporting is documented, designed or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could\nhave an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock.\n88\nTable of Contents\nChanges in U.S. and foreign tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions.\nWe are subject to tax laws, regulations, and policies of the U.S. federal, state, and local governments and of comparable taxing authorities in foreign\njurisdictions. As various levels of governments and international organizations become increasingly focused on tax reform, changes in tax laws, as well as other factors,\ncould cause us to experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rates and otherwise adversely affect our tax positions and/or our tax liabilities. For\nexample, the United States passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, which introduced a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks that could impact us in connection with a\nsettlement of the capped call transactions. Further, a provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development\nexpenditures in the year incurred and requires the capitalization and amortization of such costs. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\n(“OECD”) released Pillar Two model rules defining a 15% global minimum tax for large multinational companies. The OECD continues to release additional guidance\nand countries are in various stages of implementation with widespread adoption of the Pillar Two Framework expected in the near future. Any of these or other\ndevelopments or changes in tax laws or rulings in jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, gross receipts, value added or similar taxes\nand may successfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments or obligations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nThe application of indirect taxes, such as payroll tax, sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipts tax, to\nbusinesses like ours and to drivers is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before\nthe adoption and growth of the Internet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax obligations, and as a result,\namounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing\nstatutes might apply to our business or to drivers’ businesses.\nIn addition, local governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other legislative\naction to increase tax revenue, including through indirect taxes. For example, it is becoming more common for local governments to impose per trip fees specifically on\nTNC rides. Such taxes may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes. However, tax authorities have raised and may continue to raise questions about or challenge or\ndisagree with our calculation, reporting, or collection of taxes, and may require us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to remit\nadditional taxes and interest, and could impose associated penalties and interest. A successful assertion by one or more tax authorities requiring us to collect taxes in\njurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to collect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes, could result in substantial tax\nliabilities, including taxes on past transactions, as well as penalties and interest, and could discourage drivers and riders from utilizing our offerings or could otherwise\nharm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although we have reserved for potential payments of possible past tax liabilities in our financial\nstatements, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition could be harmed.\nAdditionally, one or more states, localities or other taxing jurisdictions may seek to impose additional reporting, record-keeping or indirect tax collection\nobligations on businesses like ours. For example, taxing authorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as a means to\ncalculate, collect, and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the Internet, and are considering related legislation. New legislation may require us or\ndrivers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated with tax calculation, collection, remittance and audit requirements, which could make\nour offerings less attractive and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and any\nsuch difference may adversely impact our results of operations in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax\noutcome is determined.\nOperating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention. In addition, certain members of our\nmanagement team have limited experience managing a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are subject to the\nreporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,\nthe rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file\nannual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also required to maintain effective disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with\n89\nTable of Contents\nthese rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, and increase demand on our systems. In addition, as a\npublic company, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can lead to substantial additional costs, distract management and impact the manner in which we\noperate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. As a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial\ncondition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors. Furthermore, if any issues in complying with those\nrequirements are identified, we may incur additional costs rectifying those or new issues, and the existence of these issues could adversely affect our reputation or\ninvestor perceptions of it.\nCertain members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors and\ncomplying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage being a public\ncompany subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and\ninvestors. These obligations and constituents require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day\nmanagement of our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nWe have established environmental programs, such as requiring our suppliers to ensure the efficient use of raw materials, water, and energy resources via our\nSupplier Code of Conduct, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. For example, our San Francisco, California\nheadquarters is projected to be vulnerable to future water scarcity and sea level rise due to climate change, as well as climate-related events including wildfires and\nassociated power shut-offs. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the U.S.\nand elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition,\nlosses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climate change policies such as California’s Clean Miles Standard\nand Incentive Program and California SB 253 and SB 261, which impose greenhouse gas and EV requirements on our industry, and efforts to meet those requirements\nas well as failure to do so could have adverse impacts on our costs and ability to operate in California, as well as public goodwill towards our company. Massachusetts,\nNew York City and Toronto are developing or have developed and implemented rules to address the environmental impact of rideshare, and other jurisdictions are likely\nto consider similar rules and regulations in the future.\nIn addition, the SEC recently adopted climate rules that will require disclosure regarding climate related information in our annual report, including material\nclimate related risks, greenhouse gas emissions, material climate related goals and targets as well as governance related to climate related risks. These rules have been\nvoluntarily stayed by the SEC pending judicial review, but, if implemented, will require significant management time and attention as well as increased compliance\ncosts. We often advocate for EV programs that can be efficiently accessed by drivers on our platform and rental car operators, and any failure of such programs to\naddress EV capital costs, EV charging costs, and EV charging infrastructure in the context of transportation network companies’ unique needs could challenge our\nability to progress toward internal and external EV targets. Furthermore, these EV programs are asset-intensive and require significant capital investments and recurring\ncosts, including debt payments, maintenance, depreciation, asset life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of\nsuch assets or such offerings are otherwise not successful, our investments may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely affected. If\nwe are not able to allocate sufficient capital or other resources to these programs and achievement of these goals, we may not be able to make progress toward or\nachieve such commitments and goals in a timely manner or at all, or we may need to modify or terminate certain programs or goals. We may also enter into\narrangements with third parties for financing, leasing or otherwise, to enable us to meet our commitments and other legal or regulatory requirements. Such transactions\nmay require us to provide guarantees for financing. We may also benefit from certain tax credits for EVs and, if such tax credits expire or are terminated or we are\notherwise unable to use them, we may not realize the benefits we have planned and our business and financial condition and results of operations may be negatively\naffected. If we fail, or are perceived to fail, to make such progress or achievements, or to maintain environmental practices that meet evolving stakeholder expectations,\nor if we revise any of our commitments, initiatives, or goals, our brand and reputation could be harmed and we may face criticism from the media or our stakeholders,\nand our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Financing and Transactional Factors\nWe may require additional capital, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nHistorically, we funded our capital-intensive operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity and debt issuances and cash generated from our\noperations. To support our growing business, we must have sufficient capital to continue to make significant investments in our offerings, including potential new\nofferings. In November 2022, we entered into a $420.0 million revolving credit agreement, and since May 2020, we have issued $850.7 million in aggregate principal\namount\n90\nTable of Contents\nof convertible notes. From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, including by the issuance of securities, to finance our operations and growth\nor to refinance our existing indebtedness, among other things. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, such as our\n2025 Notes and 2029 Notes, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our Class A common stock, and our existing stockholders may\nexperience dilution. Further, we have secured debt financing which has resulted in fixed obligations and certain restrictive covenants, and any debt financing secured by\nus in the future would result in increased fixed obligations and could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial\nand operational matters, as well as liens on some or all of our assets, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business\nopportunities.\nWe evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts,\nbusiness plans and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. Additionally, uncertain and volatile macroeconomic\nconditions, including economic instability or uncertainty, and other events beyond our control, such as slowing growth in the worldwide economy, inflation and high\ninterest rates, as well as the instability and volatility in the banking and financial services sector, and the war in Ukraine, have negatively impacted the financing\nmarkets, and may impact our access to capital and make additional capital more difficult or available only on terms less favorable to us. We cannot be certain that\nadditional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we\nrequire it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate them into our business, or if we enter into strategic transactions that do not achieve\nour objectives, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of businesses, new\ntechnologies, services and other assets, joint ventures and strategic investments that complement our business, such as our acquisition of PBSC in May 2022, as well as\ndivestitures, partnerships and other transactions. We have previously acquired and invested in, and we continue to seek to acquire and invest in businesses, technologies,\nor other assets that we believe could complement or expand our business, including acquisitions of new lines of business and other opportunities that operate in\nrelatively nascent markets. We also may explore investments in new technologies, which we may develop or other parties may develop. The identification, evaluation,\nand negotiation of potential acquisition or strategic investment transactions may divert the attention of management and entail various expenses, whether or not such\ntransactions are ultimately completed. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, and consummating favorable transaction\nopportunities.\nThese transactions involve numerous risks, whether or not completed, any of which could harm our business and negatively affect our financial condition and\nresults of operations, including:\n• intense competition for suitable acquisition and investment targets, which could increase transaction costs and adversely affect our ability to consummate deals\non favorable or acceptable terms;\n• failure or material delay in closing a transaction;\n• transaction-related lawsuits or claims;\n• our ability to successfully obtain indemnification or representation and warranty insurance;\n• difficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts and personnel of an acquired company;\n• challenges related to entering into new markets or geographies;\n• difficulties in retaining key employees or business partners of an acquired company;\n• diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition opportunities;\n• failure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\n• failure to identify the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or technology, including issues related to intellectual\nproperty, regulatory compliance practices, litigation, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or user issues;\n91\nTable of Contents\n• acquired businesses or businesses that we invest in may not have adequate controls, processes, and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations,\nincluding with respect to data privacy, data protection, and data security, as well as anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, export controls, sanctions and\nindustry-specific-regulation;\n• risks that regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to an acquired company or business, or the risk that we become\nsubject to new or additional regulatory burdens that affect our business in potentially unanticipated and significantly negative ways;\n• theft of our trade secrets or confidential information that we share with potential acquisition candidates;\n• risk that an acquired company or investment in new offerings cannibalizes a portion of our existing business; and\n• adverse market reaction to an acquisition.\nIn addition, we may divest businesses or assets or enter into joint ventures, strategic partnerships or other strategic transactions. For example, in February\n2023, we closed the sale of our vehicle service center business. In addition, as a result of our acquisition of PBSC, we became an indirect party to certain partnerships\nand joint ventures that we did not negotiate, and with partners with whom we are less familiar. These types of transactions present certain risks; for example, we may\nnot achieve the desired strategic, operational and financial benefits of a divestiture, partnership, joint venture or other strategic transaction, or we may have difficulty\noperating together with another partner or joint venturer. In addition, in light of high interest rates and the volatility of the financial markets, it may be more difficult to\nfind suitable acquirors or business partners, and during the pendency of a divestiture or during the integration or separation process of any strategic transaction, we may\nbe subject to risks related to a decline in the business, loss of employees, customers, or suppliers, and the risk that the transaction does not close.\nFurther, minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal,\noperational, regulatory, and/or compliance risks associated with the investment. In addition, we may be dependent on other persons or entities who control the entities in\nwhich we invest, including their management or controlling shareholders, and who may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent with ours.\nBusiness decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them may\nadversely affect the value of our investment or result in litigation or regulatory action against us. We can provide no assurance that our investments in other\ntechnologies or businesses will generate returns for our business, or that we will not lose our initial investment in whole or in part. For example, in October 2022, one of\nour autonomous vehicle partners announced its wind-down, and as a result we incurred a total impairment of $135.7 million consisting of impairments of our non-\nmarketable equity investment in such company and other assets.\nIf we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions of businesses, new technologies, services\nand other assets, strategic investments or other transactions, or if we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions or investments, or if we are unable to successfully\ncomplete other transactions or such transactions do not meet our strategic objectives, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely\naffected.\nServicing our current and future debt may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our\nindebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our\nflexibility in operating our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn May 2020 and February 2024, we issued our 2025 Notes and 2029 Notes, respectively, in private placements to qualified institutional buyers. In addition, in\nconnection with our acquisition of Flexdrive, which is an independently managed, wholly-owned subsidiary, Flexdrive remained responsible for its obligations under a\nLoan and Security Agreement, as amended, with a third-party lender, a Master Vehicle Acquisition Financing and Security Agreement, as amended, with a third-party\nlender and a Vehicle Procurement Agreement, as amended, with a third-party; and, following the acquisition, we continued to guarantee the payments of Flexdrive for\nany amounts borrowed under these agreements. As of September 30, 2024, we had $1.0 billion of indebtedness for borrowed money outstanding. In November 2022,\nwe also entered into a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with certain lenders providing the ability to borrow an aggregate principal amount of up\nto $420.0 million, none of which has been drawn as of September 30, 2024, and $73.0 million in letters of credit were issued under the Revolving Credit Facility as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. On December 12, 2023, we entered into an amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility which, among other things, permits us to refinance the\n2025 Notes and amends certain financial covenants. On February 21, 2024, the Revolving Credit Facility was further amended to, among other things: (a) solely for the\npurposes of the financial covenant test, replace total leverage with total net leverage and (b) permit us to repurchase up to a specified amount of the Company's common\nstock with the proceeds of a convertible note offering. See Note\n92\nTable of Contents\n7 “Debt” to our condensed consolidated financial statements, for further information on these agreements and our outstanding debt obligations.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest or fees on or to refinance or repay our indebtedness depends on our future\nperformance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the\nfuture sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more\nalternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability\nto refinance any existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets, general macroeconomic conditions and our financial condition at such time. We may\nnot be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. Events and\ncircumstances may also occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable draw-down conditions and utilize our revolving credit facility. In addition, any\nof our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants\ncould result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt.\nIn addition, our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. For\nexample, it could:\n• make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in\ngovernment regulation;\n• limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n• place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt;\n• limit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund acquisitions, for working capital and for other general corporate purposes; and\n• make an acquisition of our company less attractive or more difficult.\nIn addition, under certain of our and our subsidiary’s existing debt instruments, we and Flexdrive are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants\nregarding our business and operations, including limitations on Flexdrive’s ability to enter into certain acquisitions or consolidations or engage in certain asset\ndispositions. If we or Flexdrive, as applicable, do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements, and do not obtain an amendment,\nwaiver or consent from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding debt may be declared immediately due and payable. Further, any such\namendment, waiver or consent that we are able to obtain may contain additional restrictions or terms that are less favorable to us. Any debt financing secured by us in\nthe future could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more\ndifficult for us to obtain additional capital to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions or divestitures. Any default under our debt arrangements\ncould require that we repay our loans immediately, and may limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows\nand liquidity.\nAny of these factors could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to\nour business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase.\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely\naffect our results of operations.\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility include a number of covenants that limit our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur\nadditional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of our assets, pay dividends, make redemptions and repurchases\nof stock, make investments, loans and acquisitions, or engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of our revolving credit facility may restrict our current and future\noperations and could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more\ndifficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy, including potential acquisitions, and compete against companies which are not subject to such restrictions.\nA failure by us to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in our credit agreement could result in an event of default under the\nagreement, which would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments to provide additional loans under our revolving credit facility and to declare all\nborrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If the debt under our revolving credit facility were to be\naccelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which could\nimmediately adversely affect our business, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we\n93\nTable of Contents\nwere able to obtain new financing or negotiate an amendment, waiver or consent under our existing credit agreement, it may contain additional restrictions, or not be on\ncommercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\nIn connection with the issuance of our Notes, we entered into the capped call transactions (the “Capped Calls”) with certain of the initial purchasers of the\n2025 Notes or their respective affiliates for the 2025 Notes, and with certain financial institutions for the 2029 Notes (the “option counterparties”). We are subject to the\nrisk that any or all of them might default under the Capped Calls. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Past\nglobal economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an option counterparty becomes\nsubject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the Capped Calls\nwith such option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price\nand in the volatility of our Class A common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution\nthan we currently anticipate with respect to our Class A common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $7.7 billion of federal and $6.4 billion of state net operating losses (“NOLs”) available to reduce future taxable income,\nwhich will begin to expire in 2034 for federal income tax purposes and in 2024 for state income tax purposes. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in\ntime to use NOLs before their expiration. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the\ncorporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOLs to offset its post-change income may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative\nchange in our ownership by “5-percent shareholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Limitations may apply under state tax laws. For\nexample, recently enacted California legislation limits the use of state NOLs for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2024, and before January 1, 2027. As a result\nof this legislation or other unforeseen reasons, we may not be able to utilize some or all of our NOLs even if we attain profitability.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act, among other things,\nlimited the use of NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 to 80% of taxable income for tax years beginning after December 31, 2020. Not all\nstates conform to the Tax Act or CARES Act. In future years, if and when a net deferred tax asset is recognized related to our NOLs, these changes may significantly\nimpact our valuation allowance assessments for NOLs generated after December 31, 2017.\nRisks Related to Governance and Ownership of our Capital Stock Factors\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting power with our Co-Founders, which will limit your ability to influence the\noutcome of important transactions, including a change in control.\nOur Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our Co-Founders together hold all of the issued and\noutstanding shares of our Class B common stock. Accordingly, Logan Green, our co-founder and Chair of our board of directors holds approximately 18.91% of the\nvoting power of our outstanding capital stock; and John Zimmer, our co-founder and Vice Chair of our board of directors, holds approximately 10.86% of the voting\npower of our outstanding capital stock. Therefore, our Co-Founders, individually or together, may be able to significantly influence matters submitted to our\nstockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all\nof our assets or other major corporate transactions. Our Co-Founders, individually or together, may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with\nwhich you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control\nof our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately\naffect the market price of our Class A common stock. Each Co-Founder’s voting power is as of September 30, 2024 and includes shares of Class A common stock\nexpected to be issued upon the vesting of such Co-Founder’s RSUs within 60 days of September 30, 2024.\nFuture transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to\nlimited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will convert automatically into one\nshare of Class A common stock upon (i) the date specified by affirmative written election of the holders of two-thirds of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common\nstock, (ii) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the date on which the shares of Class B common\nstock held by our Co-Founders and their permitted entities and permitted transferees represent less than 20% of the Class B common stock held by our Co-Founders and\ntheir permitted entities as of immediately following the completion of our initial public offering, or IPO, or (iii) nine months after the death or total disability of the last\nto\n94\nTable of Contents\ndie or become disabled of our Co-Founders, or such later date not to exceed a total period of 18 months after such death or disability as may be approved by a majority\nof our independent directors.\nWe cannot predict the impact our dual class structure may have on our stock price.\nWe cannot predict whether our dual class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock, adverse publicity or other\nadverse consequences.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond\nour control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading\nprice of our Class A common stock include the following:\n• price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time, including fluctuations due to general economic uncertainty or negative market\nsentiment;\n• volatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks generally, or those in our industry, including fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate\nto the operating performance of those technology companies;\n• changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n• sales or purchases of shares of our Class A common stock by us, our officers, or our significant stockholders, as well as the perception that such sales or\npurchases could occur;\n• issuance of shares of our Class A common stock, whether in connection with our equity incentive plans, an acquisition or upon conversion of our outstanding\nNotes;\n• failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet\nthese estimates or the expectations of investors;\n• the financial and business projections, targets or goals we provide to the public, any changes in those projections, targets or goals or our failure to meet those\nprojections, targets or goals;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of new offerings or platform features;\n• investor sentiment and the public’s reaction to our press releases, earnings and other public announcements, and filings with the SEC, or those of our\ncompetitors or others in our industry;\n• rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n• short selling of our Class A common stock or related derivative securities;\n• actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\n• actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n• litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n• developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n• announced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services or technologies by us or our competitors;\n• new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business or statements by public officials regarding potential\nnew laws or regulations;\n• changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\n• any significant change in our management or our board of directors; and\n• general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.\n95\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action\nlitigation has often been instituted against these companies, including as described in the “Legal Proceedings” subheading in Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies\nto the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Although we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend\nto vigorously defend against them, such matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy\ncontest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in\ncontrol by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the\nperson became an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate\nof incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\n• any amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amendments by stockholders to our amended and restated bylaws require the\napproval of at least two-thirds of our then-outstanding voting power;\n• our dual class common stock structure, which provides our Co-Founders, individually or together, with the ability to significantly influence the outcome of\nmatters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B\ncommon stock;\n• our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors are only able to be removed from office for\ncause;\n• our stockholders are only able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and are not able to take action by written consent for any matter;\n• our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\n• vacancies on our board of directors are able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;\n• a special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer, our President or a majority\nof our board of directors;\n• certain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\n• our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may\nbe issued without further action by our stockholders; and\n• advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also\ndiscourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any\nof which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock, and could\nalso affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes\nbetween us and our stockholders and also provide that the federal district courts will be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause\nof action arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the “Securities Act”), each of which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial\nforum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the\nsole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of\nour directors, stockholders, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation\nLaw, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or (4) any other action asserting\n96\nTable of Contents\na claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction,\nanother State court in Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties\nnamed as defendants. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the federal district courts of the United States are the sole and exclusive forum for resolving\nany complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act against any person in connection with any offering of our securities, including, without\nlimitation and for the avoidance of doubt, any auditor, underwriter, expert, control person or other defendant.\nAny person or entity purchasing, holding or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these\nprovisions. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors,\nofficers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find the exclusive-forum\nprovisions in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in\nother jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations.\nITEM 2.

Services.\n1.1 The Consultant will serve as a consultant to the Company and advise the Company’s management, employees and\nagents, at reasonable times, in matters related to Company’s actual and planned business, as requested by the Company for the duration\nof the Term (the “Services”). The Services shall include, but shall not be limited to:\n(a) providing services to Lyft to ensure an orderly transition of Consultant’s former employment responsibilities\nto other Lyft employees, consultants, or agents;\n(b) cooperating with the Company and its counsel in the defense or prosecution of any claims or actions now in\nexistence or which may be brought in the future against or on behalf of the Company which relate in any way to events or occurrences\nthat transpired while Consultant was employed by the Company.\n1.2 The Services will be provided to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), and any of his delegees, as the\nCEO reasonably deems necessary.\n1.3 The Services may be provided by Consultant, and consultation may be sought by the Company, at the Company’s\noffices, over email, video conference, or telephone, or another reasonable location or communication medium and at reasonable times\n(all as specified by the Company). The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to permit Consultant to provide the Services\nremotely, to the extent that the Company (acting in good faith) believes that doing so will not harm the Company or degrade the quality\nof the Services.\n1.4 For avoidance of doubt there will be no break in service for equity vesting purposes when Consultant terminates\nemployment and immediately thereafter commences providing Services pursuant to this Agreement.\n2. Compensation.\n2.1 As compensation for the Services during the Term (defined below), Consultant will receive the following\nconsideration:\n(a) Consultant’s equity awards to receive shares of the Company’s Class A common stock set forth on Schedule\n1 (collectively, the “Equity Awards”) will continue to remain eligible to vest and, to the extent applicable, remain exercisable subject to\nthe\nterms and conditions of the applicable Company equity plan and the award agreements evidencing such Equity Awards (collectively, the\n“Equity Documents”), provided that the vesting of the tranche of Equity Awards scheduled to vest on November 20, 2024, shall be\nsubject to Consultant’s execution and non-revocation of the Supplemental Release attached as Exhibit 1 on the terms set forth therein.\nAny portion of an Equity Award that is scheduled to vest following the Contract Termination Date (as defined below) and any equity\naward held by Consultant that is not listed on Schedule 1 immediately will be forfeited to the Company on the Effective Date and at no\ncost to the Company, notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Equity Documents. Except as modified hereby, all Equity Awards\nremain subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Documents. Consultant acknowledges and agrees that Consultant remains\nsubject to the Company’s Insider Trading Policy through the Term (as defined below) and, if later, through the end of any trading\nblackout period in effect at the expiration of the Term.\n(b) In addition, the Company will pay Consultant a monthly fee of $10,000 in respect of each month during the\nTerm (“Consulting Fees”). The Company will pay each monthly Consulting Fee no later than thirty (30) days after the month to which\nsuch monthly Consulting Fee relates.\n2.2 Consultant shall not be authorized to incur on behalf of the Company any expenses and will be responsible for all\nexpenses incurred while performing the Services unless otherwise agreed to by the Company in writing in advance by the Company’s\nCEO.\n3. Term. The “Term” will be such period that commences on the Effective Date and will terminate on the earlier of (i)\nNovember 30, 2024, or (ii) the date on which Consultant commences full-time employment (or substantially full-time employment) with\na direct or indirect competitor of the Company (as determined by the Company in its reasonable and good faith discretion) (“Competitor\nEmployment”), unless earlier terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, or unless extended by agreement of the parties hereto (whichever\ndate applies being the “Contract Termination Date”). If Consultant obtains full-time (or substantially full-time) employment other than\nCompetitor Employment, then the Term shall continue until the Contract Termination Date and Consultant shall remain eligible to\nreceive the consideration set forth in Section 2 of this Agreement, provided that Consultant shall use good faith commercially reasonable\nefforts to have Consultant’s new employer compensate Consultant for any Consulting Fees which have not yet been paid as of the\ncommencement of such employment, and the Company shall not be required to pay to Consultant any such Consulting Fees for which\nConsultant is compensated by Consultant’s new employer. On or immediately following the Contract Termination Date, Consultant will\npromptly deliver to the Company all company property and documents and other materials of any nature furnished by the Company to\nthe Consultant or produced by the Consultant in connection with the services rendered hereunder, together with all copies of any of the\nforegoing pertaining to the Services or pertaining to any Confidential Information. Termination of this Agreement under this Section 3\nshall not affect the Consultant’s continuing obligations to the Company under Section 7 below.\n4. Termination.\n4.1 Breach. Either party may terminate this Agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party of this\nAgreement if such breach continues uncured for a period of ten (10) days after written notice.\n4.2 Expiration. Unless terminated earlier as provided under Section 4.1, this Agreement will expire at the end of the\nTerm.\n4.3 No Election of Remedies. The election by the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with its terms\nshall not be deemed an election of remedies, and all other remedies provided by this Agreement or available at law or in equity shall\nsurvive any termination.\n5. Conflicts of Interest.\n5.1 The Consultant will not disclose to the Company any information that the Consultant is obligated to keep secret\npursuant to an existing confidentiality agreement with a third party, and nothing in this Agreement will impose any obligation on the\nConsultant to the contrary.\n5.2 The Consultant shall not use the funding, resources, facilities or time properly devoted to any third party to perform\nconsulting work hereunder and shall not perform the Services hereunder in any manner that would give any third party rights to any\nintellectual property or other products of such consulting work.\n5.3 The Consultant has disclosed all conflicts of interest with the Company as of the date hereof on Exhibit A hereto,\nand, during the Term, will disclose to the CEO or the Company’s highest ranking legal officer and highest ranking internal employment\ncounsel (in either case, the “Company Legal Representative”) any future conflicts that arise between this Agreement and any other\nagreements entered by the Consultant.\n6. Non-Competition / Non-Solicitation.\n6.1 The Consultant agrees that during the consultancy period, she shall not, anywhere in the world, do business, as an\nemployee, independent contractor, consultant, advisor, or board member, and shall not directly or indirectly participate in or accept any\nposition, proposal or job offer with the following companies or any of their parent companies or subsidiaries: Waymo LLC; Cruise\nLLC; Uber Technologies, Inc.; Aurora Innovation, Inc.; Zoox (Amazon, Inc.); Via Transportation, Inc.; Neutron Holdings, Inc., dba\nLime; Skinny Labs Inc. dba, Spin; Bird Global, Inc.; Tesla, Inc.; Turo Inc.; Grab Holdings Inc.; DiDi Global Inc.; Bolt Technology OÜ;\nDoorDash, Inc.; GrubHub Inc.; and Maplebear Inc., dba Instacart. The preceding list does not constitute the entire list of direct or\nindirect competitors of the Company for purposes of Section 3.\n6.2 In addition, Consultant agrees that during the consultancy period, Consultant agrees not to approach, solicit or\nrecruit any employee of the Company or any consultant, service provider, agent, distributor, customer or supplier of the Company, to\nterminate, reduce or modify the scope of such person’s engagement with the Company.\n7. Confidentiality.\n7.1 The Consultant acknowledges that, during the course of performing the Services hereunder, the Company may\ndisclose information to the Consultant (including information acquired from third parties which is subject to confidentiality obligations)\nand that Consultant may have access to information related to the Company’s products, services, customers and other business partners,\npersonnel, business plans, and finances, as well as other proprietary or commercially valuable information which the Company does not\nmake generally available to the public (collectively “Confidential Information”).\n7.2 The Consultant agrees that the Confidential Information will be used by the Consultant only in connection with\nconsulting activities hereunder.\n7.3 The Consultant agrees not to disclose, directly or indirectly, the Confidential Information to any third person or\nentity, other than representatives or agents of the Company.\n7.4 The term “Confidential Information” does not include information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the\npublic other than by disclosure in violation of this Agreement, (ii) was within the Consultant’s possession prior to being furnished to the\nConsultant by the Company, as shown by written records, (iii) becomes available to the Consultant on a non-confidential basis without\nbreach of any confidentiality obligation to the Company, or (iv) was independently developed by Consultant without reference to the\ninformation provided by the Company, as shown by written records.\n7.5 The Consultant may disclose any Confidential Information that is required to be disclosed by law, government\nregulation or court order. If disclosure is required, the Consultant will give the Company advance notice so that the Company may seek a\nprotective order or take other action reasonable in light of the circumstances.\n7.6 Upon termination of this Agreement, the Consultant will promptly return to the Company all materials in\nConsultant’s possession containing Confidential Information, as well as data, records, reports and other property, furnished by the\nCompany to the Consultant or produced by the Consultant in connection with services rendered hereunder, together with all copies in\nConsultant’s possession of any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding such return, the Consultant shall continue to be bound by the terms of\nthe confidentiality provisions contained in this Section 7 for a period of three years after the termination of this Agreement.\n8. Arbitration.\n8.1 Agreement to Arbitrate. In exchange for the benefits of the speedy, economical, and impartial dispute resolution\nprocedure of arbitration, Consultant and the Company mutually forego their right to resolution of disputes in a court of law by a judge or\njury, and, as set forth herein, agree to arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9\nU.S.C. § 1, et seq.\n8.2 Disputes Covered by Arbitration. Consultant and the Company agree that any and all claims, disputes or\ncontroversies between Consultant and the Company arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement (including its enforcement,\nbreach, performance, interpretation, validity, or termination), including any claims arising out of or related in any way to Consultant’s\nrelationship with or Services for the Company and/or its affiliates, shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration to the fullest extent\nallowed by law. This arbitration obligation shall apply to any and all claims, causes of action, in law or equity of any nature whatsoever,\nwhether arising in contract, tort or statute, between Consultant and the Company and/or their affiliated entities (including their owners,\ndirectors, managers, employees, agents, and officers), unless the particular dispute or claim is expressly exempted from arbitration. By\nagreeing to this dispute resolution and arbitration agreement, Consultant and the Company expressly waive the right to sue in\ncourt and have a jury or judge decide their claim, dispute, or controversy.\n8.3 Delegation of Arbitrability. Consultant and the Company expressly delegate to the arbitrator the authority to\ndetermine the arbitrability of any dispute, including the scope, applicability, validity, and enforceability of this arbitration provision.\n8.4 Disputes Not Covered by Arbitration. This arbitration provision does not include: (1) a claim for workers’\ncompensation benefits; (2) a claim for unemployment compensation benefits; or (3) a claim under the National Labor Relations Act\n(“NLRA”), as amended. In addition, in lieu of arbitration of any dispute covered by this arbitration provision, Consultant or the\nCompany may bring any such dispute in small claims court in their individual, as opposed to a class or representative capacity.\n8.5 Class Action Waiver. Except as otherwise required under applicable law, both Consultant and the Company\nagree that each may bring any and all claims against the other only in an individual capacity, and not as a named-plaintiff or\nclass member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Any claims Consultant may bring pursuant to the Private\nAttorneys General Act (“PAGA”) on behalf of the Labor and Workforce Development Agency must be arbitrated in Consultant’s\nindividual capacity such that there is no joinder or representation of any California Labor Code violations that were or could be asserted\nby or on behalf of any other natural persons. Consultant and the Company further agree that, in the event that the agreement to not bring\nclaims on a class or representative basis is deemed unenforceable in state or federal court proceedings, then their individual claims shall\nbe resolved first by arbitration, with any class or representative claims stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration.\n8.6 Statutes of Limitations, Scope of Remedies, Discovery, and Substantive Law. Statutes of limitations, scope of\nremedies, and substantive law (including any requirement for prior exhaustion of administrative agency relief) shall be the same as would\nbe applicable were any action to be brought in court and shall not be limited by the fact that any dispute is subject to arbitration. As part\nof the arbitration, both Consultant and the Company will have the opportunity for reasonable discovery of non-privileged information\nthat is relevant to their dispute. Notwithstanding any other provision in this agreement with respect to applicable substantive law, any\narbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.\n8.7 Administration of Arbitration. The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the\n“AAA”) before one arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, and if no agreement can be reached within thirty (30) days after\nnames of potential arbitrators have been proposed by the parties or AAA, then by one arbitrator having reasonable experience in matters\nof the type provided for in this Agreement and who is chosen by the AAA. The arbitration shall take place in the county in which\nConsultant was working with the Company at the time that the dispute arose, or any other jurisdiction mutually agreed upon by\nConsultant and the Company. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect,\nwhich rules can be found at www.adr.org, or which can be obtained by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or which will be provided by\nthe Company upon request. However, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to decide to apply the AAA Employment Rules, or the AAA\nCommercial Rules, where a dispute is more appropriately arbitrated under those rules. The arbitrator shall be required to provide in\nwriting to the parties the basis for the award or order of such arbitrator, and a court reporter shall record all hearings, with such record\nconstituting the official transcript of such proceedings. The arbitrator shall have the power to decide any motions brought by any party to\nthe arbitration. Judgment upon any award rendered in such arbitration will be binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction\nthereof.\n8.8 Arbitration Costs. To the extent required by law, the Company shall pay for any administrative or hearing fees\ncharged by AAA. Subject to the foregoing limitation, to the extent permitted by the AAA rules, Consultant shall pay any filing fees\nassociated with any arbitration that Consultant initiates, unless Consultant qualifies for fee waivers or other forms of cost relief at the\ndiscretion of the arbitrator, but in no event shall Consultant’s AAA filing fee exceed the filing fees that Consultant would have paid if\nConsultant had filed a complaint in a court of law having jurisdiction.\n8.9 Optional Pre-Arbitration Negotiation Process. Before initiating any arbitration or proceeding, Consultant and the\nCompany may agree to first attempt to negotiate any dispute, claim, or controversy between the parties informally for at least thirty (30)\ndays. A party who intends to seek negotiation under this subsection must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”).\nThe Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. All offers, promises,\nconduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the negotiation by any of the parties, their agents,\nemployees, and attorneys are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in arbitration or any\nother proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered\ninadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the negotiation.\n8.10 Severability. If any provision of this arbitration agreement or the application of such provision to any person or\ncircumstance is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable to any extent, that provision will, if possible, be construed as though more narrowly\ndrawn, if a narrower construction would avoid that invalidity, illegality or unenforceability. If such a narrower construction is not\npossible, then that provision will, to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, be severed, and the remainder of this\narbitration agreement will not be affected thereby.\n9.

Employee and the Company acknowledge and agree as follows:\nWHEREAS, Employee’s employment with the Company will end on the Separation Date (as defined below) by way of voluntary resignation;\nand\nWHEREAS, the Company and Employee desire to set forth the terms of Employee’s separation and wish to resolve any and all claims that\nEmployee may have against the Company and any of the Released Parties (as defined below);\nNOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby\nacknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n1. Separation of Employment. Employee’s employment with the Company will end on August 20, 2024 (or, if applicable, another date\nmutually agreed between Employee and the Company, with the actual employment end date in all cases being the “Separation Date”), and Employee\nhereby resigns as President and from any and all positions as an officer or director of the Company and any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company as of\nthe Separation Date. On and after the Separation Date, Employee shall no longer identify or hold themselves out as an employee of the Company (or of\nany subsidiary or affiliate) and will not be authorized to bind or speak on behalf of the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, Employee’s employment\nwith the Company ends as of the Separation Date whether or not Employee executes this Agreement. Employee acknowledges and agrees that this\nAgreement is a negotiated severance agreement for which consideration does not constitute, in whole or in part, a bonus, raise, employment, or\ncontinued employment.\n2. Severance Benefits. If and only if Employee timely signs and does not revoke this Agreement and complies with its terms, then as\nconsideration, the adequacy of which Employee hereby acknowledges, the Company agrees that:\na. Severance Pay: The Company will pay Employee a severance payment in an amount equal to the sum of $650,000 and $487,500 (which\nis equal to a gross amount of $1,137,500), less lawful payroll deductions and withholdings (“Cash Severance Payment”), an amount to\nwhich Employee acknowledges Employee is not otherwise entitled.\nb. Continued Medical Benefit. The Company will pay Employee a lump sum cash payment in the gross amount of $33,462, less lawful\npayroll deductions and withholdings (the “COBRA Severance Payment”). The COBRA Severance Payment reflects the cost of\ncontinued health coverage under COBRA (as defined below) for a period of twelve (12) months. The COBRA Severance Payment will\nbe paid at the same time as the Cash Severance Payment. For the avoidance of doubt, this payment is not conditioned on Employee\nelecting COBRA continuation coverage.\nc. Accelerated Vesting of Retention RSUs. The vesting of Employee’s 209,831 currently unvested Retention RSUs (as defined in that\ncertain letter agreement entered into between\nEmployee and the Company, dated April 26, 2023 (the “Retention Agreement”)) shall be accelerated in full (the “Retention RSU\nVesting Acceleration”) on the later of the Separation Date or the Effective Date (as defined below). Following the Separation Date,\nEquity Awards (as defined below) that do not vest pursuant to the Retention RSU Vesting Acceleration will be forfeited, except as\notherwise set forth herein and in Employee’s Consulting Agreement dated August 20, 2024 (the “Consulting Agreement”).\nThe Cash Severance Payment, COBRA Severance Payment and Retention RSU Vesting Acceleration will be collectively referred to as “Severance\nBenefits”. The Company will make payment of the Severance Benefits in accordance with the payment timing requirements under the Company’s\nExecutive Change in Control and Severance Plan (the “Severance Plan”) for which Employee signed a participation agreement on or about March 8,\n2019. Employee and the Company agree that the Severance Benefits are the only payments and benefits that Employee is or will be owed under the\nSeverance Plan and the Retention Agreement, notwithstanding any subsequent change in control of the Company or other event. The Severance Benefits\nare subject to all of the terms of the Severance Plan, including (but not limited to) the provisions related to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.\nEmployee and the Company agree that employee’s termination of employment under this Agreement will be a “separation from service” under Section\n409A. By Employee’s signature below, Employee authorizes the Company to pay the cash portion of the Severance Benefits by direct deposit into\nEmployee’s bank account on file in the Company’s records.\n3. Equity. The Company previously granted Employee equity award(s) to purchase or receive shares of the Company’s Class A common\nstock set forth on Schedule 1 that remain outstanding as of the date Employee was presented with this Agreement (collectively, “Equity Awards”),\nsubject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Company equity plan and the award agreement evidencing such Equity Awards (collectively the\n“Equity Documents”). The parties acknowledge that, except as modified to reflect the Retention RSU Vesting Acceleration, the Equity Awards will be\ngoverned by the terms of the Equity Documents. Employee acknowledges and agrees that Employee remains subject to the Company’s Insider Trading\nPolicy through the Term (as defined in the Consulting Agreement) and, if later, through the end of any trading blackout period in effect at the expiration\nof the Term. After the Separation Date, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid providing employee with material non-public\ninformation regarding the Company and Employee will use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid acquiring or receiving material non-public\ninformation regarding the Company. Employee agrees that Employee’s compliance with the securities laws are Employee’s sole responsibility.\nEmployee agrees that Employee has no rights to the continued vesting of Company Equity Awards following the Separation Date other than as described\nin this Section 3 and the Consulting Agreement.\n4. Continuation of Health Benefits.\n(a) Employee will continue to receive Employee’s current benefits, if any, under the Company-sponsored benefit plans, for the period through\nthe last day of the month in which Employee’s Separation Date occurs. Beginning on the Separation Date, Employee may be eligible to elect\ncontinuation coverage under the Company’s group medical, dental, and vision insurance plans for Employee and their eligible dependents. Such\neligibility and coverage will be governed exclusively by the continuation coverage provisions of the Company’s group insurance plans (which may be\namended from time to time) and the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (“COBRA”).\n2\n(b) A “qualifying event” for purposes of COBRA coverage occurred on the Separation Date. The Company or its administrator will send\nEmployee COBRA notification separate from this Agreement, but also hereby notifies Employee that instead of enrolling in COBRA continuation\ncoverage, there may be other more affordable coverage options through the federal Health Insurance Marketplace, state exchange, Medicaid, or other\ngroup health plan coverage options (such as a spouse’s plan) through what is called a “special enrollment period.” Employee understands that Employee\nshould carefully consider whether COBRA continuation coverage is the best option for Employee. Employee will be solely responsible for continuing\ncoverage through COBRA. If Employee signs up for COBRA continuation coverage, Employee will be limited in when Employee may switch to a\nMarketplace or exchange plan in the future depending on the plan’s “special enrollment period.” Employee will be solely responsible for paying any\nCOBRA or other health premiums and administrative costs required to maintain insurance coverage, whether under the Company’s group health plan for\nthe COBRA period or any other health insurance plan.\n5. All Wages, Benefits and Expenses Paid in Full. Employee acknowledges that, to the extent applicable, all earned wages,\nvacation/PTO, benefits, overtime, meal and rest premiums, business expenses, bonuses, incentive pay and any other compensation, and any other\namounts that might be owed to Employee by the Company were paid in full as of the Separation Date. Employee agrees that Employee has submitted, or\nwill submit within 30 days of the Separation Date, any outstanding business expenses for reimbursement and such expenses will be handled pursuant to\nstandard Company policy. Other than the obligations in Sections 2, 3 and 4, Employee acknowledges and agrees that the Company has no further\nfinancial obligations to Employee, and the Company shall make no further payments or contributions on Employee’s behalf.\n6. Nonadmission of Liability. Employee acknowledges that nothing in this Agreement, including the foregoing consideration, constitutes\nan admission of liability, express or implied, on the part of the Company with respect to any fact or matter which may be involved in Employee’s\nemployment with or separation of employment from the Company. Employee further acknowledges that the Company denies that it or any of its\nemployees, officers, directors, and/or agents ever acted toward Employee in a manner that would constitute a violation of any constitutional, statutory or\ncommon law right, whether that right arises under state, federal or local law.\n7. General Release and Covenant Not to Sue.\n(a) Employee (for Employee’s self and Employee’s heirs, administrators, executors, agents and assigns) does hereby fully and forever release,\nwaive, discharge and covenant not to sue the Company or any related or affiliated entity, or its or their respective current or former parent entities,\nofficers, employees, directors, insurers, agents, attorneys, benefit plans, and assigns, and any predecessors or successors of the foregoing (collectively,\nthe “Released Parties”), with respect to any and all claims, assertions of claims, debts, demands, actions, suits, expenses, attorneys’ fees, costs, damages\nand/or liabilities of any nature, type and description, known or unknown, at law or in equity, arising out of any fact or matter in any way connected with\nEmployee’s employment with the Company, the separation thereof, or any other related matter arising before the date Employee signs this Agreement.\nThis release shall include but is not limited to any rights or claims under federal, state or local law (whether arising from statute, executive order,\nregulation, code, or constitution, or other source), including but not limited to claims arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended,\nSection 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the Fair Labor Standards Act (to the extent subject to a waiver of this sort), the Equal Pay Act, the\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967\n(“ADEA”), the Americans with Disabilities\n3\nAct, the Family Medical Leave Act, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, the Workers Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights\nAct, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the anti-retaliation provisions of the Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002 (also known as the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Report Consumer Protection Act), Cal-OSHA, the California Fair Employment & Housing Act, the\nCalifornia Labor Code, the California Government Code, the California Family Rights Act, the California Civil Code, the California Business &\nProfessions Code, each as amended, rights to rehire and reemployment, and any and all common law claims, including claims sounding in tort or\ncontract, claims for compensation, benefits, equity, or other remuneration or attorneys’ fees, costs or disbursements, claims for physical or emotional\ndistress or injuries, claims for discrimination, harassment, retaliation, failure to accommodate, violation of public policy, breach of express or implied\ncontract, breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, defamation or misrepresentation, and any claims arising under any other duty or\nobligation of any kind or description, whether arising in law or equity, which can lawfully be released under federal, state, or local law. The foregoing is\na non-exhaustive list, and this release is intended to cover all claims that may be lawfully waived by agreement, including those not specifically listed.\nThe parties agree and acknowledge that the payments made pursuant to this Agreement are not related to sexual harassment.\n(b) Covenant Not to Sue. Besides waiving rights and releasing claims encompassed by the General Release in Section 7(a) above, Employee\npromises not to bring a lawsuit or arbitration against the Company alleging any claim or violation of rights covered by that General Release. This\nCovenant Not to Sue is different from the General Release in that it is an affirmative promise by Employee, violation of which can result in a claim for\ndamages by the Company against Employee. Details regarding exceptions to this covenant and damages Employee must pay for violating it are\ncontained in Sections 7(d) and 18 below.\n(c) Waiver of Unknown Claims. This general and complete release covers both claims that Employee knows about and those that Employee may\nnot know about and that exist in Employee’s favor at the time of executing this Agreement. Employee understands and for valuable consideration hereby\nexpressly agrees that in the event of any injury, loss, or damage sustained by Employee which is not now known or suspected, or in the event that the\nlosses or damages now known or suspected have present or future consequences not now known or suspected, this Agreement shall nevertheless\nconstitute a full and final release as to the Company, and that this Agreement shall apply to all such known or unsuspected injuries, losses, damages or\nconsequences.\nEmployee understands and for valuable consideration hereby expressly waives all of the rights and benefits of Section 1542 of the California\nCivil Code, which section reads as follows:\nA GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING\nPARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF\nEXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY\nAFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY.\nEmployee also understands and agrees that this is a “negotiated severance agreement” as that term is used under California law because it is voluntary,\ndeliberate, and informed, provides consideration of\n4\nvalue to Employee, and Employee has been given notice and an opportunity to retain an attorney or is represented by an attorney.\n(d) Matters Not Waived. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Employee is not waiving, releasing or giving up any claim\nfor workers’ compensation benefits or unemployment benefits to which the Employee has an unwaivable right, vested pension or savings plan benefits,\nclaims to enforce this Agreement, claims under indemnification provisions of the Company’s by-laws or officer liability insurance policies, claims under\nsections 2800 to 2810 of the California Labor Code, and claims under other state statutes that may not be waived as a matter of law in an agreement of\nthis type. Employee acknowledges, however, that Employee has no work-related injury or illness at the time of signing this Agreement for which\nEmployee has not already filed a workers compensation claim. Nothing in any part of this Agreement limits or waives Employee’s right to file a charge\nwith an administrative agency, provide testimony or other information to an agency, or take part in any agency investigation; however, Employee is\nwaiving Employee’s right to recover any monetary or other relief in connection with such an investigation or charge filed by Employee or by any other\nindividual, or a charge filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any other federal, state or local agency. If Employee is awarded\nmoney damages as described in the previous sentence, Employee shall decline to accept any such monetary award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this\nAgreement and the limitation on monetary recovery does not limit Employee’s right to receive any statutory or otherwise authorized award for\ninformation provided to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Employee does not waive any rights or claims that arise after the effective date of this\nAgreement.\n8. Permitted Activities. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement (including, without\nlimitation, the release and covenant not to sue provisions in Section 7, the confidentiality provisions in Section 13, the cooperation provisions in Section\n14, the non-disparagement provisions in Section 15, and the mandatory arbitration provisions in Section 16) prohibits Employee from: (a) voluntarily\ncommunicating with, or providing information to, any government agency or other regulator that is responsible for enforcing a law on behalf of the\ngovernment (including, without limitation, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Labor, the National Labor\nRelations Board, the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, Congress, and any Inspector General of any agency) regarding\nconduct or action undertaken or omitted to be taken by the Company or any of its affiliates that Employee reasonably believes is illegal or in material\nnon-compliance with any financial disclosure or other regulatory requirement applicable to the Company or any of its affiliates, or (b) providing truthful\ntestimony or accurate information in connection with any investigation being conducted into the business or operations of the Company or any of its\naffiliates by any such government agency or other regulator; or requires Employee to obtain the approval of, or give notice to, the Company or any of its\nemployees or representatives to take any action permitted under clauses (a) or (b).\n9. Adequate Consideration. Employee acknowledges that the consideration Employee is receiving under this Agreement, including but\nnot limited to the Severance Benefits, constitutes a benefit to which Employee is not otherwise entitled under any policy, statute, law, or any agreement\nbetween the Company and Employee, and is adequate consideration for Employee’s covenants and obligations under this Agreement, including the\nGeneral Release.\n10. No Pending Litigation. Employee hereby represents that there is no pending action filed (either by Employee or on Employee’s behalf)\nin any court of law, in arbitration, or in any other legal forum against the Company or any of the Released Parties or any other person, entity or\ncorporation in connection with Employee’s employment with the Company.\n5\n11. Property of Employer. Employee represents that Employee has returned to the Company all property of the Company, including but\nnot limited to any keys, access cards, passwords, or equipment belonging to the Company and documents, records, and data in paper or electronic\nformat, as well as all copies of such materials. Employee also agrees to make a good-faith reasonable effort to delete all electronic copies of any such\nmaterials in Employee’s possession (including on any personal device) following return of such electronic documents to the Company. Employee\nacknowledges and understands that such property, documents and materials are proprietary to the Company. In the event that Employee fails to return all\nsuch property, the Company’s obligation under this Agreement shall cease, including the payment obligations described above.\n12. Reference Inquiries. Employee should instruct any prospective employers to direct their reference inquiries to the Human Resources\nDepartment. In the event the Human Resources Department receives any inquiries from prospective employers, the Human Resources Department will\nrespond by advising that the Company’s policy is to provide information only as to service dates and positions held and by providing such information.\nThe Company will consider in good faith input from Employee (which input shall be provided promptly from Employee, if at all) on the initial internal\nCompany-wide announcement and initial Form 8-K filing regarding the Employee’s termination of employment, it being understood that the Company\nhas full discretionary authority to determine the form, manner and content of all announcements, communications and filings.\n13. Confidentiality Matters.\n(a) Confidential or Proprietary Information. Employee acknowledges that, by reason of Employee’s employment, Employee had access to\nconfidential, proprietary, and trade secret information (including customer lists not known to the public) of the Company, and that Employee understands\nEmployee’s obligations under the law and, except as otherwise required by applicable law and/or as excepted pursuant to Sections 7(d) and 13(a) of this\nAgreement, Employee agrees not to disclose or divulge to any third party or otherwise use or allow to be used in any manner (whether for Employee’s\nbenefit, for the benefit of another individual or entity, or otherwise) any confidential, trade secret or proprietary information concerning the operations or\nbusiness of the Company at any time following the Separation Date. These obligations shall not apply to information that (i) is now a part of public\nknowledge or literature or is generally known in the industry; or (ii) hereafter becomes a part of the public knowledge or generally known in the industry\nfrom a source other than Employee, either directly or indirectly. Moreover, nothing in this Agreement shall limit Employee’s ability to report possible\nviolations of law in confidence to the appropriate government agency or entity or make other disclosures protected under the whistleblower provisions of\napplicable federal or state law or regulation. Pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Employee will not face civil or criminal liability for\ndisclosing a trade secret: (1) to a government official or an attorney, if the disclosure is made in confidence and for the sole purpose of reporting or\ninvestigating a suspected violation of law; or (2) in a document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, provided the document is filed under seal. In\naddition, if Employee files a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, Employee may disclose a trade secret to\nEmployee’s attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, provided the document containing the trade secret is filed under seal\nand Employee does not otherwise disclose the trade secret except pursuant to court order. The confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations in this\nparagraph are in addition to, and not in lieu of, Employee’s obligations under the Employee Invention Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement that\nEmployee signed on or about December 6, 2012, (the “Confidentiality Agreement”), and, except as otherwise required by applicable law and/or as\nexcepted pursuant to Sections 7(d) and 13(a) of this Agreement, Employee will remain\n6\nbound by the obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, at all times in the future, even after the Separation Date.\n(b) Confidentiality of Agreement. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the terms of this Agreement, to the extent they are not publicly\ndisclosed by the Company are ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENTIAL. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the terms of this Agreement, unless\npreviously publicly disclosed by the Company shall not, without the Company’s prior written consent, be disclosed to any person, firm, organization or\nentity, including but not limited to any current or former employees of the Company. Except as provided in this paragraph, otherwise required by\napplicable law, and/or as excepted pursuant to Sections 7(d) and 13(a) of this Agreement, Employee shall not: (a) communicate or disclose in any way\nthe amount of the Severance Benefits made by the Company; or (b) give any indication of the amount of the Severance Benefits. Employee may\ncommunicate the terms and conditions of this Agreement (1) to Employee’s spouse/domestic partner; or (2) to Employee’s attorney and those rendering\nfinancial or legal advice and having a bona fide need to know such terms and conditions; provided, however, Employee shall advise any such individuals\nbeforehand of the existence of Employee’s confidentiality obligations under this Agreement and their corresponding obligations to maintain the\nconfidentiality of this Agreement. A breach of these obligations by Employee’s spouse/domestic partner, attorney, advisor, or agents will be deemed a\nbreach of this Agreement by Employee. Moreover, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Employee from disclosing the terms and conditions of this\nAgreement to government agencies for tax purposes (i.e., the IRS and Franchise Tax Board); or if required by a valid court order, subpoena, or\nregulatory request or other compulsory process or law; provided, however, that Employee shall advise such agency or court of the confidential nature of\nthis Agreement and shall exercise reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the subject matter\ndisclosed. Further, the Company agrees that it will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to not publicly disclose any potential employment\nopportunity Employee may have prior to Employee or Employee’s new employer/company announcing it, with the exception of required disclosures to\nthe Company’s Board of Directors or advisors, or required by law, under applicable confidentiality obligations.\n(c) Breach of Confidentiality Provisions/Liquidated Damages. Employee agrees that if Employee, Employee’s attorney, or Employee’s\naccountant, financial advisor or spouse/domestic partner breaches the promise to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement and the Severance Pay,\nthen the resulting damage to the Company would be impracticable or extremely difficult to determine because of the uncertain effect of the disclosure of\nsuch information on the Company’s present and future business prospects. Because of the difficulty of determining the damages resulting from any such\nbreach of the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement, the parties agree that in the event of such a breach by Employee either directly by Employee\nor indirectly through Employee’s spouse, attorney or agents, Employee shall be obligated to re-pay to the Company the sum of five thousand dollars\n($5,000) as liquidated damages for each occurrence, which amount Employee agrees is reasonable. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict any other\nremedies available to the Company, at law or in equity, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by Employee of any obligations under this\nAgreement.\n14. Cooperation. Following the Separation Date, Employee also agrees to cooperate with the Company in regard to the transition of the\nbusiness matters handled by Employee on behalf of the Company. Employee agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Company and its counsel in the\ndefense or prosecution of any claims or actions now in existence or which may be brought in the future against or on behalf of the Company, or in any\ninvestigation or review that may be performed by the Company or any governmental authority, which relate in any way to events or occurrences that\ntranspired while Employee was employed by the Company or about which Employee may have knowledge. Employee’s cooperation\n7\nin connection with such claims, actions, or investigations will include, but not be limited to, being available to meet with the Company’s counsel to\nprepare for discovery or any legal proceeding, executing documents, and providing truthful testimony as a witness on behalf of the Company at mutually\nconvenient times. The Company will reimburse Employee for all reasonable, pre-approved out-of-pocket costs and expenses (but not including\nattorneys’ fees) that Employee incurs in connection with obligations under this paragraph.\n15. Non-Disparagement & Non-Solicitation. For a period of at least 12 months following the Separation Date, the Parties agree that they\nwill not disparage, discredit or otherwise defame one another, including the Company or its officers, directors and employees, in any form, manner, or\nmedia, including but not limited to oral or written statements, social media, or any other form of electronic communication, or otherwise take any action\nwhich could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the personal or business reputation of the Parties. The Company shall instruct its officers and\ndirectors not to undertake any of the actions described in the preceding sentence in respect of Employee. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the\nParties from testifying truthfully in any valid judicial or government agency proceeding, making disclosures as required by applicable law and/or as\nprotected by Sections 7(d) and 13(a) of this Agreement. Additionally, Employee agrees that, through the expiration of the Term, Employee will not\nsolicit any employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for employment other than at the Company or any of its subsidiaries.\n16. Arbitration. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the parties agree to resolve any disputes that they may have with each other\nregarding the validity, interpretation, applicability, or effect of this Agreement or any alleged violations of it, through final, binding, and confidential\narbitration with JAMS, pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act and in accordance with JAMS employment law rules, available at\nhttps://www.jamsadr.com/rules-employment-arbitration/. The arbitration shall take place in San Francisco before a single experienced JAMS arbitrator\nlicensed to practice law in California and mutually selected by the parties. The arbitrator may not modify or change this Agreement in any way. Unless\notherwise required by law, all costs incidental to the arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrator, the costs of any record or transcript of the arbitration\nrequired to be purchased, and administrative and filing fees shall be paid in equal shares by Employee (one-half) and the Company (one-half) at such\ntime as they become due. Each party shall bear its own attorney’s fees and costs, unless otherwise required or allowed by law and awarded by the\narbitrator, as provided for below. Any arbitration may be initiated by a written demand to the other party identifying all claims forming the basis of the\ndemand in sufficient detail to inform the other party of the substance of the claims. In no event shall the demand for arbitration be made after the date\nwhen institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such claims would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The arbitrator shall\nresolve all claims regarding the timeliness or propriety of the demand for arbitration. The parties further agree that this Agreement is intended to be\nstrictly construed to provide for arbitration as the sole and exclusive means for resolution of all disputes hereunder to the fullest extent permitted by law.\nThe parties expressly waive any entitlement to have such controversies decided by a court or a jury and agree to bring any arbitration on an individual\nbasis only, and not on a class, collective, or representative basis. Any claims Employee may bring pursuant to the Private Attorneys General Act\n(“PAGA”) on behalf of the Labor and Workforce Development Agency must be arbitrated in Employee’s individual capacity such that there is no joinder\nor representation of any California Labor Code violations that were or could be asserted by or on behalf of any other employees. The party losing the\narbitration shall reimburse the prevailing party for all arbitration costs and expenses that the prevailing party paid pursuant to the provision of this\nparagraph, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees.\n8\n17. Older Workers’ Benefit Protection Act. This Agreement is intended to satisfy the requirements of the Older Workers’ Benefit\nProtection Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 626(f) (the “OWBPA”). Employee is advised to consult with an attorney before executing this agreement.\n(a) Acknowledgments/Time to Consider. Employee acknowledges and agrees that (i) Employee has read and understands the terms of this\nAgreement; (ii) by way of this Agreement, Employee has been advised in writing that Employee has a right to consult with an attorney of Employee’s\nchoosing before executing this Agreement; (iii) Employee has obtained and considered such legal counsel as Employee deems necessary or, by\nEmployee’s own choice, has elected not to consult legal counsel; (iv) Employee has been given twenty-one (21) days to consider whether or not to enter\ninto this Agreement (although Employee may elect not to use the full 21-day period at Employee’s option, and to sign and return this Agreement earlier,\nbut not before the Separation Date) at Employee’s option; and (v) by signing this Agreement, Employee acknowledges that Employee does so freely,\nknowingly, and voluntarily, without any coercion or undue influence from anyone.\n(b) Revocation/Effective Date. If Employee timely signs this Agreement, Employee may revoke Employee’s acceptance of this Agreement\nwithin seven (7) days after the date Employee signs it. Employee’s revocation must be in writing to the Company’s highest ranking legal officer and\nhighest ranking internal employment counsel, and received by Lyft on or before the seventh day after signing it in order to be effective. If Employee\ndoes not revoke acceptance within the seven (7) day period, Employee’s acceptance of this Agreement shall become binding and enforceable on the\neighth day after Employee signs the Agreement (“Effective Date”). If Employee fails to timely sign this Agreement or revokes this Agreement as\nprovided for above, the Agreement shall have no force or effect and Employee shall have no right to the arrangements, payments, or benefits referenced\nabove.\n(c) Preserved Rights of Employee. This Agreement does not waive or release any rights or claims that Employee may have under the Age\nDiscrimination Employment Act (“ADEA”) that arise after the execution of this Agreement. In addition, this Agreement does not prohibit Employee\nfrom challenging the validity of this Agreement’s waiver and release of claims under the ADEA.\n18. Use of Agreement. Employee and the Company agree that this Agreement may be used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding in\nwhich either of the Parties alleges a breach of this Agreement, notwithstanding the confidentiality provisions above; provided that if this Agreement is\nfiled in a proceeding, it shall be filed under seal consistent with applicable court rules and any testimony regarding this Agreement shall be designated as\nconfidential to the fullest extent permitted by law.\n19. Attorneys’ Fees. Employee and the Company agree that if any action is brought to enforce the terms, conditions and provisions of this\nAgreement (including but not limited to the mandatory arbitration provision), the prevailing party will be entitled to all reasonable costs and attorneys’\nfees incurred in enforcing any of the terms, conditions and provisions hereof, except with regard to a legal action challenging or seeking a determination\nin good faith of the validity of this Agreement’s waiver under the ADEA.\n20. Captions. The captions in this Agreement have been inserted for identification and reference purposes only and shall not be used in the\nconstruction or interpretation of this Agreement.\n21. Counterparts/By Facsimile or Electronic Copy. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts by facsimile copy or electronic\ncopy, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.\n9\n22. Severability. If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and/or\nenforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; provided that if the General Release above is held to be\ninvalid, illegal, or unenforceable, then Employee agrees that Employee shall be required to enter into a new agreement containing an enforceable release\nof all legally waivable claims against the Company and that the Severance Pay, and any other consideration provided herein, will constitute sufficient\nconsideration for such new agreement. If any terms or sections of this Agreement are determined to be unenforceable, they shall be modified so that the\nunenforceable term or section is enforceable to the greatest extent possible.\n23. Governing Law. This Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with California law, without reference to its conflict of law\nprinciples, except that the FAA governs the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration provision above.\n24. Entire Agreement; Amendment. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, this Agreement is the entire agreement between\nEmployee and the Company regarding Employee’s employment with and separation from the Company, and supersedes any prior oral or written\nagreements or understandings, except that at all times in the future, Employee will remain bound by the Confidentiality Agreement and Equity\nDocuments, in accordance with their terms. The Company and Employee acknowledge that they have entered into this Agreement without reliance on\nany representation, inducement, or promise that is not contained in this Agreement. Employee acknowledges that Employee has entered into this\nAgreement with the full intent of releasing all of Employee’s claims against the Company and the Released Parties (to the fullest extent permitted by\nlaw), and Employee is fully aware of the legal and binding effect of this Agreement, including the General Release set forth herein. Employee also\nunderstands and agrees that this is a “negotiated severance agreement” as that term is used under California law because it is voluntary, deliberate, and\ninformed, provides consideration of value to Employee, and Employee has been given notice and an opportunity to retain an attorney or is represented\nby an attorney. This Agreement may not be amended or modified, except with the written consent of the Parties. Employee agrees and acknowledges that\nthe Company is not providing any tax advice in connection with this Agreement and Employee is solely responsible for Employee’s tax consequences\nfrom this Agreement. The Company agrees and acknowledges that it has the obligations to collect and remit applicable payroll taxes from the payments\nunder this Agreement.\n[SIGNATURES APPEAR ON NEXT PAGE]\n10\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the dates listed below.\nPLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT AND GENERAL RELEASE CAREFULLY.

Introduction. The purpose of this Lyft, Inc. Executive Change in Control and Severance Plan is to provide\nassurances of specified benefits to certain employees of the Company whose employment is subject to being involuntarily\nterminated other than for death, Disability, or Cause or voluntarily terminated for Good Reason under the circumstances\ndescribed in the Plan (as defined below). This Plan is an “employee welfare benefit plan,” as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA.\nThis document constitutes both the written instrument under which the Plan is maintained and the required summary plan\ndescription for the Plan. The Plan was amended and restated effective as of August 20, 2024 (the “Effective Date”). This\namended and restated Plan completely replaces and supersedes the prior version of the Plan with the result that any\ntermination of employment by a Participant on or after the Effective Date will be governed by this Plan and not by the prior\nversion of the Plan.\n2. Important Terms. The following words and phrases, when the initial letter of the term is capitalized, will have the\nmeanings set forth in this Section 2, unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context:\n2.1. “Administrator” means the Company, acting through the Compensation Committee or another duly\nconstituted committee of members of the Board, or any person to whom the Administrator has delegated any authority or\nresponsibility with respect to the Plan pursuant to Section 11, but only to the extent of such delegation.\n2.2. “Board” means the Board of Directors of the Company.\n2.3. “Cause” means, with respect to a Participant:\n(a) any willful, material violation by the Participant of any law or regulation applicable to the business of\nthe Company;\n(b) the Participant’s conviction for, or plea of no contest to, a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude;\n(c) commission of an act of personal dishonesty that is intended to result in the substantial personal\nenrichment of the Participant (excluding inadvertent acts that are promptly cured following notice);\n(d) a continued material failure or failures by the Participant to perform the Participant’s lawful and\nreasonable duties of employment (including, but not\nlimited to, compliance with material written policies of the Company and material written agreements with the Company), which\nviolations are demonstrably willful and deliberate on the Participant’s part (but only after the Company has delivered a written\ndemand for performance to the Participant that describes the basis for the Company’s belief that the Participant has committed\nmaterial violations and the Participant has not cured within a period of 15 days following notice);\n(e) a Participant’s willful failure (other than due to physical incapacity) to reasonably cooperate with any\naudit or investigation by a governmental authority or the Company of the Company’s business or financial conditions or\npractices that continues after written notice from the Board and at least fifteen (15) days to cure;\n(f) any other willful misconduct or gross negligence by the Participant that is materially injurious to the\nfinancial condition or business reputation of the Company;\n(g) a material breach of any of the Participant’s fiduciary duties to the Company;\n(h) Participant’s failure to reasonably cooperate in any audit or investigation of the business or financial\npractices of the Company; or\n(i) Participant substantially abusing alcohol, drugs, or similar substances, or Participant engaging in\nother conduct or activities, provided that such abuse or engagement results or is reasonably likely to result in negative publicity\nor public disrespect, contempt or ridicule of the Company or Participant that the Company reasonably believes will have a\ndemonstrably injurious effect on the Company’s reputation or business or Participant’s ability to perform Participant’s duties,\nbut excluding conduct or activities undertaken in good faith by Participant in the ordinary course of Participant performing\nParticipant’s duties with the Company.\n2.4. “Change in Control” means the occurrence of any of the following events:\n(a) Change in Ownership of the Company. A change in the ownership of the Company that occurs on\nthe date that any one person, or more than one person acting as a group (“Person”) acquires ownership of the stock of the\nCompany that, together with the stock held by such Person, constitutes more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power\nof the stock of the Company; provided, however, that for purposes of this subsection, (i) the acquisition of additional stock by\nany one Person, who is considered to own more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power of the stock of the Company\nwill not be considered a Change in Control and (ii) any acquisition of additional stock by the Founders and/or their Permitted\nEntities (each as defined in the Company’s certificate of incorporation, as amended from time to time (the “COI”)) as a result of\na Permitted Transfer (as defined in the COI) or from the Company in a transaction or issuance (including pursuant to Equity\nAwards) approved by the\n2\nBoard or a committee thereof, that results in such parties owning more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power of the\nstock of the Company will not be considered a Change in Control. Further, if the stockholders of the Company immediately\nbefore such change in ownership continue to retain immediately after the change in ownership, in substantially the same\nproportions as their ownership of shares of the Company’s voting stock immediately prior to the change in ownership, direct or\nindirect beneficial ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the total voting power of the stock of the Company or of the\nultimate parent entity of the Company, such event shall not be considered a Change in Control under this subsection (a). For\nthis purpose, indirect beneficial ownership shall include, without limitation, an interest resulting from ownership of the voting\nsecurities of one or more corporations or other business entities which own the Company, as the case may be, either directly or\nthrough one or more subsidiary corporations or other business entities. For the avoidance of doubt, increases in the\npercentage of total voting power owned by the Founders and/or their Permitted Entities resulting solely from a decrease in the\nnumber of shares of stock of the Company outstanding shall not constitute an acquisition that creates a Change in Control\nunder this subsection (a); or\n(b) Change in Effective Control of the Company. If the Company has a class of securities registered\npursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, a change in the effective control of the Company which occurs on the date that a\nmajority of members of the Board is replaced during any twelve (12) month period with individuals whose appointment or\nelection to the Board is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Board prior to the date of the appointment or\nelection. For purposes of this subsection (b), if any Person is considered to be in effective control of the Company, the\nacquisition of additional control of the Company by the same Person will not be considered a Change in Control; or\n(c) Change in Ownership of a Substantial Portion of the Company’s Assets. A change in the ownership\nof a substantial portion of the Company’s assets which occurs on the date that any Person acquires (or has acquired during the\ntwelve (12) month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) assets from the\nCompany that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than fifty percent (50%) of the total gross fair market value\nof all of the assets of the Company immediately prior to such acquisition or acquisitions; provided, however, that for purposes\nof this subsection (c), the following will not constitute a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the Company’s\nassets: (i) a transfer to an entity that is controlled by the Company’s stockholders immediately after the transfer, or (ii) a\ntransfer of assets by the Company to: (A) a stockholder of the Company (immediately before the asset transfer) in exchange\nfor or with respect to the Company’s stock, (B) an entity, fifty percent (50%) or more of the total value or voting power of which\nis owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company, (C) a Person, that owns, directly or indirectly, fifty percent (50%) or more of the\ntotal value or voting power of all the outstanding stock of the Company, or (iv) an entity, at least fifty percent (50%) of the total\nvalue or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by a Person\n3\ndescribed in this subsection (c)(ii)(C). For purposes of this subsection (c), gross fair market value means the value of the\nassets of the Company, or the value of the assets being disposed of, determined without regard to any liabilities associated\nwith such assets.\nFor purposes of this Section 2.4, persons will be considered to be acting as a group if they are owners of a\ncorporation that enters into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar business transaction with the\nCompany.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed a Change in Control unless the transaction\nqualifies as a change in control event within the meaning of Section 409A.\nFurther and for the avoidance of doubt, a transaction will not constitute a Change in Control if: (i) its primary\npurpose is to change the jurisdiction of the Company’s incorporation, or (ii) its primary purpose is to create a holding company\nthat will be owned in substantially the same proportions by the persons who held the Company’s securities immediately before\nsuch transaction.\n2.5. “Change in Control Period” means the time period beginning on the date that is 3 months prior to a\nChange in Control and ending on the date that is 12 months following a Change in Control.\n2.6. “Code” means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\n2.7. “Company” means Lyft, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and any successor that assumes the obligations of\nthe Company under the Plan, by way of merger, acquisition, consolidation or other transaction.\n2.8. “Compensation Committee” means the Compensation Committee of the Board.\n2.9. “Director” means a member of the Board who is not an employee of the Company.

Upon an Involuntary Termination, then, subject to the Participant’s compliance with\nSection 6, the Participant will be eligible to receive the following Severance Benefits as described in Participant’s Participation\nAgreement,\n6\nsubject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and the Participant’s Participation Agreement:\n4.1. Cash Severance Benefits. Severance equal to the amount set forth in the Participant’s Participation\nAgreement and payable in cash in a lump sum in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Plan, including without\nlimitation Section 7 hereof.\n4.2. Continued Medical Benefits.

The\nCOBRA Severance will be paid in a lump sum payment equal to the monthly COBRA premium (on an after-tax basis) that the\nParticipant would be required to pay to continue the group health coverage in effect on the date of the Participant’s termination\nof employment (which amount will be based on the premium for the first month of COBRA coverage), multiplied by the number\nof months in the period of time set forth in the Participant’s Participation Agreement following the termination. Furthermore, for\nany Participant who, due to non-U.S. local law considerations, is covered by a health plan that is not subject to COBRA, the\nCompany may (in its discretion) instead provide cash or continued coverage in a manner intended to replicate the benefits of\nthis Section 4.2 and to comply with applicable local law considerations.\n4.3. Equity Award Vesting Acceleration Benefit. If and to the extent specifically provided in the Participant’s\nParticipation Agreement, all or a portion of Participant’s Equity Awards will vest and, to the extent applicable, become\nimmediately exercisable.\n5. Limitation on Payments. In the event that the severance and other benefits provided for in this Plan or\notherwise payable to a Participant (i) constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (“280G\nPayments”), and (ii) but for this Section 5, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the\n“Excise Tax”), then the 280G Payments will be either:\n(a) delivered in full, or\n(b) delivered as to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such benefits being subject to\nthe Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes\nand the excise tax imposed by Section 4999, results in the receipt by Participant on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount\nof benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of\n7\nsuch benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code. If a reduction in the 280G Payments is necessary so that no\nportion of such benefits are subject to the Excise Tax, reduction will occur in the following order: (i) cancellation of awards\ngranted “contingent on a change in ownership or control” (within the meaning of Code Section 280G); (ii) a pro rata reduction\nof (A) cash payments that are subject to Section 409A as deferred compensation and (B) cash payments not subject to Section\n409A of the Code; (iii) a pro rata reduction of (A) employee benefits that are subject to Section 409A as deferred compensation\nand (B) employee benefits not subject to Section 409A; and (iv) a pro rata cancellation of (A) accelerated vesting equity\nawards that are subject to Section 409A as deferred compensation and (B) equity awards not subject to Section 409A. In the\nevent that acceleration of vesting of equity awards is to be cancelled, such acceleration of vesting will be cancelled in the\nreverse order of the date of grant of a Participant’s equity awards.\nUnless Participant and the Company otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Section 5 will be made\nin writing by the Company’s independent public accountants immediately prior to the Change in Control or such other person or\nentity to which the parties mutually agree (the “Firm”), whose determination will be conclusive and binding upon Participant\nand the Company. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 5 the Firm may make reasonable\nassumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations\nconcerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. Participant and the Company will furnish to the Firm such\ninformation and documents as the Firm may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section 5. The\nCompany will bear all costs the Firm may incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 5.\n6. Conditions to Receipt of Severance.\n6.1. Release Agreement. As a condition to receiving the Severance Benefits, each Participant will be required\nto sign and not revoke a separation and release of claims agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the\n“Release”). In all cases, the Release must become effective and irrevocable no later than the 60th day following the\nParticipant’s Involuntary Termination (the “Release Deadline Date”). If the Release does not become effective and irrevocable\nby the Release Deadline Date, the Participant will forfeit any right to the Severance Benefits. In no event will the Severance\nBenefits be paid or provided until the Release becomes effective and irrevocable.\n6.2. Confidential Information. A Participant’s receipt of Severance Benefits will be subject to the Participant\ncontinuing to comply with the terms of any employee invention assignment and confidentiality agreement and such other\nappropriate agreement between the Participant and the Company.\n6.3. Non-Solicitation. As a condition to receiving Severance Benefits under this Plan; the Participant agrees\nthat the Participant will not solicit any employee\n8\nof the Company or any of its subsidiaries for employment other than at the Company or any of its subsidiaries for twelve (12)\nmonths following his or her termination.\n6.4. Non-Disparagement. As a condition to receiving Severance Benefits under this Plan during the\nParticipant’s employment with the Company and for twelve (12) months following his or her termination, the Participant will not\nknowingly and materially disparage, libel, slander, or otherwise make any materially derogatory statements regarding the\nCompany or any of its officers or directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in the Plan will be deemed to\nrestrict the Participant from providing information to any governmental, administrative, judicial, legislative, or regulatory agency\nor body (or in any way limit the content of any such information) to the extent the Participant is required to provide such\ninformation pursuant to a subpoena, or upon written request from an administrative agency or the legislature, or as otherwise\nrequired by applicable law or regulation, or in accordance with any governmental investigation or audit relating to the Company.\nSimilarly, nothing in this Plan is intended to limit a Participant’s rights as an employee to discuss the terms, wages, and working\nconditions of Participant’s employment, including any rights a Participant may have under Section 7 of the National Labor\nRelations Act, nor to deny a Participant the right to disclose information about unlawful acts in the workplace, such as\nharassment or discrimination or any other conduct that Participant has reason to believe is unlawful.\n6.5. Other Requirements. Severance Benefits under this Plan shall terminate immediately for a Participant if\nsuch Participant, at any time, violates any such agreement and/or the provisions of this Section 6.\n7. Timing of Severance Benefits. Provided that the Release becomes effective and irrevocable by the Release\nDeadline Date and subject to Section 9, the Severance Benefits will be paid, or in the case of installments, will commence, on\nthe first Company payroll date following the Release Deadline Date (such payment date, the “Severance Start Date”), and any\nSeverance Benefits otherwise payable to the Participant during the period immediately following the Participant’s termination of\nemployment with the Company through the Severance Start Date will be paid in a lump sum to the Participant on the\nSeverance Start Date, with any remaining payments to be made as provided in this Plan and the Participant’s Participation\nAgreement.\n8. Exclusive Benefit. Unless otherwise provided for by the Administrator in a Participant’s Participation Agreement,\nthe benefits, if any, provided under this Plan will be the exclusive benefits for a Participant related to his or her termination of\nemployment with the Company and/or a change in control of the Company and will supersede and replace any severance\nand/or change in control benefits set forth in any offer letter, employment or severance agreement and/or other agreement\nbetween the Participant and the Company, including any equity award agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, if a Participant\nwas otherwise eligible to participate in any other Company severance and/or change in control plan (whether or not subject to\nERISA),\n9\nthen participation in this Plan will supersede and replace eligibility in such other plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any\nprovision in a Participant’s existing offer letter, employment agreement, and/or equity award agreement with the Company that\nprovides for vesting of Participant’s restricted stock units upon a “Liquidity Event” (as defined in the letter and/or agreement) or\nsuch other similar term as set forth therein, or vesting of a Participant’s equity awards upon a failure by an acquirer to assume\nthe equity awards, will not be superseded by the Plan or the Participation Agreement, and will continue in full force and effect\npursuant to its existing terms.\n9. Section 409A.\n9.1. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, no Severance Benefits to be paid or provided to a\nParticipant, if any, under this Plan that, when considered together with any other severance payments or separation benefits,\nare considered deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, and the final regulations and any guidance\npromulgated thereunder (“Section 409A”) (together, the “Deferred Payments”) will be paid or provided until the Participant\nhas a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A. Similarly, no Severance Benefits payable to a Participant,\nif any, under this Plan that otherwise would be exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)\n(9) will be payable until the Participant has a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A.\n9.2. It is intended that none of the Severance Benefits will constitute Deferred Payments but rather will be\nexempt from Section 409A as a payment that would fall within the “short-term deferral period” as described in Section 9.3\nbelow or resulting from an involuntary separation from service as described in Section 9.4 below. In no event will a Participant\nhave discretion to determine the taxable year of payment of any Deferred Payment.\n9.3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, if a Participant is a “specified employee” within the\nmeaning of Section 409A at the time of the Participant’s separation from service (other than due to death), then the Deferred\nPayments, if any, that are payable within the first 6 months following the Participant’s separation from service, will become\npayable on the date 6 months and 1 day following the date of the Participant’s separation from service. All subsequent\nDeferred Payments, if any, will be payable in accordance with the payment schedule applicable to each payment or benefit.\nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event of the Participant’s death following the Participant’s separation\nfrom service, but before the 6 month anniversary of the separation from service, then any payments delayed in accordance\nwith this paragraph will be payable in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable after the date of the Participant’s\ndeath and all other Deferred Payments will be payable in accordance with the payment schedule applicable to each payment\nor benefit. Each payment and benefit payable under this Plan is intended to constitute a separate payment under Section\n1.409A-2(b)(2) of the Treasury Regulations.\n10\n9.4. Any amount paid under this Plan that satisfies the requirements of the “short-term deferral” rule set forth in\nSection 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Treasury Regulations will not constitute Deferred Payments for purposes of this Section 9.\n9.5. Any amount paid under this Plan that qualifies as a payment made as a result of an involuntary separation\nfrom service pursuant to Section 1.409A 1(b)(9)(iii) of the Treasury Regulations that does not exceed the Section 409A Limit\nwill not constitute Deferred Payments for purposes of this Section 9.\n9.6. The foregoing provisions are intended to comply with or be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A\nso that none of the Severance Benefits will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities\nherein will be interpreted to so comply or be exempt. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, including but not\nlimited to Sections 11 and 13, the Company reserves the right to amend the Plan as it deems necessary or advisable, in its\nsole discretion and without the consent of the Participants, to comply with Section 409A or to avoid income recognition under\nSection 409A prior to the actual payment of Severance Benefits or imposition of any additional tax. In no event will the\nCompany reimburse a Participant for any taxes or other costs that may be imposed on the Participant as result of\nSection 409A.\n10. Withholdings. The Company will withhold from any Severance Benefits all applicable U.S. federal, state, local\nand non-U.S. taxes required to be withheld and any other required payroll deductions.\n11. Administration. The Company is the administrator of the Plan (within the meaning of section 3(16)(A) of ERISA).\nThe Plan will be administered and interpreted by the Administrator (in his or her sole discretion). The Administrator is the\n“named fiduciary” of the Plan for purposes of ERISA and will be subject to the fiduciary standards of ERISA when acting in\nsuch capacity. Any decision made or other action taken by the Administrator with respect to the Plan, and any interpretation by\nthe Administrator of any term or condition of the Plan, or any related document, will be conclusive and binding on all persons\nand be given the maximum possible deference allowed by law. In accordance with Section 2.1, the Administrator (a) may, in its\nsole discretion and on such terms and conditions as it may provide, delegate in writing to one or more officers of the Company\nall or any portion of its authority or responsibility with respect to the Plan, and (b) has the authority to act for the Company (in a\nnon-fiduciary capacity) as to any matter pertaining to the Plan; provided, however, that any Plan amendment or termination or\nany other action that reasonably could be expected to increase materially the cost of the Plan must be approved by the Board.\n12. Eligibility to Participate. To the extent that the Administrator has delegated administrative authority or\nresponsibility to one or more officers of the Company in accordance with Sections 2.1 and 11, each such officer will not be\nexcluded from participating in the Plan if otherwise eligible, but he or she is not entitled to act upon or make determinations\nregarding any matters pertaining specifically to his or her\n11\nown benefit or eligibility under the Plan. The Administrator will act upon and make determinations regarding any matters\npertaining specifically to the benefit or eligibility of each such officer under the Plan.\n13. Amendment or Termination. The Company, by action of the Administrator, reserves the right to amend or\nterminate the Plan, any Participation Agreement issued pursuant to the Plan, or the benefits provided hereunder at any time,\nsubject to the provisions of this Section 13. Any amendment or termination of the Plan will be in writing. Any amendment to the\nPlan that (1) causes an individual or group of individuals to cease to be a Participant, or (2) reduces or alters to the detriment\nof the Participant the Severance Benefits potentially payable to the Participant (including, without limitation, imposing additional\nconditions or modifying the timing of payment) (an amendment described in clause (1) and/or clause (2) being an “adverse\namendment or termination”), will be effective only if it is approved by the Company and communicated to the affected\nindividual(s) in writing more than 18 months before the effective date of the adverse amendment or termination. Once a\nParticipant has incurred an Involuntary Termination, no amendment or termination of the Plan may, without that Participant’s\nwritten consent, reduce or alter to the detriment of the Participant, the Severance Benefits payable to the Participant. In\naddition and notwithstanding the preceding, beginning on the date that a Change in Control occurs, the Company may not,\nwithout a Participant’s written consent, amend or terminate the Plan in any way, nor take any other action under the Plan,\nwhich (i) prevents that Participant from becoming eligible for Severance Benefits, or (ii) reduces or alters to the detriment of the\nParticipant the Severance Benefits payable, or potentially payable, to the Participant (including, without limitation, imposing\nadditional conditions). The preceding sentence shall not apply to any amendment that otherwise both (x) would take effect\nbefore a Change in Control, and (y) meets the requirements of this Section 13 without regard to the preceding sentence. Any\naction of the Company in amending or terminating the Plan will be taken in a non-fiduciary capacity.\n14. Claims and Appeals.\n14.1. Claims Procedure. Any employee or other person who believes he or she is entitled to any Severance\nBenefits may submit a claim in writing to the Administrator within 90 days of the earlier of (i) the date the claimant learned the\namount of his or her Severance Benefits or (ii) the date the claimant learned that he or she will not be entitled to any\nSeverance Benefits. If the claim is denied (in full or in part), the claimant will be provided a written notice explaining the specific\nreasons for the denial and referring to the provisions of the Plan on which the denial is based. The notice also will describe any\nadditional information needed to support the claim and the Plan’s procedures for appealing the denial. The denial notice will be\nprovided within 90 days after the claim is received. If special circumstances require an extension of time (up to 90 days),\nwritten notice of the extension will be given within the initial 90 day period. This notice of extension will indicate the special\ncircumstances requiring the\n12\nextension of time and the date by which the Administrator expects to render its decision on the claim.\n14.2. Appeal Procedure. If the claimant’s claim is denied, the claimant (or his or her authorized representative)\nmay apply in writing to the Administrator for a review of the decision denying the claim. Review must be requested within 60\ndays following the date the claimant received the written notice of their claim denial or else the claimant loses the right to\nreview. The claimant (or representative) then has the right to review and obtain copies of all documents and other information\nrelevant to the claim, upon request and at no charge, and to submit issues and comments in writing. The Administrator will\nprovide written notice of its decision on review within 60 days after it receives a review request. If additional time (up to 60\ndays) is needed to review the request, the claimant (or representative) will be given written notice of the reason for the delay.\nThis notice of extension will indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the\nAdministrator expects to render its decision. If the claim is denied (in full or in part), the claimant will be provided a written\nnotice explaining the specific reasons for the denial and referring to the provisions of the Plan on which the denial is based.\nThe notice also will include a statement that the claimant will be provided, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access\nto, and copies of, all documents and other information relevant to the claim and a statement regarding the claimant’s right to\nbring an action under Section 502(a) of ERISA.\n15. Attorneys’ Fees. The parties shall each bear their own expenses, legal fees and other fees incurred in\nconnection with this Plan.\n16. Source of Payments. All payments under the Plan will be paid from the general funds of the Company; no\nseparate fund will be established under the Plan, and the Plan will have no assets. No right of any person to receive any\npayment under the Plan will be any greater than the right of any other general unsecured creditor of the Company.\n17. Inalienability. In no event may any current or former employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or\naffiliates sell, transfer, anticipate, assign or otherwise dispose of any right or interest under the Plan. At no time will any such\nright or interest be subject to the claims of creditors nor liable to attachment, execution or other legal process.\n18. No Enlargement of Employment Rights. Neither the establishment or maintenance or amendment of the Plan,\nnor the making of any benefit payment hereunder, will be construed to confer upon any individual any right to continue to be an\nemployee of the Company. The Plan in no way alters Participant’s at will employment arrangement with Company and\nCompany expressly reserves the right to discharge any of its employees, including Participant, at any time, with or without\ncause. However, as described in the Plan, a Participant may be entitled to Severance Benefits depending upon the\ncircumstances of his or her termination of employment.\n13\n19. Successors. Any successor to the Company of all or substantially all of the Company’s business and/or assets\n(whether direct or indirect and whether by purchase, merger, consolidation, liquidation or other transaction) will assume the\nobligations under the Plan and agree expressly to perform the obligations under the Plan in the same manner and to the same\nextent as the Company would be required to perform such obligations in the absence of a succession. For all purposes under\nthe Plan, the term “Company” will include any successor to the Company’s business and/or assets which become bound by the\nterms of the Plan by operation of law, or otherwise.\n20. Applicable Law. The provisions of the Plan will be construed, administered and enforced in accordance with\nERISA and, to the extent applicable, the internal substantive laws of the state of California (but not its conflict of laws\nprovisions).\n21. Severability. If any provision of the Plan is held invalid or unenforceable, its invalidity or unenforceability will not\naffect any other provision of the Plan, and the Plan will be construed and enforced as if such provision had not been included.\n22. Headings. Headings in this Plan document are for purposes of reference only and will not limit or otherwise affect\nthe meaning hereof.\n23. Indemnification. The Company hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the officers and employees of the\nCompany, and the members of its Board, from all losses, claims, costs or other liabilities arising from their acts or omissions in\nconnection with the administration, amendment or termination of the Plan, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.\nThis indemnity will cover all such liabilities, including judgments, settlements and costs of defense. The Company will provide\nthis indemnity from its own funds to the extent that insurance does not cover such liabilities. This indemnity is in addition to and\nnot in lieu of any other indemnity provided to such person by the Company.\n24. Additional Information.\nPlan Name: Lyft, Inc.

Statement of ERISA Rights.\nAs a Participant under the Plan, you have certain rights and protections under ERISA:\n(a) You may examine (without charge) all Plan documents, including any amendments and copies of all\ndocuments filed with the U.S. Department of Labor. These documents are available for your review upon written request to the\nAdministrator.\n(b) You may obtain copies of all Plan documents and other Plan information upon written request to the\nAdministrator. A reasonable charge may be made for such copies.\nIn addition to creating rights for Participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the\noperation of the Plan. The people who operate the Plan (called “fiduciaries”) have a duty to do so prudently and in the interests\nof you and the other Participants. No one, including the Company or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate\nagainst you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a benefit under the Plan or exercising your rights under ERISA. If your\nclaim for a severance benefit is denied, in whole or in part, you must receive a written explanation of the reason for the denial.\nYou have the right to have the denial of your claim reviewed. (The claim review procedure is explained in Section 14 above.)\nUnder ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For example, if you request materials and do\nnot receive them within 30 days, you may file\n15\nsuit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Administrator to provide the materials and to pay you up to\n$110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent due to reasons beyond the control of the\nAdministrator. If you have a claim which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a federal court. If it should\nhappen that you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of\nLabor, or you may file suit in a federal court.\nIn any case, the court will decide who will pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful, the court may order the\nperson you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for\nexample, if it finds that your claim is frivolous.\nIf you have any questions regarding the Plan, please contact the Administrator. If you have any questions about this\nstatement or about your rights under ERISA, you may contact the nearest area office of the Employee Benefits Security\nAdministration (formerly the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration), U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone\ndirectory, or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of\nLabor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20210. You also may obtain certain publications about your rights and\nresponsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hotline of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.\no 0 o\n16\nAppendix A\nLyft, Inc.

Millions of DashPass members in the U.S. now have another reason to choose Lyft every time. \n  * **Further driver earnings improvements** : drivers can count on their earnings being increased any time a ride takes 5 minutes longer than estimated, or for dropping off a rider that takes them out of their way without a ride back. Drivers also now see the estimated dollar per hour rate upfront for each ride. \n\n\n\n**Fourth Quarter 2024 Outlook**\n\n  * Gross Bookings of approximately $4.28 billion to $4.35 billion, up 15% to 17% year-over-year \n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $100 million to $105 million and an Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) of approximately 2.3% to 2.4%. \n\n\n\n**Updated FY’24 Outlook**\n\n  * Rides growth in the mid-teens year-over-year. \n  * Gross Bookings to grow approximately 17% year-over-year. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) of approximately 2.3%, up from the prior outlook of 2.1%. \n  * Free cash flow to exceed $650 million. \n\n\n\nWe have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalent to our non-GAAP outlook or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of reconciling items such as stock-based compensation and income tax. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalent is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that the reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this release.

Lyft defines Active Riders as all riders who take at least one ride during a quarter where the Lyft Platform processes the transaction. An Active Rider is identified by a unique phone number. If a rider has two mobile phone numbers or changed their phone number and that rider took rides using both phone numbers during the quarter, that person would count as two Active Riders. If a rider has a personal and business profile tied to the same mobile phone number, that person would be considered a single Active Rider. If a ride has been requested by an organization using our Concierge offering for the benefit of a rider, we exclude this rider in the calculation of Active Riders, unless the ride is accessible in that rider’s Lyft App. \n\n**_Rides_ **\n\nRides represent the level of usage of our multimodal platform. Lyft defines Rides as the total number of rides including rideshare and bike and scooter rides completed using our multimodal platform that contribute to our revenue. These include any Rides taken through our Lyft App. If multiple riders take a private rideshare ride, including situations where one party picks up another party on the way to a destination, or splits the bill, we count this as a single rideshare ride. Each unique segment of a Shared Ride is considered a single Ride. For example, if two riders successfully match in Shared Ride mode and both complete their Rides, we count this as two Rides. We have largely shifted away from Shared Rides, and now only offer Shared Rides in limited markets. Lyft includes all Rides taken by riders via our Concierge offering, even though such riders may be excluded from the definition of Active Riders unless the ride is accessible in that rider’s Lyft App. \n\n**_Gross Bookings_ **\n\nGross Bookings is a key indicator of the scale and impact of our overall platform. Lyft defines Gross Bookings as the total dollar value of transactions invoiced to rideshare riders including any applicable taxes, tolls and fees excluding tips to drivers. It also includes amounts invoiced for other offerings, including but not limited to: Express Drive vehicle rentals, bike and scooter rentals, and amounts recognized for subscriptions, bike and bike station hardware and software sales, media, sponsorships, partnerships, and licensing and data access agreements. \n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings)_ **\n\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by Gross Bookings for the same period. For the definition of Adjusted EBITDA, refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”. \n\n**Webcast**\n\nLyft will host a webcast today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) to discuss these financial results and business highlights. To listen to a live audio webcast, please visit our Investor Relations page at [https://investor.lyft.com/](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.lyft.com%2F&esheet=54147753&newsitemid=20241106680853&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.lyft.com%2F&index=1&md5=e1e1deed90865343d257e34cc678b100). The archived webcast will be available on our Investor Relations page shortly after the call. \n\n**About Lyft**\n\nWhether it’s an everyday commute or a journey that changes everything, Lyft is driven by our purpose: to serve and connect. In 2012, Lyft was founded as one of the first ridesharing communities in the United States. Now, millions of drivers have chosen to earn on billions of rides. Lyft offers rideshare, bikes, and scooters all in one app — for a more connected world, with transportation for everyone. \n\n**Available Information**\n\nLyft announces material information to the public about Lyft, its products and services and other matters through a variety of means, including filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts, the investor relations section of its website (investor.lyft.com), its X accounts (@lyft and @davidrisher), its Chief Executive Officer’s LinkedIn account (linkedin.com/in/jdavidrisher) and its blogs (including: lyft.com/blog, lyft.com/hub, and eng.lyft.com) in order to achieve broad, non-exclusionary distribution of information to the public and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. \n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or Lyft’s future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “going to,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern Lyft's expectations, strategy, priorities, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this release include, but are not limited to, Lyft’s guidance and outlook, including for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024, and the trends and assumptions underlying such guidance and outlook, and Lyft’s plans and expectations, including statements about autonomous partnerships and our strategic partnership with DoorDash and the benefits such partnerships will provide. Lyft’s expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, including risks related to the macroeconomic environment and risks regarding our ability to forecast our performance due to our limited operating history and the macroeconomic environment and the risk that our partnerships may not materialize as expected. The forward-looking statements contained in this release are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in Lyft’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 that was filed with the SEC on August 7, 2024 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that will be filed with the SEC by November 12, 2024. The forward-looking statements in this release are based on information available to Lyft as of the date hereof, and Lyft disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. This press release discusses “customers.” For rideshare, there are two customers in every car - the driver is Lyft’s customer, and the rider is the driver’s customer. We care about both. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement Lyft’s financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP, Lyft considers certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) and free cash flow. Lyft defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for interest expense, other income (expense), net, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation and sublease income, as well as, if applicable, restructuring charges, costs related to acquisitions and divestitures and costs from transactions related to certain legacy auto insurance liabilities. Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by Gross Bookings for the same period and is considered a key metric. Lyft defines Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as net income (loss) adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense (net of any benefit), and payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation, as well as, if applicable, restructuring charges and transaction costs related to certain legacy auto insurance liabilities and cost related to acquisitions and divestitures. Lyft defines free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and scooter fleet. \n\nLyft subleases certain office space and earns sublease income. Sublease income is included within other income, net on the condensed consolidated statement of operations, while the related lease expense is included within operating expenses and loss from operations. Lyft believes the adjustment to include sublease income in Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors by enabling them to better assess Lyft’s operating performance, including the benefits of recent transactions, by presenting sublease income as a contra-expense to the related lease charges that are part of operating expenses. \n\nIn November 2022, April 2023 and September 2024, Lyft committed to plans of termination as part of efforts to reduce operating expenses. Lyft believes the costs associated with these restructuring efforts do not reflect performance of Lyft’s ongoing operations. Lyft believes the adjustment to exclude the costs related to restructuring from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is useful to investors by enabling them to better assess Lyft’s ongoing operating performance and provide for better comparability with Lyft’s historically disclosed Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) amounts. \n\nLyft uses its non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. Free cash flow is a measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides our management with information about our ability to generate or use cash to enhance the strength of our balance sheet, further invest in our business and pursue potential strategic initiatives. Free cash flow has certain limitations, including that it does not reflect our future contractual commitments and it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period. Free cash flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. \n\nLyft’s definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Furthermore, these measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. \n\n**Lyft, Inc.**  \n---

(Nasdaq: LYFT), one of North America's largest transportation networks, announced plans for multiple autonomous vehicle (AV) partnerships to connect the Lyft community with future AV rides in the Lyft app. \n\nToday, Lyft is announcing its next step in delivering AVs to millions of people. **Lyft** and **Mobileye** , a leader in self-driving tech and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) plan to bring AVs to the Lyft network. Through this partnership, Lyft will make its scaled rideshare platform available to all vehicles with Mobileye’s self-driving technology. Vehicles equipped with Mobileye Drive technology will hit the road “Lyft-ready” — giving small and large fleet operators seamless access to Lyft’s platform and network of riders to optimize their vehicles. \n\nBeyond pioneering a new distribution channel for AVs through its alliance with Mobileye, Lyft is solving for other key parts of the AV value chain with **May Mobility** and **Nexar** . \n\n  * **May Mobility** will directly deploy AVs to the Lyft platform in Atlanta starting in 2025. Atlanta riders will have the opportunity to be matched with a fleet of autonomous Toyota Sienna minivans equipped with May Mobility’s autonomous technology, a deployment that Lyft and May Mobility aim to scale over time across multiple markets. \n  * **Nexar** and Lyft will explore ways to harness the power of aggregated, anonymized marketplace and fleet data to help OEMs and AV companies build better and safer autonomous technology. By pairing Lyft data with Nexar’s hundreds of millions of hours of video footage, we can jointly contribute to a more complete data set for autonomous research and development. \n\n\n\n“We’re thrilled to work with Mobileye, May Mobility, and Nexar to build the autonomous future together, with more partnerships to follow,” said David Risher, CEO of Lyft. “Lyft’s aim is to connect AVs, drivers, riders, and partners to create new opportunities for all. Our rideshare network will continue to evolve as millions of people will have the opportunity to earn billions of dollars whether they choose to drive, put their AVs into service, or both.” \n\n“Cooperating with leading mobility providers and operators is an essential step to bring autonomous mobility services to reality,” said Prof. Amnon Shashua, President and CEO of Mobileye. “Enabling Mobileye Drive with Lyft’s network of 40 million annual riders in North America would allow our AV customers to reach new markets and geographies with autonomous services and provide the benefits of the technology through a sustainable business.” \n\nLyft’s rideshare network offers an easy and fast way for AVs to scale, and for partners to monetize their technology. The platform gives AV partners access to 40 million riders annually, and provides robust fleet management capabilities that streamline on-boarding, off-boarding, and vehicle servicing. The revolutionary “Lyft-ready” model is a turnkey solution, empowering partners to seamlessly deploy AVs to Lyft’s marketplace, effectively commercialize these deployments, and maximize their vehicle utilization. \n\nLyft will continue to partner with additional industry leaders to shape the future of mobility.

In 2012, Lyft was founded as one of the first ridesharing communities in the United States. Now, millions of drivers have chosen to earn on billions of rides. Lyft offers rideshare, bikes, and scooters all in one app — for a more connected world, with transportation for everyone. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\n_Certain statements contained in this press release are “forward-looking statements” about Lyft within the meaning of the securities laws, including statements about Lyft’s autonomous vehicle strategy and partnerships and related plans, expectations, technologies, benefits for drivers and riders, and an AV pilot program launch. Such statements, which are not of historical fact, involve estimates, assumptions, judgments and uncertainties.

(“LYFT” OR THE\n“COMPANY”) CURRENTLY AND AS OF JULY 23, 2024 (“APPLICABLE LYFT\n2\nSHAREHOLDERS”):\n3\nTHIS NOTICE RELATES TO THE PENDENCY AND PROPOSED\nSETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION. PLEASE\n4\nREAD THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. IF YOU ARE A\n5 LYFT SHAREHOLDER, THIS NOTICE CONTAINS IMPORTANT\nINFORMATION ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS.\n6\nTHIS ACTION IS NOT A “CLASS ACTION.” THUS, THERE IS NO COMMON\n7\nFUND UPON WHICH YOU CAN MAKE A CLAIM FOR A MONETARY\nPAYMENT.\n8\n9 YOU ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED, pursuant to an Order of the U.S. District Court for\n10 the Northern District of California (the “Court”), that a proposed settlement has been reached by\n11 the parties to the following shareholder derivative actions brought on behalf and for the benefit\n12 of Lyft: (i) In re Lyft Inc. Derivative Litigation, Case No. 4:20-cv-09257 (N.D. Cal.) (formerly\n13 captioned Chenoy v. Zimmer, Case No. 4:20-cv-09257 (N.D. Cal.)); (ii) Mehta v. Green, Case\n14 No. 4:20-cv-09364 (N.D. Cal.); (iii) Hong Kok v. Green, Case No. 3:20-cv-09272 (N.D. Cal.);\n15 and (iv) Shuman v. Green, Case No. 4:21-cv-01263 (N.D. Cal.) (collectively, the “Federal\n16 Derivative Actions”).1\n17 As explained below, a hearing will be held on Thursday, February 6, 2025 at 2:00 p.m.\n18 PST, before the Honorable Haywood S. Gilliam, Jr., at the U.S. District Court for the Northern\n19 District of California, Oakland Courthouse, Courtroom 2, 4th Floor, 1301 Clay Street, Oakland,\n20 California 94612 (the “Settlement Hearing”), at which the Court will determine whether to\n21 approve the Settlement. You have an opportunity to be heard at this hearing.\n22 The Court may, in its discretion, change the date and/or time of the Settlement Hearing\n23 without further notice to you. The Court also has reserved the right to hold the Settlement\n24 Hearing telephonically or by videoconference without further notice to you. If you intend to\n25\n26 1 All capitalized terms herein have the same meanings as set forth Settling Parties’\nStipulation of Settlement dated July 23, 2024 (the “Stipulation”), which is available for\n27 viewing on the website of Lyft at https://investor.lyft.com.\n28\n1 attend the Settlement Hearing, please consult the Court’s calendar or Lyft’s website,\n2 https://investor.lyft.com, for any change in the date, time, or format of the Settlement Hearing.\n3 The terms of the settlement are set forth in the Stipulation and summarized in this Notice.\n4 If approved by the Court, the Settlement will fully resolve the Federal Derivative Actions,\n5 including the dismissal of the Federal Derivative Actions with prejudice. For a more detailed\n6 statement of the matters involved in the Federal Derivative Actions, the Settlement, and the\n7 terms discussed in this Notice, the Stipulation may be inspected at the Clerk of Court’s office,\n8 U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, 450 Golden Gate Avenue San\n9 Francisco, CA 94102. The Stipulation is also available for viewing on the website of Lyft at\n10 https://investor.lyft.com. For a fee, all papers filed in the Federal Derivative Actions are\n11 available at www.pacer.gov.\n12 This Notice is not intended to be an expression of any opinion by the Court with respect\n13 to the merits of the claims made in the Federal Derivative Actions, but is merely to advise you of\n14 the pendency and proposed settlement of the Federal Derivative Actions.\n15 THERE IS NO CLAIMS PROCEDURE. This case was brought to protect the\n16 interests of Lyft. The Settlement results in changes to the Company’s corporate governance, not\n17 in payment to individuals, and accordingly, there will be no claims procedure.\n18 I. THE FEDERAL DERIVATIVE ACTIONS\n19 The Federal Derivative Actions are brought by Plaintiffs solely on behalf of and for the\n20 benefit of Lyft and against the Individual Defendants. Lyft maintains a peer-to-peer marketplace\n21 for on-demand ridesharing, representing one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in\n22 the United States and Canada. The derivative claims arise from allegedly false and misleading\n23 statements made in connection with Lyft’s March 28, 2019 initial public offering.\n24 II. PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS AND THE BENEFITS OF SETTLEMENT\n25 Plaintiffs believe that the Federal Derivative Actions have substantial merit, and\n26 Plaintiffs’ entry into the Stipulation and Settlement is not intended to be and shall not be\n27 construed as an admission or concession concerning the relative strength or merit of the claims\n28 alleged in the Federal Derivative Actions. However, Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ Counsel recognize\nNOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF\nATTORNEYS AT LAW 2 SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION\nCASE NO. 4:20-cv-09257-HSG\n1 and acknowledge the significant risk, expense, and length of continued proceedings necessary to\n2 prosecute the Federal Derivative Actions against the Individual Defendants through trial and\n3 through possible appeals. Plaintiffs’ Counsel also have taken into account the uncertain outcome\n4 and the risk of any litigation, especially in complex cases such as the Federal Derivative Actions,\n5 as well as the difficulties and delays inherent in such litigation. Plaintiffs’ Counsel are also\n6 mindful of the inherent problems of establishing standing in derivative litigation, and the\n7 possible defenses to the claims alleged in the Federal Derivative Actions.\n8 Plaintiffs’ Counsel have conducted extensive investigation and analysis, including, inter\n9 alia: (i) reviewing Lyft’s press releases, public statements, U.S. Securities and Exchange\n10 Commission (“SEC”) filings, and securities analysts’ reports and advisories about the Company\n11 and its financial condition; (ii) reviewing related media reports about the Company;\n12 (iii) researching applicable law with respect to the claims alleged in the Federal Derivative\n13 Actions and potential defenses thereto; (iv) preparing and filing derivative complaints;\n14 (v) conducting damages analyses; (vi) reviewing and analyzing relevant documents in the\n15 Federal Securities Action and in the State Securities Action; (vii) researching corporate\n16 governance best practices; (viii) researching and preparing correspondence related to the\n17 settlement demands; and (viii) negotiating this Settlement with Defendants. Based on Plaintiffs’\n18 Counsel’s thorough review and analysis of the relevant facts, allegations, defenses, and\n19 controlling legal principles, Plaintiffs’ Counsel believe that the Settlement set forth in the\n20 Stipulation is fair, reasonable, and adequate, and confers substantial benefits upon Lyft. Based\n21 upon Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s evaluation, Plaintiffs have determined that the Settlement is in the best\n22 interests of Lyft and have agreed to settle the Federal Derivative Actions upon the terms and\n23 subject to the conditions set forth herein.\n24 III. DEFENDANTS’ DENIALS OF WRONGDOING AND LIABILITY\n25 Defendants have denied and continue to deny each and all of the claims and contentions\n26 alleged by Plaintiffs in the Federal Derivative Actions. The Individual Defendants have\n27 expressly denied and continue to deny all charges of wrongdoing or liability against them arising\n28 out of any of the conduct, statements, acts, or omissions alleged, or that could have been alleged\nNOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF\nATTORNEYS AT LAW 3 SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION\nCASE NO. 4:20-cv-09257-HSG\n1 in the Federal Derivative Actions.\n2 Nonetheless, Lyft and the Individual Defendants have concluded that further litigation of\n3 the Federal Derivative Actions would be protracted and expensive, and that it is desirable for the\n4 Federal Derivative Actions to be fully and finally settled in the matter and upon the terms and\n5 conditions set forth in the Stipulation. Defendants have also taken into account the uncertainty\n6 and risks inherent in any litigation, especially in complex cases like the Federal Derivative\n7 Actions. Defendants have, therefore, determined that it is desirable and beneficial that the\n8 Federal Derivative Actions be settled in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth\n9 in the Stipulation.\n10 Neither the Stipulation, nor any of its terms or provisions, nor entry of the Judgment, nor\n11 any document or exhibit referred or attached to the Stipulation, nor any action taken to carry out\n12 the Stipulation, is, may be construed as, or may be used as evidence of the validity of any of the\n13 Released Claims or an admission by or against the Individual Defendants of any fault,\n14 wrongdoing, or concession of liability whatsoever.\n15 IV. BOARD APPROVAL\n16 The terms of the Stipulation of Settlement, including exhibits thereto, shall be presented\n17 to the Lyft Board of Directors for their review and approval at the next regularly scheduled\n18 Board meeting, currently set for August 20, 2024.\n19 V. TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT\n20 The terms and conditions of the proposed Settlement are set forth in the Stipulation,\n21 which has been filed with the Court and is available for viewing on Lyft’s website at\n22 https://investor.lyft.com. The following is only a summary of its terms.\n23 As consideration for the Settlement, Lyft has made significant company-wide reforms,\n24 and commits to substantively maintaining or expanding upon the following corporate governance\n25 reforms set forth in Exhibit A to the Stipulation (“Reforms”). The Reforms shall be maintained\n26 by Lyft for a period of not less than three (3) years. Lyft and the Individual Defendants\n27 acknowledge that the prosecution and settlement of the Federal Derivative Actions was a\n28 substantial and material factor in the Company’s decision to adopt, implement, and/or maintain\nNOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF\nATTORNEYS AT LAW 4 SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION\nCASE NO. 4:20-cv-09257-HSG\n1 the Reforms, and agree that the Reforms are significant and extensive and confer substantial\n2 benefits upon Lyft and its shareholders.\n3 The Reforms are specifically designed to improve the functioning of Lyft and convey to\n4 investors that they can invest in the Company with confidence. The Reforms provide, among\n5 other things, that Lyft will, for a period of not less than three (3) years:\n6 • make a link to its Compliance and Ethics Hotline publicly available on Lyft’s Investor\n7 Relations webpage;\n8 • amendments to its Clawback Policy, effected on October 2, 2023, including robust provisions\n9 for providing recoupment in the event of material negative restatements;\n10 • enhance the membership of the Company’s Culture of Ethics and Compliance Committee to\n11 include the Company’s Vice President, Safety and Customer Care (or future equivalent\n12 leader of user safety) as a standing member of the committee;\n13 • make efforts to share safety features and products with riders and drivers in order to enhance\n14 their efficacy, including by, over the next twelve months, making at least one additional post\n15 on its blog (https://www.lyft.com/blog) highlighting key in-app safety features available to\n16 riders and drivers;\n17 • amendments to its code of business conduct and ethics, effected on October 26, 2021,\n18 including further guidance to employees about the seriousness of the provisions stated\n19 therein;\n20 • amendments to the Compensation Committee Charter, effected on July 25, 2023, including\n21 enhanced duties of the Compensation Committee as they relate to changes in compensation,\n22 the Company’s Clawback Policy, and hiring strategies, including diversity and inclusion\n23 efforts;\n24 • amendments to the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, effected on October 26,\n25 2023, including specifying limitations on executive director board membership, director\n26 training, and leadership development.\n27 This Notice provides a summary of some, but not all, of the Reforms Lyft has agreed to\n28 adopt or adopted as consideration for the Settlement. For a list of all of the Reforms, please see\nNOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF\nATTORNEYS AT LAW 5 SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION\nCASE NO. 4:20-cv-09257-HSG\n1 Exhibit A to the Stipulation, which is available for viewing from the Court or on Lyft’s website\n2 at https://investor.lyft.com.\n3 VI. DISMISSAL AND RELEASES\n4 The Settlement is conditioned upon the occurrence of certain events, which include,\n5 among other things: (i) approval of the Settlement by Lyft’s Board of Directors; (ii) the Court’s\n6 issuance of an order preliminarily approving the terms and conditions of the Settlement;\n7 (iii) Court approval of the method of providing notice to the Applicable Lyft Shareholders;\n8 (iv) final approval of the Settlement by the Court following notice to Applicable Lyft\n9 Shareholders and the Settlement Hearing contemplated by the Stipulation; (v) Court entry of the\n10 Judgment, approving the Settlement and dismissing with prejudice the Consolidated Derivative\n11 Action, without awarding costs to any Party, except as provided in the Stipulation; and\n12 (vi) payment of the Fee and Expense Amount; (vii) the passing of the date upon which the\n13 Judgment becomes Final; and (viii) Court issuance of an order dismissing the Federal Derivative\n14 Actions with prejudice (the “Effective Date”).\n15 Upon the Effective Date, the Releasing Persons shall be deemed to have fully, finally,\n16 and forever released, relinquished, and discharged the Released Claims (including Unknown\n17 Claims) against the Released Persons and any and all derivative claims arising out of, relating to,\n18 or in connection with the defense, settlement, or resolution of the Federal Derivative Actions\n19 against the Released Persons. Nothing herein shall in any way impair or restrict the rights of any\n20 Settling Party to enforce the terms of the Stipulation.\n21 Except as set forth in paragraph 5.3, of the Stipulation, upon the Effective Date, Lyft and\n22 each of the Individual Defendants and their Related Persons shall be deemed to have fully,\n23 finally, and forever released, relinquished, and discharged Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ Counsel and\n24 their Related Persons from all claims (including claims related to Unknown Claims), arising out\n25 of, relating to, or in connection with the institution, prosecution, assertion, settlement, or\n26 resolution of the Federal Derivative Actions or the Released Claims. Nothing herein shall in any\n27 way impair or restrict the rights of any Settling Party to enforce the terms of the Stipulation.\n28\nNOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF\nATTORNEYS AT LAW 6 SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION\nCASE NO. 4:20-cv-09257-HSG\n1 VII. PLAINTIFFS’ ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND EXPENSES\n2 After negotiating the substantive terms of the settlement, the Settling Parties discussed a\n3 fair and reasonable sum to be paid to Plaintiffs’ Counsel for their attorneys’ fees and expenses.\n4 In recognition of the substantial benefits conferred upon Lyft as a direct result of the prosecution\n5 and Settlement of the Federal Derivative Actions, and subject to Court approval, the Individual\n6 Defendants shall cause their insurers to pay Plaintiffs’ Counsel the agreed-to amount of $700,000\n7 (the “Fee and Expense Amount”). To date, Plaintiffs’ Counsel have neither received any\n8 payment for their services in conducting the Actions, nor have counsel been reimbursed for their\n9 out-of-pocket expenses incurred. The Settling Parties believe that the sum agreed to is within the\n10 range of attorneys’ fees and expenses approved by courts under similar circumstances in\n11 litigation of this type. Lyft’s shareholders are not personally liable for the payment of any award\n12 of attorneys’ fees and expenses.\n13 Plaintiffs’ Counsel may apply to the Court for service awards of up to $1,500 for each of\n14 the Plaintiffs, only to be paid upon Court approval, and to be paid from the Fee and Expense\n15 Amount in recognition of Plaintiffs’ participation and effort in the prosecution of the Actions.\n16 Neither Lyft nor any of the Individual Defendants shall be liable for any portion of any service\n17 awards.\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\nNOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF\nATTORNEYS AT LAW 7 SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION\nCASE NO. 4:20-cv-09257-HSG\n1 VIII. THE SETTLEMENT HEARING\n2 The Settlement Hearing will be held before the Honorable Haywood S. Gilliam, Jr. at the\n3 U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Oakland Courthouse, Courtroom 2,\n4 4th Floor, 1301 Clay Street, Oakland, California 94612 (the “Settlement Hearing”), at which the\n5 Court will determine: (i) whether the terms of the Stipulation should be approved as fair,\n6 reasonable, and adequate; (ii) whether the Notice fully satisfied the requirements of Rule 23.1 of\n7 the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the requirements of due process; (iii) whether all\n8 Released Claims against the Released Persons should be fully and finally released; (iv) whether\n9 the agreed-to Fee and Expense Amount should be approved; and (v) such other matters as the\n10 Court may deem appropriate. The Settlement Hearing may be continued by the Court at the\n11 Settlement Hearing, or at any adjourned session thereof, or it may be held telephonically or by\n12 videoconference, without further notice.

(“Lyft” or the “Company”); (ii) Logan Green, John Zimmer, Brian Roberts, Prashant (Sean)\n6 Aggarwal, Jonathan Christodoro, Ben Horowitz, Valerie Jarrett, David Lawee, Hiroshi Mikitani,\n7 Ann Miura-Ko, and Mary Agnes (Maggie) Wilderotter; and (iii) Lyft. This Stipulation is\n8 intended by the Settling Parties to fully, finally, and forever resolve, discharge, and settle the\n9 Released Claims, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.\n10 I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n11 Lyft maintains a peer-to-peer marketplace for on-demand ridesharing, representing one of\n12 the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United States and Canada. The derivative\n13 claims arise from allegedly false and misleading statements made in connection with Lyft’s\n14 March 28, 2019 initial public offering.\n15 A. Proceedings in the Related Federal Securities Class Action\n16 On May 17, 2019, Lyft investors filed a securities class action, entitled In re Lyft, Inc.\n17 Securities Litigation, Lead Case No. 4:19-cv-02690-HSG, in which plaintiffs asserted federal\n18 securities claims against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors\n19 before the Honorable Haywood S. Gilliam, Jr. (the “Federal Securities Action”). On\n20 September 8, 2020, the Court granted in part and denied in part defendants’ motions to dismiss\n21 the Federal Securities Action. On August 20, 2021, the Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class\n22 certification. On February 8, 2022, the parties to the Federal Securities Action informed the\n23 court by letter that they had reached an agreement-in-principle to settle the Federal Securities\n24 Action on a class-wide basis. On December 16, 2022, the Court granted the parties’ motion for\n25 preliminary approval of class action settlement. On August 7, 2023, the Court granted final\n26 approval to the class action settlement. On September 11, 2023, judgment was entered and the\n27 Federal Securities Action was terminated.\n28\n1 All capitalized terms not otherwise defined are defined in section V.1.\nSTIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT\n1 CASE NO. 4:20-cv-09257-HSG\nCase 4:20-cv-09257-HSG Document 60-2 Filed 07/23/24 Page 4 of 57\n1 B. The State Securities Class Action\n2 On April 15, 2019, Frederic Lande filed the first complaint in any jurisdiction that alleged\n3 securities violations arising out of the Lyft IPO in the Superior Court of the State of California,\n4 County of San Francisco. Following this complaint, six additional lawsuits were filed in San\n5 Francisco Superior Court on the same subject matter, and were ultimately consolidated with the\n6 Lande action (together, the “State Securities Action”). On January 25, 2022, the state court\n7 denied Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and stayed the State Securities Action based on\n8 the pendency of the parallel Federal Securities Action. In late 2022, during the settlement\n9 approval process for the Federal Securities Action, the plaintiffs in the State Securities Action\n10 moved to intervene and opt back into the federal class for the purpose of objecting to the\n11 settlement. The Court considered and rejected the State Securities Action plaintiffs’ objections.\n12 After settlement of the Federal Securities Action was finally approved, the plaintiffs in the State\n13 Securities Action voluntarily dismissed their claims. The State Securities Action was dismissed\n14 on October 31, 2023.\n15 C. Proceedings in the Federal Derivative Actions\n16 On September 30, 2020, Plaintiff Vishal Mehta filed a shareholder derivative action on\n17 behalf of nominal defendant Lyft in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware\n18 alleging breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement,\n19 waste of corporate assets, and for contribution under Section 11(f) of the Securities Act of 1933\n20 (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange\n21 Act”) against defendants Logan Green, John Zimmer, Brian Roberts, Prashant (Sean) Aggarwal,\n22 Ben Horowitz, Valerie Jarrett, David Lawee, Hiroshi Mikitani, Ann Miura-Ko, Mary Agnes\n23 (Maggie) Wilderotter, and Jonathan Christodoro captioned Mehta v. Green, Case No. 1:20-cv-\n24 01326. On December 28, 2020, the Mehta Action was transferred to the Northern District of\n25 California, Case No. 4:20-cv-09364 (the “Mehta Action”).\n26 On December 21, 2020, Plaintiff Ron Chenoy filed a shareholder derivative action on\n27 behalf of nominal defendant Lyft in this Court alleging breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust\n28 enrichment, waste of corporate assets, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and for\nSTIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT\n2 CASE NO. 4:20-cv-09257-HSG\nCase 4:20-cv-09257-HSG Document 60-2 Filed 07/23/24 Page 5 of 57\n1 contribution under Section 11(f) of the Securities Act and Section 21D of the Exchange Act\n2 against defendants John Zimmer, Logan Green, Brian Roberts, Prashant (Sean) Aggarwal, David\n3 Lawee, Hiroshi Mikitani, Ann Miura-Ko, Mary Agnes (Maggie) Wilderotter, Jonathan\n4 Christodoro, Ben Horowitz, and Valerie Jarrett, captioned Chenoy v. Zimmer, Case No. 4:20-cv-\n5 09257 (the “Chenoy Action”).\n6 On December 21, 2020, Plaintiff Yao Hong Kok filed a shareholder derivative action on\n7 behalf of nominal defendant Lyft in this Court alleging breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust\n8 enrichment and for contribution under Section 11(f) of the Securities Act and Section 21D of the\n9 Exchange Act against defendants Logan Green, John Zimmer, Brian Roberts, Prashant (Sean)\n10 Aggarwal, Ben Horowitz, Valerie Jarrett, David Lawee, Hiroshi Mikitani, Ann Miura-Ko, and\n11 Mary Agnes (Maggie) Wilderotter, and nominal defendant Lyft, captioned Hong Kok v. Green,\n12 Case No. 3:20-cv-09272 (the “Hong Kok Action”).\n13 On January 4, 2021, the Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley consolidated the Mehta\n14 Action, the Hong Kok Action, and the Chenoy Action (ECF No. 9) into the above-captioned In\n15 re Lyft Inc. Derivative Litigation case (the “Consolidated Derivative Action”) and appointed The\n16 Brown Law Firm, P.C. and Levi & Korsinsky, LLP as Co-Lead Counsel for Plaintiffs in the\n17 Consolidated Derivative Action. On February 17, 2021, at the parties’ joint request, the Court\n18 stayed the case.\n19 On February 22, 2021, Plaintiff Brad Shuman filed a shareholder derivative action on\n20 behalf of nominal defendant Lyft in this Court alleging breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust\n21 enrichment, and seeking contribution under Section 11(f) of the Securities Act and Section 21D\n22 of the Exchange Act against Defendants Logan Green, John Zimmer, Brian Roberts, Prashant\n23 Aggarwal, Ann Miura-Ko, Valerie Jarrett, David Lawee, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, Hiroshi\n24 Mikitani, Ben Horowitz, and nominal defendant Lyft, captioned Shuman v. Green, Case No.\n25 4:21-cv-01263 (the “Shuman Action”). On March 10, 2021, the Shuman Action was\n26 consolidated for all purposes, including pre-trial proceedings and trial, with the Consolidated\n27 Derivative Action.\n28\nSTIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT\n3 CASE NO. 4:20-cv-09257-HSG\nCase 4:20-cv-09257-HSG Document 60-2 Filed 07/23/24 Page 6 of 57\n1 On January 19, 2024, the court lifted the stay of the Consolidated Derivative Action. On\n2 March 26, 2024, Plaintiffs Vishal Mehta, Yao Hong Kok, Ron Chenoy, and Brad Shuman\n3 designated the Verified Shareholder Derivative Complaint filed in the Hong Kok Action on\n4 December 21, 2020, as the operative complaint in the Consolidated Derivative Action.\n5 II. PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS AND THE BENEFITS OF SETTLEMENT\n6 Plaintiffs believe that the Federal Derivative Actions have substantial merit, and\n7 Plaintiffs’ entry into this Stipulation and Settlement is not intended to be and shall not be\n8 construed as an admission or concession concerning the relative strength or merit of the claims\n9 alleged in the Federal Derivative Actions. However, Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ Counsel recognize\n10 and acknowledge the significant risk, expense, and length of continued proceedings necessary to\n11 prosecute the Federal Derivative Actions against the Individual Defendants through trial and\n12 through possible appeals. Plaintiffs’ Counsel also have taken into account the uncertain outcome\n13 and the risk of any litigation, especially in complex cases such as the Federal Derivative Actions,\n14 as well as the difficulties and delays inherent in such litigation. Plaintiffs’ Counsel are also\n15 mindful of the inherent problems of establishing standing in derivative litigation, and the\n16 possible defenses to the claims alleged in the Federal Derivative Actions.\n17 Plaintiffs’ Counsel have conducted extensive investigation and analysis, including, inter\n18 alia: (i) reviewing Lyft’s press releases, public statements, U.S. Securities and Exchange\n19 Commission (“SEC”) filings, and securities analysts’ reports and advisories about the Company\n20 and its financial condition; (ii) reviewing related media reports about the Company;\n21 (iii) researching applicable law with respect to the claims alleged in the Federal Derivative\n22 Actions and potential defenses thereto; (iv) preparing and filing derivative complaints;\n23 (v) conducting damages analyses; (vi) reviewing and analyzing relevant documents in the\n24 Federal Securities Action and in the State Securities Action; (vii) researching corporate\n25 governance best practices; (viii) researching and preparing correspondence related to the\n26 settlement demands; and (viii) negotiating this Settlement with Defendants. Based on Plaintiffs’\n27 Counsel’s thorough review and analysis of the relevant facts, allegations, defenses, and\n28 controlling legal principles, Plaintiffs’ Counsel believe that the Settlement set forth in this\nSTIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT\n4 CASE NO. 4:20-cv-09257-HSG\nCase 4:20-cv-09257-HSG Document 60-2 Filed 07/23/24 Page 7 of 57\n1 Stipulation is fair, reasonable, and adequate, and confers substantial benefits upon Lyft. Based\n2 upon Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s evaluation, Plaintiffs have determined that the Settlement is in the best\n3 interests of Lyft and have agreed to settle the Federal Derivative Actions upon the terms and\n4 subject to the conditions set forth herein.\n5 III. DEFENDANTS’ DENIALS OF WRONGDOING AND LIABILITY\n6 Defendants have denied and continue to deny each and all of the claims and contentions\n7 alleged by Plaintiffs in the Federal Derivative Actions. The Individual Defendants have\n8 expressly denied and continue to deny all charges of wrongdoing or liability against them arising\n9 out of any of the conduct, statements, acts, or omissions alleged, or that could have been alleged\n10 in the Federal Derivative Actions.\n11 Nonetheless, Lyft and the Individual Defendants have concluded that further litigation of\n12 the Federal Derivative Actions would be protracted and expensive, and that it is desirable for the\n13 Federal Derivative Actions to be fully and finally settled in the matter and upon the terms and\n14 conditions set forth in this Stipulation. Defendants have also taken into account the uncertainty\n15 and risks inherent in any litigation, especially in complex cases like the Federal Derivative\n16 Actions. Defendants have, therefore, determined that it is desirable and beneficial that the\n17 Federal Derivative Actions be settled in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth\n18 in this Stipulation.\n19 Neither this Stipulation, nor any of its terms or provisions, nor entry of the Judgment, nor\n20 any document or exhibit referred or attached to this Stipulation, nor any action taken to carry out\n21 this Stipulation, is, may be construed as, or may be used as evidence of the validity of any of the\n22 Released Claims or an admission by or against the Individual Defendants of any fault,\n23 wrongdoing, or concession of liability whatsoever.\n24 IV. BOARD APPROVAL\n25 The terms of this Stipulation of Settlement, including exhibits hereto, shall be presented\n26 to the Lyft Board of Directors for their review and approval at the next regularly scheduled\n27 Board meeting, currently set for August 20, 2024.\n28\nSTIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT\n5 CASE NO. 4:20-cv-09257-HSG\nCase 4:20-cv-09257-HSG Document 60-2 Filed 07/23/24 Page 8 of 57\n1 V.

Plaintiffs’ Counsel, as a condition of receiving any part of the Fee and\n11 Expense Amount, on behalf of themselves and each partner and/or shareholder of them, agrees\n12 that Plaintiffs’ Counsel and their partners and/or shareholders are subject to the jurisdiction of\n13 the Court for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this paragraph.\n14 4.4.

In such event, the terms and provisions of this\n16 Stipulation shall have no further force and effect with respect to the Settling Parties and shall not\n17 be used in the Federal Derivative Actions or in any other proceeding for any purpose.\n18 7.

No. 60\n11\n12\na\nt r i n\nu or o 13 Pending before the Court is Plaintiffs’ unopposed motion for preliminary approval of the\nCf\ni\ntl\na\ncC 14 settlement reached in their consolidated shareholder derivative action. See Dkt. No. 60 (“Mot.”).\ni\nr t s f o\ni\nD t c 15 The Court held a hearing on the motion on August 29, 2024. For the reasons detailed below, the\nsi\nr\net\nt a ts i D 16 Court GRANTS the motion.\nS\nd\nn\nr\ne te h 17 I. BACKGROUND\ni nt\nr\nUo\nN 18 A. Factual Allegations\n19 This is a shareholder derivative action on behalf of nominal defendant Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”)\n20 against several Lyft officers and directors (collectively “Individual Defendants”).1 Plaintiffs\n21 allege that the Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duty by failing, among other things,\n22 to: “(1) prevent or remediate the rampant sexual and physical assault committed by Lyft drivers\n23 against Lyft passengers; (2) provide an adequate reporting mechanism, oversight of personnel,\n24 training, or disciplinary avenues to prevent or at least remedy the known problem of sexual and\n25 physical assault; or (3) implement an adequate background check system to effectively screen Lyft\n26\n27\n1 The “Individual Defendants” include Logan Green, John Zimmer, Brian Roberts, Prashant\n(Sean) Aggarwal, Jonathan Christodoro, Ben Horowitz, Valerie Jarrett, David Lawee, Hiroshi\n28\nMikitani, Ann Miura-Ko, and Mary Agnes (Maggie) Wilderotter.\nCase 4:20-cv-09257-HSG Document 62 Filed 10/16/24 Page 2 of 13\n1 drivers, particularly drivers with known histories of committing past acts of sexual misconduct\n2 and/or harassment.” Mot. at 9–10; Verified Shareholder Derivative Complaint (“Compl.”) ¶ 19.2\n3 Plaintiffs further allege that these Individual Defendants made “a series of false and misleading\n4 statements in connection with Lyft’s March 28, 2019 initial public offering (“IPO”).” Mot. at 10;\n5 Compl. ¶¶ 1, 16.3 According to Plaintiffs, the alleged false and/or misleading statements failed to\n6 disclose that: “(1) passengers had reported to Lyft being verbally and physically assaulted,\n7 sexually harassed, and raped by Lyft drivers even prior to the IPO; (2) it was likely that Lyft\n8 would sustain damage to its reputation and also be subject to legal liability as a consequence of\n9 numerous and still increasing sexual assaults perpetrated by the Company’s drivers; (3) numerous\n10 riders of the Company’s electronic bikes were caused to sustain injuries such as scrapes, bruising,\n11 broken bones, and damaged limbs as a result of a defect in the braking system of Lyft’s electronic\n12 bikes; (4) riders injured by the defective braking system had complained to the Company before\na\nt r i n\nu or o 13 Lyft went public on March 28, 2019; (5) Lyft’s transformation into a multimodal transportation\nCf\ni\ntl\na\ncC 14 network was being disrupted by safety issues with their bikes; and (6) Lyft failed to maintain\ni\nr t s f o\ni\nD t c 15 internal controls.” Compl. at ¶ 16.\nsi\nr\net\nt a ts i D 16 Based on this alleged misconduct, Plaintiffs assert claims on behalf of Lyft against the\nS\nd\nn\nr\nee 17 Individual Defendants for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of\nth\ni nt\nr\nUo\nN 18 control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, and for contribution under Section 11(f)\n19 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Mot. at 7.\n20 B. Procedural Background\n21 This consolidated action combines four federal shareholder derivative actions filed against\n22 the Individual Defendants on behalf of nominal defendant Lyft between September 2020 and\n23 February 2021. In January 2021, then-Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley consolidated\n24 three of these actions: Mehta v. Green, Case No. 1:20-cv-01326 (D. Del.) (later Case No. 4:20-cv-\n25\n2 For ease of reference, the Court refers to the PDF pages rather than the document’s internal\n26\npagination unless otherwise noted.\n3 Plaintiffs designated the Verified Shareholder Derivative Complaint filed by Yao Hong Kok in\n27\nHong Kok v. Green, et al., Case No. 3:20-cv-09272 on December 21, 2020, as the operative\nComplaint in the above-captioned consolidated action. See Dkt. No. 50 (designation notice); see\n28\nalso Case No. 20-9272, Dkt. No. 1 (“Compl.”).\n2\nCase 4:20-cv-09257-HSG Document 62 Filed 10/16/24 Page 3 of 13\n1 09364 (N.D. Cal.)), Chenoy v. Zimmer, Case No. 4:20-cv-09257 (N.D. Cal.), and Hong Kok v.\n2 Green, Case No. 3:20-cv-09272 (N.D. Cal.). Mot. at 11; Dkt. No. 9. In February 2021, Plaintiff\n3 Brad Shuman filed a similar shareholder derivative action, Shuman v. Green, Case No. 4:21-cv-\n4 01263 (N.D. Cal.), which the Court also consolidated into the above-captioned action. Dkt. No.\n5 37.\n6 In February 2021, the Court granted the parties’ request to stay this consolidated case in\n7 light of In re Lyft, Inc. Securities Litigation, No. 4:19-cv-02690 (“Federal Securities Action”), a\n8 factually-related securities class action then pending before the Court. See Dkt. No. 34. The\n9 parties in that case reached a class-wide settlement, which the Court approved in August 2023, and\n10 the Federal Securities Action was dismissed in October 2023. Mot. at 13.4 Following the Court’s\n11 approval of the parties’ class action settlement in the Federal Securities Action, the parties in this\n12 case began settlement negotiations. Id. The parties informed the Court that they reached a\na\nt r i n\nu or o 13 tentative settlement on May 28, 2024. Dkt. No. 51.\nCf\ni\ntl\na\nc iC 14 C. Settlement Agreement\nr t s f o\ni\nD t c 15 The key terms of the Stipulation of Settlement, Dkt. No. 60-2 (“Settlement Agreement” or\nsi\nr\net\nt a ts i D 16 “SA”), are as follows:\nS\nd\nn\nr\nee 17 Settlement Benefits: Lyft will keep the corporate governance reforms set forth in Exhibit\nth\ni nt\nr\nUo\nN 18 A of the Settlement Agreement in place for at least three years. See Dkt. No. 60-2, Ex. A. These\n19 reforms include, among other things, Lyft’s amended Clawback Policy, changes to Lyft’s Code of\n20 Business Conduct and Ethics, amendments to Lyft’s Compensation Committee Charter, and\n21 changes to Lyft’s Corporate Governance Guidelines. Id. Lyft will also post a link to its\n22 Compliance and Ethics Hotline on the Lyft website within 90 days of the settlement’s final\n23 approval. Id. Consistent with Exhibit A of the Settlement Agreement, Lyft will undertake efforts\n24 to improve safety compliance and awareness by (1) adding a user safety executive to Lyft’s\n25 Culture of Ethics and Compliance Committee, and (2) promoting safety features like the “Alert\n26 911 Safety Feature” and “Safety Phone Calls.” Id. Within 12 months of the settlement’s final\n27\n4 Following the Federal Securities Action’s dismissal, the Court lifted the temporary stay in this\n28\nlitigation. Dkt. No. 43.\n3\nCase 4:20-cv-09257-HSG Document 62 Filed 10/16/24 Page 4 of 13\n1 approval, Lyft will also make at least one further post on its blog (https://www.lyft.com/blog)\n2 about in-app safety features available to riders and drivers. Id.\n3 Releases: Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the “Releasing Persons shall be\n4 deemed to have fully, finally, and forever released, relinquished, and discharged the Released\n5 Claims (including Unknown Claims) against the Released Persons and any and all derivative\n6 claims arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the defense, settlement, or resolution of the\n7 Federal Derivative Actions against the Released Persons.” SA § 5.1.\n8\nThe Releasing Persons are “Plaintiffs (individually, collectively, and derivatively on behalf\nof Lyft), all other Applicable Lyft Shareholders, Plaintiffs’ Counsel, and Lyft.” Id. § 1.23.\n9\n10 The Released Persons are “Lyft, the Individual Defendants, and their Related Persons.” Id.\n§ 1.22.\n11\nReleased Claims means “[A]ny and all actions, suits, claims, debts, rights, liabilities, and\n12\na causes of action, whether under federal, state, local, statutory, common law, foreign law, or\nt r i n\nu or o 13 any other law, rule or regulation, including both known and Unknown Claims (as defined\nCf i in paragraph 1.26 below), that: (a) were asserted or could have been asserted by any\ntl\na\ncC 14 shareholder derivatively on behalf of Lyft, or by Lyft, against any Released Person; and (b)\ni\nr t s f o concern, arise out of, or relate to (i) the allegations asserted in the Federal Derivative\ni\nD t c 15 Actions or the matters and occurrences that were alleged in the Federal Derivative Actions,\nsi\nr\ne t a t S dt s i D\nn\nr\n16 o a cn lr\na\ny( ii mi c) l\ns\nat h i am le\nl\nesS\ng\nte eot dt l e e in nm f o te hrn c et e ,\nF\nd t ehe def\ne\ne S rn aes lte t\nS\nlo e emr\nc\nur ee rns itto i. l eEu st xi Ao cl cn u\nt\nido oef\nn\ndt h afe nr o dF m e thd t ee h r Sea tl t\na\neD tr eme Sr i ‘ ev R ca ueti rlv e ite a\nie\nsA e\ns\ndc\nA\nt Ci co tln ia os im n, .e ”sx ’ c Iae drp e\n.\nt\n§\naf lo 1l r\n.2 1.\nee 17\nth\ni nt\nr\nUo\nN 18 Notice: Lyft will provide notice of the proposed settlement, see Dkt.

PRELIMINARY SETTLEMENT APPROVAL\n12\na\nt r i n A. Legal Standard\nu or o 13\nCf i Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.1, “[a] derivative action may be settled,\ntl\na\ncC 14\ni\nr t s f o voluntarily dismissed, or compromised only with the court’s approval.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.1(c).\ni\nD t c 15\nsi r “Rule 23 requires courts to employ a two-step process in evaluating a class action or derivative\net\nt a ts i D 16\nS\nd\nn\nr\naction settlement.” In re Wells Fargo & Co. Sharehold Derivative Litig., No. 16-CV-05541-JST,\nee 17\nt i nh t\nr\n2019 WL 13020734, at *4 (N.D. Cal. May 14, 2019). First, the court “must make a preliminary\nUo\nN 18\ndetermination that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate” under Rule 23(e)(2). Id.\n19\n(internal citation and quotations omitted). Only if a settlement is “fundamentally fair, adequate,\n20\nand reasonable” may it be approved. In re Hewlett-Packard Co. S’holder Derivative Litig., No.\n21\n3:12-CV-06003-CRB, 2015 WL 1153864, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 13, 2015) (internal citation and\n22\nquotations omitted). “[I]f the court preliminarily approves a derivative action settlement, notice\n23\n‘must be given to shareholders or members in the manner that the court orders.’” In re Wells\n24\nFargo & Co. Sharehold Derivative Litig., 2019 WL 13020734, at *4 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P.\n25\n23.1(c)). The court then holds a hearing to “make a final determination whether the settlement is\n26\n‘fair, reasonable, and adequate.’” Id. (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)).\n27\nIn the context of a derivative action, courts evaluate fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy\n28\n5\nCase 4:20-cv-09257-HSG Document 62 Filed 10/16/24 Page 6 of 13\n1 by considering a range of factors, such as “the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; the risk, expense,\n2 complexity, and likely duration of further litigation; . . . the amount offered in settlement; the\n3 extent of discovery completed and the stage of the proceedings; [and] the experience and views of\n4 counsel . . . . ” Id. (internal citation and quotations omitted). Courts also consider “the extent of\n5 the benefit to be derived from the proposed settlement by the corporation, the real party in\n6 interest.” In re Pinterest Derivative Litig., No. C 20-08331-WHA, 2022 WL 484961, *3 (N.D.\n7 Cal. Feb. 16, 2022) (internal citation and quotations omitted). And courts ensure that the proposed\n8 settlement is not “the product of fraud or overreaching by, or collusion between, the negotiating\n9 parties,” In re Hewlett-Packard, 2015 WL 1153864, at *3 (internal citation and quotation\n10 omitted). See also Lloyd v. Gupta, No. 15-CV-04183-MEJ, 2016 WL 3951652, at *4 (N.D. Cal.\n11 July 22, 2016) (internal citation and quotations omitted) (noting that courts consider whether “the\n12 settlement is the result of arm’s-length negotiations in which plaintiffs’ counsel has effectively\na\nt r i n\nu or o 13 represented the interest of the shareholder class, and whether the substantive terms of the\nCf\ni\ntl\na\ncC 14 settlement are in the interests of [the company] and its shareholders relative to the likely rewards\ni\nr t s f o\ni\nD t c 15 of litigation.”).\nsi\nr\net\nt a ts i D 16 At the preliminary approval stage, the Court need not definitively decide whether the\nS\nd\nn\nr\nee 17 proposed settlement survives scrutiny under these standards: instead, it need only determine\nth\ni nt\nr\nUo\nN 18 whether the settlement falls “within the range of possible approval.” In re Tableware Antitrust\n19 Litig., 484 F. Supp. 2d 1078, 1080 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (internal citation and quotations omitted); see\n20 In re Wells Fargo & Co. Sharehold Derivative Litig., 2019 WL 13020734, at *4.\n21 B. Analysis\n22 i. Benefits to the Corporation\n23 “The principal factor to be considered in determining the fairness of a settlement\n24 concluding a shareholders’ derivative action is the extent of the benefit to be derived from the\n25 proposed settlement by the corporation, the real party in interest.” In re Apple Computer, Inc.\n26 Derivative Litig., No. C 06-4128 JF (HRL), 2008 WL 4820784, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 5, 2008)\n27 (internal citation and quotation omitted). This is a non-monetary settlement that requires Lyft to\n28 adopt several corporate governance reforms and keep them in place for a three-year period. See\n6\nCase 4:20-cv-09257-HSG Document 62 Filed 10/16/24 Page 7 of 13\n1 Dkt. No. 60-2, Ex. A. While “[c]ourts have recognized that corporate governance reforms . . .\n2 provide valuable benefits to public companies,” the Court is skeptical that the reforms presented\n3 here are a benefit of the settlement rather than Lyft’s own independent actions. In re NVIDIA\n4 Corp. Derivative Litig., No. C-06-06110-SBA-(JCS), 2008 WL 5382544, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Dec.\n5 22, 2008) (internal citation and quotations omitted). See In re Pinterest Derivative Litig., No. C\n6 20-08331-WHA, 2022 WL 2079712, at *3 (N.D. Cal. June 9, 2022) (expressing concern regarding\n7 the value of corporate reforms when a “fair number of the reforms were already in place as a result\n8 of the corporation’s own actions addressing the problem”). Lyft has already implemented most of\n9 the specified reforms such that they are not “benefit[s] . . . derived from the proposed settlement.”\n10 In re Apple Computer, Inc. Derivative Litig., 2008 WL 4820784, at *2.\n11 The settlement does, however, fix these reforms in place for a three-year period, assuring\n12 Lyft drivers, riders, and shareholders that these reforms are not immediately revocable.\na\nt r i n\nu or o 13 Presumably, this three-year commitment should enhance consumer, investor, and employee trust\nCf\ni\ntl\na\ncC 14 in Lyft’s safety and corporate governance. And because “potential buyers of [Lyft] stock likely\ni\nr t s f o\ni\nD t c 15 will view [the] reforms as an additional reason to purchase the stock,” this three-year period\nsi\nr\net\nt a ts i D 16 should confer financial benefits to Lyft. Id.; see In re Pinterest Derivative Litig., No. C 20-08331-\nS\nd\nn\nr\nee 17 WHA, 2022 WL 2079712, at *1 (N.D. Cal. June 9, 2022) (“The reaction of shareholders also\nth\ni nt\nr\nUo\nN 18 factors into assessing the fairness of a settlement.”).\n19 Moreover, “without a settlement, Plaintiffs face[] the prospect of additional or collateral\n20 litigation . . . further prolonging any resolution beneficial to [Lyft].” In re Wells Fargo & Co.\n21 Sharehold Derivative Litig., 2019 WL 13020734, at *6. See In re Apple Computer, Inc, 2008 WL\n22 4820784, at *3 (internal citation and quotations omitted) (“[T]he risk, expense, complexity, and\n23 likely duration of further litigation are additional factors that should be considered in determining\n24 the fairness of a proposed settlement.”). The parties acknowledge that Plaintiffs’ claims would\n25 likely face substantial obstacles at the pleading and summary judgment stages, see Mot. at 21–22,\n26 and courts have generally “recognized that it is often difficult for plaintiffs to prevail in derivative\n27 actions.” In re Wells Fargo & Co. Sharehold Derivative Litig., 2019 WL 13020734, at *6. The\n28 Settlement Agreement bypasses the expenses and likely duration of further litigation, provides a\n7\nCase 4:20-cv-09257-HSG Document 62 Filed 10/16/24 Page 8 of 13\n1 resolution beneficial to Lyft, and ensures that Plaintiffs do not end up with zero benefit. The\n2 amount of time this case has been pending—the operative complaint was filed almost four years\n3 ago—heightens these considerations.\n4 Accordingly, at the preliminary approval stage, the Court is persuaded that the benefits of\n5 the Settlement Agreement—principally the three-year commitment period—weigh in favor of\n6 granting preliminary approval.\n7 ii. Evidence of Conflicts and Signs of Collusion\n8 To determine whether the settlement is “within the range of possible approval,” the Court\n9 must “ensure that the agreement is not the product of fraud or overreaching by, or collusion\n10 between, the negotiating parties.” In re NVIDIA Corp. Derivative Litig., 2008 WL 5382544, at *2\n11 (internal citation and quotations omitted). See In re Pac. Enterprises Sec. Litig., 47 F.3d 373, 378\n12 (9th Cir. 1995). The Ninth Circuit has directed district courts to look for “subtle signs of\na\nt r i n\nu or o 13 collusion,” including whether the parties negotiated a “‘clear sailing’ arrangement (i.e., an\nCf\ni\ntl\na\ncC 14 arrangement where defendant will not object to a certain fee request by class counsel).” Roes, 1-2\ni\nr t s f o\ni\nD t c 15 v. SFBSC Mgmt., LLC, 944 F.3d 1035, 1049 (9th Cir. 2019). “Although clear sailing provisions\nsi\nr\net\nt a ts i D 16 are not prohibited, they by [their] nature deprive[] the court of the advantages of the adversary\nS\nd\nn\nr\nee 17 process in resolving fee determinations and are therefore disfavored.” Id. at 1050.\nth\ni nt\nr\nUo\nN 18 Although the Settlement Agreement does not contain an express clear sailing provision, the\n19 parties propose an “agreed-to” $700,000 award for attorneys’ fees and expenses. SA § 4.1. In\n20 light of this ambiguous phrasing, the Court errs on the side of treating this provision as a version\n21 of a clear sailing agreement. See Erguera v. CMG CIT Acquisition, LLC, No. 1:20-CV-1744 JLT\n22 CDB, 2023 WL 4108071, at *11 (E.D. Cal. June 21, 2023). The Court “has a heightened duty to\n23 peer into the [clear sailing] provision and scrutinize closely the relationship between attorneys’\n24 fees and benefit to the class, being careful to avoid awarding ‘unreasonably high’ fees simply\n25 because they are uncontested.” In re Bluetooth Headset Prod. Liab. Litig., 654 F.3d 935, 948 (9th\n26 Cir. 2011). The Court has some skepticism that a $700,000 award is appropriate here and is\n27 cognizant of its obligation to review fee awards with particular rigor. See Roes, 944 F.3d at 1051\n28 (“[T]he district court [must] closely . . . examine the claimed value of the non-cash portions of the\n8\nCase 4:20-cv-09257-HSG Document 62 Filed 10/16/24 Page 9 of 13\n1 settlement that were used to justify the requested attorneys’ fees.”). At the final approval stage,\n2 the Court will carefully scrutinize the circumstances and determine what attorneys’ fee award is\n3 appropriate in this case. See id. at 1056.\n4 At this preliminary stage, the Settlement Agreement’s clear sailing provision does not\n5 create an inference of collusion or conflict that warrants invalidating the settlement as a whole.\n6 The Settlement Agreement does not contain a reversionary “kicker” arrangement, and any\n7 approved service awards are drawn from the awarded attorneys’ fees. SA § 4. See In re Bluetooth\n8 Headset Prod. Liab. Litig., 654 F.3d at 949 (“[A] kicker arrangement reverting unpaid attorneys’\n9 fees to the defendant rather than to the class amplifies the danger of collusion already suggested by\n10 a clear sailing provision.”); In re Toys R Us-Delaware, Inc.--Fair & Accurate Credit Transactions\n11 Act (FACTA) Litig., 295 F.R.D. 438, 458 (C.D. Cal. 2014) (“As the Ninth Circuit has noted . . . the\n12 inference of collusion drawn from a clear sailing provision is reduced when the agreement lacks a\na\nt r i n\nu or o 13 reversionary or ‘kicker provision.’”). Moreover, the parties assert that the Settlement Agreement\nCf\ni\ntl\na\ncC 14 is “the product of arm’s length negotiations” and “significant give and take” between “zealous and\ni\nr t s f o\ni\nD t c 15 able counsel with extensive experience in complex derivative litigation.” Mot. at 19–20. The\nsi\nr\net\nt a ts i D 16 Settlement Agreement also describes Plaintiffs’ counsel’s “extensive investigation and analysis”\nS\nd\nn\nr\nee 17 of the alleged misconduct. SA § II. The involvement of counsel with significant experience in\nth\ni nt\nr\nUo\nN 18 derivative litigation, who appear “on behalf of all parties,” weighs in favor of a non-collusive\n19 settlement. In re NVIDIA Corp. Derivative Litig., 2008 WL 5382544, at *3; see Lloyd, 2016 WL\n20 3951652, at *5; In re Pinterest Derivative Litig., No. C 20-08331-WHA, 2022 WL 484961, at *7\n21 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 16, 2022) (finding that representation by “various experienced counsel” may\n22 support a settlement).\n23 At this stage, the Court does not find any procedural inadequacies in the negotiating\n24 process or substantive inadequacies in the Settlement Agreement’s provisions that bar preliminary\n25 approval.\n26 iii. Scope of Release\n27 “The scope of releases factor[s] into the fairness of a settlement.” In re Pinterest\n28 Derivative Litig., No. C 20-08331-WHA, 2022 WL 484961, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 16, 2022).\n9\nCase 4:20-cv-09257-HSG Document 62 Filed 10/16/24 Page 10 of 13\n1 Under the Settlement Agreement, the “Released Claims” must “concern, arise out of, or relate to”\n2 this derivate shareholder action. SA § 1.21. As such, the Released Claims “are limited to those\n3 based upon the core of this litigation.” In re Hewlett-Packard, 2015 WL 1153864, at *5.\n4 Accordingly, the “scope of release is sufficiently narrow.” In re LDK Solar Sec. Litig., No. C 07-\n5 05182 WHA, 2010 WL 598361, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 17, 2010). See In re Zoran Corp.\n6 Derivative Litig., No. C 06-05503 WHA, 2008 WL 941897, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 7, 2008) (“The\n7 released claims should only be those made in the consolidated complaint and those closely related\n8 thereto.”); Nen Thio v. Genji, LLC, 14 F. Supp. 3d 1324, 1334 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (“[T]he scope of\n9 the release in the proposed settlement . . . is acceptable because the claims released are limited to\n10 those based upon the facts set forth in the . . . Complaint.”). Moreover, claims alleged in the\n11 Federal Securities Action and related state actions are specifically carved out of the Settlement\n12 Agreement, bolstering the release provisions’ fairness. See SA § 1.21. Since the language of the\na\nt r i n\nu or o 13 Settlement Agreement’s release is appropriately tied to the claims raised in the operative\nCf\ni\ntl\na\ncC 14 complaint, the scope of release weighs in favor of granting preliminary approval.\ni\nr t s f o\ni\nD t c 15 iv. Preferential Treatment\nsi\nr\net\nt a ts i D 16 Finally, the Court considers whether the Settlement Agreement provides preferential\nS\nd\nn\nr\nee 17 treatment. The Settlement Agreement authorizes Plaintiffs’ counsel to “apply to the Court for a\nth\ni nt\nr\nUo\nN 18 service award of up to $1,500 for each of the Plaintiffs, only to be paid upon Court approval.” SA\n19 § 4.2. “Derivative plaintiffs may . . . merit compensation for work done on behalf of the\n20 [shareholders].” In re Wells Fargo & Co. Sharehold Derivative Litig., 2019 WL 13020734, at *8\n21 (internal citation and quotations omitted). $1,500 is below what some courts have considered “the\n22 presumptively reasonable amount of $5,000 for such awards.” Id. Again, the Court will decide at\n23 the final approval stage whether the requested awards are warranted. But the Court finds that this\n24 factor does not weigh against preliminary approval.\n25 * * *\n26 Having weighed the relevant factors, the Court preliminarily finds that the Settlement\n27 Agreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, and GRANTS preliminary approval. The Court\n28 DIRECTS the parties to include both a joint proposed order and a joint proposed judgment when\n10\nCase 4:20-cv-09257-HSG Document 62 Filed 10/16/24 Page 11 of 13\n1 submitting their motion for final approval.\n2 III. PROPOSED NOTICE PLAN\n3 If the Court preliminarily approves a derivative action settlement, notice “must be given to\n4 shareholders or members in the manner that the court orders.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.1(c). The Court\n5 separately evaluates the proposed notice procedure. See In re Wells Fargo & Co. Sharehold\n6 Derivative Litig., 2019 WL 13020734, at *8. In determining the appropriate notice method, “the\n7 Court considers whether such notice would be sufficient to reach the majority of interested\n8 stockholders.” Bushansky v. Armacost, No. 12-CV-01597-JST, 2014 WL 2905143, at *6 (N.D.\n9 Cal. June 25, 2014) (citing Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 1839).\n10 The parties propose to provide notice by (1) Lyft publishing the Summary Notice one time\n11 in the national edition of Investor’s Business Daily; (2) Plaintiffs’ Counsel publishing the\n12 Summary Notice one time over PR Newswire; and (3) Lyft posting the Settlement Agreement (and\na\nt r i n\nu or o 13 exhibits thereto) and the Notice on an Internet page that Lyft creates which is accessible via the\nCf\ni\ntl\na\ncC 14 “Investors” page of Lyft’s website. See Mot. at 23; SA § 3. Courts have found that similar\ni\nr t s f o\ni\nD t c 15 procedures satisfy Rule 23.1 and due process. See In re Hewlett-Packard Co. S'holder Derivative\nsi\nr\net\nt a ts i D 16 Litig., 716 F. App’x 603, 608 (9th Cir. 2017) (affirming the district court’s decision to approve\nS\nd\nn\nr\nee 17 notice procedures where the parties placed notice in prominent publications and posted the notice\nth\ni nt\nr\nUo\nN 18 on the company’s website); Bushansky, 2014 WL 2905143, at *6 (collecting cases). The Court\n19 comes to the same conclusion here.\n20 Similarly, the Court finds that the content of the proposed Notice “describes the terms of\n21 the settlement in sufficient detail to alert those with adverse viewpoints to investigate and to come\n22 forward and be heard.” In re Hewlett-Packard, 716 F. App’x at 609 (quoting Churchill Vill.,\n23 L.L.C. v. Gen. Elec., 361 F.3d 566, 575 (9th Cir. 2004)). The Notice summarizes: the litigation to\n24 date, the proposed corporate governance reforms, the release provisions, the proposed attorneys’\n25 fee award, and relevant information about the hearing, including the deadline to file an objection.\n26 See Dkt. No 60-2, Ex. C. The Summary Notice is similarly sufficient to alert and inform\n27 interested parties about the proposed Settlement Agreement and its accompanying hearing. See\n28 Dkt. No 60-2, Ex. D (directing readers to the full-length Notice and providing information about\n11\nCase 4:20-cv-09257-HSG Document 62 Filed 10/16/24 Page 12 of 13\n1 the reforms, hearing, and objection period). Accordingly, the Court finds that the proposed notice\n2 process is “reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise all [shareholders] of the\n3 proposed settlement.” See Roes, 944 F.3d at 1045 (internal citation and quotations omitted).\n4 IV. ATTORNEYS’ FEES\n5 “[B]ecause of the danger that parties will overestimate the value of injunctive relief in\n6 order to inflate fees, courts must be particularly careful when ascribing value to injunctive relief\n7 for purposes of determining attorneys’ fees, and avoid doing so altogether if the value of the\n8 injunctive relief is not easily measurable.” Id. at 1055. Under the terms of the proposed\n9 Settlement Agreement, the Individual Defendants agreed to pay Plaintiffs’ counsel $700,000.\n10 However, the Court need not—and does not—decide the issue of attorneys’ fees now.\n11 Preliminary approval of the settlement is not an endorsement or pre-approval of any future fee\n12 request, which will be considered at the final fairness hearing.\na\nt r i n\nu or o 13 V. CONCLUSION\nCf\ni\ntl\na\ncC 14 The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary approval, Dkt. No. 60. All\ni\nr t s f o\ni\nD t c 15 proceedings and deadlines save those involving settlement are STAYED. The form of notice is\nsi\nr\net\nt a ts i D 16 hereby APPROVED. The parties are DIRECTED to implement the proposed notice plan. The\nS\nd\nn\nr\nee 17 parties are further DIRECTED to meet and confer and stipulate to a schedule of dates for each\nth\ni nt\nr\nUo\nN 18 event listed below, which shall be submitted to the Court within seven days of the date of this\n19 Order.
