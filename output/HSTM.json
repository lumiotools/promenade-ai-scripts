Coupled with myClinicalExchange™, HealthStream’s application for students’ clinical rotations acquired in 2020, the Company has meaningfully enlarged its footprint among nursing and allied healthcare students as they prepare for careers in healthcare. \n\nEvery year in the U.S., nursing and allied healthcare students are required to fulfill clinical rotations in a healthcare organization (primarily hospitals) as part of their educational programs. Hospitals and schools are responsible for managing the placement of students into clinical rotations, including scheduling, onboarding, tracking, and ensuring compliance of students and ensuring that proper credentials are in place for their working in their organizations with patients. Both TCPS and The Clinical Hub, as well as HealthStream’s myClinicalExchange application, help to streamline these processes for students, schools and healthcare organizations in this critical area of workforce management. \n\nAlready this year, HealthStream’s myClinicalExchange application has helped healthcare organizations and academic institutions facilitate over 285,000 clinical rotations for nursing and allied healthcare students, nationwide. With the additions of TCPS and The Clinical Hub, HealthStream will further expand its geographic coverage in Tennessee, and surrounding states, and in Oklahoma, enhancing clinical placement options for hospitals, schools, and students. \n\n“HealthStream’s leadership in the healthcare workforce sector is unparalleled and, therefore, they are ideally positioned to bring additional opportunities to the students, schools, and healthcare facilities that use TCPS,” said Pam Taylor, Chief Executive Officer, TCPS. Similarly, Jim Durbin, President of The Clinical Hub, added, “Our clients will continue to receive the benefits they enjoy from The Clinical Hub while now gaining access to HealthStream’s ecosystem of workforce solutions that increasingly bridges the gap between school and practice.” Both Taylor and Durbin expressed confidence and gratitude that customers would continue to enjoy the same quality of uninterrupted service while beginning to see new and additional benefits with HealthStream over time. \n\n“By adding the highly respected businesses of TCPS and The Clinical Hub to HealthStream, along with the continued growth of the myClinicalExchange application, we strengthen our position in supporting the development of future clinicians by working closely with academic institutions and healthcare organizations to efficiently facilitate clinical placement of students in rotations,” said Scott McQuigg, Senior Vice President, Digital & Network Solutions, HealthStream. \n\n_Terms of the Transactions:_\n\n  * HealthStream acquired substantially all of the assets of Total Clinical Placement System (TCPS) from Cyber Healthcare Solutions, LLC for up to $1.65 million in cash (the full payment of which will require earnout achievement), subject to customary post-closing price adjustments. \n  * HealthStream acquired substantially all of the assets of The Clinical Hub, Inc. for up to $600,000 in cash (the full payment of which will require earnout achievement), subject to customary post-closing price adjustments. \n\n\n\n**About HealthStream**\n\nHealthStream (Nasdaq: HSTM) is the healthcare industry’s largest ecosystem of platform-delivered workforce solutions that empowers healthcare professionals to do what they do best: deliver excellence in patient care.

(the “Company”) (Nasdaq: HSTM), a leading healthcare technology platform for workforce solutions, announced today results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024**\n\n  * Revenues of $73.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, up 3.9% from $70.3 million in the third quarter of 2023 \n  * Operating income of $6.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, up 33.6% from $4.9 million in the third quarter of 2023 \n  * Net income of $5.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, up 48.0% from $3.9 million in the third quarter of 2023 \n  * Earnings per share (EPS) of $0.19 per share (diluted) in the third quarter of 2024, up from $0.13 per share (diluted) in the third quarter of 2023 \n  * Adjusted EBITDA1 of $17.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, up 9.0% from $16.2 million in the third quarter of 2023 \n  * Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.028 per share, payable on November 15, 2024, to holders of record on November 4, 2024\n\n\n\n1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income and disclosure regarding why we believe adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors is included later in this release.   \n---  \n  \n**Financial Results:**\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Compared to Third Quarter 2023**\n\nRevenues for the third quarter of 2024 increased by $2.8 million, or 3.9%, to $73.1 million, compared to $70.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. Subscription revenues increased by $2.5 million, or 3.6%, and professional services revenues increased by $0.3 million, or 10.8%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. \n\nOperating income was $6.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, up 33.6% from $4.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The improvement in operating income was primarily attributable to increased revenues and an increase in capitalized labor associated with software development activities, partially offset by increases in labor costs. \n\nNet income was $5.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, up 48.0% from $3.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, and EPS was $0.19 per share (diluted) in the third quarter of 2024, up from $0.13 per share (diluted) in the third quarter of 2023. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $17.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, up 9.0% from $16.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $94.9 million. The Company does not have any outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money. Capital expenditures incurred during the third quarter of 2024 were $6.9 million. \n\n**Year-to-Date 2024 Compared to Year-to-Date 2023**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues were $217.4 million, an increase of 4.3% over revenues of $208.5 million for the first nine months of 2023. Operating income for the first nine months of 2024 increased by 41.1% to $16.6 million, compared to $11.8 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to higher revenues and an increase in capitalized labor associated with software development activities. Operating income was also impacted by higher expenses, including software, bad debt related to a customer bankruptcy during the second quarter of 2024, cloud hosting, labor costs, amortization, general marketing, and travel expenses. Net income for the first nine months of 2024 increased to $15.1 million, compared to $10.6 million for the first nine months of 2023. Earnings per share were $0.50 per share (diluted) for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $0.35 per share (diluted) for the first nine months of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 11.7% to $50.6 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $45.3 million for the first nine months of 2023. \n\n**Other Business Updates**\n\nOn October 21, 2024, the Board approved a quarterly cash dividend under the Company's dividend policy of $0.028 per share, payable on November 15, 2024, to holders of record on November 4, 2024. \n\n**Financial Outlook for 2024**\n\nThe Company is updating its guidance for 2024 for certain of the measures set forth below. For a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure defined later in this release, to projected net income (the most comparable GAAP measure) for 2024, see the table included on page nine of this release. \n\n**Full Year 2024 Guidance**  \n---  \n**Low** |  **High**  \nRevenue  |  $  |  290.0  |  -  |  $  |  292.0  |  million2  \nNet Income  |  $  |  18.5  |  -  |  $  |  19.5  |  million3  \nAdjusted EBITDA1 |  $  |  66.0  |  -  |  $  |  67.5  |  million4  \nCapital Expenditures  |  $  |  28.0  |  -  |  $  |  30.0  |  million   \n  \n1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA to projected net income (the most comparable GAAP measure) is included later in this release.   \n---  \n2 Previous expected Revenue guidance range was $292.0 to $296.0 million.   \n3 Previous expected Net Income guidance range was $16.7 to $18.6 million.   \n4 Previous expected Adjusted EBITDA guidance range was $64.5 to $67.5 million.   \n  \nThe Company’s guidance for 2024 as set forth above reflects the Company’s assumptions regarding, among other things, expectations for new sales and renewals, and assumes that general economic conditions, including inflationary pressures, do not deteriorate. This consolidated guidance does not include the impact of any acquisitions that we may complete during 2024, gains or losses from changes in the fair value of minority investments, or impairment of long-lived assets. \n\nCommenting on third quarter 2024 results, Robert A. Frist, Jr., Chief Executive Officer, HealthStream, said, “Our quarterly financial performance showed year-over-year increases in each of the major categories we highlight in our earnings release, which included record quarterly revenues and record adjusted EBITDA. We continue to see competitive benefits emerge from our innovative platform strategy, which we believe is paving the way for increased, long-term value for our customers and shareholders.” \n\nA conference call with Robert A. Frist, Jr., Chief Executive Officer, Scott A. Roberts, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, and Mollie Condra, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications, will be held on Tuesday, October 22, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. (ET).

A replay of the conference call and webcast will be archived on the Company’s website in the Investor Relations section under “Events & Presentations.” \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release presents adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure used by management in analyzing the Company’s financial results and ongoing operational performance. In order to better assess the Company’s financial results, management believes that net income before interest, income taxes, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, and changes in fair value of, including gains (losses) on the sale of, non-marketable equity investments (“adjusted EBITDA”) is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company because adjusted EBITDA reflects net income adjusted for certain GAAP accounting, non-cash, and/or non-operating items which may not, in any such case, fully reflect the underlying operating performance of our business. In addition, as discussed below, for periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2023, adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of the deferred revenue write-downs associated with fair value accounting for acquired businesses. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to assess the Company’s ongoing operating performance and to compare the Company’s operating performance between periods. In addition, certain short-term cash incentive bonuses and performance-based equity awards are based on the achievement of adjusted EBITDA (as defined in applicable bonus and equity grant documentation) targets. \n\nAs previously disclosed, prior to the Company early adopting ASU 2021-08 effective January 1, 2022, following the completion of any acquisition by the Company, the Company was required to record the acquired deferred revenue at fair value as defined in GAAP, which typically resulted in a write-down of the acquired deferred revenue. In connection therewith, management determined that including an adjustment in the definition of adjusted EBITDA for the impact of the deferred revenue write-downs associated with fair value accounting for businesses acquired prior to the January 1, 2022 effective date of the Company's adoption of ASU 2021-08 (the “Pre-2022 Acquisitions”) provided useful information to investors because the deferred revenue write-down recognized in periods after any such Pre-2022 Acquisitions could, given the nature of this non-cash accounting impact, cause our GAAP financial results during such periods to not fully reflect our underlying operating performance. Following the adoption of ASU 2021-08, contracts acquired in an acquisition completed on or after January 1, 2022 have been measured as if the Company had originated the contract (rather than the contract being measured at fair value) such that, for such acquisitions, the Company no longer records deferred revenue write-downs associated with acquired businesses. With respect to periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2023, the Company has included an adjustment in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA for the impact of deferred revenue write-downs associated with the Pre-2022 Acquisitions consistent with this prior accounting standard, given the ongoing impact of such deferred revenue on our financial results under GAAP over this time period. With respect to periods beginning on and after January 1, 2024, the Company no longer recognizes any deferred revenue write-downs associated with the Pre-2022 Acquisitions under GAAP, and accordingly such deferred revenue write-downs are not an adjustment in connection with the calculation of adjusted EBITDA for periods on and after January 1, 2024. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP, adjusted EBITDA is susceptible to varying calculations. Accordingly, adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and has limitations as an analytical tool. \n\nThis non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to net income (the most comparable GAAP measure), which is set forth below in this release. \n\n**About HealthStream**\n\nHealthStream (Nasdaq: HSTM) is the healthcare industry’s largest ecosystem of platform-delivered workforce solutions that empowers healthcare professionals to do what they do best: deliver excellence in patient care.
