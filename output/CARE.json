          "content": "NEWS RELEASE\nCarter Bankshares, Inc. Announces Third Quarter\n2024 Financial Results\n2024-10-24\nMARTINSVILLE, VA / ACCESSWIRE / October 24, 2024 / Carter Bankshares, Inc. (the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:CARE), the\nholding company of Carter Bank & Trust (the \"Bank\") today announced quarterly net income of $5.6 million, or\n$0.24 diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\"), for the third quarter of 2024 compared to net income of $4.8 million, or\n$0.21 diluted EPS, for the second quarter of 2024 and net income of $3.6 million, or $0.16 diluted EPS, for the third\nquarter of 2023. The pre-tax pre-provision income1 was $6.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, $6.2 million for\nthe second quarter of 2024 and $5.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income was $16.2 million, or $0.70 diluted EPS, compared to\nnet income of $25.3 million, or $1.07 diluted EPS for the same period in 2023. Pre-tax pre-provision income1 was\n$20.2 million and $33.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company obtained a voluntary stipulation of dismissal of the lawsuit \u0000led\nagainst the Bank in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia (Danville Division) on\nFebruary 10, 2024 (the \"GLAS Trust Lawsuit\") by GLAS Trust Company, LLC, in its capacity as Note Trustee (\"GLAS\nTrust\") \"with prejudice.\" Accordingly, GLAS Trust may not bring any future legal action in any court based on the\nfacts alleged in the GLAS Trust Lawsuit. Moreover, in connection with the dismissal of the GLAS Trust Lawsuit, GLAS\nTrust and certain a\u0000liates and parties on whose behalf it is acting have executed a release that waives any and all\ncauses of action of any kind that they might claim to have against the Bank.\nThe dismissal of the GLAS Trust Lawsuit ended all pending litigation brought against the Bank by GLAS Trust in\nconnection with the Bank's lending relationship with James C. Justice, II and the entities in which he has an interest\n(collectively, the \"Justice Entities\"). Also in connection with the dismissal of the GLAS Trust Lawsuit, the Justice\n1\nEntities executed documents rea\u0000rming the legality, validity and binding nature of all loan documents they have\nexecuted in favor of the Bank.\nThe Company tendered a payment (the \"Settlement Payment\") in consideration of the voluntary dismissal of the\nGLAS Trust Lawsuit. In light of the fact that certain of the Justice Entities had previously agreed to indemnify the\nBank against the claims asserted in the GLAS Trust Lawsuit, certain of the Justice Entities executed a promissory\nnote in favor of the Bank further evidencing this indemni\u0000cation obligation as related to the Settlement Payment.\nThis promissory note was recognized as a principal charge-o\u0000 due to the nonperforming status of the Bank's loans\nwith the Justice Entities, and because the settled claims related to allegedly preferential payments made on those\nnonperforming loans.\nThe Company's \u0000nancial results continue to be signi\u0000cantly impacted by placing loans contained in the Bank's\nOther segment on nonaccrual status during the second quarter of 2023. The Bank's loans to the Justice Entities,\nremain the Bank's largest lending relationship and comprise the signi\u0000cant majority of the Other segment. As a\nresult, interest income was negatively impacted by $8.8 million and $9.3 million during the third quarter of 2024\nand 2023, respectively. Interest income has been negatively impacted by $57.2 million in the aggregate since\nplacement of these loans on nonaccrual status during the second quarter of 2023.\nFinancial Highlights as of and for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nAt September 30, 2024, nonperforming loans declined by $12.5 million to $287.7 million compared to June 30,\n2024. Nonperforming loans to total portfolio loans were 8.00%, 8.46% and 9.04% for the quarters ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The decline in nonperforming loans\nduring the third quarter of 2024 is primarily due to $13.2 million of curtailment payments made by the Bank's\nlargest nonperforming lending relationship;\nThe allowance for credit losses to total portfolio loans were 2.25%, 2.72% and 2.77% at September 30, 2024,\nJune 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease is primarily related to the updated analysis\nof the individually evaluated loans, a $15.0 million charge-o\u0000 related to the Other segment of the loan\nportfolio, and $1.7 million of Other segment speci\u0000c reserves released in connection with $13.2 million of\ncurtailment payments in accordance with the Forbearance Agreement currently in place;\nTotal portfolio loans increased $46.3 million, or 5.2% on an annualized basis, to $3.6 billion at September 30,\n2024 compared to June 30, 2024 and increased $184.9 million, or 5.4%, compared to September 30, 2023;\nTotal deposits increased $203.8 million, or 20.9% on an annualized basis, compared to June 30, 2024 and\nincreased $525.5 million, or 14.8%, compared to September 30, 2023 of which $100.5 million were new\n2\nbrokered certi\u0000cates of deposit (\"CDs\") in the third quarter of 2024;\nFederal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") borrowings decreased $148.0 million to $90.0 million at September 30,\n2024 as compared to June 30, 2024 due to deposit growth;\nNet interest income totaled $28.8 million, an increase of $0.7 million, or 2.5% compared to the prior quarter,\nand an increase of $1.4 million, or 5.1% compared to the year ago period. Net interest margin, on a fully\ntaxable equivalent (\"FTE\") basis3, increased three basis points to 2.59% for the third quarter of 2024,\ncompared to 2.56% for the prior quarter and increased \u0000ve basis points from the year ago quarter. Net\ninterest income and net interest margin continue to be signi\u0000cantly impacted by the Bank's largest lending\nrelationship remaining on nonaccrual status since the second quarter of 2023; and\nThe e\u0000ciency ratio was 80.17%, 81.62% and 83.52% for the quarters ended September 30, 2024, June 30,\n2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The e\u0000ciency ratio was impacted primarily by the Bank's largest\nlending relationship that was placed in nonaccrual status during the second quarter of 2023.\nPositive developments continued in the third quarter with respect to legal actions and our large nonperforming\nrelationship. \"As previously noted, the lawsuit \u0000led by GLAS Trust Company, LLC was voluntarily dismissed with\nprejudice during the third quarter of 2024, and the Justice Entities have continued to curtail their debt owed to the\nBank in accordance with the Forbearance Agreement currently in place. These are favorable outcomes for our\nCompany and represent continued progress towards the ultimate resolution of our large nonperforming\nrelationship. We remain committed to resolving this lending relationship in a manner that best protects the\nCompany, the Bank and shareholders\", stated Litz H. Van Dyke, Chief Executive O\u0000cer.\nVan Dyke continued, \"Although the large nonperforming lending relationship continues to have a negative impact\non our \u0000nancial and credit metrics, aside from this impact, our \u0000nancial performance and asset quality metrics\nremain solid. We continue to feel positive about the fundamentals of the Company and the structure of our balance\nsheet. Capital and liquidity levels continue to be strong, and loan production was solid in the third quarter, although\nmuch of this production was construction lending which has a lag time before it is fully funded and earning interest.\nOur loan production pipeline also remains solid, providing good visibility through year end. Deposit growth is\noccurring in most categories, with the majority of growth coming from increases in interest checking and CD\naccounts. During the third quarter, the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates 50 basis points. We expect an\nimmediate decline in the cost of funds in the fourth quarter from this recent rate cut. Our balance sheet is slightly\nliability sensitive and is well positioned so that a declining interest rate environment should positively impact our\nmargin. We also expect that our net interest margin will return to a more normalized level once the large\nnonperforming lending relationship is fully resolved.\"\n3\nOperating Highlights\nCredit Quality\nNonperforming loans as a percentage of total portfolio loans were 8.00%, 8.46% and 9.04% as of September 30,\n2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, nonperforming loans decreased\n$12.5 million to $287.7 million since June 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to $13.2 million of curtailment\npayments made by the Bank's largest nonperforming lending relationship during the third quarter of 2024.\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company placed commercial loans in the Other segment of the Company's\nloan portfolio relating to the Bank's largest lending relationship with a current aggregate principal amount of $280.9\nmillion on nonaccrual status due to loan maturities and failure to pay in full. This nonperforming relationship\nrepresents 97.6% of total nonperforming loans and 7.8% of total portfolio loans at September 30, 2024.\nDuring the second and third quarters of 2024, $7.8 million and $13.2 million of curtailments, respectively, have\ndecreased the aggregate nonperforming loan balance outstanding to the Bank from $301.9 million at March 31,\n2024 to $280.9 million at September 30, 2024. The Company continues to believe it is well secured based on the net\ncarrying value of the credit relationship and it has appropriately reserved for potential credit losses with respect to\nall such loans based on information currently available. However, the Company cannot give any assurance as to the\ntiming or amount of future payments or collections on such loans or that the Company will ultimately collect all\namounts contractually due under the terms of such loans. The Company has speci\u0000c reserves of $36.9 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024 with respect to such loans as compared to $52.9 million at June 30, 2024. The decline was\ndriven by updated analysis of the credit relationship during the third quarter of 2024 using the discounted cash\n\u0000ow model with updated assumptions and inputs regarding the credit relationship, legal risk and related risks. The\nupdated analysis and the impact on the speci\u0000c reserves contributed to the decrease in the provision for credit\nlosses during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior quarter.\nThe provision for credit losses decreased $0.9 million and $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the\nsecond quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, respectively. The decrease in the provision for credit losses\nas compared to the second quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by the updated analysis of the individually\nevaluated loans and $1.7 million of other segment reserves released due to the aforementioned $13.2 million of\ncurtailment payments during the third quarter of 2024, o\u0000set by loan growth in the third quarter of 2024.\nThe provision for unfunded commitments in the third quarter of 2024 was a provision of $191 thousand compared\nto a recovery of $236 thousand in the second quarter of 2024 and a recovery of $130 thousand in the third quarter\nof 2023. The increase was due to increased commitments in construction loans during the third quarter of 2024.\n4\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income increased $0.7 million to $28.8 million compared to the second quarter of 2024 and increased\n$1.4 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. Net interest margin, on a FTE basis3, increased three basis\npoints to 2.59% compared to the second quarter of 2024 and increased \u0000ve basis points compared to the third\nquarter of 2023. The increase in interest-earning income was primarily due to a 17 basis point increase in the yield\non average loans from 5.26% in the second quarter of 2024 to 5.43% in the third quarter of 2024, as well as a higher\naverage loan balance.\nNet interest margin, on an FTE basis3, continues to be negatively impacted by funding costs. Total interest-bearing\ndeposit costs increased 18 basis points to 3.05% compared to 2.87% in the second quarter of 2024. The higher\ninterest-bearing deposit costs were primarily due to growth in average certi\u0000cates of deposits of $104.0 million and\ninterest-bearing demand of $71.9 million compared to the second quarter of 2024. The increase in deposit costs is\no\u0000set by total average borrowings which decreased $110.1 million to $181.5 million compared to $291.6 million in\nthe second quarter of 2024 due to higher average deposit balances. Total borrowing costs declined 20 basis points\nto 5.00% compared to 5.20% in the second quarter of 2024.\nNet interest income decreased $9.6 million, or 10.1%, to $85.3 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to the same period in 2023, re\u0000ecting the impact of rising rates on funding costs more than\no\u0000setting loan growth and higher loan and securities yields. Net interest margin, on an FTE basis3, decreased 41\nbasis points to 2.59% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.00% for the same period in\n2023. Funding costs increased 104 basis points, o\u0000set by an increase of 43 basis points on the yield on earning\nassets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nThe decline in net interest income and net interest margin were signi\u0000cantly driven by the aforementioned large\nnonperforming lending relationship, which negatively impacted interest income by $27.2 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $20.7 million for the same period in 2023. During the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, $956.0 million of CDs matured and repriced from an average rate of 4.13% to\nan average rate of 4.44%.\nOur balance sheet is currently exhibiting characteristics of a slightly liability sensitive position due to the short-term\nnature of our deposit portfolio and FHLB borrowings. Speci\u0000cally, 82.46% of our CD portfolio and 50.0% of our\noutstanding FHLB borrowings will mature and reprice over the next twelve months. This strategy gives us \u0000exibility\nto manage the structure and pricing of our deposit and borrowing portfolios to reduce future funding costs should\nthe Federal Open Market Committee (\"FOMC\") continue cutting short-term rates in the future.\nNoninterest Income\n5\nFor the third quarter of 2024, total noninterest income was $5.4 million, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 2.0%, from\nthe second quarter of 2024 and an increase of $0.2 million, or 2.9%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. For the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, total noninterest income was $16.0 million, an increase of $1.0 million, or\n6.4%, from the same period in 2023.\nThe decrease of $0.1 million in noninterest income compared to the second quarter of 2024 primarily related to a\ndecrease of $0.2 million in other noninterest income as a result of community development grants received in the\nsecond quarter of 2024, o\u0000set by an increase of $0.1 million in insurance commissions due to higher activity. The\nincreases compared to the third quarter of 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023were also related\nto higher insurance commissions in the current period.\nNoninterest Expense\nFor the third quarter of 2024, total noninterest expense remained \u0000at at $27.4 million compared to the second\nquarter of 2024 and increased $0.2 million, or 0.6% from the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, total noninterest expenses was $81.1 million, an increase of $4.7 million, or 6.2%, from the\nsame period in 2023.\nAs compared to the second quarter of 2024, the signi\u0000cant variances o\u0000set one another with decreases in other\nnoninterest expense and professional and legal fees, o\u0000set by increases in salaries and employee bene\u0000ts,\noccupancy expenses and data processing expenses that net to a decrease of less than $0.1 million.\nTotal noninterest expense increased $0.2 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to similar signi\u0000cant\nvariances to the prior quarter of 2024. The increases in salaries and employee bene\u0000ts resulted from higher salary\nexpenses due to fewer open positions in retail, job grade assessment increases and normal merit increases of $0.6\nmillion. The increase in occupancy expenses, net of $0.4 million was due to new software license and depreciation\nexpense in the third quarter of 2024, and the increase in data processing expenses of $0.3 million relates primarily\nto general in\u0000ationary cost increases for existing and new service agreements. These increases were o\u0000set by\ndecreases of $1.1 million in other noninterest expense related to a gain of $0.5 million on a closed o\u0000ce that was\nsold in the third quarter of 2024, write-downs of $0.6 million on three legacy other real estate owned (\"OREO\")\nproperties and write-downs of $0.2 million on two additional closed o\u0000ces in the third quarter of 2023. The\ndecrease in professional and legal fees related to reimbursement of expenses in connection with the current\nforbearance agreement with the large nonperforming lending relationship.\nThe most signi\u0000cant increases for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in\n2023, included similar variances to the year ago quarter. However, the year-to-date variance was also impacted by\n6\nan increase of $2.1 million in FDIC insurance expense, which was a direct result of the aforementioned large\nnonperforming lending relationship. The similar variances were an increase of $1.8 million in salaries and employee\nbene\u0000ts, an increase of $0.9 million in occupancy expenses, and an increase of $0.6 million in data processing\nexpenses. Debit card expense also increased $0.4 million related to discounts received in March of 2023. O\u0000setting\nthese increases was a $1.6 million decline in other noninterest expenses which include the gains on the sale and\nwrite-downs on OREO properties mentioned above in the third quarter of 2024, but also includes gains of $0.3\nmillion on two other closed o\u0000ces sold in the \u0000rst quarter of 2024, previously written down in the third quarter of\n2023.\nFinancial Condition\nCash and due from banks increased $43.3 million to $105.0 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $61.7\nmillion at June 30, 2024 primarily due to higher excess cash on hand in the third quarter of 2024. The available-for-\nsale securities portfolio decreased $3.7 million and is currently 16.1% of total assets at September 30, 2024\ncompared to 16.5% of total assets at June 30, 2024. The decrease is due to maturities deployed into higher yielding\nloan assets during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nTotal portfolio loans increased $46.3 million, or 5.2% on an annualized basis, to $3.6 billion at September 30, 2024\ncompared to June 30, 2024. The increase in loans primarily related to growth in commercial real estate loans of\n$56.6 million o\u0000set by the aforementioned $13.2 million of curtailment payments compared to June 30, 2024.\nTotal deposits increased $203.8 million, or 20.9% on an annualized basis, to $4.1 billion at September 30, 2024\ncompared to June 30, 2024. Deposits increased primarily due to growth in CDs of $167.9 million, an increase of\n$83.6 million in interest-bearing demand accounts, and an increase of $3.7 million in money market accounts,\no\u0000set by a decrease of $27.0 million in savings accounts, and a decrease of $24.4 million in noninterest-bearing\ndemand accounts. The Company had $216.1 million brokered CDs at September 30, 2024 and $115.6 million at June\n30, 2024, as a result of $100.5 million new brokered CDs.\nFHLB borrowings decreased $148.0 million to $90.0 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $238.0 million at\nJune 30, 2024 primarily due to a decline in overnight borrowings, o\u0000set by $100.5 million of new brokered CDs\nduring the third quarter of 2024, as well as deposit growth.\nAs of September 30, 2024, approximately 82.7% of our total deposits of $4.1 billion were insured under standard\nFDIC insurance coverage limits, and approximately 17.3% of our total deposits were uninsured deposits over the\nstandard FDIC insurance coverage limit. As of June 30, 2024, approximately 82.8% of our total deposits of $3.9\nbillion were insured under standard FDIC insurance coverage limits, and approximately 17.2% of our total deposits\nwere uninsured deposits over the standard FDIC insurance coverage limit. The Company had no outstanding\n7\nfederal funds purchased at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024.\nCapitalization and Liquidity\nThe Company remained well capitalized as of September 30, 2024.

          "content": "NEWS RELEASE\nCarter Bankshares, Inc. Announces Second Quarter\n2024 Financial Results\n2024-07-25\nMARTINSVILLE, VA / ACCESSWIRE / July 25, 2024 / Carter Bankshares, Inc. (the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:CARE), the\nholding company of Carter Bank & Trust (the \"Bank\") today announced quarterly net income of $4.8 million, or\n$0.21 diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\"), for the second quarter of 2024 compared to net income of $5.8 million, or\n$0.25 diluted EPS, in the \u0000rst quarter of 2024 and net income of $5.7 million, or $0.24 diluted EPS, for the second\nquarter of 2023. The pre-tax pre-provision income1 was $6.2 million for the second quarter of 2024, $7.2 million for\nthe \u0000rst quarter of 2024 and $6.2 million for the second quarter of 2023.\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, net income was $10.6 million, or $0.46 diluted EPS, compared to net\nincome of $21.6 million, or $0.91 diluted EPS for the same period in 2023. Pre-tax pre-provision income1 was $13.4\nmillion and $28.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024 the federal court lawsuit \u0000led against the Company and the Bank by West\nVirginia Governor James C. Justice II, his wife Cathy L. Justice, his son James C. Justice, III, and related entities that he\nand/or they own (collectively, the \"Justice Entities\") was dismissed with prejudice. In connection with the dismissal\nof this litigation, the Justice Entities have agreed upon a pathway of curtailment and payo\u0000 of the outstanding loans\nwith the Bank. The Justice Entities have already started that process of curtailment, and the aggregate\nnonperforming loan balance associated with the Justice Entities has been reduced from $301.9 million as of March\n31, 2024 to $294.1 million as of June 30, 2024.\nThe Company's \u0000nancial results continue to be signi\u0000cantly impacted by placing loans contained in the Bank's\nOther segment on nonaccrual status during the second quarter of 2023. The Bank's Other segment, represents the\nBank's loans to the Justice Entities, which remains the Bank's largest lending relationship. As a result, interest\n1\nincome was negatively impacted by $9.1 million and $11.3 million during the second quarter of 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. Interest income has been negatively impacted by $48.4 million in the aggregate since placement of\nthese loans on nonaccrual status during the second quarter of 2023.\nFinancial Highlights for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2024\nAt June 30, 2024, nonperforming loans declined by $7.1 million to $300.2 million when compared to March 31,\n2024. Nonperforming loans to total portfolio loans were 8.46%, 8.76% and 9.33% for the quarters ended June\n30, 2024, March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. The decline in nonperforming loans during the\nsecond quarter of 2024 is primarily due to $7.8 million of curtailment payments made by the Bank's largest\nnonperforming lending relationship;\nThe allowance for credit losses to total portfolio loans were 2.72%, 2.75% and 2.83% at June 30, 2024, March\n31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease is primarily related to $1.4 million of other segment\nspeci\u0000c reserves released in connection with the aforementioned $7.8 million of curtailment payments;\nTotal portfolio loans increased $40.5 million, or 4.6% on an annualized basis, to $3.5 billion at June 30, 2024\ncompared to March 31, 2024 and increased $219.1 million, or 6.6%, compared to June 30, 2023;\nTotal deposits increased $50.8 million, or 5.3% on an annualized basis, compared to March 31, 2024 and\nincreased $301.2 million, or 8.4%, compared to June 30, 2023;\nNet interest income decreased $0.3 million, or 1.2%, to $28.1 million compared to the \u0000rst quarter of 2024\nand increased $1.4 million, or 5.2% compared to the second quarter of 2023. For the six months ended June\n30, 2024 net interest income decreased $11.0 million, or 16.3% compared to the same period in 2023\nprimarily driven by the aforementioned NPL relationship, which negatively impacted interest income by $18.4\nmillion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to $11.3 million for the same period in 2023.\nFunding costs increased 127 basis points, o\u0000set by an increase of 36 basis points on the yield on earning\nassets for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023;\nNet interest margin, on a fully taxable equivalent basis3 (\"FTE\"), decreased four basis points to 2.56%\ncompared to the \u0000rst quarter of 2024 and increased two basis points compared to the second quarter of\n2023. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 net interest margin, on a FTE basis, decreased 67 basis points\nto 2.58% compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest income and net interest margin continue to be\nsigni\u0000cantly impacted by the Bank's largest lending relationship remaining on nonaccrual status since the\nsecond quarter of 2023;\n2\nThe e\u0000ciency ratio was 81.62%, 78.46% and 80.46% for the quarters ended June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024\nand June 30, 2023, respectively. The e\u0000ciency ratio was impacted primarily by the Bank's largest lending\nrelationship that was placed in nonaccrual status during the second quarter of 2023.\n\"As previously noted, the lawsuit \u0000led by West Virginia Governor James Justice and related entities was dismissed\nwith prejudice during the second quarter of 2024, and the Justice Entities have begun curtailing their debt owed to\nthe Bank. This was a favorable outcome for our Company and we remain committed to resolving this lending\nrelationship in a manner that best protects the Company, the Bank and shareholders, stated Litz H. Van Dyke, Chief\nExecutive O\u0000cer.\"\nVan Dyke continued, \"Obviously, the large nonperforming lending relationship continues to have a negative impact\non our \u0000nancial results, but aside from this issue, we believe our \u0000nancial performance for the second quarter was\nsolid and our asset quality remains strong across all credit metrics. We continue to feel positive about the\nfundamentals of the Company and the structure of our balance sheet. Capital and liquidity levels continue to be\nstrong. Loan production was modest in the second quarter, largely due to more construction lending that we\nexpect to fund gradually over time. Our loan production pipeline also remains solid, however, we are still expecting\nmoderate loan growth this year. We believe our bond portfolio is well positioned to outperform many of our peers\nin what appears to be a protracted period of higher interest rates. Modest deposit growth is occurring in most\ncategories. While there continues to be pressure on the cost of funds, rates have been leveling o\u0000. However, the\ncurrent rate environment will continue to a\u0000ect our margin in the coming quarters. We expect that our net interest\nmargin will return to a more normalized level once the large nonperforming lending relationship is fully resolved.\nAdditionally, if the Fed begins to cut short-term interest rates, we believe our balance sheet is positioned so that it\nwill positively impact our margins.\"\nOperating Highlights\nCredit Quality\nNonperforming loans as a percentage of total portfolio loans were 8.46%, 8.76% and 9.33% as of June 30, 2024,\nMarch 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. At June 30, 2024, nonperforming loans decreased $7.1 million to\n$300.2 million since March 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to $7.8 million of curtailment payments made\nby the Bank's largest nonperforming lending relationship.\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company placed commercial loans in the other segment of the Company's\nloan portfolio relating to the Bank's largest lending relationship with a current aggregate principal amount of $294.1\nmillion on nonaccrual status due to loan maturities and failure to pay in full. This nonperforming relationship\nrepresents 98.0% of total nonperforming loans and 8.3% of total portfolio loans at June 30, 2024.\n3\nIn connection with the settlement and the path of curtailment described above, during the second quarter of 2024,\n$7.8 million of curtailments have decreased the aggregate nonperforming loan balance outstanding to the Bank.\nThe Company believes it is well secured based on the net carrying value of the credit relationship and it has\nappropriately reserved for expected credit losses with respect to all such loans based on information currently\navailable. However, the Company cannot give any assurance as to the timing or amount of future payments or\ncollections on such loans or that the Company will ultimately collect all amounts contractually due under the terms\nof such loans. The Company has speci\u0000c reserves of $52.9 million at June 30, 2024 with respect to such loans.\nThe provision for credit losses increased $0.5 million and $0.4 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to\nthe \u0000rst quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2023, respectively. The increase in the provision for credit losses\nas compared to the \u0000rst quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by loan growth, net charge-o\u0000s and a $0.5 million\nreserve on a new individually evaluated loan in the second quarter of 2024, o\u0000set by $1.4 million of other segment\nreserves released during the second quarter of 2024 related to the aforementioned $7.8 million of curtailment\npayments.\nThe (recovery) provision for unfunded commitments in the second quarter of 2024 was a recovery of $235.4\nthousand compared to a recovery of $43.3 thousand in the \u0000rst quarter of 2024 and a provision of $359.8 thousand\nin the second quarter of 2023. The decline was due to decreased commitments in construction loans during the\nsecond quarter of 2024.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income decreased $0.3 million, or 1.2%, to $28.1 million compared to the \u0000rst quarter of 2024 and\nincreased $1.4 million, or 5.2%, compared to the second quarter of 2023. The net interest margin decreased three\nbasis points to 2.55% compared to the \u0000rst quarter of 2024, and increased four basis points compared to the\nsecond quarter of 2023. Net interest margin, on an FTE basis decreased four basis points to 2.56% compared to the\nquarter ended March 31, 2024 and increased two basis points compared to the second quarter of 2023. The yield\non interest-earning assets increased four basis points compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and\nincreased 84 basis points compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2023.\nInterest income increased $0.5 million during the second quarter of 2024 compared to the \u0000rst quarter of 2024\nprimarily due to higher interest rate yields on interest-earning assets of four basis points due to new loan growth\ncoming on at higher interest rates. Interest income increased $10.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024\ncompared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to average loan growth of $272.6 million in taxable loans\nduring the second quarter of 2024, o\u0000set by the negative impact on interest income of $9.1 million relating to the\nBank's largest nonperforming lending relationship in the second quarter of 2024 compared to a higher negative\n4\nimpact of $11.3 million in the second quarter of 2023.\nInterest expense increased $0.9 million, or 3.4%, for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the \u0000rst\nquarter of 2024 and increased $9.5 million, or 55.8%, as compared to the second quarter of 2023. Funding costs\nincreased nine basis points compared to the previous quarter and increased 98 basis points compared to the same\nquarter of 2023. The increase in interest expense is due to customers migrating from lower cost non-maturing\ndeposits to higher interest-bearing demand, money market and certi\u0000cate of deposit (\"CD\") products. During the\nsecond quarter of 2024, $286.8 million of CDs matured and repriced from an average rate of 4.32% to an average\nrate of 4.39%.\nNet interest income decreased $11.0 million, or 16.3%, to $56.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024\ncompared to the same period in 2023. The net interest margin decreased 66 basis points to 2.56% for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 compared to 3.22% for the same period in 2023. Net interest margin, on an FTE basis3,\ndecreased 67 basis points to 2.58% for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to 3.25% for the same period\nin 2023. The decline in net interest income and net interest margin were signi\u0000cantly driven by the aforementioned\nlarge nonperforming lending relationship, which negatively impacted interest income by $18.4 million for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 as compared to $11.3 million for the same period in 2023. Funding costs increased\n127 basis points, partially o\u0000set by an increase of 36 basis points on the yield on earning assets for the six months\nended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, $760.6\nmillion of CDs matured and repriced from an average rate of 4.30% to an average rate of 4.41%.\nSince the \u0000rst quarter of 2023, there has been continued pressure on our cost of funds due to the shift from non-\nmaturing deposits to higher yielding certi\u0000cates of deposits, interest-bearing demand, money markets and higher-\ncost borrowingsdriven by the ongoing inversion of the yield curve, which has negatively impacted our net interest\nmargin. During the second quarter of 2024, this trend began to stabilize and we believe it will continue to stabilize\nin the coming quarters. Our balance sheet is currently exhibiting characteristics of a slightly liability sensitive\nposition due to the short-term nature of our deposit portfolio and Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") borrowings.\nSpeci\u0000cally, 91.70% of our CD portfolio and 81.1% of our outstanding FHLB borrowings will mature and reprice over\nthe next twelve months. This strategy gives us \u0000exibility to manage the structure and pricing of our deposit and\nborrowing portfolios to reduce future funding costs should the Federal Open Market Committee (\"FOMC\") begin\ncutting short-term rates later this year and beyond.\nNoninterest Income\nFor the second quarter of 2024, total noninterest income was $5.5 million, an increase of $0.5 million, or 9.7%, from\nthe \u0000rst quarter of 2024 and an increase of $0.5 million, or 10.0%, compared to the second quarter of 2023. For the\nsix months ended June 30, 2024, total noninterest income was $10.6 million, an increase of $0.8 million, or 8.3%,\n5\nfrom the same period in 2023.\nThe increase of $0.5 million in noninterest income compared to the \u0000rst quarter of 2024 primarily related to an\nincrease of $0.3 million in insurance commissions and a $0.3 million increase in other noninterest income, o\u0000set by\na decrease of $0.2 million in debit card interchange fees. The decline in debit card interchange fees was due to an\nannual Visa incentive program that occurred during the \u0000rst quarter of 2024 and increased income by $0.3 million.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, we recognized an unrealized fair value gain of $63.3 thousand on\nequity securities. This unrealized fair value gain is recorded in Other Income on the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome.\nAs compared to the second quarter of 2023, the $0.5 million variance in noninterest income was primarily due to an\nincrease of $0.4 million in insurance commissions and $0.1 million increase on service charges, commissions and\nfees, o\u0000set by a decrease of $0.1 million in other noninterest income.\nThe most signi\u0000cant increase during the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $0.9 million higher insurance\ncommissions. Also impacting the year-to-date increase was $0.1 million higher service charges, commissions and\nfees, o\u0000set by a decrease of $0.1 million in other noninterest income, as well as a decline of $0.1 million in\ncommercial loan swap fee income as activity has declined due to the interest rate environment.\nNoninterest Expense\nFor the second quarter of 2024, total noninterest expense was $27.4 million, an increase of $1.2 million, or 4.5%,\nfrom the \u0000rst quarter of 2024 and an increase of $1.9 million, or 7.5% from the second quarter of 2023. For the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, total noninterest expenses was $53.7 million, an increase of $4.6 million, or 9.3%,\nfrom the same period in 2023.\nAs compared to the \u0000rst quarter of 2024, the increase of $1.2 million included increases of $0.7 million in other\nnoninterest expense, an increase of $0.3 million in data processing, and an increase of $0.2 million in advertising\nexpenses, o\u0000set by a decrease of $0.1 million in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, (\"FDIC\") insurance\nexpense. The increase in other noninterest expense relates to a net change of $0.3 million on two other real estate\nowned (\"OREO\") properties that sold in the \u0000rst quarter of 2024, as well as higher appraisal expenses and loan\ncollection expenses during the second quarter of 2024.\nAs compared to the second quarter of 2023, the increase of $1.9 million related to $0.9 millionhigher FDIC\ninsurance expenses due to the deterioration in asset quality as a direct result of the large nonperforming lending\nrelationship, and that reduced asset quality's impact on the FDIC insurance assessment calculation, an increase of\n$0.6 million in salaries and employee bene\u0000ts, an increase of $0.2 million in data processing expenses, and an\n6\nincrease of $0.2 million in occupancy expenses. Salaries and employee bene\u0000ts increased as a result of higher\nsalary expense due to fewer open positions in retail, job grade assessment increases and normal merit increases.\nThe variance in occupancy relates primarily to general in\u0000ationary cost increases for existing and new service\nagreements, as well as lease expense on a newly opened o\u0000ce in the second quarter of 2024.\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023, the most signi\u0000cant\nincreases in total noninterest expense, and similar variances to the year ago quarter, was an increase of $1.9\nmillion in FDIC insurance expense, which was a direct result of the aforementioned large nonperforming lending\nrelationship, an increase of $1.1 million in salaries and employee bene\u0000ts, and an increase of $0.5 million in\noccupancy expenses. However, the year-to-date variance was also impacted by a $0.6 million increase in\nprofessional and legal fees as a result of fees incurred in connection with the large nonperforming lending\nrelationship and an increase of $0.3 million in debit card expense. The variance in debit card expenses was\nprimarily related to discounts received in March of 2023.\nFinancial Condition\nTotal assets were $4.5 billion at June 30, 2024, decreasing $22.4 million during the second quarter of 2024. Total\nportfolio loans increased $40.5 million, or 4.6% on an annualized basis, to $3.5 billion at June 30, 2024 compared to\nMarch 31, 2024. Cash and due from banks decreased $46.4 million to $61.7 million at June 30, 2024 compared to\n$108.1 million at March 31, 2024. The available-for-sale securities portfolio decreased $22.5 million and is currently\n16.5% of total assets at June 30, 2024 compared to 16.9% of total assets at March 31, 2024. The decrease is due to\nmaturities deployed into higher yielding loan assets during the six months ended June 30, 2024. FHLB stock, at cost,\ndecreased $3.4 million to $14.5 million at June 30, 2024 compared to $17.9 million at March 31, 2024 due to lower\nlevels of FHLB borrowings.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company purchased $5.0 million of equity securities with carrying value\ntotaling $5.1 million at June 30, 2024. The equity securities consist of our investment in a market-rate bond mutual\nfund that invests in high quality \u0000xed income bonds, mainly government agency securities whose proceeds are\ndesigned to positively impact community development throughout the United States. The mutual fund focuses\nexclusively on providing a\u0000ordable housing to low- and moderate-income borrowers and renters, including those in\nMajority Minority Census Tracts.\nTotal deposits increased $50.8 million, or 5.3% on an annualized basis, to $3.9 billion at June 30, 2024 compared to\nMarch 31, 2024 due to an increase of $67.5 million in CDs, an increase of $49.9 million in interest-bearing demand\naccounts, o\u0000set by a decrease of $27.6 million in savings accounts, a decrease of $20.3 million in money market\naccounts, and a decrease of $18.7 million in noninterest-bearing demand accounts. The Company had $115.6\nmillion brokered CDs at both June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024.\n7\nAt June 30, 2024, noninterest-bearing deposits comprised 16.8% of total deposits compared to 17.5% and 19.3% at\nMarch 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. CDs comprised 45.4%, 44.2% and 40.5% of total deposits at June 30,\n2024, March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively.As of June 30, 2024, approximately 82.8% of our total deposits\nof $3.9 billion were insured under standard FDIC insurance coverage limits, and approximately 17.2% of our total\ndeposits were uninsured deposits over the standard FDIC insurance coverage limit. As of March 31, 2024,\napproximately 82.8% of our total deposits of $3.8 billion were insured under standard FDIC insurance coverage\nlimits, and approximately 17.2% of our total deposits were uninsured deposits over the standard FDIC insurance\ncoverage limit.\nFHLB borrowings decreased $72.5 million to $238.0 million at June 30, 2024 compared to $310.5 million at March\n31, 2024 primarily due to deposit growth. The Company had no outstanding federal funds purchased at June 30,\n2024 and March 31, 2024.\nCapitalization and Liquidity\nThe Company remained well capitalized as of June 30, 2024. The Company's Tier 1 Capital ratio was 10.95% at June\n30, 2024 compared to 10.89% at March 31, 2024. The Company's leverage ratio was 9.43% at June 30, 2024\ncompared to 9.34% at March 31, 2024.

          "content": "NEWS RELEASE\nCarter Bankshares, Inc. Announces Third Quarter\n2024 Financial Results\n10/24/2024\nMARTINSVILLE, VA / ACCESSWIRE / October 24, 2024 / Carter Bankshares, Inc. (the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:CARE), the\nholding company of Carter Bank & Trust (the \"Bank\") today announced quarterly net income of $5.6 million, or\n$0.24 diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\"), for the third quarter of 2024 compared to net income of $4.8 million, or\n$0.21 diluted EPS, for the second quarter of 2024 and net income of $3.6 million, or $0.16 diluted EPS, for the third\nquarter of 2023. The pre-tax pre-provision income1 was $6.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, $6.2 million for\nthe second quarter of 2024 and $5.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income was $16.2 million, or $0.70 diluted EPS, compared to\nnet income of $25.3 million, or $1.07 diluted EPS for the same period in 2023. Pre-tax pre-provision income1 was\n$20.2 million and $33.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company obtained a voluntary stipulation of dismissal of the lawsuit \u0000led\nagainst the Bank in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia (Danville Division) on\nFebruary 10, 2024 (the \"GLAS Trust Lawsuit\") by GLAS Trust Company, LLC, in its capacity as Note Trustee (\"GLAS\nTrust\") \"with prejudice.\" Accordingly, GLAS Trust may not bring any future legal action in any court based on the\nfacts alleged in the GLAS Trust Lawsuit. Moreover, in connection with the dismissal of the GLAS Trust Lawsuit, GLAS\nTrust and certain a\u0000liates and parties on whose behalf it is acting have executed a release that waives any and all\ncauses of action of any kind that they might claim to have against the Bank.\nThe dismissal of the GLAS Trust Lawsuit ended all pending litigation brought against the Bank by GLAS Trust in\nconnection with the Bank's lending relationship with James C. Justice, II and the entities in which he has an interest\n(collectively, the \"Justice Entities\"). Also in connection with the dismissal of the GLAS Trust Lawsuit, the Justice\n1\nEntities executed documents rea\u0000rming the legality, validity and binding nature of all loan documents they have\nexecuted in favor of the Bank.\nThe Company tendered a payment (the \"Settlement Payment\") in consideration of the voluntary dismissal of the\nGLAS Trust Lawsuit. In light of the fact that certain of the Justice Entities had previously agreed to indemnify the\nBank against the claims asserted in the GLAS Trust Lawsuit, certain of the Justice Entities executed a promissory\nnote in favor of the Bank further evidencing this indemni\u0000cation obligation as related to the Settlement Payment.\nThis promissory note was recognized as a principal charge-o\u0000 due to the nonperforming status of the Bank's loans\nwith the Justice Entities, and because the settled claims related to allegedly preferential payments made on those\nnonperforming loans.\nThe Company's \u0000nancial results continue to be signi\u0000cantly impacted by placing loans contained in the Bank's\nOther segment on nonaccrual status during the second quarter of 2023. The Bank's loans to the Justice Entities,\nremain the Bank's largest lending relationship and comprise the signi\u0000cant majority of the Other segment. As a\nresult, interest income was negatively impacted by $8.8 million and $9.3 million during the third quarter of 2024\nand 2023, respectively. Interest income has been negatively impacted by $57.2 million in the aggregate since\nplacement of these loans on nonaccrual status during the second quarter of 2023.\nFinancial Highlights as of and for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nAt September 30, 2024, nonperforming loans declined by $12.5 million to $287.7 million compared to June 30,\n2024. Nonperforming loans to total portfolio loans were 8.00%, 8.46% and 9.04% for the quarters ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The decline in nonperforming loans\nduring the third quarter of 2024 is primarily due to $13.2 million of curtailment payments made by the Bank's\nlargest nonperforming lending relationship;\nThe allowance for credit losses to total portfolio loans were 2.25%, 2.72% and 2.77% at September 30, 2024,\nJune 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease is primarily related to the updated analysis\nof the individually evaluated loans, a $15.0 million charge-o\u0000 related to the Other segment of the loan\nportfolio, and $1.7 million of Other segment speci\u0000c reserves released in connection with $13.2 million of\ncurtailment payments in accordance with the Forbearance Agreement currently in place;\nTotal portfolio loans increased $46.3 million, or 5.2% on an annualized basis, to $3.6 billion at September 30,\n2024 compared to June 30, 2024 and increased $184.9 million, or 5.4%, compared to September 30, 2023;\nTotal deposits increased $203.8 million, or 20.9% on an annualized basis, compared to June 30, 2024 and\nincreased $525.5 million, or 14.8%, compared to September 30, 2023 of which $100.5 million were new\n2\nbrokered certi\u0000cates of deposit (\"CDs\") in the third quarter of 2024;\nFederal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") borrowings decreased $148.0 million to $90.0 million at September 30,\n2024 as compared to June 30, 2024 due to deposit growth;\nNet interest income totaled $28.8 million, an increase of $0.7 million, or 2.5% compared to the prior quarter,\nand an increase of $1.4 million, or 5.1% compared to the year ago period. Net interest margin, on a fully\ntaxable equivalent (\"FTE\") basis3, increased three basis points to 2.59% for the third quarter of 2024,\ncompared to 2.56% for the prior quarter and increased \u0000ve basis points from the year ago quarter. Net\ninterest income and net interest margin continue to be signi\u0000cantly impacted by the Bank's largest lending\nrelationship remaining on nonaccrual status since the second quarter of 2023; and\nThe e\u0000ciency ratio was 80.17%, 81.62% and 83.52% for the quarters ended September 30, 2024, June 30,\n2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The e\u0000ciency ratio was impacted primarily by the Bank's largest\nlending relationship that was placed in nonaccrual status during the second quarter of 2023.\nPositive developments continued in the third quarter with respect to legal actions and our large nonperforming\nrelationship. \"As previously noted, the lawsuit \u0000led by GLAS Trust Company, LLC was voluntarily dismissed with\nprejudice during the third quarter of 2024, and the Justice Entities have continued to curtail their debt owed to the\nBank in accordance with the Forbearance Agreement currently in place. These are favorable outcomes for our\nCompany and represent continued progress towards the ultimate resolution of our large nonperforming\nrelationship. We remain committed to resolving this lending relationship in a manner that best protects the\nCompany, the Bank and shareholders\", stated Litz H. Van Dyke, Chief Executive O\u0000cer.\nVan Dyke continued, \"Although the large nonperforming lending relationship continues to have a negative impact\non our \u0000nancial and credit metrics, aside from this impact, our \u0000nancial performance and asset quality metrics\nremain solid. We continue to feel positive about the fundamentals of the Company and the structure of our balance\nsheet. Capital and liquidity levels continue to be strong, and loan production was solid in the third quarter, although\nmuch of this production was construction lending which has a lag time before it is fully funded and earning interest.\nOur loan production pipeline also remains solid, providing good visibility through year end. Deposit growth is\noccurring in most categories, with the majority of growth coming from increases in interest checking and CD\naccounts. During the third quarter, the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates 50 basis points. We expect an\nimmediate decline in the cost of funds in the fourth quarter from this recent rate cut. Our balance sheet is slightly\nliability sensitive and is well positioned so that a declining interest rate environment should positively impact our\nmargin. We also expect that our net interest margin will return to a more normalized level once the large\nnonperforming lending relationship is fully resolved.\"\n3\nOperating Highlights\nCredit Quality\nNonperforming loans as a percentage of total portfolio loans were 8.00%, 8.46% and 9.04% as of September 30,\n2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, nonperforming loans decreased\n$12.5 million to $287.7 million since June 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to $13.2 million of curtailment\npayments made by the Bank's largest nonperforming lending relationship during the third quarter of 2024.\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company placed commercial loans in the Other segment of the Company's\nloan portfolio relating to the Bank's largest lending relationship with a current aggregate principal amount of $280.9\nmillion on nonaccrual status due to loan maturities and failure to pay in full. This nonperforming relationship\nrepresents 97.6% of total nonperforming loans and 7.8% of total portfolio loans at September 30, 2024.\nDuring the second and third quarters of 2024, $7.8 million and $13.2 million of curtailments, respectively, have\ndecreased the aggregate nonperforming loan balance outstanding to the Bank from $301.9 million at March 31,\n2024 to $280.9 million at September 30, 2024. The Company continues to believe it is well secured based on the net\ncarrying value of the credit relationship and it has appropriately reserved for potential credit losses with respect to\nall such loans based on information currently available. However, the Company cannot give any assurance as to the\ntiming or amount of future payments or collections on such loans or that the Company will ultimately collect all\namounts contractually due under the terms of such loans. The Company has speci\u0000c reserves of $36.9 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024 with respect to such loans as compared to $52.9 million at June 30, 2024. The decline was\ndriven by updated analysis of the credit relationship during the third quarter of 2024 using the discounted cash\n\u0000ow model with updated assumptions and inputs regarding the credit relationship, legal risk and related risks. The\nupdated analysis and the impact on the speci\u0000c reserves contributed to the decrease in the provision for credit\nlosses during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior quarter.\nThe provision for credit losses decreased $0.9 million and $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the\nsecond quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, respectively. The decrease in the provision for credit losses\nas compared to the second quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by the updated analysis of the individually\nevaluated loans and $1.7 million of other segment reserves released due to the aforementioned $13.2 million of\ncurtailment payments during the third quarter of 2024, o\u0000set by loan growth in the third quarter of 2024.\nThe provision for unfunded commitments in the third quarter of 2024 was a provision of $191 thousand compared\nto a recovery of $236 thousand in the second quarter of 2024 and a recovery of $130 thousand in the third quarter\nof 2023. The increase was due to increased commitments in construction loans during the third quarter of 2024.\n4\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income increased $0.7 million to $28.8 million compared to the second quarter of 2024 and increased\n$1.4 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. Net interest margin, on a FTE basis3, increased three basis\npoints to 2.59% compared to the second quarter of 2024 and increased \u0000ve basis points compared to the third\nquarter of 2023. The increase in interest-earning income was primarily due to a 17 basis point increase in the yield\non average loans from 5.26% in the second quarter of 2024 to 5.43% in the third quarter of 2024, as well as a higher\naverage loan balance.\nNet interest margin, on an FTE basis3, continues to be negatively impacted by funding costs. Total interest-bearing\ndeposit costs increased 18 basis points to 3.05% compared to 2.87% in the second quarter of 2024. The higher\ninterest-bearing deposit costs were primarily due to growth in average certi\u0000cates of deposits of $104.0 million and\ninterest-bearing demand of $71.9 million compared to the second quarter of 2024. The increase in deposit costs is\no\u0000set by total average borrowings which decreased $110.1 million to $181.5 million compared to $291.6 million in\nthe second quarter of 2024 due to higher average deposit balances. Total borrowing costs declined 20 basis points\nto 5.00% compared to 5.20% in the second quarter of 2024.\nNet interest income decreased $9.6 million, or 10.1%, to $85.3 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to the same period in 2023, re\u0000ecting the impact of rising rates on funding costs more than\no\u0000setting loan growth and higher loan and securities yields. Net interest margin, on an FTE basis3, decreased 41\nbasis points to 2.59% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.00% for the same period in\n2023. Funding costs increased 104 basis points, o\u0000set by an increase of 43 basis points on the yield on earning\nassets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nThe decline in net interest income and net interest margin were signi\u0000cantly driven by the aforementioned large\nnonperforming lending relationship, which negatively impacted interest income by $27.2 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $20.7 million for the same period in 2023. During the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, $956.0 million of CDs matured and repriced from an average rate of 4.13% to\nan average rate of 4.44%.\nOur balance sheet is currently exhibiting characteristics of a slightly liability sensitive position due to the short-term\nnature of our deposit portfolio and FHLB borrowings. Speci\u0000cally, 82.46% of our CD portfolio and 50.0% of our\noutstanding FHLB borrowings will mature and reprice over the next twelve months. This strategy gives us \u0000exibility\nto manage the structure and pricing of our deposit and borrowing portfolios to reduce future funding costs should\nthe Federal Open Market Committee (\"FOMC\") continue cutting short-term rates in the future.\nNoninterest Income\n5\nFor the third quarter of 2024, total noninterest income was $5.4 million, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 2.0%, from\nthe second quarter of 2024 and an increase of $0.2 million, or 2.9%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. For the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, total noninterest income was $16.0 million, an increase of $1.0 million, or\n6.4%, from the same period in 2023.\nThe decrease of $0.1 million in noninterest income compared to the second quarter of 2024 primarily related to a\ndecrease of $0.2 million in other noninterest income as a result of community development grants received in the\nsecond quarter of 2024, o\u0000set by an increase of $0.1 million in insurance commissions due to higher activity. The\nincreases compared to the third quarter of 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023were also related\nto higher insurance commissions in the current period.\nNoninterest Expense\nFor the third quarter of 2024, total noninterest expense remained \u0000at at $27.4 million compared to the second\nquarter of 2024 and increased $0.2 million, or 0.6% from the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, total noninterest expenses was $81.1 million, an increase of $4.7 million, or 6.2%, from the\nsame period in 2023.\nAs compared to the second quarter of 2024, the signi\u0000cant variances o\u0000set one another with decreases in other\nnoninterest expense and professional and legal fees, o\u0000set by increases in salaries and employee bene\u0000ts,\noccupancy expenses and data processing expenses that net to a decrease of less than $0.1 million.\nTotal noninterest expense increased $0.2 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to similar signi\u0000cant\nvariances to the prior quarter of 2024. The increases in salaries and employee bene\u0000ts resulted from higher salary\nexpenses due to fewer open positions in retail, job grade assessment increases and normal merit increases of $0.6\nmillion. The increase in occupancy expenses, net of $0.4 million was due to new software license and depreciation\nexpense in the third quarter of 2024, and the increase in data processing expenses of $0.3 million relates primarily\nto general in\u0000ationary cost increases for existing and new service agreements. These increases were o\u0000set by\ndecreases of $1.1 million in other noninterest expense related to a gain of $0.5 million on a closed o\u0000ce that was\nsold in the third quarter of 2024, write-downs of $0.6 million on three legacy other real estate owned (\"OREO\")\nproperties and write-downs of $0.2 million on two additional closed o\u0000ces in the third quarter of 2023. The\ndecrease in professional and legal fees related to reimbursement of expenses in connection with the current\nforbearance agreement with the large nonperforming lending relationship.\nThe most signi\u0000cant increases for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in\n2023, included similar variances to the year ago quarter. However, the year-to-date variance was also impacted by\n6\nan increase of $2.1 million in FDIC insurance expense, which was a direct result of the aforementioned large\nnonperforming lending relationship. The similar variances were an increase of $1.8 million in salaries and employee\nbene\u0000ts, an increase of $0.9 million in occupancy expenses, and an increase of $0.6 million in data processing\nexpenses. Debit card expense also increased $0.4 million related to discounts received in March of 2023. O\u0000setting\nthese increases was a $1.6 million decline in other noninterest expenses which include the gains on the sale and\nwrite-downs on OREO properties mentioned above in the third quarter of 2024, but also includes gains of $0.3\nmillion on two other closed o\u0000ces sold in the \u0000rst quarter of 2024, previously written down in the third quarter of\n2023.\nFinancial Condition\nCash and due from banks increased $43.3 million to $105.0 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $61.7\nmillion at June 30, 2024 primarily due to higher excess cash on hand in the third quarter of 2024. The available-for-\nsale securities portfolio decreased $3.7 million and is currently 16.1% of total assets at September 30, 2024\ncompared to 16.5% of total assets at June 30, 2024. The decrease is due to maturities deployed into higher yielding\nloan assets during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nTotal portfolio loans increased $46.3 million, or 5.2% on an annualized basis, to $3.6 billion at September 30, 2024\ncompared to June 30, 2024. The increase in loans primarily related to growth in commercial real estate loans of\n$56.6 million o\u0000set by the aforementioned $13.2 million of curtailment payments compared to June 30, 2024.\nTotal deposits increased $203.8 million, or 20.9% on an annualized basis, to $4.1 billion at September 30, 2024\ncompared to June 30, 2024. Deposits increased primarily due to growth in CDs of $167.9 million, an increase of\n$83.6 million in interest-bearing demand accounts, and an increase of $3.7 million in money market accounts,\no\u0000set by a decrease of $27.0 million in savings accounts, and a decrease of $24.4 million in noninterest-bearing\ndemand accounts. The Company had $216.1 million brokered CDs at September 30, 2024 and $115.6 million at June\n30, 2024, as a result of $100.5 million new brokered CDs.\nFHLB borrowings decreased $148.0 million to $90.0 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $238.0 million at\nJune 30, 2024 primarily due to a decline in overnight borrowings, o\u0000set by $100.5 million of new brokered CDs\nduring the third quarter of 2024, as well as deposit growth.\nAs of September 30, 2024, approximately 82.7% of our total deposits of $4.1 billion were insured under standard\nFDIC insurance coverage limits, and approximately 17.3% of our total deposits were uninsured deposits over the\nstandard FDIC insurance coverage limit. As of June 30, 2024, approximately 82.8% of our total deposits of $3.9\nbillion were insured under standard FDIC insurance coverage limits, and approximately 17.2% of our total deposits\nwere uninsured deposits over the standard FDIC insurance coverage limit.

Forward-looking statements include statements that\nrelate to our financial condition, market conditions, results of operations, plans, objectives, outlook for earnings, revenues, expenses, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality and\nnonaccrual and nonperforming loans. Forward looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as “will likely result,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “intend,” “\nbelieve,” “assume,” “strategy,” “trend,” “plan,” “outlook,” “outcome,” “continue,” “remain,” “potential,” “opportunity,” “comfortable,” “current,” “position,” “maintain,” “sustain,” “seek,” “achieve” and\nvariations of such words and similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as will, would, should, could or may. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve\ncertain risks, uncertainties and assumption that are difficult to predict and often are beyond the Company’s control. Although we believe the assumptions upon which these forward-looking statements are\nbased are reasonable, any of these assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and the forward-looking statements based on these assumptions could be incorrect. The matters discussed in these forward-\nlooking statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results and trends to differ materially from those made, projected, or implied in or by the forward-\nlooking statements including, but not limited to the effects of: market interest rates and the impacts of market interest rates on economic conditions, customer behavior, and the Company’s loan and\nsecurities portfolios; inflation, market and monetary fluctuations; changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws of the U.S. government, including policies of the Federal Reserve, FDIC and Treasury\nDepartment; changes in accounting policies, practices, or guidance, for example, our adoption of Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) methodology, including potential volatility in the Company’s\noperating results due to application of the CECL methodology; cyber-security threats, attacks or events; rapid technological developments and changes; our ability to resolve our nonperforming assets and\nour ability to secure collateral on loans that have entered nonaccrual status due to loan maturities and failure to pay in full; changes in the Company’s liquidity and capital positions; concentrations of loans\nsecured by real estate, particularly commercial real estate, and the potential impacts of changes in market conditions on the value of real estate collateral; increased delinquency and foreclosure rates on\ncommercial real estate loans; an insufficient allowance for credit losses; the potential adverse effects of unusual and infrequently occurring events, such as weather-related disasters, terrorist acts, war and\nother military conflicts (such as the war between Israel and Hamas and the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine) or public health events (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), and of any governmental and\nsocietal responses thereto; these potential adverse effects may include, without limitation, adverse effects on the ability of the Company's borrowers to satisfy their obligations to the Company, on the value\nof collateral securing loans, on the demand for the Company's loans or its other products and services, on incidents of cyberattack and fraud, on the Company’s liquidity or capital positions, on risks posed by\nreliance on third-party service providers, on other aspects of the Company's business operations and on financial markets and economic growth; a change in spreads on interest-earning assets and interest-\nbearing liabilities; regulatory supervision and oversight, including our relationship with regulators and any actions that may be initiated by our regulators; legislation affecting the financial services industry as\na whole, and the Company and the Bank, in particular; the outcome of pending and future litigation and/or governmental proceedings; increasing price and product/service competition; the ability to\ncontinue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis; managing our internal growth and acquisitions; the possibility that the anticipated benefits from acquisitions\ncannot be fully realized in a timely manner or at all, or that integrating acquired operations will be more difficult, disruptive or more costly than anticipated; the soundness of other financial institutions and\nany indirect exposure related to recent large bank failures and their impact on the broader market through other customers, suppliers and partners or that the conditions which resulted in the liquidity\nconcerns with those failed banks may also adversely impact, directly or indirectly, other financial institutions and market participants with which the Company has commercial or deposit relationships with;\nmaterial increases in costs and expenses; reliance on significant customer relationships; general economic or business conditions, including unemployment levels, supply chain disruptions and slowdowns in\neconomic growth; significant weakening of the local economies in which we operate; changes in customer behaviors, including consumer spending, borrowing and saving habits; changes in deposit flows and\nloan demand; our failure to attract or retain key employees; expansions or consolidations in the Company’s branch network, including that the anticipated benefits of the Company’s branch network\noptimization project are not fully realized in a timely manner or at all; deterioration of the housing market and reduced demand for mortgages; and re-emergence of turbulence in significant portions of the\nglobal financial and real estate markets that could impact our performance, both directly, by affecting our revenues and the value of our assets and liabilities, and indirectly, by affecting the economy\ngenerally and access to capital in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support our future businesses. Many of these factors, as well as other factors, are described in our filings with the\nSEC including in the “Risk Factors” section of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Carter Bankshares, Inc. (the “Company”) and its wholly\nowned subsidiary, Carter Bank & Trust (the “Bank”). CB&T Investment Company (the “Investment Company”) is a subsidiary of the Bank. All significant\nintercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nBasis of Presentation: The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (“GAAP”) in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.\nAccordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction\nwith the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), on March 8, 2024. In management’s opinion, the accompanying interim financial information reflects all\nadjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly our financial position and the results of operations for each of the interim\nperiods presented. Results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative to the results of operations that may be expected for a full year or any\nfuture period.\nReclassification: Amounts in prior periods financial statements and footnotes are reclassified whenever necessary to conform to the current period\npresentation. Reclassifications had no material effect on prior periods net income or shareholders’ equity.\nUse of Estimates: To prepare financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information.\nThese estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the disclosures provided, and actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates.\nAccounting Standards Adopted in 2024\nOn June 30, 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of\nEquity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions. The FASB issued this ASU to (1) clarify the guidance in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, when\nmeasuring the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security, (2) amend a related illustrative\nexample, and (3) introduce new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions that are measured at fair value in\naccordance with Topic 820. The amendments in this ASU clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit\nof account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit\nof account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The amendments in this ASU also require the following disclosures for equity securities\nsubject to contractual sale restrictions: (1) the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions reflected in the balance sheet; (2) the nature\nand remaining duration of the restriction(s); and (3) the circumstances that could cause a lapse in the restriction(s). For public business entities, the\namendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this\nASU was effective for the Company on March 31, 2024 but was first applied on June 30, 2024, concurrent with the purchase of equity securities, and did not\nhave a significant impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAccounting Standards Issued but Not Yet Adopted\nOn March 29, 2024 the FASB issued ASU 2024-02, Codification Improvements— Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements, which\namends the Codification to remove references to various concepts statements and impacts a variety of topics in the Codification. The amendments apply to all\nreporting entities within the scope of the affected accounting guidance, but in most instances the references removed are extraneous and not required to\nunderstand or apply the guidance. Generally, the amendments in ASU 2024-02 are not intended to result in significant accounting changes for most entities.\nThe ASU is effective January 1, 2025 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.\n9\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION – (continued)\nOn December 14, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which enhances the required\ndisclosures primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The ASU requires an entity’s income tax rate reconciliation to provide\nadditional information for reconciling items meeting a quantitative threshold, and to disclose certain selected categories within the income tax rate\nreconciliation. The ASU also requires entities to disclose the amount of income taxes paid, disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes. The ASU is\neffective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, though early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this\nguidance on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn November 27, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07. Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which changes\ndisclosures relating to reportable segments. The ASU expands the disclosure requirements relating to reportable segments, including requiring entities to\ndisclose information about a reportable segment’s significant expenses, among other changes. The ASU does not change how an entity identifies reportable\nsegments or the accounting for segments. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within annual\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company has one reporting segment and will not impact our Consolidated\nFinancial Statements; however, this ASU requires disclosure of the title and position of the chief operating decision maker and an explanation of how resources\nare allocated.\nRecently Issued Disclosure Rules\nIn March 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") adopted final rules under SEC Release No. 33-11275, “The Enhancement and\nStandardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors”. This rule will require registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in registration\nstatements and annual reports. In April 2024, the SEC issued an order staying this rule pending the outcome of the federal court litigation challenging the rule.\nSubject to the outcome of this litigation, the disclosure requirements of the final rule will start to phase-in commencing with the Company's fiscal year\nbeginning January 1, 2026.\nNOTE 2 – EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE\nBasic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of\ncommon stock outstanding, less average participating shares during the period. Diluted earnings per common share reflects the potential dilution that could\noccur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that\nthen shared in the earnings of the entity.\nThe following table reconciles the numerators and denominators of basic and diluted earnings per common share calculations for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in Thousands, except share and per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator for Earnings per Common Share – Basic and Diluted\nNet Income $ 5,629 $ 3,627 $ 16,243 $ 25,272\nLess: Income allocated to participating shares 58 33 165 208\nNet Income Allocated to Common Shareholders - Basic & Diluted $ 5,571 $ 3,594 $ 16,078 $ 25,064\nDenominator:\nWeighted Average Shares Outstanding, including Shares Considered Participating Securities 23,072,376 23,157,563 23,043,705 23,600,946\nLess: Average Participating Securities 239,757 211,384 233,591 193,875\nWeighted Average Common Shares Outstanding - Basic & Diluted 22,832,619 22,946,179 22,810,114 23,407,071\nEarnings per Common Share – Basic $ 0.24 $ 0.16 $ 0.70 $ 1.07\nEarnings per Common Share – Diluted $ 0.24 $ 0.16 $ 0.70 $ 1.07\n10\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 3 - INVESTMENT SECURITIES\nThe following tables present the amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale securities as of the dates presented:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nGross Gross\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized\n(Dollars in Thousands) Cost Gains Losses Fair Value\nU.S. Government Agency Securities 27,986 51 (562) 27,475\nResidential Mortgage-Backed Securities 107,515 7 (8,713) 98,809\nCommercial Mortgage-Backed Securities 23,524 55 (538) 23,041\nOther Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities 24,097 — (1,830) 22,267\nAsset Backed Securities 128,726 13 (7,593) 121,146\nCollateralized Mortgage Obligations 165,377 16 (8,975) 156,418\nStates and Political Subdivisions 262,960 — (31,788) 231,172\nCorporate Notes 70,750 — (8,443) 62,307\nTotal Debt Securities $ 810,935 $ 142 $ (68,442) $ 742,635\nDecember 31, 2023\nGross Gross\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized\n(Dollars in Thousands) Cost Gains Losses Fair Value\nU.S. Government Agency Securities 44,185 398 (756) 43,827\nResidential Mortgage-Backed Securities 110,726 — (11,576) 99,150\nCommercial Mortgage-Backed Securities 31,578 336 (751) 31,163\nOther Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities 24,522 — (2,666) 21,856\nAsset Backed Securities 150,832 — (10,826) 140,006\nCollateralized Mortgage Obligations 174,396 — (12,863) 161,533\nStates and Political Subdivisions 263,557 — (41,449) 222,108\nCorporate Notes 70,750 — (11,390) 59,360\nTotal Debt Securities $ 870,546 $ 734 $ (92,277) $ 779,003\nThe Company did not have securities classified as held-to-maturity at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nThe following table shows the composition of gross and net realized gains and losses for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in Thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nProceeds from Sales of Securities Available-for-Sale $ — $ — $ 10,617 $ 15,054\nGross Realized Gains $ — $ — $ 36 $ 129\nGross Realized Losses — (1) — (139)\nNet Realized (Losses) Gains — (1) 36 (10)\nTax Impact $ — $ — $ 8 $ (2)\nGains or losses are recognized in earnings on the trade date using the amortized cost of the specific security sold.

The Company regularly reviews debt securities for expected credit loss using both qualitative and quantitative criteria, as necessary,\nbased on the composition of the portfolio at period end.\nAs of September 30, 2024, management does not intend to sell any security in an unrealized loss position and it is not more than likely that it will be required\nto sell any such security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. The unrealized losses on debt securities are primarily the result of interest rate changes,\ncredit spread fluctuations, general financial market uncertainty and market volatility. These conditions should not prohibit the Company from receiving its\ncontractual principal and interest payments on its debt securities. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing\ndate. It should be noted that we may occasionally sell securities to take advantage of market opportunities or as part of a strategic initiative.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company determined the unrealized losses detailed in the table above are not related to credit; therefore, no ACL has been\nrecognized on the Company’s securities. Should the impairment of any of these securities become credit related, the impairment will be recognized by\nestablishing an ACL through provision for credit losses in the period the credit related impairment is identified, while any non-credit loss will be recognized in\naccumulated other comprehensive loss, net of applicable taxes. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the\nCompany had no credit related net investment impairment losses.\nEquity Securities\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company purchased $5.0 million of equity securities with carrying value totaling $5.2 million at September 30, 2024.\nThese securities are separately reported as “equity securities” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The equity securities consist of our investment\nin a market-rate bond mutual fund that invests in high quality fixed income bonds, mainly government agency securities whose proceeds are designed to\npositively impact community development throughout the United States. The mutual fund focuses exclusively on providing affordable housing to low- and\nmoderate-income borrowers and renters, including those in Majority Minority Census Tracts. The Company’s investment in the mutual fund is eligible for\ninvestment credit under the Community Reinvestment Act.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized an unrealized fair value gain of $181.5 thousand and $207.1 thousand,\nrespectively, on these equity securities. This unrealized fair value gain is recorded in Other Income on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nNOTE 4 – LOANS\nThe composition of the loan portfolio by dollar amount is shown in the table below:\n(Dollars in Thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCommercial\nCommercial Real Estate $ 1,857,997 $ 1,670,631\nCommercial and Industrial 241,474 271,511\nTotal Commercial Loans 2,099,471 1,942,142\nConsumer\nResidential Mortgages 782,930 787,929\nOther Consumer 29,813 34,277\nTotal Consumer Loans 812,743 822,206\nConstruction 399,502 436,349\nOther 284,145 305,213\nTotal Portfolio Loans 3,595,861 3,505,910\nLoans Held-for-Sale 390 —\nTotal Loans $ 3,596,251 $ 3,505,910\n13\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 4 – LOANS (continued)\nLoan Restructurings\nThe Company evaluates all loan restructurings in accordance with ASU 2022-02 for loan modifications to determine if the restructuring results in a new loan or\na continuation of the existing loan. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that result in a direct change in the timing or amount of\ncontractual cash flows include situations where there is principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant payment delays, term extensions,\nand combinations of the listed modifications. Therefore, the disclosures related to loan restructurings are only for modifications that directly affect cash flows.\nA loan that is considered a restructured loan may be subject to the individually evaluated loan analysis if the commitment is $1.0 million or greater and/or\nbased on management’s discretion; otherwise, the restructured loan remains in the appropriate segment in the ACL model.

For purposes of this disclosure, a default occurs when, within 12\nmonths of the original modification, either a full or partial charge-off occurs or the loan becomes 90 days or more past due.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank had zero and $2.0 million, respectively, of loans in the process of foreclosure.\nNOTE 5 – ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe Company maintains an ACL at a level determined to be adequate to absorb expected credit losses associated with the Company’s financial instruments\nover the life of those instruments as of the balance sheet date. The Company develops and documents a systematic ACL methodology based on the following\nportfolio segments: 1) Commercial Real Estate (“CRE”), 2) Commercial and Industrial, (“C&I”), 3) Residential Mortgages, 4) Other Consumer, 5)\nConstruction and 6) Other. The Company’s loan portfolio is segmented by homogeneous loan types that behave similarly to economic cycles. The following is\na discussion of the key risks by portfolio segment that management assesses in preparing the ACL.\nCRE loans are secured by commercial purpose real estate, including both owner occupied properties and investment properties, for various purposes such as\nhotels, strip malls and apartments. Operations of the individual projects as well as global cash flows of the debtors are the primary sources of repayment for\nthese loans. The condition of the local economy is an important indicator of risk, but there are also more specific risks depending on the collateral type as well\nas the business.\nC&I loans are made to operating companies or manufacturers for the purpose of production, operating capacity, accounts receivable, inventory or equipment\nfinancing. Cash flow from the operations of the borrower is the primary source of repayment for these loans. The condition of the local economy is an\nimportant indicator of risk, but there are also more specific risks depending on the industry of the borrower. Collateral for these types of loans often do not have\nsufficient value in a distressed or liquidation scenario to satisfy the outstanding debt. These loans are also made to local and state municipalities for various\npurposes including refinancing existing obligations, infrastructure up-fit and expansion, or to purchase new equipment. These loans may be secured by general\nobligations from the municipal authority or revenues generated by infrastructure and equipment financed by the Company. The primary repayment source for\nthese loans include the tax base of the municipality, specific revenue streams related to the infrastructure financed, and other business operations of the\nmunicipal authority. The health and stability of state and local economies directly impacts each municipality’s tax basis and are important indicators of\n16\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 5 – ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (continued)\nrisk for this segment. The ability of each municipality to increase taxes and fees to offset debt service requirements give this type of loan a very low risk profile\nin the continuum of the Company’s loan portfolio.\nResidential Mortgages are loans secured by first and second liens such as home equity loans, home equity lines of credit and 1-4 family residential mortgages,\nincluding purchased money mortgages. The primary source of repayment for these loans is the income of the borrower. The condition of the local economy, in\nparticular the unemployment rate, is an important indicator of risk for this segment. The state of the local housing market can also have a significant impact on\nthis segment because low demand and/or declining home values can limit the ability of borrowers to sell a property and satisfy the debt.\nOther Consumer loans are made to individuals and may be either secured by assets other than 1-4 family residences or unsecured. This segment includes auto\nloans and unsecured loans and lines. The primary source of repayment for these loans is the income and assets of the borrower. The condition of the local\neconomy, in particular the unemployment rate, is an important indicator of risk for this segment. The value of the collateral, if there is any, is less likely to be a\nsource of repayment due to less certain collateral values.\nConstruction loans include both commercial and consumer. Commercial loans are made to finance construction of buildings or other structures, as well as to\nfinance the acquisition and development of raw land for various purposes. While the risk of these loans is generally confined to the construction period, if there\nare problems, the project may not be completed, and as such, may not provide sufficient cash flow on its own to service the debt or have sufficient value in a\nliquidation to cover the outstanding principal. The condition of the local economy is an important indicator of risk, but there are also more specific risks\ndepending on the type of project and the experience and resources of the developer. Consumer loans are made for the construction of residential homes for\nwhich a binding sales contract exists and generally are for a period of time sufficient to complete construction. Residential construction loans to individuals\ngenerally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase. Credit risk for residential real estate construction loans can arise from\nconstruction delays, cost overruns, failure of the contractor to complete the project to specifications and economic conditions that could impact demand for or\nsupply of the property being constructed.\nOther loans, which includes the Company’s largest lending relationship, has unique risk attributes considered inconsistent with our current underwriting\nstandards. The ACL reserve for the Other segment is based on a discounted cash flow methodology and reserves will fluctuate based on expected cash flow\nchanges in the future. These inconsistencies may include, but are not limited to i) transaction and/or relationship sizes that exceed limits established in 2018, ii)\noverreliance on secondary, tertiary or guarantor cash flow, iii) land acquisition loans without a defined source of amortization, iv) loan structures on operating\nlines of credit dependent on the value of real estate rather than trading assets, and v) indirect liabilities of certain guarantees resulting from the nonpayment of\nfinancial obligations. Management continuously assesses underwriting standards, but significantly enhanced these standards in 2018.\nCurrent Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) Model\nThe CECL model is based on our best estimate of facts known with the most current information. Certain portions of the CECL model are inherently subjective\nand include, but are not limited to estimates with respect to: prepayment speeds, the timing of prepayments, potential losses given default, discount rates and\nthe timing of future cash flows. Management utilizes widely published economic forecasts as the basis for the regression analysis used to estimate the\nprobability of default in the baseline model. The peaks and troughs of these forecasts serve as guardrails for potential subjective adjustments. In addition to\nconsidering the outcomes based on the range of forecasts, management recognizes that the assumptions used in economic forecasts may not perfectly align\nwith our market area, risk profile or unique attributes of our portfolio along with other important considerations. Severe changes in forecasts can also create\nsignificant variability and management must assess not only the absolute balance of reserves but also consider the appropriateness of the velocity of change.\nTherefore, management developed a framework to assess the tolerance and reasonableness of the CECL modeling process by challenging certain elements of\nthe forecasts, when appropriate. These outcomes, known as “challenger models,” provide opportunities to examine and subjectively adjust the CECL model\noutput and are designed to be counter cyclical, thereby reducing variability.\nCredit Quality Indicators:\nThe Company’s portfolio grading analysis estimates the capability of the borrower to repay the contractual obligations of the loan agreements as scheduled or\nat all. The Company’s internal credit risk grading system is based on debt service coverage,\n17\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 5 – ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (continued)\ncollateral values and other subjective factors. Mortgage and consumer loans are defaulted to a pass grade until a loan migrates to past due status.\nThe Company has a loan review policy and annual scope report that details the level of loan review for loans in a given year. The annual loan review provides\nthe Credit Risk Committee with an independent analysis of the following: 1) credit quality of the loan portfolio, 2) compliance with the loan policy, 3)\nadequacy of documentation in credit files and 4) validity of risk ratings. Since 2020 and continuing through 2024, the Company used a five step approach for\nloan review in the following categories:\n• Individual reviews of the top twenty large loan relationships (“LLRs”), which are defined as any individual commercial loan or aggregate commercial\nrelationship totaling $2.0 million or more;\n• A sampling of small LLRs, which are defined as individual commercial loans or relationships with aggregate exposure of $2.0 million or more but not\nincluded in the top twenty LLRs;\n• A sampling review of Executive Loan Committee modifications, including new and existing loans to provide perspective on the appropriateness of the\nmodification in relation to established policies and procedures;\n• A sampling review of non-organic commercial loans and those commercial loans approved outside of the Executive Loan Committee; and\n• Focus reviews of various segments to evaluate emerging risk rather than individual loan risk. Focus reviews are performed annually on a rotational\nbasis.\nThe Company’s internally assigned grades are as follows:\nPass – The Company uses six grades of pass, including its watch rating. Generally, a pass rating indicates that the loan is currently performing and is\nof high quality.\nSpecial Mention – Assets with potential weaknesses that warrant management’s close attention and if left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses\nmay result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution’s credit position at some future date.\nSubstandard – Assets that are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged, if\nany. Assets so classified have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Such assets are characterized by the\ndistinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\nDoubtful – Assets with all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or\nliquidation in full, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.\nLoss – Assets considered of such little value that its continuance on the books is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has\nabsolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial\nrecovery may be affected in the future.\nThe ability of borrowers to repay commercial loans is dependent upon the success of their business and general economic conditions. Due to the greater\npotential for loss within our commercial portfolio, we monitor the commercial loan portfolio through an internal risk rating system. Loan risk ratings are\nassigned based upon the creditworthiness of the borrower and are reviewed on an ongoing basis according to our internal policies. Loans rated special mention\nor substandard have potential or well-defined weaknesses not generally found in high quality, performing loans, and require attention from management to\nlimit loss.\n18\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 5 – ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (continued)\nThe following table presents loan balances by year

we transfer the interest methodology from accrual to nonaccrual. Nonaccrual status recognizes that the collection in\nfull of both principal and interest is unlikely. Without applying additional scrutiny at a granular level, management believes delinquency to be a leading\nindicator with respect to the likelihood of collection in full of both principal and interest. Accordingly, management automatically transfers loans to nonaccrual\nstatus if they are 90 or more days’ delinquent. Management reserves the right to exercise discretion at the individual loan level. For example, we may elect to\ntransfer a loan to nonaccrual regardless of the delinquency status if we believe the collection in full of both principal and interest to be unlikely. We may also\nelect to retain a loan that is 90 or more days’ delinquent in accrual status if we believe the loan is well secured and in the process of collection.

Securities available-for-sale, equity\nsecurities, loans and derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, we may be required to\nrecord other assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as loans held-for-sale, individually evaluated loans, OREO, and certain other assets.\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement date. An orderly transaction is a transaction that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the\nmeasurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets or liabilities; it is not a forced\ntransaction. In determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches, including market, income and cost approaches. The fair value standard establishes\na hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that\nobservable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, which are developed\nbased on market data we have obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs reflect our estimates of assumptions that market participants would use\nin pricing an asset or liability, which are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement)\nand the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that an entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date, or\nobservable inputs.\nLevel 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that\nare not active, and other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect an entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an\nasset or liability.\nA financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. We recognize\ntransfers between any of the fair value hierarchy levels at the end of the reporting period in which the transfer occurred.\nThe following are descriptions of the valuation methodologies that the Company uses for financial instruments recorded at fair value on either a recurring or\nnonrecurring basis.\nRecurring Basis\nSecurities Available-for-Sale: The fair values of securities available-for-sale are determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities\nexchanges, if available. This valuation method is classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair\nvalues are calculated on market prices of similar securities, or matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique, used widely in the industry to value debt\nsecurities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted\nsecurities. Matrix pricing relies on the securities’ relationship to similarly traded securities, benchmark curves, and the benchmarking of like securities. Matrix\npricing utilizes observable market inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark\nsecurities, bids, offers, reference data, and industry and economic events. In instances where broker quotes are used, these quotes are obtained from market\nmakers or broker-dealers recognized to be market participants. This valuation method is classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. For securities where\nquoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators. This\nvaluation method is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n26\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 6 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (continued)\nEquity Securities: The fair values of equity securities are determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized or foreign securities exchanges, if\navailable. This valuation method is classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. As of September 30, 2024, Level 1 fair values are available for each of the\nCompany’s equity securities.\nDerivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities: The Company uses derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps for commercial loans with our\ncustomers. Upon entering into swaps with the borrower, the Company entered into offsetting positions with counterparties to minimize risk to the Company.\nThe back-to-back swaps qualify as derivatives, but are not designated as hedging instruments. Interest rate swap contracts involve the risk of dealing with\nborrower and counterparties and their ability to meet contractual terms. We calculate the fair value for derivatives using accepted valuation techniques,\nincluding discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. Each valuation considers the contractual terms of the derivative,\nincluding the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, such as interest rate curves and implied volatilities. When the fair value of a\nderivative instrument contract is positive, this generally indicates that the counterparty or customer owes the Company, and results in credit risk to the\nCompany. When the fair value of a derivative instrument contract is negative, the Company owes the customer or counterparty, and, therefore, has no risk.\nAccordingly, interest rate swaps for commercial loans are classified as Level 2.\nThe Company also enters into commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding (rate lock\ncommitments). Rate lock commitments on mortgage loans to be held-for-sale are considered to be derivatives. The period of time between issuance of a loan\ncommitment and closing and sale of the loan generally ranges from 15 to 90 days. The Company protects itself from changes in interest rates through the use of\nbest efforts forward delivery commitments, whereby the Company commits to sell a loan at the time the borrower commits to an interest rate with the intent\nthat the buyer has assumed interest rate risk on rate lock commitments due to changes in interest rates.\nNonrecurring Basis\nIndividually Evaluated Loans: Individually evaluated loans with commitments of $1.0 million or greater and/or based on management’s discretion are\nevaluated for potential specific reserves and adjusted, if a shortfall exists, to fair value less costs to sell. Fair value is measured based on the value of the\nunderlying collateral securing the loan if repayment is expected solely from the sale or operation of the collateral or present value of estimated future cash\nflows discounted at the loan’s contractual interest rate if the loan is not determined to be collateral dependent. All loans with a specific reserve are classified as\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nFair value for individually evaluated loans is determined using several methods. Generally, the fair value of real estate is determined based on appraisals by\nqualified licensed appraisers. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the\nincome approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income\ndata available. These routine adjustments are made to adjust the value of a specific property relative to comparable properties for variations in qualities such as\nlocation, size, and income production capacity relative to the subject property of the appraisal. Such adjustments are typically significant and result in a Level 3\nclassification of the inputs for determining fair value.\nSubsequent to the initial impairment date, existing individually evaluated loans are reevaluated quarterly for additional impairment and adjustments to fair\nvalue less costs to sell are made, where appropriate. For individually evaluated loans, the first stage of our impairment analysis involves inspection of the\nproperty in question to affirm the condition has not deteriorated since the previous impairment analysis date. Management also engages in conversations with\nlocal real estate professionals and market participants to determine the likely marketing time and value range for the property. The second stage involves an\nassessment of current trends in the regional market. After thorough consideration of these factors, management will order a new appraisal.\nFor non-collateral dependent loans, the fair value is determined by updating the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan’s existing rate to\nreflect the payment schedule for the remaining life of the loan.\nOREO is evaluated at the time of acquisition and is recorded at fair value as determined by an appraisal or evaluation, less costs to sell. After acquisition, most\nOREO assets are revalued every twelve months, or more frequently when deemed necessary by management based upon changes in market or collateral\nconditions. For smaller OREO assets with existing carrying values less than $0.5 million, management may elect to re-value the assets, at minimum, once\nevery twenty-four months based on the size of the exposure. Fair value, when recorded, is generally based upon appraisals by approved, independent state\ncertified\n27\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 6 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (continued)\nappraisers. Appraisals on OREO may be discounted based on our historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of appraisal or other\ninformation available to us. OREO and other repossessed assets marked to fair value are classified as Level 3. At September 30, 2024 OREO assets were in\ncompliance with the OREO policy as set forth above, and substantially all of the assets were listed for sale with credible third-party real estate brokers.\nFinancial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below for the periods presented:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant Other Significant\nCarrying Identical Assets Observable Inputs Unobservable Inputs\n(Dollars in Thousands) Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets\nSecurities Available-for-Sale:\nU.S. Government Agency Securities 27,475 — 27,475 —\nResidential Mortgage-Backed Securities 98,809 — 98,809 —\nCommercial Mortgage-Backed Securities 23,041 — 23,041 —\nOther Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities 22,267 — 22,267 —\nAsset Backed Securities 121,146 — 121,146 —\nCollateralized Mortgage Obligations 156,418 — 156,418 —\nStates and Political Subdivisions 231,172 — 231,172 —\nCorporate Notes 62,307 — 54,720 7,587\nTotal Securities Available-for-Sale 742,635 — 735,048 7,587\nEquity Securities 5,207 5,207 — —\nPortfolio Loan Pool Subject to Fair Value Hedge 8,484 — 8,484 —\nDerivatives 13,756 — 13,756 —\nTotal $ 770,082 $ 5,207 $ 757,288 $ 7,587\nLiabilities\nDerivatives $ 21,765 $ — $ 21,765 $ —\nTotal $ 21,765 $ — $ 21,765 $ —\nDecember 31, 2023\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant Other Significant\nCarrying Identical Assets Observable Inputs Unobservable Inputs\n(Dollars in Thousands) Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets\nSecurities Available-for-Sale:\nU.S. Government Agency Securities 43,827 — 43,827 —\nResidential Mortgage-Backed Securities 99,150 — 99,150 —\nCommercial Mortgage-Backed Securities 31,163 — 31,163 —\nOther Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities 21,856 — 21,856 —\nAsset Backed Securities 140,006 — 140,006 —\nCollateralized Mortgage Obligations 161,533 — 161,533 —\nStates and Political Subdivisions 222,108 — 222,108 —\nCorporate Notes 59,360 — 52,041 7,319\nTotal Securities Available-for-Sale 779,003 — 771,684 7,319\nDerivatives 17,440 — 17,440 —\nTotal $ 796,443 $ — $ 789,124 $ 7,319\nLiabilities\nDerivatives $ 17,228 $ — $ 17,228 $ —\nTotal $ 17,228 $ — $ 17,228 $ —\nWe have invested in subordinated debt of other financial institutions.

Interest rate swaps are contracts in which a series of interest rate flows (fixed and variable) are exchanged over a prescribed period.\nThe notional amounts on which the interest payments are based are not exchanged. These derivative positions relate to transactions in which the Company\nenters into an interest rate swap with a commercial customer while at the same time entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with another financial\ninstitution, or counterparty. In connection with each transaction, the Company originates a floating rate loan to the customer at a notional amount. In turn, the\ncustomer contracts with the counterparty to swap the stream of cash flows associated with the floating interest rate loan with the Company for a stream of fixed\ninterest rate cash flows based on the same notional amount as the Company’s loan. The transaction allows the customer to effectively convert a variable rate\nloan to a fixed rate loan with the Company receiving a variable rate. These agreements could have floors or caps on the contracted interest rates.\nEffective July 11, 2024, the Company entered into two related pay-fixed/receive-floating interest rate swaps (the “Pay-Fixed Swap Agreements”) for a\ncombined notional amount of $300.0 million with a combined fair value of $8.1 million at September 30, 2024. The Pay-Fixed Swap Agreements were\ndesignated as fair value hedges in order to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of the fixed rate loans included in the amortizing single family mortgages\nand CRE loans. These fair value hedges convert the hedged loans from a fixed rate to a synthetic floating Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). The\nfirst Pay-Fixed Swap Agreement with a notional value of $125.0 million matures on July 11, 2027 and the Company will pay a fixed coupon rate of 4.188%\nwhile receiving the overnight SOFR. The second Pay-Fixed Swap Agreement with a notional value of $175.0 million matures on July 11, 2029 (but includes\npartial amortization beginning July 11, 2027) and the Company will pay a fixed coupon rate of 4.004% while receiving the overnight SOFR.\nAs long as a hedging instrument is designated and the results of the effectiveness testing support that the instrument qualifies for hedge accounting treatment,\n100% of the periodic changes in fair value of the hedging instrument are accounted for in net interest income. The fair value of these hedges is recorded in\neither other assets or in other liabilities depending on the position of the hedge, and the offset is recorded in loans. This is the case whether or not economic\nmismatches exist in the hedging relationship. As a result, there is no periodic measurement or recognition of ineffectiveness. Rather, the full impact of hedge\ngains and losses is recognized in the period in which the hedged transactions impact earnings. The hedges were determined to be effective during all periods\npresented and the Company expects them to remain effective during the remaining terms.\nPursuant to agreements with various financial institutions, the Company may receive collateral or may be required to post collateral based upon mark-to-market\npositions. Beyond unsecured threshold levels, collateral in the form of cash or securities may be made available to counterparties of interest rate swap\ntransactions. Based upon current positions and related future collateral requirements relating to them, management believes any effect on our cash flow or\nliquidity position to be immaterial.\nDerivatives contain an element of credit risk, the possibility that the Company will incur a loss because a counterparty, which may be a financial institution or a\ncustomer, fails to meet its contractual obligations. All derivative contracts with financial institutions may be executed only with counterparties approved by the\nAsset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”) and all derivatives with customers are approved by a team of members from senior management who have been\ntrained to understand the risk associated with interest rate swaps and have past industry experience. Interest rate swaps are considered derivatives but are not\naccounted for using hedge accounting. As such, changes in the estimated fair value of the derivatives are recorded in current earnings in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income.\n31\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 7 – DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES – (continued)\nThe following table indicates the amounts representing the fair value of derivative assets and derivative liabilities at the dates presented:\nFair Value of Derivative Assets\n(Included in Other Assets)\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nNumber of Notional Number of Notional\n(Dollars in Thousands) Transactions Amount Fair Value Transactions Amount Fair Value\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\nInterest Rate Swaps - Balance Sheet Hedge — $ — $ — — $ — $ —\nTotal Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments — $ — $ — — $ — $ —\nDerivatives not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nInterest Rate Lock Commitments – Mortgage Loans 5 $ 1,266 $ 2 3 $ 620 $ 3\nInterest Rate Swap Contracts – Commercial Loans 56 372,232 13,754 58 387,144 17,437\nTotal Derivatives not Designated as Hedging Instruments 61 $ 373,498 $ 13,756 61 $ 387,764 $ 17,440\nTotal Derivatives 61 $ 373,498 $ 13,756 61 $ 387,764 $ 17,440\nFair Value of Derivative Liabilities\n(Included in Other Liabilities)\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nNumber of Notional Number of Notional\n(Dollars in Thousands) Transactions Amount Fair Value Transactions Amount Fair Value\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\nInterest Rate Swaps - Balance Sheet Hedge 2 $ 300,000 $ 8,109 — $ — $ —\nTotal Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments 2 $ 300,000 $ 8,109 — $ — $ —\nDerivatives not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nForward Sale Contracts – Mortgage Loans 5 $ 1,266 $ 2 3 $ 620 $ 3\nInterest Rate Swap Contracts – Commercial Loans 56 372,232 13,654 58 387,144 17,225\nTotal Derivatives not Designated as Hedging Instruments 61 $ 373,498 $ 13,656 61 $ 387,764 $ 17,228\nTotal Derivatives 63 $ 673,498 $ 21,765 61 $ 387,764 $ 17,228\n32\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 7 – DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES – (continued)\nThe following table indicates the (loss) income recognized on derivatives for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in Thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\nInterest Rate Swaps - Balance Sheet Hedge $ 103 $ — $ 103 $ —\nTotal Derivative Income Designated as Hedging Instruments $ 103 $ — $ 103 $ —\nDerivatives not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nInterest Rate Lock Commitments – Mortgage Loans $ (3) $ (1) $ (1) $ 4\nForward Sale Contracts – Mortgage Loans 3 1 1 (4)\nInterest Rate Swap Contracts – Commercial Loans (128) 234 (112) 90\nTotal Derivative (Loss) Income not Designated as Hedging Instruments $ (128) $ 234 $ (112) $ 90\nTotal Derivative (Loss) Income $ (25) $ 234 $ (9) $ 90\nPresenting offsetting derivatives that are subject to legally enforceable netting arrangements with the same party is permitted.

The Company had $90.0 million Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) borrowings at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and $393.4 million at December 31, 2023. FHLB borrowings are fixed rate advances for various terms and are secured by a blanket lien on\nselect residential mortgages, select multifamily loans, and select commercial real estate loans. Variable rate FHLB borrowings were 0.0% and 5.6% of total\nborrowings at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Total loans pledged as collateral were $1.6 billion at September 30, 2024 and\n$1.5 billion at December 31, 2023. There were no securities available-for-sale pledged as collateral at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nAt September 30, 2024, funding sources accessible to the Company include borrowing availability at the FHLB, equal to 25.0% of the Company’s assets or\napproximately $1.2 billion, subject to the amount of eligible collateral pledged, of which the Company is eligible to borrow up to an additional $791.4 million.\nThe Company has unsecured facilities with three other correspondent financial institutions totaling $30.0 million at September 30, 2024 and $50.0 million at\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively, a fully secured facility with one other correspondent financial institution totaling $45.0 million, and access to the institutional\ncertificate of deposit (“CD”) and brokered deposit markets. The Company did not have outstanding borrowings on these fed funds lines as of September 30,\n2024 or December 31, 2023. The Company had the capacity to borrow up to an additional $480.3 million from the FHLB at December 31, 2023.\nThe following table represents the balance of FHLB borrowings and the weighted average interest rate as of the periods presented:\n34\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in Thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nFHLB Borrowings $ 90,000 $ 393,400\nWeighted Average Interest Rate 4.30 % 5.20 %\nFHLB Availability $ 791,403 $ 480,266\nThe following table represents the balance of federal funds purchased and the weighted average interest rate as of the periods presented:\n(Dollars in Thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nFederal Fund Purchased $ — $ —\nWeighted Average Interest Rate — % — %\nFederal Funds Purchased Availability $ 75,000 $ 50,000\nScheduled annual maturities and weighted average interest rates for FHLB borrowings for each of the five years subsequent to September 30, 2024 and\nthereafter are as follows:\nWeighted\n(Dollars in Thousands) Balance Average Rate\n1 year $ 45,000 4.64 %\n2 years 45,000 3.96 %\n3 years — — %\n4 years — — %\n5 years — — %\nThereafter — — %\nTotal FHLB Borrowings $ 90,000 4.30 %\nNOTE 10 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nCommitments to extend credit, which amounted to $799.8 million at September 30, 2024 and $702.3 million at December 31, 2023, represent agreements to\nlend to customers with fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. The Company provides lines of credit to our clients to finance the completion of\nconstruction projects and revolving lines of credit to operating companies to finance their working capital needs. Lines of credit for construction projects\nrepresented $435.3 million, or 54.4% and $452.2 million, or 64.4%, of the commitments to extend credit at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company guaranteeing the performance of a customer to a third-party. Those\nguarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling $18.2 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and $19.6 million at December 31, 2023.\nThe following table sets forth our commitments and letters of credit as of the dates presented:\n(Dollars in Thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCommitments to Extend Credit $ 799,808 $ 702,301\nStandby and Performance Letters of Credit 18,244 19,643\nTotal $ 818,052 $ 721,944\nOur exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters\nof credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and unconditional\nobligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Unless noted otherwise, collateral or other security is required to support financial instruments with\ncredit risk.\nLife-of-Loss Reserve on Unfunded Loan Commitments\nWe maintain a life-of-loss reserve on unfunded commercial lending commitments and letters of credit to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these\narrangements. The life-of-loss reserve is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine\n35\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 10 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES – (continued)\nthe ACL for loans, modified to take into account the probability of a draw-down on the commitment. The life-of-loan reserve for unfunded commitments is\nincluded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table presents activity in the life-of-loss reserve on unfunded loan commitments as of and for the dates presented:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in Thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nLife-of-Loss Reserve on Unfunded Loan Commitments\nBalance at Beginning of Period $ 2,914 $ 2,736 $ 3,193 $ 2,292\nProvision (Recovery) for Unfunded Commitments 191 (130) (88) 314\nBalance at End of Period $ 3,105 $ 2,606 $ 3,105 $ 2,606\nAmounts are added or subtracted to the reserve for unfunded commitments through a charge or credit to current earnings in the provision (recovery) for\nunfunded commitments. A provision of $0.2 million was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which resulted in an increase of $0.3 million\ncompared to a recovery of $(0.1) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the provision (recovery) for unfunded commitments\nwas primarily due to an increase in construction commitments.\nLegal Proceedings\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various legal and administrative proceedings and claims. Legal and administrative proceedings are\nsubject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur, and the timing and outcome of any legal or administrative proceeding cannot be predicted\nwith certainty. Further, estimating an amount or range of possible losses that may result from legal or administrative proceedings and claims is inherently\ndifficult and requires an extensive degree of judgment, particularly where the matters involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages, may involve awards\nthat are discretionary in amount, present novel legal theories or policies, are in the early stages of the proceedings, or are subject to appeal. In addition, because\nlegal proceedings may be resolved over an extended period of time, potential losses are subject to change due to the outcome of intermediate procedural and\nsubstantive rulings, actions by other parties which may be influenced by their settlement posture or their evaluation of the strength or weakness of their case,\nand other factors.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company is not involved in any other material pending legal proceedings other than proceedings occurring in the ordinary\ncourse of business.\nGLAS Federal Court Litigation\nOn February 12, 2024, the Bank was named as a defendant in a lawsuit (the “GLAS Federal Court Litigation”) filed in the United States District Court for the\nWestern District of Virginia by GLAS Trust Company LLC (“GLAS”). The allegations contained in the GLAS Federal Court Litigation relate to a series of\nfinancing transactions that occurred in 2018 between Bluestone Resources, Inc. (“Bluestone Resources”), its subsidiary Bluestone Coal Sales Corporation\n(“Bluestone Sales”, and together with Bluestone Resources and their respective affiliates, the “Bluestone Entities”), and Greensill (UK) Limited, Ltd.\n(“Greensill”). The Bluestone Entities are owned and controlled by James C. Justice, II and James C. Justice, III. In the GLAS Federal Court Litigation, GLAS\nalleged that it serves as trustee for investors that acquired notes via a series of securities transactions that repackaged the Bluestone Entities’ obligations to\nrepay Greensill and sold them to those investors. In the GLAS Federal Court Litigation, GLAS alleged that certain transfers to the Bank executed during 2018\nby the Bluestone Entities or Greensill, which in the aggregate totaled approximately $226 million, each constitute either a fraudulent conveyance, or a\nvoluntary conveyance, under Virginia law. In the GLAS Federal Court Litigation, GLAS sought an award equal to the full amount of such fraudulent\nconveyances and/or voluntary conveyances plus interest and payment of attorneys’ fees and costs.\nOn August 28, 2024, the Bank announced that it had agreed to a settlement with GLAS (the “GLAS Settlement”). In connection with the GLAS Settlement, the\nGLAS Federal Court Litigation was dismissed with prejudice, certain entities that are owned or controlled by James C. Justice, II, Cathy L. Justice and James\nC. Justice, III (each, a “Justice Entity” and collectively, the “Justice Entities”) executed documents reaffirming the legality, validity and binding nature of all\nloan documents they have executed and judgments granted in favor of the Bank, and GLAS and certain affiliates and parties on whose behalf GLAS was acting\nhave executed a release that waives any and all causes of action of any kind that they might claim to have against the Bank.\n36\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 10 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES – (continued)\nAlso in connection with the GLAS Settlement, the Company tendered a payment (the “Settlement Payment”) in consideration of the voluntary dismissal of the\nGLAS Federal Court Litigation. Because certain of the Justice Entities had previously agreed to indemnify the Bank against the claims asserted in the GLAS\nFederal Court Litigation, certain of the Justice Entities executed a promissory note in favor of the Bank further evidencing this indemnification obligation as\nrelated to the Settlement Payment. This promissory note was recognized as a principal charge-off during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the\nnonperforming status of the Bank’s loans with the Justice Entities, and because the settled claims asserted in the GLAS Federal Court Litigation related to\nallegedly preferential payments made on those nonperforming loans.

On March 29, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase\nprogram (the “2023 Program”) which took effect starting May 1, 2023, after the expiration of the previous repurchase program (the “2022 Program”), which\nwas originally authorized through August 1, 2023, but was fully exhausted as of March 10, 2023. The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of\n1,000,000 shares of common stock under the 2023 Program and on August 31, 2023 reached the maximum number of shares that could be purchased under the\n2023 Program. The Company’s Board of Directors has not authorized a new repurchase program as of September 30, 2024.\n37\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help readers understand Carter Bankshares,\nInc., our operations, our present business environment, and our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and highlights material changes in our\nfinancial condition and results of operations as of and for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The MD&A is\nprovided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in\nItem 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to place them on a basis comparable with the current\nperiod presentation. The results of operations reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are not necessarily indicative of results to be\nexpected in future periods. The MD&A includes the following sections:\n• Important Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n• Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n• Critical Accounting Estimates\n• Overview and Strategy\n• Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n◦ Earnings Summary\n◦ Financial Condition\n◦ Liquidity and Capital Resources\n◦ Regulatory Capital Requirements\n◦ Contractual Obligations\n◦ Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nImportant Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains or incorporates certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation\nReform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include statements that relate to our financial condition, market conditions, results of operations, plans,\nobjectives, outlook for earnings, strategic initiatives and related earn-back periods, revenues, expenses, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels and\nasset quality, including but not limited to statements regarding the interest rate environment, the impact of future changes in interest rates, and the impacts of\nthe Company placing its largest lending relationship on nonaccrual status. Forward looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as “will\nlikely result,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “intend,” “ believe,” “assume,” “strategy,” “trend,” “plan,” “outlook,” “outcome,”\n“continue,” “remain,” “potential,” “opportunity,” “comfortable,” “current,” “position,” “maintain,” “sustain,” “seek,” “achieve” and variations of such words\nand similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as will, would, should, could or may.\nThese statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and\noften are beyond the Company’s control. Although we believe the assumptions upon which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of\nthese assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and the forward-looking statements based on these assumptions could be incorrect. The matters discussed in\nthese forward-looking statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results and trends to differ materially from\nthose made, projected, or implied in or by the forward-looking statements including, but not limited to the effects of:\n• market interest rates and the impacts of market interest rates on economic conditions, customer behavior, and the Company’s loan and securities\nportfolios;\n• inflation, market and monetary fluctuations;\n38\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – (continued)\n• reliance on significant customer relationships;\n• general economic or business conditions, including unemployment levels, supply chain disruptions and slowdowns in economic growth;\n• significant weakening of the local economies in which we operate;\n• changes in customer behaviors, including consumer spending, borrowing and saving habits;\n• changes in deposit flows and loan demand;\n• our failure to attract or retain key associates;\n• expansions or consolidations in the Company’s branch network, including that the anticipated benefits of the Company’s branch network optimization\nproject are not fully realized in a timely manner or at all;\n• deterioration of the housing market and reduced demand for mortgages; and\n• turbulence in significant portions of the global financial and real estate markets that could impact our performance, both directly, by affecting our\nrevenues and the value of our assets and liabilities, and indirectly, by affecting the economy generally and access to capital in the amounts, at the times\nand on the terms required to support our future businesses.\nPlease also refer to such other factors as discussed throughout Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023, and any of our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Forward-looking statements are based on\nbeliefs and assumptions using information available at the time the statements are made. We caution you not to unduly rely on forward-looking statements\nbecause the assumptions, beliefs, expectations and projections about future events are expressed in or implied by a forward-looking statement may, and often\ndo, differ materially from actual results. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as to the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to\nupdate, revise or clarify any forward-looking statement to reflect developments occurring after the statement is made.\nExplanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the results of operations presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), management\nuses, and this quarterly report references, interest and dividend income, yield on interest earnings assets, net interest income and net interest margin on a fully\ntaxable equivalent, (“FTE”) basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes these measures provide information useful to investors in\nunderstanding our underlying business, operational performance and performance trends as it facilitates comparisons with the performance of other companies\nin the financial services industry. The Company believes the presentation of interest and dividend income, yield on interest earnings assets, net interest income\nand net interest margin on an FTE basis ensures the comparability of interest and dividend income, yield on interest earning assets, net interest income and net\ninterest margin arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice. Interest and dividend income (GAAP) per the\nConsolidated Statements of Income is reconciled to interest and dividend income adjusted on an FTE basis, yield on interest earning assets (GAAP) is\nreconciled to yield on interest earning assets adjusted on an FTE basis, net interest income (GAAP) is reconciled to net interest income adjusted on an FTE\nbasis and net interest margin (GAAP) is reconciled to net interest margin adjusted on an FTE basis in the \"Results of Operations and Financial Condition - Net\nInterest Income\" section of this MD&A.\nAlthough management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure enhances investors’ understanding of our business and performance, this non-GAAP\nfinancial measure should not be considered an alternative to GAAP or considered to be more relevant than financial results determined in accordance with\nGAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable with similar non-GAAP measures which may be presented by other companies.\n40\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 2.

Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “CARE”.\nThe Company earns revenue primarily from interest on loans and securities and fees charged for financial services provided to our customers. The Company\nincurs expenses for the cost of deposits, provision for credit losses and other operating costs such as salaries and employee benefits, data processing, occupancy\nand income tax provision.\nPart of the Company’s current three-year strategic plan is to focus on refining and enhancing its brand image and position in the markets it serves. With this\nnew brand strategy, the Company has embarked on a multi-year implementation plan to create a brand tailored to the needs of our critical growth audiences,\nwith a focus on innovating brand experiences to exceed expectations and to build a brand that stands apart. This means a commitment to aligning processes,\noperations and systems around the Company’s brand while introducing new products and services, so that in time the Company can increase its brand\nawareness in the communities it serves. To strengthen and further shape the brand and culture of the Company, a new set of guiding principles were introduced\nto associates in June 2023. The guiding principles include a new purpose statement: To create opportunities for more people and businesses to prosper;\nsupported by our new set of core values: Build Relationships, Earn Trust and Take Ownership. We believe these new guiding principles will help create\nalignment to support future growth by empowering our associates and igniting a passion for the Company.\nThe Company’s goal is to shift from restructuring the balance sheet to pursuing a prudent growth strategy when appropriate. We believe this strategy will be\nprimarily targeted at organic growth, but will also consider opportunistic acquisitions that fit this strategic vision. We believe that the Bank’s strong capital and\nliquidity positions support this strategy. In addition to loan and deposit growth, the Company will seek to increase fee income while closely monitoring\noperating expenses.\nThe Company is focused on executing this strategy to successfully support the new brand and grow our business in our current markets as well as any new\nmarkets we may enter. As part of executing this strategy, the Company continues to dedicate significant resources to the ultimate resolution of the Company’s\nnonaccrual loans, the significant majority of which are related to a single large lending relationship that the Company placed on nonaccrual status in the second\nquarter of 2023, in a manner that best protects the Company, the Bank and shareholders. The Company is closely monitoring all developments that may impact\ncollateral values or potential recoveries on its nonperforming loans, including claims that may be asserted by other purported creditors.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company obtained a voluntary stipulation of dismissal of the lawsuit filed against the Bank in the United States District\nCourt for the Western District of Virginia (Danville Division) on February 10, 2024 (the “GLAS Trust Lawsuit”) by GLAS Trust Company, LLC, in its capacity\nas Note Trustee (“GLAS Trust”) “with prejudice.” Accordingly, GLAS Trust may not bring any future legal action in any court based on the facts alleged in the\nGLAS Trust Lawsuit. Moreover, in connection with the dismissal of the GLAS Trust Lawsuit, GLAS Trust and certain affiliates and parties on whose behalf it\nis acting have executed a release that waives any and all causes of action of any kind that they might claim to have against the Bank.\nThe dismissal of the GLAS Trust Lawsuit ended all pending litigation brought against the Bank by GLAS Trust in connection with the Bank’s lending\nrelationship with James C. Justice, II and the entities in which he has an interest. Also in connection with the dismissal of the GLAS Trust Lawsuit, certain\nJustice Entities executed documents reaffirming the legality, validity and binding nature of all loan documents they have executed in favor of the Bank.\n41\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nThe Company tendered a payment (the “Settlement Payment”) in consideration of the voluntary dismissal of the GLAS Trust Lawsuit. Because certain of the\nJustice Entities had previously agreed to indemnify the Bank against the claims asserted in the GLAS Federal Court Litigation, certain of the Justice Entities\nexecuted a promissory note in favor of the Bank further evidencing this indemnification obligation as related to the Settlement Payment. This promissory note\nwas recognized as a principal charge-off during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the nonperforming status of the Bank’s loans with the\nJustice Entities, and because the settled claims related to allegedly preferential payments made on those nonperforming loans.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024 the federal court lawsuit filed against the Company and the Bank by West Virginia Governor James C. Justice II, his wife\nCathy L. Justice, his son James C. Justice, III, and related entities that he and/or they own was dismissed with prejudice. In connection with the dismissal of\nthis litigation, the Justice Entities agreed upon a pathway of curtailment and payoff of the outstanding loans with the Bank. The Justice Entities have reduced\nthe aggregate nonperforming loan balance associated with the Justice Entities has been reduced from $301.9 million as of March 31, 2024 to $280.9 million as\nof September 30, 2024.\nThe Company’s financial results continue to be significantly impacted by the Bank’s largest nonperforming lending relationship that was placed on nonaccrual\nstatus during the second quarter of 2023, which has an aggregate principal balance of $280.9 million as of September 30, 2024. As a result, interest income was\nnegatively impacted by $8.8 million and $9.3 million during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $27.2 million and $20.7 million during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and the same period in 2023, respectively. Interest income has been negatively impacted by $57.2 million in the\naggregate since placement of these loans on nonaccrual status during the second quarter of 2023.\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition\nEarnings Summary\nHighlights for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\n• Net interest income increased $1.4 million, or 5.1% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 57 basis point\nincrease in the yield on earning assets, offset by a 61 basis point increase in funding costs;\n• The (recovery) provision for credit losses decreased $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in\n2023;\n• Total noninterest income increased $0.2 million to $5.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023;\n• Total noninterest expense increased $0.2 million to $27.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in\n2023; and\n• Provision for income taxes increased $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\n42\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 2.

Nonperforming loans as a\npercentage of total portfolio loans were 8.00% compared to 8.83%. The decline is due to $21.0 million of curtailment payments made by the Banks’s\nlargest nonperforming lending relationship that was placed on nonaccrual status during the second quarter of 2023. These loans are contained in the\nOther segment with an aggregate principal balance of $280.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and comprise 97.6% of nonperforming loans at\nSeptember 30, 2024;\n• The Allowance for Credit Losses, (“ACL”) to total portfolio loans ratio was 2.25% compared to 2.77%. The ACL on portfolio loans totaled $80.9\nmillion at September 30, 2024, compared to $97.1 million at December 31, 2023.\n• Total deposits increased $363.2 million, or 13.0% on an annualized basis, compared to December 31, 2023; and\n• Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) borrowings decreased $303.4 million to $90.0 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $393.4 million at\nDecember 31, 2023 primarily due to scheduled maturities, repayment of overnight funds and liquidity provided by deposit growth.\nThe Company reported net income of $5.6 million or $0.24 diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”) for the three months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to net income of $3.6 million, or $0.16 diluted EPS for the same period in 2023.\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\nPERFORMANCE RATIOS 2024 2023 2024 2023\nReturn on Average Assets 0.49 % 0.33 % 0.48 % 0.78 %\nReturn on Average Shareholders’ Equity 5.99 % 4.19 % 5.99 % 9.71 %\nPortfolio Loans to Deposit Ratio 88.02 % 95.82 % 88.02 % 95.82 %\nAllowance for Credit Losses to Total Portfolio Loans 2.25 % 2.77 % 2.25 % 2.77 %\nNonperforming Loans to Portfolio Loans 8.00 % 9.04 % 8.00 % 9.04 %\n43\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nNet Interest Income\nOur principal source of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income represents the difference between the interest and fees earned on interest-earning\nassets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by changes in the average balance of interest-earning assets, interest-\nbearing liabilities, as well as changes in interest rates and spreads. The level and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities is managed by our\nAsset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”), in order to mitigate interest rate and liquidity risks of the balance sheet. A variety of ALCO strategies were\nimplemented, within prescribed ALCO risk parameters, to produce what the Company believes is an acceptable level of net interest income.\nNet interest income and the net interest margin are presented on an FTE basis. The FTE basis (non-GAAP) adjusts net interest income and net interest margin\nfor the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt loans and securities using the applicable federal statutory tax rate for each period (which was 21% for the\nperiods presented). The Company believes this FTE basis presentation provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable sources of interest\nincome.

The net interest margin increased 6 basis points to 2.58% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.52% for the same\nperiod in 2023. Net interest margin, on an FTE basis, increased 5 basis points to 2.59% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.54% for\nthe same period in 2023. The increase was primarily a result of higher average interest-earning assets of $127.1 million with the yield on average interest-\nearning assets increasing 57 basis points. The most significant increase in interest-earning assets was a 65 basis point increase in the yield on average loans\nfrom 4.78% in the third quarter of 2023 to 5.43% in the third quarter of 2024, as well as a higher average loan balance.\nNet interest income decreased to $85.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $94.9 million for the same period in 2023. Net interest\nincome, on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), decreased $9.8 million, or 10.2%, to $85.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $95.7\nmillion for the same period in 2023. The net interest margin decreased 41 basis points to 2.57% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to\n2.98% for the same period in 2023. Net interest margin, on an FTE basis, decreased 41 basis points to 2.59% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to 3.00% for the same period in 2023. The decline in net interest income and net interest margin were significantly driven by the Bank’s largest\nnonperforming lending relationship that was placed on nonaccrual status during the second quarter of 2023, which negatively impacted interest income by\n$27.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and by $20.7 million for the same period in 2023.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, $1.2 billion of CDs matured and repriced from an average rate of 4.33% to an average rate of 4.40%.\nInterest income increased to $56.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $48.9 million compared to the same period in 2023. Interest\nincome, on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), increased $7.7 million, or 15.6%, to $56.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $49.1\nmillion for the same period in 2023, primarily from growth in earning assets and higher earning asset yields. Average interest-earning assets increased primarily\ndue to average loan growth of $200.4 million in loans and an increase of $31.2 million in interest-bearing deposits with banks during the third quarter of 2024,\nand was partially offset by a decrease of $93.4 million in average investment securities and a decrease of $11.1 million in FHLB stock. The Bank’s largest\nnonperforming lending relationship negatively impacted interest income by $8.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 and was negatively impacted by $9.3\nmillion in the third quarter of 2023. Interest income increased to $165.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $144.6 million compared\nto the same period in 2023. Interest income, on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), increased $20.5 million, or 14.1%, to $165.8 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to $145.3 million for the same period in 2023, resulting from average loan growth of $275.5 million in taxable loans.\nThe change in average investment securities is the result of active balance sheet management to deploy the proceeds from securities maturities and principal\ncurtailments into higher yielding loans, rather than reinvesting those proceeds back into the securities portfolio. The portfolio has been diversified as to bond\ntypes, maturities, and interest rate structures. As of September 30, 2024, the securities portfolio was comprised of 43.7% variable rate securities with\napproximately 96.9% that will reprice at least once over the next 12 months. We believe having a significant percentage of variable rate securities is an\nimportant strategy during times of rising interest rates because fixed-rate bond prices generally fall when interest rates increase, which can result in unrealized\nlosses. However, variable rate securities do not carry as much interest rate risk so there is much less price volatility. This variable rate strategy has limited the\nimpact of rising rates on the Company’s unrealized losses on debt securities. With the Federal Reserve on a likely path of reducing short-term interest rates, the\nBank may alter this interest rate mix strategy going forward.\nInterest expense of $27.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $6.3 million, or 29.3% compared to the same period in 2023,\nprimarily due to an increase in average interest-bearing deposits of $430.9 million. The increase in average-bearing deposits reflected solid growth in average\nCDs of $349.2 million, an increase of $128.7 million in interest-bearing demand accounts and an increase of $71.0 million in average money market accounts,\noffset by a decrease of $118.0 million in savings accounts as customer preferences shifted from lower cost non-maturing deposits to higher-yielding interest-\nbearing demand, money market and CD products. Interest expense of $79.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $30.3 million, or\n60.9% compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an average increase in CDs of $345.8 million.\nOur balance sheet is currently exhibiting characteristics of a slightly liability sensitive position due to the short-term nature of our deposit portfolio and FHLB\nborrowings. Specifically, 93.0% of our CD portfolio and 50.0% of our outstanding FHLB borrowings will mature and reprice over the next twelve months.\nThis strategy gives us flexibility to manage the structure and pricing of our deposit and borrowing portfolios to reduce future funding costs should the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (“FOMC”) continue cutting short-term rates in the future.\n47\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 2.

The decrease\nand the increase in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively were due to changes in commitments in construction loans during the\nperiods.\nNet charge-offs were $15.3 million and $16.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $0.8 million and $2.0 million for\nthe same periods in 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, net charge-offs were significantly impacted by\na $15.0 million principal charge-off related to the Other segment of the loan portfolio. As a percentage of average portfolio loans, on an annualized basis, net\ncharge-offs were 1.71% and 0.61% for the three and nine months ended 2024 and 0.09% and 0.08% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,\nrespectively.\nThe $15.0 million principal charge-off related to the Other segment of the loan portfolio. Certain Justice Entities executed a promissory note related to the\nSettlement Payment (as defined in Note 10).

The increase for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher insurance commissions of $0.2 million, offset by a decrease of $0.1 million in other noninterest income related\nto lower fair value adjustment of our interest rate swap contracts with commercial customers.\nThe most significant increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher insurance commissions of $1.1 million. Also impacting the\nincrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a $0.2 million increase in service charges, commissions and fees, offset by a decrease of $0.2\nmillion in other noninterest income similar to the decrease mentioned above and a decline of $0.1 million in commercial loan swap fee income as activity has\ndeclined due to the interest rate environment.\n49\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 2.

The\nmost significant variance for the comparable period related to a $0.6 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, an increase of $0.4 million in\noccupancy expenses, an increase of $0.3 million in data processing expenses and a $0.2 million increase in FDIC insurance expense, offset by a decrease of\n$1.1 million in other noninterest expense and a decrease of $0.3 million in professional and legal fees.\nThe increases in salaries and employee benefits resulted from higher salary expenses due to fewer open positions in retail, job grade assessment increases and\nnormal merit increases. The increase in occupancy expenses, net of $0.4 million was due to new software license and depreciation expense in the third quarter\nof 2024 and the increase in data processing expenses of $0.3 million relates primarily to general inflationary cost increases for existing and new service\nagreements. The increase in advertising expenses relates to costs incurred for the Company’s new brand roll-out. The higher FDIC insurance expense was due\nto the deterioration in asset quality as a direct result of the large nonperforming lending relationship that was placed into nonaccrual status in the second quarter\nof 2023, which is a component used to determine the assessment. The decrease in other noninterest expense related to a gain of $0.5 million on a closed office\nthat was sold in the third quarter of 2024, write-downs of $0.6 million on three legacy other real estate owned (“OREO”) properties and write-downs of $0.3\nmillion on two additional closed offices in the third quarter of 2023.\nTotal noninterest expense increased $4.7 million or 6.2% to $81.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nThe most significant variances were similar to those mentioned for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nHowever, the year-to-date variance was also impacted by an increase of $0.4 million in debit card expense related to discounts received in March of 2023, as\nwell as, a decrease of $0.3 million in telephone expenses due to the lower ongoing cost of a new phone system that was replaced in 2023.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes increased $0.6 million and decreased $1.4 million to $1.4 million and $3.9 million for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively when compared to the same periods in 2023. Pre-tax income increased $2.6 million and decreased $10.4 million for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively when compared to the same periods in 2023. The effective tax rate was 19.9% and 19.5% for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 17.7% and 17.4% for the same periods in 2023. The increase in the effective tax\nrate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily related to changes in pre-tax income,\npartially offset by higher levels of tax credits in 2023. The Company ordinarily generates an annual effective tax rate that is less than the statutory rate of 21%\ndue to benefits resulting from tax-exempt interest income, tax credit projects and bank owned life insurance (“BOLI”).\n50\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nFinancial Condition\nSeptember 30, 2024\nTotal assets increased $100.9 million, to $4.6 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. Cash and due from banks increased $50.5 million\nto $105.0 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $54.5 million at December 31, 2023 primarily due to higher excess cash on hand in the third quarter of\n2024. Total portfolio loans increased $90.0 million, or 3.4% on an annualized basis, to $3.6 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023\nprimarily due to loan growth in the CRE loan segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Loan growth was muted by $80.0 million in loan\npayoffs of two large commercial real estate loans in the first quarter of 2024. The variances in loan segments for portfolio loans related to increases of $187.4\nmillion in CRE loans, offset by decreases in all the other loan segments, such as a $36.8 million decrease in construction loans, a $30.0 million decrease in C&I\nloans, a $21.1 million decrease in the other loan segment due to curtailment payments made by the Bank’s largest nonperforming lending relationship, a $5.0\nmillion decrease in residential mortgages and a $4.5 million decrease in other consumer loans.\nThe securities portfolio decreased $36.4 million and is currently 16.1% of total assets at September 30, 2024 compared to 17.3% of total assets at December 31,\n2023. The decrease is due to ongoing maturities, principal curtailments, purchases and sales of available for sale securities and changes in market values driven\nby fluctuations in intermediate treasury yields. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 there was one new security purchase of $8.6 million and one\nsale of two bonds with a book value of $10.6 million. As of September 30, 2024, the securities portfolio was comprised of 43.7% variable rate securities with\napproximately 96.9% that will reprice at least once over the next 12 months. At September 30, 2024, total gross unrealized gains in the available-for-sale\nportfolio were $0.1 million, offset by $68.4 million of gross unrealized losses. Refer to the “Securities” section below for further discussion of unrealized\nlosses in the available-for-sale securities portfolio.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company purchased $5.0 million of equity securities with carrying value totaling $5.2 million at September 30, 2024.\nThe equity securities consist of our investment in a market-rate bond mutual fund that invests in high quality fixed income bonds, mainly government agency\nsecurities whose proceeds are designed to positively impact community development throughout the United States. The mutual fund focuses exclusively on\nproviding affordable housing to low- and moderate-income borrowers and renters, including those in Majority Minority Census Tracts. The Company’s\ninvestment in the mutual fund is eligible for investment credit under the Community Reinvestment Act.\nFHLB stock, at cost decreased $14.2 million to $7.4 million at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease is due to a lower level of\nFHLB borrowings due to deposit growth that funded paydowns of FHLB borrowings. Closed retail bank offices had a book value of $0.5 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and $2.3 million at December 31, 2023 included in OREO on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe ACL was 2.25% of total portfolio loans at September 30, 2024 compared to 2.77% as of December 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily related to an\nupdated analysis of the individually evaluated loans, a $15.0 million charge-off related to the Other segment of the loan portfolio and $3.1 million of Other\nsegment specific reserves released in connection with $21.0 million of curtailment payments made by the Bank’s largest nonperforming lending relationship.\nGeneral reserves as a percentage of total portfolio loans were 1.21% at September 30, 2024 and 1.22% at December 31, 2023. Management believes the ACL is\nadequate to absorb expected losses inherent in the loan portfolio. See the sections of this MD&A titled “Provision for Credit Losses,” “Credit Quality” and\n“Allowance for Credit Losses” for information about the factors that impacted the ACL and the provision for credit losses.\nTotal deposits increased $363.2 million, or 13.0% on an annualized basis, to $4.1 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. The increase\nin deposits was primarily due to a $343.4 million increase in CDs and an increase of $167.5 million in interest-bearing demand accounts, offset by a decrease\nof $82.0 million in savings accounts, a decrease of $56.3 million in noninterest-bearing demand accounts and a decrease of $9.4 million in money market\naccounts. The Company had $216.1 million brokered CDs at September 30, 2024, compared to $70.0 million at December 31, 2023.\nAt September 30, 2024, noninterest-bearing deposits comprised 15.4% of total deposits compared to 18.4% at December 31, 2023 and 18.7% at September 30,\n2023. CDs comprised 47.2%, 42.6% and 42.5% of total deposits at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, based on assumptions that the Bank uses to prepare its regulatory call report, approximately 82.7% of our total deposits of $4.1 billion\nwere insured under standard FDIC insurance coverage limits, and approximately 17.3% of our total deposits were uninsured deposits over the standard FDIC\n51\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 2.

The Company’s deposit base is diversified and granular and is comprised of approximately 78.5% of retail deposits.\nFHLB borrowings decreased $303.4 million to $90.0 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $393.4 million at December 31, 2023 primarily due to a\ndecline in overnight borrowings, offset by $146.1 million of new brokered CDs during the third quarter of 2024, as well as deposit growth. The Company had\nno outstanding federal funds purchased at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nTotal capital of $386.8 million at September 30, 2024, reflects an increase of $35.6 million compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in total capital from\nDecember 31, 2023 is primarily due to net income of $16.2 million, an increase of $18.1 million in other comprehensive income (loss) due to changes in fair\nvalue of investment securities, as well as an increase of $1.3 million related to restricted stock activity all during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe Company remains well capitalized. The Tier 1 capital ratio decreased to 10.83% at September 30, 2024 compared to 11.08% at December 31, 2023. The\nleverage ratio was 9.53% at September 30, 2024, compared to 9.48% at December 31, 2023 and the total risk-based capital ratio was 12.09% at September 30,\n2024 compared to 12.34% at December 31, 2023.\nThe Bank also remained well capitalized as of September 30, 2024. The Bank’s Tier 1 Capital ratio was 10.75% at September 30, 2024 compared to 10.99% at\nDecember 31, 2023.

Securities are subject to market risks that could\nnegatively affect the level of liquidity available to us. Security purchases are subject to our investment policy that is approved annually by our Board and\nadministered through ALCO and our treasury function.\nThe securities portfolio decreased $36.4 million to $742.6 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $779.0 million at December 31, 2023. Securities\ncomprise 16.1% of total assets at September 30, 2024 compared to 17.3% at December 31, 2023. The decrease is due to ongoing maturities, principal\ncurtailments, purchases and sales of available for sale securities and changes in market values driven by fluctuations in intermediate treasury yields. During the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, there was one new security purchase of $8.6 million and one sale of two bonds with a book value of $10.6 million as\nliquidity generated by the securities portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily deployed into higher yielding loans. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the securities portfolio was comprised of 43.7% variable rate securities with approximately 96.9% that will reprice at least once over the\nnext 12 months.\nAt September 30, 2024 total gross unrealized gains in the available-for-sale portfolio were $0.1 million, offset by $68.4 million of gross unrealized losses. At\nDecember 31, 2023, total gross unrealized gains in the available-for-sale portfolio were $0.7 million offset by $92.3 million of gross unrealized losses.\n52\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nThe unrealized losses on debt securities are believed to be temporary primarily because these unrealized losses are due to reductions in market value caused by\nupward movement in interest rates since the securities purchase (as applicable), and not related to the credit quality of these securities. Our portfolio consists of\n46.9% of securities issued by United States government sponsored entities and carry an implicit government guarantee. States and political subdivisions\ncomprise 31.1% of the portfolio and are largely general obligations or essential purpose revenue bonds, which have performed very well historically over all\nbusiness cycles, and are rated AA and AAA. We have the ability to hold these securities to maturity and expect full recovery of the amortized cost. We may\noccasionally sell securities to take advantage of market opportunities or as part of a strategic initiative.\nThe Company’s investment securities with intermediate and long-term maturities were the largest driver of these gross unrealized losses, as the market values\nof these securities are significantly impacted by the Treasury yield curve for similar durations (i.e., 5- and 10-year Treasury securities). This portion of the\nTreasury yield curve has moved lower over the past three months, driving unrealized losses on outstanding securities lower. Changes in short-term interest rates\ncan affect the yield on floating rate securities. Yields on floating rate securities will fall as the Federal Reserve Board (“FRB”) lower short-term rates. Changes\nin intermediate and long-term interest rates, which are market driven, affect the market value of fixed rate securities with similar maturities. The Company\nexpects that market values on the Bank’s intermediate and long-term maturity holdings will continue to fluctuate in large part driven by treasury yield changes.\nAt September 30, 2024 the 5-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields were 3.58% and 3.81%, respectively. At December 31, 2023, those same bond yields were\n3.84% and 3.88%, respectively. Therefore, this decrease of 26 bps and 7 bps, respectively in the intermediate part of the yield curve largely caused an increase\nin bond prices for fixed rate bonds in that maturity range. Note, the effects were generally greater for longer maturity bonds, such as municipal bonds. On the\nother hand, floating rate bonds largely held consistent values, as those interest rates generally adjust in line with FRB interest rate moves.\nShould the impairment of any of these securities become credit related, the impairment will be recognized by establishing an ACL through provision for credit\nlosses in the period the credit related impairment is identified, while any non-credit loss will be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of\napplicable taxes. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no credit related impairment.\nThe Basel rules permit most banking organizations to retain, through a one-time election, existing treatment for accumulated other comprehensive loss, which\ncurrently does not affect regulatory capital. The Company elected to retain this treatment which reduces the volatility of regulatory capital levels.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company purchased $5.0 million of equity securities with carrying value totaling $5.2 million at September 30, 2024.\nThe equity securities consist of our investment in a market-rate bond mutual fund that invests in high quality fixed income bonds, mainly government agency\nsecurities whose proceeds are designed to positively impact community development throughout the United States. The mutual fund focuses exclusively on\nproviding affordable housing to low- and moderate-income borrowers and renters, including those in Majority Minority Census Tracts. The Company’s\ninvestment in the mutual fund is eligible for investment credit under the Community Reinvestment Act.\n53\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 2.

The risk that borrowers are unable to pay such obligations is inherent in the loan\nportfolio. Other conditions such as downturns in the borrower's industry or the overall economic climate can significantly impact the borrower’s ability to pay.\nFor a discussion of the risk factors relevant to our business and operations, please refer to Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” contained in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nTotal portfolio loans increased $90.0 million, or 3.4%, on an annualized basis, and was $3.6 billion at September 30, 2024 and $3.5 billion at December 31,\n2023 with production primarily in our CRE portfolio. The CRE portfolio is monitored for potential concentrations of credit risk by market, property type and\ntenant concentrations. Given the current interest rate environment, our mortgage portfolio paydowns outpaced growth in the nine months ended September 30,\n2024. At September 30, 2024, the loan portfolio was comprised of 26.4% floating rates which reprice monthly, 39.1%, variable rates that reprice at least once\nduring the life of the loan and the remaining 34.5% are fixed rate loans. The Company continues to carefully monitor the loan portfolio during 2024, including\nin light of market conditions that impact our borrowers and the interest rate environment.\nTotal CRE represented 51.7% of total portfolio loans at September 30, 2024 compared to 47.7% at December 31, 2023. The collateral for the Company’s CRE\nloans is concentrated predominantly in North Carolina, Virginia, South Carolina, West Virginia and Georgia within the retail/restaurant, warehouse, hospitality,\nmultifamily, and office metrics.\n54\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 2.

The majority of our CRE loans are made in the above noted geographies and granted to experienced\ndevelopers and sponsors with loan guaranty structures that provide recourse to individuals with access to financial resources. We believe our knowledge of\nCRE and our operating knowledge at the local and regional level of these markets allows us to effectively manage concentration risk. Our operating knowledge\nat the local and regional level is derived from our front-line connection to the customer and our understanding of their business model. We also have access to\nresearch tools that inform us about market statistics such as occupancy, lease growth rates and new construction starts. This data is reviewed frequently by our\ncredit officers and disseminated to our lenders. The Bank’s underwriting process includes multiple shock scenarios primarily focused on cash flow and leverage\nin order to determine a supportable loan amount.\nWe attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by diversifying our loan portfolio by segment, geography, collateral and industry while actively managing\nconcentrations. When concentrations exist in certain segments, we seek to mitigate this risk by reviewing the relevant economic indicators and internal risk\nrating trends of the loans in these segments. The Company established transaction, relationship and specific loan segment limits in its loan policy. Total\ncommercial real estate balances should not exceed the combination of 300% of total risk-based capital and growth in excess of 50% over the previous thirty-six\nmonths and construction loan balances should not exceed 100% of total risk-based capital. Investment real estate property types and purchased loan programs\nhave individual dollar limits that should not be exceeded in the portfolio and are based on\n55\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nmanagement’s risk tolerance relative to capital. In addition, there are specific targets for various categories of real estate loans with respect to debt service\ncoverage ratios, loan-to-value ratios, loan terms, and amortization periods. We also have policy limits on loan-to-cost for construction projects. Although\nleverage is important, the Company also focuses on cash flow generation and employs stress testing to calculate a supportable loan amount.\nAggregate commitments to our top 10 credit relationships was $717.2 million at September 30, 2024. The Other segment represents 39.2% of the top 10 credit\nrelationships including the Bank’s largest nonperforming lending relationship, the entire balance which was transferred to nonaccrual status during the second\nquarter of 2023, as described in more detail below under “Credit Quality” in this MD&A.\nThe following table summarizes our top 10 relationships and a description of industries represented for the periods presented:\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nFor the Periods Ending 2024 2024\n(Dollars in Thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change % of Gross Loans % of RBC\n1.

The majority of\nunused commitments are for construction projects that will be drawn as the construction completes. Total utilization was 52.8% at September 30, 2024 and\n53.8% at December 31, 2023. Unfunded commitments on commercial operating lines of credit was 52.6% at September 30, 2024 and 53.7% at December 31,\n2023.\nUnsecured loans pose higher risk for the Company due to the lack of a well-defined secondary source of repayment. Commercial unsecured loans are reserved\nfor the best quality customers with well-established businesses that operate with low financial and operating leverage. The repayment capacity of the borrower\nshould exceed the policy and guidelines for secured loans. The Company significantly increased the standards for consumer unsecured lending by adjusting\nupward the required qualifying Fair Isaac Corporation (“FICO”) scores and restricting loan amounts at lower FICO scores.\nDeferred costs and fees included in the portfolio balances above were $7.7 million and $7.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. Discounts on purchased 1-4 family loans included in the portfolio balances above were $113.4 thousand and $133.4 thousand at September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nRefer to Note 4, Loans and Loans Held-for-Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for\nadditional information related to our loans.\nCredit Quality\nOn a monthly basis, a Criticized Asset Committee meets to review certain watch, special mention and substandard risk rated loans within prescribed policy\nthresholds. These loans typically represent the highest risk of loss to the Company. Action plans are established and these loans are monitored through regular\ncontact with the borrower and loan officer, review of current financial information and other documentation, review of all loan or potential loan restructures or\nmodifications and the regular re-evaluation of assets held as collateral.\n56\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nOn a quarterly basis, the Credit Risk Committee of the Board meets to review our loan portfolio metrics, approve segment limits, approve the adequacy of\nACL, and review the findings from Loan Review identified in the previous quarter. Annually, this same committee approves credit related policy changes and\npolicy enhancements as they become available.\nAdditional credit risk management practices include continuous reviews of trends in our lending footprint and our lending policies and procedures to support\nsound underwriting practices, concentrations, delinquencies and annual portfolio stress testing. Our Loan Review department serves as a mechanism to\nindependently monitor credit quality and assess the effectiveness of credit risk management practices to provide oversight of all lending activities. The loan\nreview function has the primary responsibility for assessing commercial credit administration and credit decision functions of consumer and mortgage\nunderwriting, as well as determining the appropriateness of risk ratings for those loans reviewed and providing input to the loan risk rating process. Our policy\nis to place loans in all categories in nonaccrual status when collection of interest or principal is doubtful, or generally when interest or principal payments are\n90 days or more past due based on contractual terms. Consumer unsecured loans and secured loans are evaluated for charge-off after the loan becomes 90 days\npast due. Loans past due 90 days are automatically transferred to nonaccrual status. Management reserves the right to exercise discretion at the individual loan\nlevel. For example, we may elect to transfer a loan to nonaccrual regardless of the delinquency status if we believe the collection in full of both principal and\ninterest to be unlikely. We may also elect to retain a loan that is 90 or more days’ delinquent in accrual status if we believe the loan is well secured and in the\nprocess of collection. Unsecured loans are fully charged-off and secured loans are charged-off to the estimated fair value of the collateral less the cost to sell.\nThe ability of borrowers to repay commercial loans is dependent upon the success of their business and general economic conditions. Due to the greater\npotential for loss within our commercial portfolio, we monitor the commercial loan portfolio through an internal risk rating system. Loan risk ratings are\nassigned based upon the creditworthiness of the borrower and are reviewed on an ongoing basis according to our internal policies. Loans rated special mention\nor substandard have potential or well-defined weaknesses not generally found in high quality, performing loans, and require attention from management to\nlimit loss.\nNonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans and OREO.

The decrease of $21.8 million in\nnonperforming loans was primarily related to $21.0 million of curtailment payments made by the Bank’s largest nonperforming relationship.\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company placed $301.9 million of commercial loans that reside in the Other segment of the Company’s loan portfolio,\nrelating to the Bank’s largest lending relationship, on nonaccrual status due to loan maturities and failure to pay in full. These loans remained on nonaccrual\nstatus at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. These nonperforming loans are 97.6% of the Company's total nonperforming loans and 97.1% of\nthe Company's total nonperforming assets at September 30, 2024.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the federal court lawsuit filed against the Company and the Bank by West Virginia Governor James C. Justice II, his wife\nCathy L. Justice, his son James C. Justice, III, and related entities that he and/or they own (collectively, the “Justice Entities”) was dismissed and we have\nagreed upon a pathway of curtailment and payoff of the outstanding loans with the Bank. During the second and third quarters of 2024, $21.0 million of\ncurtailment payments made by the Bank’s largest nonperforming lending relationship have decreased the aggregate nonperforming loan balance outstanding to\n57\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nthe Bank to $280.9 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company believes it is well secured based on the net carrying value of the credit relationship and it\nhas appropriately reserved for expected credit losses with respect to all such loans based on information currently available. However, the Company cannot\ngive any assurance as to the timing or amount of future payments or collections on such loans or that the Company will ultimately collect all amounts\ncontractually due. The Company is closely monitoring all developments that may impact collateral values or potential recoveries on its nonperforming loans,\nincluding claims that may be asserted by other purported creditors.\nBased on analyses of the credit relationship and various discounted cash flow valuation techniques utilized in the alternative modeling, which resulted in a\nspecific reserves with respect to these loans of $36.9 million at September 30, 2024, representing 13.1%, of these loans aggregate principal amount as\ncompared to $54.3 million or 18.0% of these loans aggregate principal amount at December 31, 2023. This decline was driven by updated analysis of the credit\nrelationship during the third quarter of 2024 using the discounted cash flow model with updated assumptions and inputs regarding the credit relationship, legal\nrisk and related risks.\nAs the borrowers on these loans operate in the hospitality, agriculture, and energy sectors, this credit relationship is secured by, among other collateral,\ncommercial real estate properties in these sectors including but not limited to top-tier hospitality properties. When evaluating the net carrying value of this\ncredit relationship at September 30, 2024, the Company utilized discounted cash flow valuation techniques to estimate the timing and magnitude of potential\nrecoveries resulting from various collection processes.\n58\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nThe following is an analysis of nonperforming loans by loan portfolio segment for the dates presented, and each segment’s relative contribution to total\nnonperforming loans:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(Dollars in Thousands) Amount % of NPLs Amount % of NPLs\nCommercial Real Estate $ 978 0.3 % $ 1,324 0.4 %\nCommercial & Industrial 1,094 0.4 % 52 — %\nResidential Mortgages 4,482 1.6 % 3,283 1.1 %\nOther Consumer 20 — % 59 — %\nConstruction 231 0.1 % 2,904 1.0 %\nOther 280,905 97.6 % 301,913 97.5 %\nBalance End of Period 287,710 100.0 % 309,535 100.0 %\nClosed retail bank offices had a book value of $0.5 million at September 30, 2024 and $2.3 million at December 31, 2023, and are recorded in OREO on the\nCompany’s balance sheet. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank sold three retail banking offices and moved $1.2 million of loans at fair\nvalue to OREO. These properties are currently being marketed for sale.\nPast Company legacy underwriting standards relied heavily on loan to value and did not necessarily consider the income characteristics of the borrower or the\nrepayment capacity of collateral with respect to speculative land financing. An overreliance on value as a primary repayment source can become compromised\nduring real estate cycles. As a result, management has worked through these legacy credits and has installed a number of underwriting guardrails that consider\nthe global cash flows and repayment capability of borrowers and/or guarantors, the proportion of speculation, transaction limits and introduced sensitivity\nanalysis in order to determine supportable loan amounts. While these guardrails do not insulate the Company from credit cycles, management believes it should\nreduce the experience of defaults.\nClosed-end installment loans, amortizing loans secured by real estate and any other loans with payments scheduled monthly are reported past due when the\nborrower is in arrears two or more monthly payments. Other multi-payment obligations with payments scheduled other than monthly are reported past due\nwhen one scheduled payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more. We monitor delinquency on a monthly basis, including loans that are at risk for becoming\ndelinquent and early stage delinquencies in order to identify emerging patterns and potential problem loans.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe following is the allocation of the ACL reserves by segment for the periods presented:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n% of Loans in each % of Loans in each\nCategory to Total Category to Total\n(Dollars in Thousands) Amount Portfolio Loans Amount Portfolio Loans\nCommercial Real Estate $ 20,067 51.7 % $ 19,873 47.7 %\nCommercial & Industrial 2,936 6.7 % 3,286 7.7 %\nResidential Mortgages 10,520 21.8 % 10,879 22.5 %\nOther Consumer 724 0.8 % 868 1.0 %\nConstruction 9,742 11.1 % 7,792 12.4 %\nOther 36,920 7.9 % 54,354 8.7 %\nBalance End of Period $ 80,909 100.0 % $ 97,052 100.0 %\nThe ACL was $80.9 million, or 2.25%, of total portfolio loans at September 30, 2024 compared to $97.1 million, or 2.77%, of total portfolio loans at\nDecember 31, 2023.\n59\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 2.

The decrease in the (recovery) provision for credit losses for the quarterly comparison was primarily driven by the\nupdated analysis of the individually evaluated loans, within the Other loan segment and $1.7 million of other segment reserves released related to the\naforementioned $13.2 million of curtailment payments made by the Bank’s largest nonperforming relationship, offset by loan growth in the third quarter of\n2024. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in the (recovery) provision for credit losses, compared to the same period in 2023, was\nprimarily driven by the aforementioned $3.1 million of other segment reserves released related to the aforementioned $21.0 million of curtailment payments,\noffset by loan growth in 2024. For more information about the Company’s provision for credit losses, see the discussion above under “Provision for Credit\nLosses” in this MD&A.\nThe provision (recovery) for unfunded commitments increased $0.3 million and decreased $0.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase was due to increased commitments in construction loans during the third quarter of\n2024. The reserve for unfunded commitments is largely comprised of unfunded commitments related to real estate construction loans and pressure on the\nreserve rates. There are three basic factors that influence the reserve rates associated with unfunded commitments for real estate construction loans. First, the\nreserve rate is extrapolated from the reserve rates calculated for certain commercial real estate funded loans within the ACL model. These reserve rates are\ninfluenced by the same factors cited in the ACL model such as economic forecasts, average portfolio life, etc. Refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation, in the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information related to the ACL Policy and the\ndiscussion of these factors. Second, since the category of construction is generic, management applies a weighting of the reserve rates associated with certain\ncommercial real estate loans. The proportion of these segments affect the weighting.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net charge-offs were significantly impacted by the $15.0 million\nprincipal charge-off related to the Other segment of the loan portfolio. Certain Justice Entities executed a promissory note related to the Settlement Payment.\nThis promissory note was\n60\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nrecognized as a principal charge-off due to the nonperforming status of the Bank’s loans with the Justice Entities and because the settled claims related to\nallegedly preferential payments made on those nonperforming loans. As a percentage of average portfolio loans, on an annualized basis, net charge-offs were\n1.71% and 0.61% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.09% and 0.08% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNonperforming loans remained significantly elevated at $287.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and $309.5 million as of December 31, 2023 due principally\nto the aggregate balance of the nonperforming loans associated with the Bank’s largest lending relationship that was placed on nonaccrual status during the\nsecond quarter of 2023. The balance of that relationship has declined from $301.9 million December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024 to $280.9 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total portfolio loans were 8.00% and 8.83% as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. The decline in nonperforming loans is primarily due to $21.0 million in total payments received during the second and third quarters of 2024 on\nthe Bank’s largest nonperforming lending relationship, which payments reduced the Bank’s amortized cost associated with those nonperforming loans and were\nmade pursuant to the pathway of curtailment and payoff of the outstanding nonperforming loan agreed between the relevant borrowers and the Bank.

The variance related to an increase of $343.4 million in CDs, which includes an increase of $146.1 million in brokered CDs, and an\nincrease of $167.5 million in interest-bearing demand accounts, offset by a decrease of $82.0 million in savings accounts, a decrease of $56.3 million in\nnoninterest-bearing demand accounts and a decrease of $9.4 million in money market accounts.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nBorrowings and Federal Funds Purchased\nBorrowings are an additional source of liquidity for the Company. FHLB borrowings decreased $303.4 million to $90.0 million at September 30, 2024 and\nwere $393.4 million at December 31, 2023 primarily due to a decline in overnight borrowings, coupled with $146.1 million of new brokered CDs during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company used liquidity provided by deposit growth to reduce outstanding FHLB borrowings during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024. The Company had no overnight federal funds purchased at September 30, 2024 or at December 31, 2023. The level and\ncomposition of borrowed funds fluctuates over time based on many factors including market conditions, loan growth, investment securities, deposits growth\nand capital considerations. We manage our borrowed funds to provide a reliable source of liquidity.\nInformation pertaining to FHLB borrowings and federal funds purchased is summarized in the following table:\n(Dollars in Thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nBalance at Period End\nFederal Home Loan Bank Borrowings $ 90,000 $ 393,400\nFederal Funds Purchased $ — $ —\nAverage Balance during the Period\nFederal Home Loan Bank Borrowings $ 273,413 $ 402,675\nFederal Funds Purchased $ — $ 7,023\nAverage Interest Rate during the Period\nFederal Home Loan Bank Borrowings 5.20 % 5.17 %\nFederal Funds Purchased — % 5.24 %\nMaximum Month-end Balance during the Period\nFederal Home Loan Bank Borrowings $ 403,000 $ 525,135\nFederal Funds Purchased $ — $ 46,965\nAverage Interest Rate at Period End\nFederal Home Loan Bank Borrowings 4.30 % 5.20 %\nFederal Funds Purchased — % — %\nThe Company held FHLB of Atlanta stock of $7.4 million and $21.6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in\nFHLB stock was due to a lower required level of stock holdings due to a lower level of FHLB borrowings. Dividends recorded on restricted stock were\n$0.2 million and $0.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $0.4 million and $1.0 million for the same periods in 2023.\nThe investment is carried at cost and evaluated for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value. We hold FHLB stock because we are a\nmember of the FHLB of Atlanta. The FHLB requires members to purchase and hold a specified level of FHLB stock based upon the members’ asset values,\nlevel of borrowings and participation in other programs offered. Stock in the FHLB is non-marketable and is redeemable at the discretion of the FHLB.\nMembers do not purchase stock in the FHLB for the same reasons that traditional equity investors acquire stock in an investor-owned enterprise. Rather,\nmembers purchase stock to obtain access to the products and services offered by the FHLB. Unlike equity securities of traditional for-profit enterprises, the\nstock of the FHLB does not provide its holders with an opportunity for capital appreciation because, by regulation, FHLB stock can only be purchased,\nredeemed and transferred at par value.\nRefer to Note 9, Federal Home Loan Bank Borrowings and Federal Funds Purchased, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information related to borrowings.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is defined as a financial institution’s ability to meet its cash and collateral obligations at a reasonable cost. This includes the ability to satisfy the\nfinancial needs of depositors who want to withdraw funds or borrowers needing to access funds to meet their credit needs. In order to manage liquidity risk the\nCompany’s Board has delegated authority to ALCO for formulation, implementation and oversight of liquidity risk management for the Company. The ALCO’s\ngoal is to maintain adequate levels of liquidity at a reasonable cost to meet funding needs in both a normal operating environment and for potential liquidity\nstress events. The ALCO closely monitors and manages liquidity by reviewing cash flow projections, performing balance sheet stress tests and by maintaining\na detailed contingency funding plan that includes specific liquidity measures that\n63\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nare reviewed by the ALCO monthly. Our liquidity policy and contingency funding plan provide graduated risk tolerance levels for multiple liquidity measures\nand potential liquidity environments. If our liquidity position moves to a level that has been defined as high risk, specific actions are required, such as increased\nmonitoring or the development of an action plan to reduce the risk position.\nThe Company’s primary funding and liquidity source is a stable customer deposit base. Management believes that we have the ability to retain existing deposits\nand attract new deposits, mitigating any potential funding dependency on other more volatile sources. Although deposits are the primary source of funds, the\nCompany has identified various other funding sources that can be used as part of our normal funding program when either a structure or cost efficiency has\nbeen identified. Additional funding sources accessible to the Company include borrowing availability at the FHLB, equal to 25.0% of the Company’s assets or\napproximating $1.2 billion, subject to the amount of eligible collateral pledged, of which the Company is eligible to borrow up to an additional $791.4 million.\nThe Company has unsecured facilities with three other correspondent financial institutions totaling $30.0 million, a fully secured facility with one other\ncorrespondent financial institution totaling $45.0 million, and access to the institutional CD market, and the brokered deposit market. The Company did not\nhave outstanding borrowings on these fed funds lines as of September 30, 2024. In addition to the above funding resources, the Company also has $433.3\nmillion of unpledged available-for-sale investment securities, at fair value, as an additional source of liquidity. Please refer to the Liquidity Sources table below\nfor available funding with the FHLB and our secured and unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 82.7%\nof our total deposits of $4.1 billion were insured under standard FDIC insurance coverage limits, and approximately 17.3% of our total deposits were uninsured\ndeposits over the standard FDIC insurance coverage limit.\nThe Company closely monitors changes in the industry and market conditions that may impact the Company’s liquidity and will use other borrowing means or\nother liquidity and funding strategies sources to fund its liquidity needs as needed. The Company is also closely tracking the potential impacts on the\nCompany’s liquidity of declines in the fair value of the Company’s securities portfolio due to rising market interest rates and developments in the banking\nindustry that may change the availability of traditional sources of liquidity or market expectations with respect to available sources and amounts of additional\nliquidity.\nAn important component of our ability to effectively respond to potential liquidity stress events is maintaining a cushion of highly liquid assets. Highly liquid\nassets are those that can be converted to cash quickly, with little or no loss in value, to meet financial obligations. ALCO policy guidelines define a ratio of\nhighly liquid assets to total assets by graduated risk tolerance levels of minimal, moderate and high. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had $495.3 million in\nhighly liquid assets, which consisted of Federal Reserve Board Excess Reserves and interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions of $61.6 million,\n$433.3 million in unpledged securities and $0.4 million in loans held-for-sale. This resulted in highly liquid assets to total assets ratio of 10.7% at\nSeptember 30, 2024. Total available liquidity to uninsured deposits was 207.8% at September 30, 2024.\nIf an extended recession, or significant industry or market volatility, caused large numbers of our deposit customers to withdraw their funds, we might become\nmore reliant on volatile or more expensive sources of funding.\nThe following table provides detail of liquidity sources as of the periods presented:\n(Dollars in Thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCash and Due From Banks, including Interest-bearing Deposits $ 104,992 $ 54,529\nUnpledged Investment Securities 433,273 563,537\nExcess Pledged Securities 65,931 61,774\nFHLB Borrowing Availability 791,403 480,266\nCollateralized Lines of Credit 45,000 —\nUnsecured Lines of Credit 30,000 50,000\nTotal Liquidity Sources $ 1,470,599 $ 1,210,106\n64\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 2.

The increase in total capital from\nDecember 31, 2023 is primarily due to net income of $16.2 million, an increase of $18.1 million in other comprehensive loss due to changes in fair value of\ninvestment securities, as well as an increase of $1.3 million related to restricted stock activity all during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to various capital requirements administered by the federal banking regulators. Failure to meet the minimum capital\nrequirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on\nour financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we must meet specific capital\nguidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The\ncapital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Prompt\ncorrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies. Quantitative measures established by regulations to ensure capital adequacy require\nus to maintain minimum amounts and ratios.\nPrompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and\ncritically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required\nto accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and capital restoration plans are required. At\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized the Bank as well-capitalized under the regulatory framework\nfor prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institution’s category.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Bank continues to maintain its capital position with a leverage ratio of 9.45% as compared to the regulatory guideline of 5.00% to\nbe well-capitalized and a risk-based Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.75% compared to the regulatory guideline of 6.50% to be well-capitalized. The Bank’s\nrisk-based Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios were 10.75% and 12.01%, respectively, which places the Bank above the federal bank regulatory agencies’ well-\ncapitalized guidelines of 8.00% and 10.00%, respectively. We believe that we have the ability to raise additional capital, if necessary.\nThe Basel rules permit banking organizations with less than $15.0 billion in assets to retain, through a one-time election, existing treatment for accumulated\nother comprehensive loss, which currently does not affect regulatory capital. The Company elected to retain this treatment which reduces the volatility of\nregulatory capital levels.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios, along with a\ncapital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in new minimum capital ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of\neconomic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the minimum, but below the conservation\nbuffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends,\nequity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a “countercyclical capital buffer” that is\napplicable to only certain covered institutions and does not have any current applicability to the Company or the Bank.\n65\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 2.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is defined as the degree to which changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, or equity prices can adversely affect a\nfinancial institution’s earnings or capital. For financial institutions, market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending, investment, and\ndeposit-taking activities. Interest rate risk can arise from timing differences in the repricing and maturities of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing\nliabilities (repricing risk), changes in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities arising from embedded options, such as borrowers’ ability to prepay home\nmortgage loans at any time, depositors’ ability to redeem certificates of deposit before maturity (option risk), changes in the shape of the yield curve, where\ninterest rates increase or decrease in a non-parallel fashion (yield curve risk), and changes in spread relationships between different yield curves, such as U.S.\nTreasuries and SOFR (basis risk).\nInterest rate fluctuations affect earnings by changing net interest income and other interest-sensitive income and expense levels. Interest rate changes affect\ncapital by changing the net present value of a financial institution’s future cash flows, and the cash flows themselves, as rates change. Accepting this risk is a\nnormal part of banking and can be an important source of profitability and enhancement of shareholder value. However, excessive interest rate risk can threaten\na financial institution’s earnings, capital, liquidity, and solvency. The Company’s ALCO is responsible for the reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of\nthe institution, establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to this type of risk, and employing strategies to ensure our asset-liability structure produces\nthe maximum yield-cost spread available based on current market conditions. The Company’s Investment / Interest Rate Risk Committee, a committee of the\nBoard of Directors, reviews and approves the policies established by ALCO.\n66\nTable of Contents\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nEarnings Simulation Modeling\nThe ALCO uses an asset liability model (“ALM”) to forecast earning simulations that measure the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates.\nThe ALM calculates an earnings estimate based on current and projected balances and rates. This method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that\nsupport the ALM process. The ALCO derives the assumptions used in the ALM from historical trends and management’s outlook, including expected loan\ngrowth, loan prepayment rates, deposit growth rates, changes to deposit product betas and non-maturity deposit decay rates, and projected yields and rates. The\nALM assumes that all maturities, calls, and prepayments in the securities portfolio are reinvested in like instruments. These assumptions may not be realized\nand unanticipated events and circumstances may also occur that cause the assumptions to be inaccurate. The ALM also does not take into account any future\nactions management may take to mitigate the impact of unforeseen interest rate changes. A sensitivity analysis for deposit betas, deposit decay rates and loan\nprepayment speeds is performed at least annually within the ALM to help ALCO better understand the impact of these critical assumptions on the ALM results.\nThe ALCO reviews the assumptions of the ALM at least quarterly and periodically adjusts them when deemed appropriate.\nThe ALCO also uses different interest rate scenarios and shifts in yield curve shapes to measure the sensitivity of earnings to various interest rate environments.\nInterest rates on unique asset and liability accounts move differently when the short-term market rate changes. These differences are reflected in the different\nrate scenarios utilized by the ALM. For earning simulations, our policy guidelines limit the change in net interest income over a 12-month and 24-month\nhorizon using rate shocks of +/- 100, 200, 300, 400 basis points and for non-parallel yield curve shift scenarios. We have temporarily suspended the + 300 and\n+ 400 basis point rate shock analyses. Due to the FOMC’s recent action to reduce the Fed Funds Target Rate range by 50 bps from 5.25% - 5.50% to 4.75% -\n5.00% effective September 18, 2024 coupled with current rate forecasts that imply that the FOMC will continue reducing the Fed Funds Target Rate during the\nfourth quarter of 2024 and well into 2025, we believe the impact to net interest income when evaluating the + 300 and +400 basis point rate shock scenarios do\nnot provide meaningful insight into our interest rate risk position nor does it project a probable interest rate environment for the foreseeable future.\nThe following tables reflect the earnings simulation results for the periods presented utilizing a forecasted static balance sheet over the next twelve months. All\npercentage changes presented are within prescribed ranges set by ALCO.\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nChange in Interest Rate (basis points) % Change in Pretax Net Interest Income % Change in Pretax Net Interest Income\n200 3.9% (1.1)%\n100 2.1% (0.3)%\n-100 1.2 % 2.4 %\n-200 2.5 % 4.4 %\n-300 3.1 % 5.6 %\n-400 2.6 % 6.7 %\nThe results from the earnings simulation imply that the Company’s assets and liabilities are relatively evenly matched to allow for net interest income margin\nexpansion in rising and falling interest rate environments at September 30, 2024 versus being liability sensitive at December 31, 2023. The above table\nindicates that as of September 30, 2024 the Company’s balance sheet is positioned to produce a modest increase in pre-tax net interest income in both a rising\nand falling interest rate environment principally due to the current balance sheet composition, related maturity structures, interest rate hedges entered into\nduring the third quarter and dynamic repricing correlations to market interest rates for both assets and liabilities.\nEconomic Value of Equity Modeling\nEconomic value of equity simulation is used to calculate the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities over different interest rate environments. The ALM\ncalculates the economic value of equity based on discounted cash flow analysis. The net economic value of equity is the economic value of all assets minus the\neconomic value of all liabilities. The change in net economic value of equity over different rate environments is an indication of the longer-term earnings\ncapability of the balance sheet. The Company uses the same assumptions in the economic value of equity simulation model as in the earnings simulation\nmodel. The economic value of equity simulation model uses instantaneous rate shocks to the balance sheet. For economic value of equity simulation, our policy\nguidelines limit the change in economic value of equity given changes in rates of +/- 100, 200, 300, 400 basis points and for non-parallel yield curve shift\nscenarios. We have temporarily suspended the + 300 and + 400 basis\n67\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued)\npoint rate shock analyses. Due to the FOMC’s recent action to reduce the Fed Funds Target Rate range by 50 bps from 5.25% - 5.50% to 4.75% - 5.00%\neffective September 18, 2024 coupled with current rate forecasts that imply that the FOMC will continue reducing the Fed Funds Target Rate during the fourth\nquarter of 2024 and well into 2025, we believe the impact to net interest income when evaluating the + 300 and +400 basis point rate shock scenarios do not\nprovide meaningful insight into our interest rate risk position nor does it project a probable interest rate environment for the foreseeable future.\nResults for the economic value of equity modeling are driven primarily by the shape of the underlying yield curves and option-adjusted spreads used to\ndiscount the projected cash flows of assets and liabilities, and the assumed life span of the assets and liabilities being discounted.\nThe following tables reflect the economic value of equity analyses results for the periods presented. All percentage changes presented are within prescribed\nranges set by management.\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nChange in Interest Rate (basis points) % Change in Economic Value of Equity % Change in Economic Value of Equity\n200 (7.3)% (4.7)%\n100 (2.9)% (1.8)%\n-100 2.0 % 0.9 %\n-200 2.0 % 0.5 %\n-300 (0.9 %) (2.7)%\n-400 (12.8)% (10.9)%\nITEM 4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) (its principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September 30, 2024. In designing and\nevaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\nrequired by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s\nmanagement, including our CEO and CFO as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nBased on and as of the date of such evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were\neffective in all material respects, as of the end of the period covered by this Report.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nNo changes were made to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter\nended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1- LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThe information contained in Part I, Item 1.

          "content": "INVESTOR\nPRESENTATION\nTHIRD QUARTER 2024\nF O R W A R D - L O O K I N G S T A T E M E N T\nThis information contains or incorporates certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include statements that\nrelate to our financial condition, market conditions, results of operations, plans, objectives, outlook for earnings, revenues, expenses, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality and\nnonaccrual and nonperforming loans. Forward looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as “will likely result,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “intend,” “\nbelieve,” “assume,” “strategy,” “trend,” “plan,” “outlook,” “outcome,” “continue,” “remain,” “potential,” “opportunity,” “comfortable,” “current,” “position,” “maintain,” “sustain,” “seek,” “achieve” and\nvariations of such words and similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as will, would, should, could or may. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve\ncertain risks, uncertainties and assumption that are difficult to predict and often are beyond the Company’s control. Although we believe the assumptions upon which these forward-looking statements are\nbased are reasonable, any of these assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and the forward-looking statements based on these assumptions could be incorrect. The matters discussed in these forward-\nlooking statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results and trends to differ materially from those made, projected, or implied in or by the forward-\nlooking statements including, but not limited to the effects of: market interest rates and the impacts of market interest rates on economic conditions, customer behavior, and the Company’s loan and\nsecurities portfolios; inflation, market and monetary fluctuations; changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws of the U.S. government, including policies of the Federal Reserve, FDIC and Treasury\nDepartment; changes in accounting policies, practices, or guidance, for example, our adoption of Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) methodology, including potential volatility in the Company’s\noperating results due to application of the CECL methodology; cyber-security threats, attacks or events; rapid technological developments and changes; our ability to resolve our nonperforming assets and\nour ability to secure collateral on loans that have entered nonaccrual status due to loan maturities and failure to pay in full; changes in the Company’s liquidity and capital positions; concentrations of loans\nsecured by real estate, particularly commercial real estate, and the potential impacts of changes in market conditions on the value of real estate collateral; increased delinquency and foreclosure rates on\ncommercial real estate loans; an insufficient allowance for credit losses; the potential adverse effects of unusual and infrequently occurring events, such as weather-related disasters, terrorist acts, war and\nother military conflicts (such as the war between Israel and Hamas and the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine) or public health events (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), and of any governmental and\nsocietal responses thereto; these potential adverse effects may include, without limitation, adverse effects on the ability of the Company's borrowers to satisfy their obligations to the Company, on the value\nof collateral securing loans, on the demand for the Company's loans or its other products and services, on incidents of cyberattack and fraud, on the Company’s liquidity or capital positions, on risks posed by\nreliance on third-party service providers, on other aspects of the Company's business operations and on financial markets and economic growth; a change in spreads on interest-earning assets and interest-\nbearing liabilities; regulatory supervision and oversight, including our relationship with regulators and any actions that may be initiated by our regulators; legislation affecting the financial services industry as\na whole, and the Company and the Bank, in particular; the outcome of pending and future litigation and/or governmental proceedings; increasing price and product/service competition; the ability to\ncontinue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis; managing our internal growth and acquisitions; the possibility that the anticipated benefits from acquisitions\ncannot be fully realized in a timely manner or at all, or that integrating acquired operations will be more difficult, disruptive or more costly than anticipated; the soundness of other financial institutions and\nany indirect exposure related to recent large bank failures and their impact on the broader market through other customers, suppliers and partners or that the conditions which resulted in the liquidity\nconcerns with those failed banks may also adversely impact, directly or indirectly, other financial institutions and market participants with which the Company has commercial or deposit relationships with;\nmaterial increases in costs and expenses; reliance on significant customer relationships; general economic or business conditions, including unemployment levels, supply chain disruptions and slowdowns in\neconomic growth; significant weakening of the local economies in which we operate; changes in customer behaviors, including consumer spending, borrowing and saving habits; changes in deposit flows and\nloan demand; our failure to attract or retain key employees; expansions or consolidations in the Company’s branch network, including that the anticipated benefits of the Company’s branch network\noptimization project are not fully realized in a timely manner or at all; deterioration of the housing market and reduced demand for mortgages; and re-emergence of turbulence in significant portions of the\nglobal financial and real estate markets that could impact our performance, both directly, by affecting our revenues and the value of our assets and liabilities, and indirectly, by affecting the economy\ngenerally and access to capital in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support our future businesses. Many of these factors, as well as other factors, are described in our filings with the\nSEC including in the “Risk Factors” section of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. All risk factors and uncertainties described herein and therein should be\nconsidered in evaluating the Company’s forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on beliefs and assumptions using information available at the time the statements are prepared.\nWe caution you not to unduly rely on forward-looking statements because the assumptions, beliefs, expectations and projections about future events are expressed in or implied by a forward-looking\nstatement may, and often do, differ materially from actual results. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as to the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update, revise or clarify\nany forward-looking statement to reflect developments occurring after the statement is made.\n2\nSECTION TITLE SLIDES\n1 Overview 4-12\n2 Financial Highlights 13-24\n3 Asset Quality 25-31\n4 Deposit Mix 32-34\n5 Commercial Loans 35-44\n6 Non-GAAP Reconciliation 45-50\n3\nS E C T I O N 0 1\nOVERVIEW\nFOCUSED ON\n$4.6B CORPORATE\nTHE FUTURE MARTINSVILLE,\nHIGHLIGHTS\nVIRGINIA\nA Well-Capitalized Franchise with Momentum ASSETS ◦ Strong Deposit Growth in Q3\n2024, 20.9%, annualized\n1974 65 ◦ Strong and Improving Available\nLiquidity Position in Q3 2024,\nBRANCHES\nBank established denovo in 207.8% available liquidity to\n1974 as First National Bank $3.6B uninsured deposits\nof Rocky Mount, VA\n◦ Diversified and granular deposit\n2006 base, approximately 78.5%\nLOANS Retail Customers\nCarter Bank & Trust\nCORPORATE\ncharter established in 2006 CENTERS ◦ Approximately 82.7% of\nwith the merger of ten Deposits, including\nbanks Collateralized Muni deposits are\nFDIC Insured\n2020 $4.1B\n03 ◦ Branch network expansion in\nCORPORATE\nCarter Bankshares, Inc.

Management uses, and this exhibit references, the efficiency ratio, the adjusted book value, net interest income and net interest\nmargin, each on a fully taxable equivalent, or FTE, basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes the efficiency ratio, adjusted book value, net\ninterest income and net interest margin on an FTE basis provide information useful to investors in understanding our underlying business, operational performance\nand performance trends as they facilitate comparisons with the performance of other companies in the financial services industry. Although management believes\nthat these non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors’ understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be\nconsidered alternatives to GAAP or considered to be more important than financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable\nwith non-GAAP measures which may be presented by other companies.\n46\nN O N - G A A P R E C O N C I L I A T I O N\nNet Interest Income (FTE) (Non-GAAP) Quarter-to-Date\nNet interest income (FTE) (non-GAAP) and total (Dollars in Thousands) 3Q 2024 2Q 2024 3Q 2023\nInterest and dividend income (FTE) (non- Interest Income (FTE)(Non-GAAP)\nGAAP) , which are used in computing net Interest and Dividend Income (GAAP) $ 56,595 $ 54,583 $ 48,886\ninterest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP), and adjusted Tax Equivalent Adjustment 3 190 197 247\nefficiency ratio (non-GAAP), respectively,\nInterest and Dividend Income (FTE) (Non-GAAP) 56,785 54,780 49,133\nprovide valuable additional insight into the net\nAverage Earning Assets 4,447,455 4,437,077 4,320,390\ninterest margin and the efficiency ratio by\nYield on Interest-earning Assets (GAAP) 5.06 % 4.95 % 4.49 %\nadjusting for differences in tax treatment of\ninterest income sources.
