CDW also announced the approval by its Board of Directors of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.625 per common share to be paid on December 10, 2024 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 25, 2024. \n\n\"The team's value as a trusted advisor and ability to meet our customers' most pressing needs drove strong performance in cloud and end-point solutions,\" said Christine A. Leahy, chair and chief executive officer, CDW. \"While this performance delivered resilient margins that reinforce the integrity of our strategy, it was not enough to offset the impact of lower hardware solutions demand.\" \n\n\"Persistent economic uncertainty and growing complexity in the technology landscape resulted in elongated customer decision making and delays in projects,\" said Albert J. Miralles, chief financial officer, CDW. \"Despite the challenging market, our ability to optimize cash flow generation through effective management of our working capital provides strategic flexibility across our capital priorities including M&A and share repurchases.\" \n\n\"In this evolving and dynamic business environment, our value proposition is stronger than ever as customers turn to CDW to help them address mission-critical IT and operational needs across the full IT solutions stack and lifecycle. We continue to target exceeding US IT market growth by 200 to 300 basis points on a constant currency basis. To achieve this, we remain laser focused on meeting the needs of our more than 250,000 customers around the globe and remaining the partner of choice for more than 1,000 leading and emerging technology brands as the IT market evolves,\" concluded Leahy. \n\nThird Quarter of 2024 Highlights:\n\nNet sales in the third quarter of 2024 were $5,517 million, compared to $5,628 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 2.0 percent. There were 64 and 63 selling days for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On an average daily sales basis, Net sales decreased 3.5 percent from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024. The decline in Net sales was driven by the Public and Corporate segments, partially offset by our UK and Canadian operations. Continued economic uncertainty and the complex technology landscape has led customers to be cautious and measured in their approach to technology spending, leading to a decline in Net sales. The third quarter of 2024 Net sales performance, on an average daily sales basis, included: \n\n  * Corporate segment Net sales of $2,161 million, 4.4 percent lower than 2023. \n  * Small Business segment Net sales of $380 million, 1.2 percent lower than 2023. \n  * Public segment Net sales of $2,336 million, 5.1 percent lower than 2023. Public results were primarily driven by decrease in Net sales to Government and Education customers of 12.3 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively, partially offset by an increase in Net sales to Healthcare customers of 3.1 percent. \n  * Net sales for CDW's UK and Canadian operations, combined as \"Other\" for financial reporting purposes, were $640 million, 4.8 percent higher than 2023. \n\n\n\nGross profit in the third quarter of 2024 was $1,201 million, compared to $1,228 million for the third quarter of 2023, representing a decrease of 2.2 percent. Gross profit margin remained consistent at 21.8 percent for both the third quarters of 2024 and 2023. \n\nSelling and administrative expenses were $719 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $749 million in the third quarter of 2023, representing a decrease of 4.0 percent. The decrease was primarily due to lower performance-based compensation, including equity-based compensation, consistent with lower attainment against certain financial measures. \n\nOperating income was $482 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $478 million in the third quarter of 2023, representing an increase of 0.7 percent. Non-GAAP operating income was $534 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $556 million in the third quarter of 2023, representing a decrease of 4.0 percent. Operating income margin and Non-GAAP operating income margin were 8.7 percent and 9.7 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2024 versus 8.5 percent and 9.9 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2023. \n\nInterest expense, net includes interest expense and interest income. Interest expense, net was $54 million for third quarter of 2024, compared to $57 million for the third quarter of 2023, representing a decrease of 5.2 percent. The decrease was primarily due to increased interest income earned on higher average cash balances, partially offset by increased interest expense on higher debt levels. \n\nThe effective tax rate was 26.0 percent in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 24.8 percent in the third quarter of 2023, which resulted in income tax expense of $111 million and $104 million, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to lower excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation. \n\nNet income remained consistent at $316 million for both the third quarters of 2024 and 2023. Non-GAAP net income was $355 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $369 million in the third quarter of 2023, representing a decrease of 3.9 percent. \n\nWeighted-average diluted shares outstanding were 135 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 136 million for the third quarter of 2023. Net income per diluted share for the third quarter of 2024 was $2.34, compared to $2.32 for the third quarter of 2023, representing an increase of 1.0 percent. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the third quarter of 2024 was $2.63, compared to $2.72 for the third quarter of 2023, representing a decrease of 3.2 percent. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These statements relate to analyses and other information, which are based on forecasts of future results or events and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. These statements also relate to our future prospects, growth, developments and business strategies. We claim the protection of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for all forward-looking statements in this release. \n\nThese forward-looking statements are identified by the use of terms and phrases such as \"anticipate,\" \"assume,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"goal,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"target\" and similar terms and phrases or future or conditional verbs such as \"could,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" and \"would.\" However, these words are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. Although we believe that our plans, intentions and other expectations reflected in or suggested by such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that we will achieve those plans, intentions or expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those that we expected. \n\nImportant factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from our expectations, or cautionary statements, are disclosed under the sections entitled \"Risk Factors\" and \"Trends and Key Factors Affecting our Financial Performance\" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and from time to time in our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our other US Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") filings and public communications. These factors include, among others, inflationary pressures; level of interest rates; CDW's relationships with vendor partners and terms of their agreements; continued innovations in technology by CDW's vendor partners; the use or capabilities of artificial intelligence; substantial competition that could reduce CDW's market share; the continuing development, maintenance and operation of CDW's information technology systems; potential breaches of data security and failure to protect our information technology systems from cybersecurity threats; potential failures to provide high-quality services to CDW's customers; potential losses of any key personnel, significant increases in labor costs or ineffective workforce management; potential adverse occurrences at one of CDW's primary facilities or third-party data centers, including as a result of climate change; increases in the cost of commercial delivery services or disruptions of those services; CDW's exposure to accounts receivable and inventory risks; future acquisitions or alliances; fluctuations in CDW's operating results; fluctuations in foreign currency; global and regional economic and political conditions, including the impact of pandemics such as COVID-19 and armed conflicts; potential interruptions of the flow of products from suppliers; decreases in spending on technology products and services, including impacts of adverse change in government spending policies; potential failures to comply with Public segment contracts or applicable laws and regulations; current and future legal proceedings, investigations and audits, including intellectual property infringement claims; changes in laws, including regulations or interpretations thereof, or the potential failure to meet stakeholder expectations on environmental sustainability and corporate responsibility matters; CDW's level of indebtedness; restrictions imposed by agreements relating to CDW's indebtedness on its operations and liquidity; failure to maintain the ratings assigned to CDW's debt securities by rating agencies; changes in, or the discontinuation of, CDW's share repurchase program or dividend payments; and other risk factors or uncertainties identified from time to time in CDW's filings with the SEC. All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by those cautionary statements as well as other cautionary statements that are made from time to time in our other SEC filings and public communications. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this release in the context of these risks and uncertainties. \n\nWe caution you that the important factors referenced above may not reflect all of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ from our expectations. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results or developments we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the consequences or affect us or our operations in the way we expect. The forward-looking statements included in this release are made only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\nGenerally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance or financial condition that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with US GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. \n\nOur non-GAAP performance measures include Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP operating income margin, Non-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share and Net sales on a constant currency basis, and our non-GAAP financial condition measures include Free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow. These non-GAAP performance measures and non-GAAP financial condition measures are collectively referred to as \"non-GAAP financial measures.\" \n\nNon-GAAP operating income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, equity-based compensation and the associated payroll taxes, acquisition and integration expenses, transformation initiatives and workplace optimization. Non-GAAP operating income margin is defined as Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of Net sales. Non-GAAP net income and Non-GAAP net income per diluted share exclude, among other things, charges related to acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, equity-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, transformation initiatives, workplace optimization and the associated tax effects of each. Net sales on a constant currency basis is defined as Net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on Net sales. Free cash flow is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as Free cash flow adjusted to include certain cash flows from financing activities incurred in the normal course of operations or as capital expenditures. \n\nWe believe our non-GAAP performance measures provide analysts, investors and management with useful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business, as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. Management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business. We also present non-GAAP financial condition measures as we believe they provide analysts, investors and management with more information regarding our liquidity and capital resources. Certain non-GAAP financial measures are also used to determine certain components of performance-based compensation. \n\nOur outlook includes non-GAAP financial measures because certain reconciling items are dependent on future events that either cannot be controlled, such as currency impacts or interest rates, or reliably predicted because they are not part of our underlying performance, such as refinancing activities or acquisition and integration expenses. \n\nThe financial statement tables that accompany this press release include a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable US GAAP financial measures. \n\nAbout CDW\n\nCDW Corporation is a leading multi-brand provider of information technology solutions to business, government, education and healthcare customers in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or events to differ\nmaterially from those described in such statements. Although CDW believes that its plans, intentions and other expectations reflected in or suggested by such forward-\nlooking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that it will achieve those plans, intentions or expectations. Reference is made to a more complete\ndiscussion of forward-looking statements and applicable risks contained under the captions \"Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors\" in CDW's Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and subsequent filings with the SEC. CDW undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of its forward-looking\nstatements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.\n3\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nGenerally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance or financial condition that either excludes or includes amounts that are\nnot normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with US GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by\nmanagement may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.\nOur non-GAAP performance measures include Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP operating income margin, Non-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income per\ndiluted share and Net sales on a constant currency basis, and our non-GAAP financial condition measures include Free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow. These\nnon-GAAP performance measures and non-GAAP financial condition measures are collectively referred to as \"non-GAAP financial measures.\"\nNon-GAAP operating income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, equity-based compensation\nand the associated payroll taxes, acquisition and integration expenses, transformation initiatives and workplace optimization. Non-GAAP operating income margin is\ndefined as Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of Net sales. Non-GAAP net income and Non-GAAP net income per diluted share exclude, among other things,\ncharges related to acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, equity-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, transformation initiatives,\nworkplace optimization and the associated tax effects of each. Net sales on a constant currency basis is defined as Net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency\ntranslation on Net sales. Free cash flow is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as Free cash\nflow adjusted to include certain cash flows from financing activities incurred in the normal course of operations or as capital expenditures.\nWe believe our non-GAAP performance measures provide analysts, investors and management with useful information regarding the underlying operating\nperformance of our business, as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. Management\nuses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business. We\nalso present non-GAAP financial condition measures as we believe they provide analysts, investors and management with more information regarding our liquidity and\ncapital resources. Certain non-GAAP financial measures are also used to determine certain components of performance-based compensation.\nOur outlook includes non-GAAP financial measures because certain reconciling items are dependent on future events that either cannot be controlled, such as\ncurrency impacts or interest rates, or reliably predicted because they are not part of our underlying performance, such as refinancing activities or acquisition and\nintegration expenses.\nNon-GAAP financial measures in this presentation are denoted with an asterisk (*) when shown. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most\ncomparable US GAAP financial measures, see the CDW Investor Relations website: https://investor.cdw.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx.\n4\nFinancial Performance\n• Net sales of $5.5 billion\n• Down 2.0% on a reported basis\n• Down 3.5% on an average daily sales (\"ADS\") basis\n• Down 3.6% on an ADS constant currency* basis\n• Gross profit of $1.2 billion, down 2.2%\n• Gross profit margin of 21.8%, consistent with prior year\n• Operating income of $482 million, up 0.7%\n• Non-GAAP operating income* of $534 million, down 4.0%\n• Net income of $316 million, up 0.3%\n• Net income per diluted share of $2.34, up 1.0%\n• Non-GAAP net income per diluted share* of $2.63, down 3.2%\n*Non-GAAP Measure\n5\nNet Sales By Channel\n(Unaudited)\n($ in millions)\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nAverage Daily %\n2024 2023 % Change(1) Change(1)\nCorporate $ 2,161.2 $ 2,226.5 (2.9) % (4.4) %\nSmall Business 379.7 378.4 0.3 (1.2)\nPublic\nGovernment 691.0 775.7 (10.9) (12.3)\nEducation 995.7 1,026.7 (3.0) (4.5)\nHealthcare 649.0 619.7 4.7 3.1\nTotal Public 2,335.7 2,422.1 (3.6) (5.1)\nOther 640.0 601.3 6.4 4.8\nTotal Net Sales $ 5,516.6 $ 5,628.3 (2.0) % (3.5) %\n(1) There were 64 and 63 selling days for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

CDW also announced the approval by its Board of Directors of a quarterly cash dividend of\n$0.625 per common share to be paid on December 10, 2024 to all stockholders of record as of the close\nof business on November 25, 2024.\n\"The team's value as a trusted advisor and ability to meet our customers' most pressing needs drove\nstrong performance in cloud and end-point solutions,\" said Christine A. Leahy, chair and chief executive\nofficer, CDW. \"While this performance delivered resilient margins that reinforce the integrity of our\nstrategy, it was not enough to offset the impact of lower hardware solutions demand.\"\n\"Persistent economic uncertainty and growing complexity in the technology landscape resulted in\nelongated customer decision making and delays in projects,\" said Albert J. Miralles, chief financial officer,\nCDW. \"Despite the challenging market, our ability to optimize cash flow generation through effective\nmanagement of our working capital provides strategic flexibility across our capital priorities including M&A\nand share repurchases.\"\n\"In this evolving and dynamic business environment, our value proposition is stronger than ever as\ncustomers turn to CDW to help them address mission-critical IT and operational needs across the full IT\nsolutions stack and lifecycle. We continue to target exceeding US IT market growth by 200 to 300 basis\npoints on a constant currency basis. To achieve this, we remain laser focused on meeting the needs of\nour more than 250,000 customers around the globe and remaining the partner of choice for more than\n1,000 leading and emerging technology brands as the IT market evolves,\" concluded Leahy.\n1\nThird Quarter of 2024 Highlights:\nNet sales in the third quarter of 2024 were $5,517 million, compared to $5,628 million in the third quarter\nof 2023, a decrease of 2.0 percent. There were 64 and 63 selling days for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On an average daily sales basis, Net sales decreased 3.5\npercent from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024. The decline in Net sales was driven by\nthe Public and Corporate segments, partially offset by our UK and Canadian operations. Continued\neconomic uncertainty and the complex technology landscape has led customers to be cautious and\nmeasured in their approach to technology spending, leading to a decline in Net sales. The third quarter of\n2024 Net sales performance, on an average daily sales basis, included:\n• Corporate segment Net sales of $2,161 million, 4.4 percent lower than 2023.\n• Small Business segment Net sales of $380 million, 1.2 percent lower than 2023.\n• Public segment Net sales of $2,336 million, 5.1 percent lower than 2023. Public results were\nprimarily driven by decrease in Net sales to Government and Education customers of 12.3\npercent and 4.5 percent, respectively, partially offset by an increase in Net sales to Healthcare\ncustomers of 3.1 percent.\n• Net sales for CDW's UK and Canadian operations, combined as \"Other\" for financial reporting\npurposes, were $640 million, 4.8 percent higher than 2023.\nGross profit in the third quarter of 2024 was $1,201 million, compared to $1,228 million for the third\nquarter of 2023, representing a decrease of 2.2 percent. Gross profit margin remained consistent at 21.8\npercent for both the third quarters of 2024 and 2023.\nSelling and administrative expenses were $719 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $749\nmillion in the third quarter of 2023, representing a decrease of 4.0 percent. The decrease was primarily\ndue to lower performance-based compensation, including equity-based compensation, consistent with\nlower attainment against certain financial measures.\nOperating income was $482 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $478 million in the third\nquarter of 2023, representing an increase of 0.7 percent. Non-GAAP operating income was $534 million\nin the third quarter of 2024, compared to $556 million in the third quarter of 2023, representing a\ndecrease of 4.0 percent. Operating income margin and Non-GAAP operating income margin were 8.7\npercent and 9.7 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2024 versus 8.5 percent and 9.9 percent,\nrespectively, for the third quarter of 2023.\nInterest expense, net includes interest expense and interest income. Interest expense, net was $54\nmillion for third quarter of 2024, compared to $57 million for the third quarter of 2023, representing a\ndecrease of 5.2 percent. The decrease was primarily due to increased interest income earned on higher\naverage cash balances, partially offset by increased interest expense on higher debt levels.\nThe effective tax rate was 26.0 percent in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 24.8 percent in the third\nquarter of 2023, which resulted in income tax expense of $111 million and $104 million, respectively. The\nincrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to lower excess tax benefits on equity-based\ncompensation.\nNet income remained consistent at $316 million for both the third quarters of 2024 and 2023. Non-GAAP\nnet income was $355 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $369 million in the third quarter of\n2023, representing a decrease of 3.9 percent.\nWeighted-average diluted shares outstanding were 135 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to\n136 million for the third quarter of 2023. Net income per diluted share for the third quarter of 2024 was\n$2.34, compared to $2.32 for the third quarter of 2023, representing an increase of 1.0 percent. Non-\nGAAP net income per diluted share for the third quarter of 2024 was $2.63, compared to $2.72 for the\nthird quarter of 2023, representing a decrease of 3.2 percent.\n2\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

Non-\nGAAP measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even\nwhen similar terms are used to identify such measures.\nOur non-GAAP performance measures include Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP operating\nincome margin, Non-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share and Net sales on a\nconstant currency basis, and our non-GAAP financial condition measures include Free cash flow and\nAdjusted free cash flow. These non-GAAP performance measures and non-GAAP financial condition\nmeasures are collectively referred to as \"non-GAAP financial measures.\"\nNon-GAAP operating income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of\nacquisition-related intangible assets, equity-based compensation and the associated payroll taxes,\nacquisition and integration expenses, transformation initiatives and workplace optimization. Non-GAAP\noperating income margin is defined as Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of Net sales. Non-\nGAAP net income and Non-GAAP net income per diluted share exclude, among other things, charges\nrelated to acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, equity-based compensation, acquisition and\nintegration expenses, transformation initiatives, workplace optimization and the associated tax effects of\neach. Net sales on a constant currency basis is defined as Net sales excluding the impact of foreign\ncurrency translation on Net sales. Free cash flow is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities\nless capital expenditures. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as Free cash flow adjusted to include certain\ncash flows from financing activities incurred in the normal course of operations or as capital expenditures.\nWe believe our non-GAAP performance measures provide analysts, investors and management with\nuseful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business, as they remove the\nimpact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance.\nManagement uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes\nthey provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business. We also present non-GAAP\nfinancial condition measures as we believe they provide analysts, investors and management with more\ninformation regarding our liquidity and capital resources. Certain non-GAAP financial measures are also\nused to determine certain components of performance-based compensation.\nOur outlook includes non-GAAP financial measures because certain reconciling items are dependent on\nfuture events that either cannot be controlled, such as currency impacts or interest rates, or reliably\npredicted because they are not part of our underlying performance, such as refinancing activities or\nacquisition and integration expenses.\nThe financial statement tables that accompany this press release include a reconciliation of non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to the most comparable US GAAP financial measures.\nAbout CDW\nCDW Corporation is a leading multi-brand provider of information technology solutions to business,\ngovernment, education and healthcare customers in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.\nA Fortune 500 company and member of the S&P 500 Index, CDW helps its customers to navigate an\nincreasingly complex IT market and maximize return on their technology investments.

The significant accounting policies and estimates used in preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements were applied on a basis\nconsistent with those reflected in the December 31, 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Parent and its 100% owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts\nare eliminated in consolidation.\n2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic\n740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This ASU enhances existing income tax disclosures primarily through standardization and\ndisaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The ASU is effective for all public entities for annual periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. Entities should apply the amendments on a prospective basis, but retrospective\napplication is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This ASU\nimproves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses included in a\nsegment’s profit or loss measure on an annual and interim basis. The ASU is effective for all public entities for fiscal years beginning after December\n15, 2023, and interim\n9\nTable of Contents\nCDW CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)\nperiods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Entities are required to apply the amendments on a retrospective basis. The Company\nis currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its disclosures.\n3. Accounts Receivable and Contract Balances\nAccounts Receivable\nThe following table details the total accounts receivable recognized and the related classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAccounts receivable, current(1) $ 4,894.0 $ 4,567.5\nAccounts receivable, noncurrent(2) 639.4 337.5\nTotal accounts receivable $ 5,533.4 $ 4,905.0\n(1) Accounts receivable, current are presented within Accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(2) Accounts receivable, noncurrent are presented within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFrom time to time, the Company transfers certain accounts receivable, without recourse, to third-party financial companies as a method to reduce the\nCompany’s credit exposure and accelerate cash collections. Such transfers are recognized as a sale and the related accounts receivable are\nderecognized from the Consolidated Balance Sheet upon receipt of payment from the third-party financing company. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company sold approximately $337 million and $382 million of accounts receivable, respectively.\nContract Balances\nContract assets and liabilities represent the difference in the timing of revenue recognition from receipt of cash from customers. Contract assets\nrepresent revenue recognized on performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied for which the Company has no unconditional right to\nconsideration. Contract liabilities consist of payments received from customers, or such consideration that is contractually due, in advance of\nproviding the product or performing services. The following table details information about the Company’s contract balances recognized on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nContract assets(1) $ 91.0 $ 111.8\nContract liabilities(2)(3) $ 505.0 $ 527.4\n(1) Contract assets are presented within Prepaid expenses and other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(2) Includes $30 million and $40 million of long-term contract liabilities that are presented within Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.\n(3) For both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized revenue of $293 million related to its contract liabilities that were included in the\nbeginning balance of the respective periods.\nA contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is\nsatisfied. The following table represents the total transaction price for the remaining performance obligations as of September 30, 2024 related to non-\ncancelable services contracts whereby the Company is acting as the principal and the duration is longer than 12 months, which is expected to be\nrecognized over future periods.\nWithin 1 Year Years 1-2 Years 2-3 Thereafter\nRemaining performance obligations $ 108.3 $ 64.6 $ 30.3 $ 11.5\n4. Inventory Financing Agreements\nThe Company has entered into agreements with financial institutions to facilitate the purchase of inventory from designated suppliers under certain\nterms and conditions to enhance liquidity. Under these agreements, the Company\n10\nTable of Contents\nCDW CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)\nreceives extended payment terms and agrees to pay the financial institutions a stated amount of confirmed invoices from its designated suppliers. The\nCompany does not incur any interest or other incremental expenses associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due.\nAdditionally, the Company has no involvement in establishing the terms or conditions of the arrangements between its suppliers and the financial\ninstitutions.\nThe amounts outstanding under these agreements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $357 million and $431 million, respectively,\nand are separately presented as Accounts payable-inventory financing on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The majority of such outstanding amounts\nrelates to a floorplan sub-facility that is incorporated in the Company’s Revolving Loan Facility, as defined within Note 5 (Debt). A portion of the\nCompany’s availability under the Revolving Loan Facility is reserved to cover the obligation to pay the financial institution. For additional\ninformation regarding the Revolving Loan Facility, see Note 5 (Debt).\n5.

The interest rate is based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus a spread\nadjustment and a margin based on the Company’s senior unsecured rating. The Revolving Loan Facility is used by the Company for borrowings,\nissuances of letters of credit and floorplan financing. As of September 30, 2024, the Company could have borrowed up to an additional $1.3\nbillion under the Revolving Loan Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the Revolving Loan Facility had $346 million reserved for the floorplan sub-\nfacility.\nTerm Loan\nThe senior unsecured term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) has a variable interest rate. The interest rate is based on SOFR plus a spread\nadjustment and a margin based on the Company’s senior unsecured rating. No mandatory payments are required on the remaining principal amount\nuntil its maturity date on December 1, 2026.\nUnsecured Senior Notes\nThe unsecured senior notes have a fixed interest rate, which is paid semi-annually.\nReceivable Financing\nThe receivable financing liability relates to certain accounts receivable transferred to third-party financial institutions that did not qualify as a sale\nunder the terms of the agreements. While the terms of such agreements are on a nonrecourse basis, the transfers of accounts receivable could not\nachieve certain criteria that would allow derecognition of the accounts receivable. The proceeds from these arrangements are recognized as a liability\nand the associated accounts receivable remains on the Consolidated Balance Sheet until the liability is settled. The Company did not execute any\ntransfers under these agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nDebt Issuances and Extinguishments\nOn August 22, 2024, the Company completed the issuance of $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.100% Senior Notes due 2030 (the “2030\nNotes”) at 99.889% of par and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.550% Senior Notes due 2034 (the “2034 Notes”) at 99.742% of par\n(collectively, the “Notes”). Interest on the 2030 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. Interest on the 2034 Notes\nis payable semi-annually on February 22 and August 22 of each year. The net proceeds from the Notes issuance were used to fund the settlement of the\nconcurrent cash tender offer and the payment of related accrued and unpaid interest, fees and expenses and general corporate purposes, including the\nredemption of the remaining 5.500% Senior Notes due 2024 and the repayment at maturity of the remaining 4.125% Senior Notes due 2025.\nOn August 22, 2024, concurrent with the Notes issuance, the Company completed a cash tender offer for $391 million and $389 million of the\noutstanding aggregate principal amounts under its 5.500% Senior Notes due 2024 and the 4.125% Senior Notes due 2025, respectively, plus accrued\nand unpaid interest, fees and expenses. In connection with the cash tender offer, the Company recognized an immaterial net gain on extinguishment of\ndebt, which is presented within Other income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFair Value\nThe fair values of the unsecured senior notes were estimated using quoted market prices for identical liabilities that are traded in over-the-counter\nsecondary markets. The fair value of the Term Loan Facility was estimated using dealer quotes and other market observable inputs for comparable\nliabilities. The unsecured senior notes and Term Loan Facility were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value of the\nRevolving Loan Facility approximates fair value.\n12\nTable of Contents\nCDW CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)\nThe approximate fair values and related carrying values of the Company’s long-term debt, including current maturities and excluding unamortized\ndiscount and unamortized debt issuance costs, were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nFair value $ 5,895.2 $ 5,348.2\nCarrying value $ 6,065.5 $ 5,673.3\n6. Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company may use derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. The Company does not hold or issue derivative\nfinancial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The following sections detail the Company’s derivative financial instruments.\nInterest Rate Collars\nThe Company’s variable interest rate debt creates interest rate risk. The Company has interest rate collar agreements that provide for a contractually\nspecified interest rate cap and an interest rate floor based on SOFR. The Company receives payment from the counterparty if SOFR is greater than the\ncap or pays the counterparty if SOFR is below the floor. If SOFR is between the floor and cap, no payment is due to either party. There were no new\ninterest rate collar agreements executed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the interest rate collar agreements were classified within Long-term liabilities - Other liabilities on\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets for which the fair value was not material. The total notional amount of the interest rate collar agreements was $400\nmillion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and these agreements mature on September 30, 2026.\nThe fair values of the Company’s interest rate collar agreements are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The valuation of the interest rate\ncollar agreements is derived using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash receipts or cash disbursements that would occur if variable\ninterest rates rise above or fall below the strike rates of the interest rate cap and interest rate floor, respectively. This analysis reflects the contractual\nterms of the interest rate collar agreements, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including SOFR curves and\nimplied volatilities. The Company also incorporates insignificant credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect the respective counterparty’s\nnonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. The counterparty credit spreads are based on publicly available credit information obtained from\na third-party credit data provider.\nThe interest rate collars are designated as cash flow hedges. The changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded\nin Accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCL”) and are subsequently reclassified into Interest expense, net in the period when the hedged\nforecasted transaction affects earnings. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the changes in fair value for the\neffective portion of the derivative financial instruments and the reclassification from AOCL to Interest expense, net were not material.\nTreasury Locks\nThe Company used treasury lock agreements to manage interest rate risk in advance of the issuance of fixed rate debt. During the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company executed and settled treasury lock agreements for a total notional value of $600 million, concurrent with the\nissuance of unsecured senior notes. The treasury lock agreements were settled at an immaterial loss. For additional information regarding the issuance\nof the unsecured senior notes, see Note 5 (Debt).\nThe treasury lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges. The loss on the settlement was recorded to AOCL and is subsequently reclassified\ninto Interest expense, net over the term of the debt in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. During the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the reclassification from AOCL to Interest expense, net was not material.\n13\nTable of Contents\nCDW CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)\nShort-term Investments\nShort-term investments, which have a maturity that extends beyond three months but within one year, is comprised of a certificate of deposit. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the amortized cost of the certificate of deposit was $212 million and is classified within Short-term investments on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the short-term investment approximates the carrying value due to its short-term nature and is classified\nas a Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n7. Income Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $111 million and $104 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate,\nexpressed by calculating the income tax expense as a percentage of Income before income taxes, was 26.0% and 24.8% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIncome tax expense was $270 million and $261 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate\nwas 24.9% and 24.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe effective tax rate for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differed from the US federal statutory rate of 21.0%\nprimarily due to state and local income taxes, partially offset by excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nThe numerator for both basic and diluted earnings per share is Net income. The denominator for basic earnings per share is the weighted-average\nshares outstanding during the period.\nA reconciliation of basic weighted-average shares outstanding to diluted weighted-average shares outstanding is as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBasic weighted-average shares outstanding 133.5 134.1 134.0 134.8\nEffect of dilutive securities(1) 1.4 1.8 1.5 1.6\nDiluted weighted-average shares outstanding(2) 134.9 135.9 135.5 136.4\n(1) The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, performance share units and Coworker Stock Purchase Plan units is reflected in the diluted weighted-\naverage shares outstanding using the treasury stock method.\n(2) There were fewer than 0.2 million potential common shares excluded from diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for both the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023. Inclusion of these common shares in diluted weighted-average shares outstanding would have had an anti-dilutive effect.\n9. Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company is party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business, which include commercial, intellectual property,\nemployment, tort and other litigation matters. The Company is also subject to audit by federal, state, international, national, provincial and local\nauthorities, and by various partners, group purchasing organizations and customers, including government agencies, relating to purchases and sales\nunder various contracts. In addition, the Company is subject to indemnification claims under various contracts. From time to time, certain customers\nof the Company file voluntary petitions for reorganization or liquidation under the US bankruptcy laws or similar laws of the jurisdictions for the\nCompany’s business activities outside of the US. In such cases, certain pre-petition payments received by the Company could be considered\npreference items and subject to return to the bankruptcy administrator.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company does not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already\nrecognized for these proceedings and matters, if any, has been incurred. However, the ultimate resolutions of these proceedings and matters are\ninherently unpredictable. As such, the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements could be adversely affected in any particular period by the\nunfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings or matters.\n14\nTable of Contents\nCDW CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted)\nThe Company received a Civil Investigative Demand, issued by the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) on June 11, 2024, in connection with a False\nClaims Act investigation. The DOJ requested information relating to bids the Company submitted for contracts funded in whole or in part by the\nSchools and Libraries Program (E-Rate Program). The Company is cooperating with the DOJ and, at this stage of the investigation, is unable to assess\nthe probability of any outcome or the range of possible loss, if any.\n10. Segment Information\nThe Company’s segment information reflects the way the chief operating decision maker uses internal reporting to evaluate business performance,\nallocate resources and manage operations.\nThe Company has three reportable segments: Corporate, which is primarily comprised of private sector business customers with more than 250\nemployees in the US, Small Business, which is primarily comprised of private sector business customers with up to 250 employees in the US, and\nPublic, which is comprised of government agencies and education and healthcare institutions in the US. The Company has two other operating\nsegments: CDW UK and CDW Canada, both of which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds and, accordingly, are included in an\nall other category (“Other”).\nThe Company has centralized logistics and headquarters functions that provide services to the segments. The logistics function includes purchasing,\ndistribution and fulfillment services to support the Corporate, Small Business and Public segments. As a result, costs and intercompany charges\nassociated with the logistics function are fully allocated to all of these segments based on a percent of Net sales. The centralized headquarters function\nprovides services in areas such as accounting, information technology, marketing, legal and coworker services.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to\nnumerous risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking\nStatements” at the end of this discussion.\nOverview\nCDW Corporation (“Parent”), a Fortune 500 company and member of the S&P 500 Index, is a leading multi-brand provider of information technology (“IT”)\nsolutions to small, medium and large business, government, education and healthcare customers in the United States (“US”), the United Kingdom (“UK”) and\nCanada. Our broad array of offerings ranges from discrete hardware and software products to integrated IT solutions and services that include on-premise and\ncloud capabilities across hybrid infrastructure, digital experience and security.\nWe have three reportable segments: Corporate, Small Business and Public. Our Corporate segment primarily serves US private sector business customers with\nmore than 250 employees. Our Small Business segment primarily serves US private sector business customers with up to 250 employees. Our Public segment\nis comprised of government agencies and education and healthcare institutions in the US. We also have two other operating segments: CDW UK and CDW\nCanada, each of which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds and, accordingly, are included in an all other category (“Other”).\nWe are vendor, technology and consumption model unbiased, with a solutions portfolio including more than 100,000 products and services from more than\n1,000 leading and emerging brands. Our solutions are delivered in physical, virtual and cloud-based environments through approximately 11,200 customer-\nfacing coworkers, including sellers, highly-skilled technology specialists and advanced service delivery engineers. We are a leading sales channel partner for\nmany original equipment manufacturers, software publishers and cloud providers (collectively, our “vendor partners”), whose products we sell or include in the\nsolutions we offer. We provide our vendor partners with a cost-effective way to reach customers and deliver a consistent brand experience through our\nestablished end-market coverage, technical expertise and extensive customer access.\nWe may sell all or only select products that our vendor partners offer. Each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions, which may\ninclude one or more of the following: product return privileges, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs, such as purchase\nor sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements. We also resell software for major software publishers. Our agreements with software publishers\nallow the end-user customer to acquire software or licensed products and services. In addition to helping our customers determine the best software solutions\nfor their needs, we help them manage their software agreements, including warranties and renewals. A significant portion of our advertising and marketing\nexpenses are reimbursed through cooperative advertising programs with our vendor partners. These programs are at the discretion of our vendor partners and\nare typically tied to sales or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time.\nTrends and Key Factors Affecting our Financial Performance\nWe believe the following key factors may have a meaningful impact on our business performance, influencing our ability to generate sales and achieve our\ntargeted financial and operating results:\n• General economic conditions are a key factor affecting our results as they can impact our customers’ willingness and ability to spend on information\ntechnology. Macroeconomic uncertainty persists as a result of the inflationary environment and corresponding level of interest rates driven by\nmonetary policy. The uncertainty in the current economic environment resulted in, and may continue to result in, a delay, pause or reduction of\ninvestments in technology by our customers.\n• Customers are evaluating the complex technology landscape in order to balance priorities and focus on solutions that lead to business optimization,\ncost management and security risk management, resulting in a more measured approach to their IT spending. We have orchestrated solutions by\nleveraging security, software and hybrid and cloud offerings to help customers achieve their objectives.\n• Changes and uncertainty related to spending policies, budget priorities, timing and funding levels, including current and future stimulus packages, are\nkey factors influencing the purchasing levels of government, healthcare and education customers. As the duration and ongoing impact of current\neconomic conditions remain uncertain, current\n21\nTable of Contents\nand future budget priorities and funding levels for government, healthcare and education customers may be adversely affected, leading to lower IT\nspend.\n• Technology trends drive customer purchasing behaviors in the market. Current technology trends are focused on delivering greater flexibility and\nefficiency, as well as designing and managing IT securely. These trends are driving customer adoption of cloud, generative artificial intelligence,\nsoftware defined architectures and hybrid on-premise and off-premise combinations. The trends are further driven by the evolution of the IT\nconsumption model to more “as a service” offerings, including software as a service and infrastructure as a service, in addition to ongoing managed\nand professional service arrangements. Technology trends are likely to evolve as customers prioritize spend that will produce the most important\noutcomes for their business.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe monitor a number of financial and non-financial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments\nas necessary. Financial measures include both US GAAP, the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and Non-GAAP, which\nexcludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with\nUS GAAP. We believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include Gross profit, Gross profit margin, Operating income, Operating income\nmargin, Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP operating income margin, Net income, Non-GAAP net income, Net income per diluted share, Non-GAAP\nnet income per diluted share, Average daily sales, Net cash provided by operating activities, Adjusted free cash flow, Cash conversion cycle, and Net debt.\nThese measures and ratios are closely monitored by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve financial objectives.\nFor the definitions, discussion of management’s use of Non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable US GAAP measure, see\n“Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations.”\nThe results of certain key business metrics for the comparative periods are as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(dollars in millions, except per share amounts and percentages) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet sales $ 5,516.6 $ 5,628.3 $ 15,812.7 $ 16,357.5\nGross profit $ 1,200.7 $ 1,227.7 $ 3,447.1 $ 3,498.6\nGross profit margin 21.8 % 21.8 % 21.8 % 21.4 %\nOperating income $ 481.6 $ 478.4 $ 1,242.7 $ 1,245.9\nOperating income margin 8.7 % 8.5 % 7.9 % 7.6 %\nNon-GAAP operating income $ 534.0 $ 556.3 $ 1,447.8 $ 1,520.4\nNon-GAAP operating income margin 9.7 % 9.9 % 9.2 % 9.3 %\nNet income $ 316.4 $ 315.5 $ 813.6 $ 808.2\nNon-GAAP net income $ 354.9 $ 369.4 $ 954.5 $ 997.1\nNet income per diluted share $ 2.34 $ 2.32 $ 6.00 $ 5.92\nNon-GAAP net income per diluted share $ 2.63 $ 2.72 $ 7.04 $ 7.31\nAverage daily sales(1) $ 86.2 $ 89.3 $ 82.4 $ 85.6\n(1) Defined as Net sales divided by the number of selling days.

The\ndecrease was primarily due to a decrease in netcomm products, partially offset by an increase in notebooks/mobile devices. Continued economic uncertainty\nand the complex technology landscape has led customers to be cautious and measured in their approach to technology spending, leading to a decline in Net\nsales.\nGross profit decreased $27 million, or 2.2%, primarily due to lower Net sales across various hardware categories, partially offset by increased netted down\nrevenue. Gross profit margin, expressed as Gross profit as a percentage of Net sales, remained consistent at 21.8%.\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased $30 million, or 4.0%, primarily due to lower performance-based compensation, including equity-based\ncompensation, consistent with lower attainment against certain financial measures.\nOperating income increased $3 million, or 0.7%, to $482 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $478 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\nInterest expense, net includes interest expense and interest income. Interest expense, net decreased $3 million, or 5.2%, primarily due to increased interest\nincome earned on higher average cash balances, partially offset by increased interest expense on higher debt levels.\nIncome tax expense increased $7 million, or 6.6%. The effective tax rate, expressed by calculating income tax expense as a percentage of Income before\nincome taxes, was 26.0% and 24.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily\nattributable to lower excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nNet sales decreased $545 million, or 3.3%, with lower Net sales across all operating segments. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in netcomm and\ncollaboration products, partially offset by an increase in notebooks/mobile devices. Continued economic uncertainty and the complex technology landscape has\nled customers to be cautious and measured in their approach to technology spending, leading to a decline in Net sales.\nGross profit decreased $52 million, or 1.5%. Gross profit margin, expressed as Gross profit as a percentage of Net sales, increased 40 basis points primarily\ndriven by a higher contribution of netted down revenue, primarily software as a service, partially offset by an increased mix into notebooks/mobile devices.\n23\nTable of Contents\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased $48 million, or 2.1%, primarily due to lower performance-based compensation, including equity-based\ncompensation, consistent with lower attainment against certain financial measures, and lower workplace optimization costs, partially offset by increased\ntransformation and other related costs.\nOperating income decreased $3 million, or 0.3%, to $1,243 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $1,246 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\nInterest expense, net decreased $15 million, or 8.8%, primarily due to increased interest income earned on higher average cash balances and decreased interest\nexpense on lower average debt levels during 2024, partially offset by higher variable interest rate on the senior unsecured term loan.\nIncome tax expense increased $9 million, or 3.4%. The effective tax rate was 24.9% and 24.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to lower excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation.\n24\nTable of Contents\nSegment Results of Operations\nNet sales by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of total Net sales, and the year-over-year dollar, percentage and average daily sales percentage change in\nNet sales by segment are as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nPercentage Percentage Dollar Percent Average Daily Sales\n(dollars in millions) Net Sales of Total Net Sales Net Sales of Total Net Sales Change Change(1) Percent Change(1)\nCorporate $ 2,161.2 39.2 % $ 2,226.5 39.6 % $ (65.3) (2.9)% (4.4)%\nSmall Business 379.7 6.9 378.4 6.7 1.3 0.3 (1.2)\nPublic:\nGovernment 691.0 12.5 775.7 13.8 (84.7) (10.9) (12.3)\nEducation 995.7 18.0 1,026.7 18.2 (31.0) (3.0) (4.5)\nHealthcare 649.0 11.8 619.7 11.0 29.3 4.7 3.1\nTotal Public 2,335.7 42.3 2,422.1 43.0 (86.4) (3.6) (5.1)\nOther 640.0 11.6 601.3 10.7 38.7 6.4 4.8\nTotal Net sales $ 5,516.6 100.0 % $ 5,628.3 100.0 % $ (111.7) (2.0)% (3.5)%\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nPercentage Percentage Dollar Percent Average Daily Sales\n(dollars in millions) Net Sales of Total Net Sales Net Sales of Total Net Sales Change Change(1) Percent Change(1)\nCorporate $ 6,492.3 41.1 % $ 6,675.2 40.8 % $ (182.9) (2.7)% (3.2)%\nSmall Business 1,143.5 7.2 1,186.0 7.3 (42.5) (3.6) (4.1)\nPublic:\nGovernment 1,873.4 11.8 2,008.4 12.3 (135.0) (6.7) (7.2)\nEducation 2,609.9 16.5 2,719.2 16.6 (109.3) (4.0) (4.5)\nHealthcare 1,820.4 11.5 1,802.4 11.0 18.0 1.0 0.5\nTotal Public 6,303.7 39.8 6,530.0 39.9 (226.3) (3.5) (4.0)\nOther 1,873.2 11.9 1,966.3 12.0 (93.1) (4.7) (5.2)\nTotal Net sales $ 15,812.7 100.0 % $ 16,357.5 100.0 % $ (544.8) (3.3)% (3.8)%\n(1) There were 64 and 63 selling days for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Non-GAAP\nmeasures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.\nOur non-GAAP performance measures include Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP operating income margin, Non-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net\nincome per diluted share and Net sales on a constant currency basis, and our non-GAAP financial condition measures include Free cash flow and Adjusted free\ncash flow. These non-GAAP performance measures and non-GAAP financial condition measures are collectively referred to as “non-GAAP financial\nmeasures.”\nNon-GAAP operating income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, equity-based\ncompensation and the associated payroll taxes, acquisition and integration expenses, transformation initiatives and workplace optimization. Non-GAAP\noperating income margin is defined as Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of Net sales. Non-GAAP net income and Non-GAAP net income per\ndiluted share exclude, among other things, charges related to acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, equity-based compensation, acquisition and\nintegration\n27\nTable of Contents\nexpenses, transformation initiatives, workplace optimization and the associated tax effects of each. Net sales on a constant currency basis is defined as Net\nsales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on Net sales. Free cash flow is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities less capital\nexpenditures. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as Free cash flow adjusted to include certain cash flows from financing activities incurred in the normal course\nof operations or as capital expenditures.\nWe believe our non-GAAP performance measures provide analysts, investors and management with useful information regarding the underlying operating\nperformance of our business, as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance.\nManagement uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the\nunderlying business. We also present non-GAAP financial condition measures as we believe they provide analysts, investors and management with more\ninformation regarding our liquidity and capital resources. Certain non-GAAP financial measures are also used to determine certain components of\nperformance-based compensation.\nWe have included reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable US GAAP financial measures for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023 below.\nNon-GAAP operating income and Non-GAAP operating income margin\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n(dollars in millions) 2024 Percentage of Net Sales 2023 Percentage of Net Sales Percent Change\nOperating income, as reported $ 481.6 8.7 % $ 478.4 8.5 % 0.7 %\nAmortization of intangibles(1) 37.7 37.3\nEquity-based compensation 2.7 26.0\nTransformation initiatives(2) 8.3 6.4\nAcquisition and integration expenses 0.5 7.1\nWorkplace optimization(3) 2.2 (0.4)\nOther adjustments 1.0 1.5\nNon-GAAP operating income $ 534.0 9.7 % $ 556.3 9.9 % (4.0)%\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(dollars in millions) 2024 Percentage of Net Sales 2023 Percentage of Net Sales Percent Change\nOperating income, as reported $ 1,242.7 7.9 % $ 1,245.9 7.6 % (0.3)%\nAmortization of intangibles(1) 113.2 116.2\nEquity-based compensation 50.8 71.6\nTransformation initiatives(2) 23.1 16.0\nAcquisition and integration expenses 2.1 24.7\nWorkplace optimization(3) 9.5 42.5\nOther adjustments 6.4 3.5\nNon-GAAP operating income $ 1,447.8 9.2 % $ 1,520.4 9.3 % (4.8)%\n(1) Includes amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, customer contracts and trade names.\n(2) Includes costs related to strategic transformation initiatives focused on optimizing various operations and systems.\n(3) Includes costs related to the workforce reduction program and charges related to the reduction of our real estate lease portfolio.\n28\nTable of Contents\nNon-GAAP net income and Non-GAAP net income per diluted share\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nIncome before Income tax Income before Income tax Net Income\n(dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts) income taxes expense(1) Net income income taxes expense(1) Net income Percent Change\nUS GAAP, as reported $ 427.6 $ (111.2) $ 316.4 $ 419.8 $ (104.3) $ 315.5 0.3 %\nAmortization of intangibles(2) 37.7 (9.8) 27.9 37.3 (9.7) 27.6\nEquity-based compensation 2.7 (0.3) 2.4 26.0 (10.3) 15.7\nTransformation initiatives(3) 8.3 (2.1) 6.2 6.4 (1.7) 4.7\nAcquisition and integration expenses 0.5 (0.1) 0.4 7.1 (1.8) 5.3\nWorkplace optimization(4) 2.2 (0.6) 1.6 (0.4) — (0.4)\nOther adjustments 0.1 (0.1) — 1.5 (0.5) 1.0\nNon-GAAP $ 479.1 $ (124.2) $ 354.9 $ 497.7 $ (128.3) $ 369.4 (3.9)%\nNet income per diluted share, as reported $ 2.34 $ 2.32\nNon-GAAP net income per diluted share $ 2.63 $ 2.72\nShares used in computing US GAAP and Non-\nGAAP net income per diluted share 134.9 135.9\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nIncome before Income tax Income before Income tax Net Income\n(dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts) income taxes expense(1) Net income income taxes expense(1) Net income Percent Change\nUS GAAP, as reported $ 1,083.9 $ (270.3) $ 813.6 $ 1,069.5 $ (261.3) $ 808.2 0.7 %\nAmortization of intangibles(2) 113.2 (29.4) 83.8 116.2 (30.2) 86.0\nEquity-based compensation 50.8 (23.4) 27.4 71.6 (32.7) 38.9\nTransformation initiatives(3) 23.1 (6.0) 17.1 16.0 (4.2) 11.8\nAcquisition and integration expenses 2.1 (0.5) 1.6 24.7 (6.4) 18.3\nWorkplace optimization(4) 9.5 (2.5) 7.0 42.5 (11.1) 31.4\nOther adjustments 5.5 (1.5) 4.0 3.5 (1.0) 2.5\nNon-GAAP $ 1,288.1 $ (333.6) $ 954.5 $ 1,344.0 $ (346.9) $ 997.1 (4.3)%\nNet income per diluted share, as reported $ 6.00 $ 5.92\nNon-GAAP net income per diluted share $ 7.04 $ 7.31\nShares used in computing US GAAP and Non-\nGAAP net income per diluted share 135.5 136.4\n(1) Income tax on non-GAAP adjustments includes excess tax benefits associated with equity-based compensation.\n(2) Includes amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, customer contracts and trade names.\n(3) Includes costs related to strategic transformation initiatives focused on optimizing various operations and systems.\n(4) Includes costs related to the workforce reduction program and charges related to the reduction of our real estate lease portfolio.\n29\nTable of Contents\nNet sales on a constant currency basis\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\nPercent Average Daily % Percent Average Daily %\n(dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Change(1) Change(1) 2024 2023 Change(1) Change(1)\nNet sales, as reported $ 5,516.6 $ 5,628.3 (2.0)% (3.5)% $ 15,812.7 $ 16,357.5 (3.3)% (3.8)%\nForeign currency\ntranslation(2) — 6.6 — 27.2\nNet sales, on a constant\ncurrency basis $ 5,516.6 $ 5,634.9 (2.1)% (3.6)% $ 15,812.7 $ 16,384.7 (3.5)% (4.0)%\n(1) There were 64 and 63 selling days for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

As of September 30, 2024, we had $1.3 billion of availability for borrowings under our Revolving Loan Facility. Our liquidity\nand borrowing plans are established to align with our financial and strategic planning processes and ensure we have the necessary funding to meet our\noperating commitments, which primarily include the purchase of inventory, payroll and general expenses. We also take into consideration our overall capital\nallocation strategy, which includes dividend payments, assessment of debt levels, acquisitions and share repurchases. We believe we have adequate sources of\nliquidity and funding available for at least the next year; however, there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds. The\namount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of our business plan, general economic conditions\nand working capital management.\nLong-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had total unsecured indebtedness of $6.0 billion, and we were in compliance with the covenants under our credit agreements and\nindentures.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.100% Senior Notes due 2030 and $600 million aggregate principal\namount of 5.550% Senior Notes due 2034 (collectively, the “Notes”). Concurrent with the Notes issuance, we settled a cash tender offer for $391 million and\n$389 million of the outstanding aggregate principal amounts under the 5.500% Senior Notes due 2024 and the 4.125% Senior Notes due 2025, respectively.\nWe may from time to time repurchase one or more series of our outstanding unsecured senior notes, depending on market conditions, contractual commitments,\nour capital needs and other factors. Repurchases of our senior notes may be made by\n30\nTable of Contents\nopen market or privately negotiated transactions and may be pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans or otherwise. On October 7, 2024, we redeemed the remaining\noutstanding 5.500% Senior Notes due 2024, which were scheduled to mature on December 1, 2024, at par for $184 million.\nFor additional information regarding our debt and refinancing activities, see Note 5 (Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInventory Financing Agreements\nWe have entered into agreements with certain financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and\nconditions to enhance liquidity. These amounts are classified separately as Accounts payable-inventory financing on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do\nnot incur any interest expense or other incremental expenses associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due. For additional\ninformation, see Note 4 (Inventory Financing Agreements) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock for $354 million under the previously announced\nshare repurchase program.

Components of\nour cash conversion cycle are as follows:\nSeptember 30,\n(in days) 2024 2023\nDays of sales outstanding (DSO)(1) 79 73\nDays of supply in inventory (DIO)(2) 14 14\nDays of purchases outstanding (DPO)(3) (76) (72)\nCash conversion cycle 17 15\n(1) Represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of Accounts receivable, net at the end of the period, divided by average daily Net sales for the same three-month period. Also\nincorporates components of other miscellaneous receivables.\n(2) Represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of Merchandise inventory at the end of the period divided by average daily Cost of sales for the same three-month period.\n(3) Represents the rolling three-month average of the combined balance of Accounts payable-trade, excluding cash overdrafts, and Accounts payable-inventory financing at the end of the\nperiod divided by average daily Cost of sales for the same three-month period.\nThe cash conversion cycle increased to 17 days at September 30, 2024, compared to 15 days at September 30, 2023. The overall increase was primarily driven\nby an increase in DSO due to multi-year transactions and timing of collections. This was partially offset by an increase in DPO due to multi-year transactions\nand timing of payments. Netted down revenue results in an increase to both DSO and DPO as the corresponding receivables and payables reflect the gross\namounts due from customers and due to vendors while the corresponding sales and cost of sales are reflected on a net basis within Net sales.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $110 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. This increase was\nprimarily due to purchases of short-term investments with no similar activity in the prior year, partially offset by cash flows for acquisitions in 2023.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $469 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. This decrease\nwas primarily driven by the Notes issuance and lower share repurchases, partially offset by the payments related to the settlement on the cash tender offer and\ndecreased activity associated with inventory financing arrangements. For additional information regarding the inventory financing agreements, see Note 4\n(Inventory Financing Agreements) and for debt activities, see Note 5 (Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIssuers and Guarantors of Debt Securities\nEach series of our outstanding unsecured senior notes (the “Notes”) are issued by CDW LLC and CDW Finance Corporation (the “Issuers”) and are guaranteed\nby Parent and certain of CDW LLC’s direct and indirect, 100% owned, domestic subsidiaries (the “Guarantor Subsidiaries” and, together with Parent, the\n“Guarantors”).

          "content": "CDW Corporation\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nThird Quarter 2024\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures - Definitions\nGenerally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance or financial condition that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally\nincluded or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with US GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management may differ from\nsimilar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. Our outlook includes non-GAAP financial measures because certain\nreconciling items are dependent on future events that either cannot be controlled, such as currency impacts or interest rates, or reliably predicted because they are not part of our\nunderlying performance, such as refinancing activities or acquisition and integration expenses. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP performance and non-GAAP\nfinancial condition measures. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable US GAAP financial measures, refer to the slides herein.\nNon-GAAP Performance Measures:\nWe believe our non-GAAP performance measures provide analysts, investors and management with useful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our\nbusiness, as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. Management uses these measures to evaluate\nperiod-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business.\nNon-GAAP operating income and Non-GAAP selling and administrative expenses excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible\nassets, equity-based compensation and the associated payroll taxes, acquisition and integration expenses, transformation initiatives and workplace optimization.

These non-GAAP performance measures and non-GAAP financial condition\nmeasures are collectively referred to as “non-GAAP financial measures.” Non-GAAP operating income excludes,among other things, charges related to\nthe amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, equity-based compensation and the associated payroll taxes, acquisition and integration\nexpenses, transformation initiatives and workplace optimization.

CDW has not disclosed netted down revenues prior to\n2016.\n3.

Milwaukee Avenue\nVernon Hills, Illinois 60061\n(847) 968-0238\nDISCLOSURES\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:\nStatements in this document that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation\nReform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, statements regarding the future financial performance, 2024 outlook, capital allocation priorities and growth prospects of CDW. These\nforward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those described in such statements. Although CDW\nbelieves that its plans, intentions and other expectations reflected in or suggested by such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that it will achieve those\nplans, intentions or expectations. Reference is made to a more complete discussion of forward-looking statements and applicable risks contained under the captions “Forward-Looking\nStatements” and “Risk Factors” in CDW's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2023, and subsequent filings with the SEC.CDW undertakes no obligation to update\nor revise any of its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION:\nGenerally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance or financial condition that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally\nincluded or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with US GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management may differ from similar\nmeasures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.\nOur non-GAAP performance measures include Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP operating income margin, Non-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share and Net\nsales on a constant currency basis, and our non-GAAP financial condition measures include Free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow, and Return on working capital (\"ROWC“). These\nnon-GAAP performance measures and non-GAAP financial condition measures are collectively referred to as “non-GAAP financial measures.”\nNon-GAAP operating income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, equity-based compensation and the associated\npayroll taxes, acquisition and integration expenses, transformation initiatives and workplace optimization. Non-GAAP operating income margin is defined as Non-GAAP operating income\nas a percentage of Net sales. Non-GAAP net income and Non-GAAP net income per diluted share exclude, among other things, charges related to acquisition-related intangible asset\namortization, equity-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, transformation initiatives, workplace optimization and the associated tax effects of each. Net sales on a\nconstant currency basis is defined as Net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on Net sales. Free cash flow is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities less\ncapital expenditures. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as Free cash flow adjusted to include certain cash flows from financing activities incurred in the normal course of operations or as\ncapital expenditures. Return on working capital (\"ROWC\") is defined as the percentage of Non-GAAP operating income after-tax divided by working capital.\nWe believe our non-GAAP performance measures provide analysts, investors and management with useful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business, as\nthey remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. Management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period\nperformance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business. We also present non-GAAP financial condition measures as we believe they\nprovide analysts, investors and management with more information regarding our liquidity and capital resources. Certain non-GAAP financial measures are also used to determine certain\ncomponents of performance-based compensation.\nOur outlook includes non-GAAP financial measures because certain reconciling items are dependent on future events that either cannot be controlled, such as currency impacts or interest\nrates, or reliably predicted because they are not part of our underlying performance, such as refinancing activities or acquisition and integration expenses.\nFor a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable US GAAP financial measures, see the CDW Investor Relations website:\nhttps://investor.cdw.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx.\n6| INVESTOR FACT SHEET"
