(NASDAQ: CFBK) (the \"Company\"), the parent of CFBank, National Association (\"CFBank\"), today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and YTD Highlights**\n\n  * Net income for Q3 2024 was **$4.2 million**(**$0.65** per diluted common share). Pre-provision, pre-tax net revenue (PPNR) for Q3 2024 was **$5.8 million**. \n  * Return on Average Equity (ROE) was **10.38%** for the third quarter, while Return on Average Assets (ROA) was **0.****84%**.\n  * Net Interest Margin (NIM) increased **2bps** when compared to the previous quarter. This represents the second consecutive quarter where we have achieved NIM expansion.\n  * Noninterest bearing deposits grew by **$40 million (18%)** during the quarter. Total core deposits are up **$57 million** when compared to June 30, 2024.\n  * Commercial loans increased **$35** million during the quarter and total loans and leases (gross) increased **$27** million. \n  * Service charge fee income increased **$259,000 (65%)** when compared to Q3 2023. Year to date, income from service charges is up **$758,000 (70%)** when compared to the first nine months of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\n  * On October 1, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.07 per share on its common stock and a corresponding cash dividend of $7.00 per share on its Series D Preferred Stock. The dividend was paid on October 19, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 11, 2024.\n\n\n\n**CEO and Board Chair Commentary**\n\nTimothy T. O'Dell, President and CEO, commented: \"Net Earnings for the third quarter were $4.2 million or $0.65 per share.\n\nOur CFBank growth trajectory is continuing. Commercial Bank business pipelines, with loans, deposits and fee income are continuing to expand. A key strategic focus remains to expand the size and scope of our Commercial Banking franchise. Additionally, we are focused on market share expansion in all four major Metro markets (Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati & Indianapolis), through strengthening our business banking teams.\n\nNon-interest-bearing deposits grew by 18% during the third quarter. Growth of noninterest bearing deposits will serve to reduce reliance on higher cost funding going forward. We believe that presently we are in an interest rate period with rates on short term deposits and loans declining, however, we have yet to see a normalized yield curve in this cycle. Nonetheless, recent Fed rate cuts are providing for deposit repricing opportunities which will lower deposit interest expense and are expected to reduce our incremental cost of funding over time.\n\nStrategically, our business intents include repositioning our balance sheet, by reducing the portfolio of residential home mortgage loans, channeling refinancing and/or sale proceeds to fund commercial banking pipelines and growth opportunities. We have introduced initiatives coupled with incentives to accelerate refinancing of lower rate residential home mortgage loans. This approach will result in a long-term benefit to our net interest margin. Furthermore, commercial loans are typically accompanied by attractive full-service deposit and treasury management relationships.\n\nOur business initiatives include efforts aimed at continued expansion of our shareholder base, including both institutional and retail investors. CF has strong insider ownership, with roughly 40% of our outstanding stock being held by our Board Members and Management (including their affiliates and related parties). \n\nDuring October we moved into our new Northeast Ohio (Cleveland Market) Main Office in Pinecrest. By relocating to a location adjacent to a number of successful Family Wealth Offices, we expect to gain greater visibility as well as efficiency. We anticipate our relocation will provide added business synergy for our CF Boutique Banking model.\n\nWe believe Our Bests are yet Ahead!\"\n\nRobert E. Hoeweler, Chairman of the Board, added: \"Our CF Leadership Team has continued to successfully adapt to the challenging interest rate environment. We maintain our focus on executing solid fundamentals, including at the forefront serving the needs of entrepreneurs and closely-held businesses.\"\n\n**Overview of Results**\n\nNet income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $4.2 million (or $0.65 per diluted common share) compared to net income of $1.7 million (or $0.26 per diluted common share) for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and net income of $4.0 million (or $0.62 per diluted common share) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Pre-provision, pre-tax net revenue (\"PPNR\") for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $5.8 million compared to PPNR of $5.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and PPNR of $6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nNet income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $9.0 million (or $1.38 per diluted common share) compared to net income of $12.7 million (or $1.97 per diluted common share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. PPNR for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $16.3 million compared to PPNR of $17.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\nNet interest income totaled $11.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and increased $93,000, or 0.8%, compared to $11.4 million for the prior quarter, and decreased $207,000, or 1.8%, compared to $11.7 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe increase in net interest income compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to a $681,000, or 2.3%, increase in interest income, partially offset by a $588,000, or 3.3%, increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was primarily attributed to a 14bps increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets, coupled with a $1.5 million, or 0.08%, increase in average interest-earning assets. The increase in interest expense when compared to the prior quarter was attributed to a 13bps increase in the average cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities, coupled with a $7.5 million, or 0.5%, increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest margin of 2.41% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased 2bps compared to the net interest margin of 2.39% for the prior quarter.\n\nThe decrease in net interest income compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a $2.0 million, or 12.3%, increase in interest expense, partially offset by a $1.8 million, or 6.5%, increase in interest income. The increase in interest expense was attributed to a 46bps increase in the average cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities, coupled with a $22.8 million, or 1.5%, increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in interest income was primarily attributed to a 26bps increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets, coupled with a $40.9 million, or 2.2%, increase in average interest-earning assets outstanding. The net interest margin of 2.41% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 decreased 9bps compared to the net interest margin of 2.50% for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Noninterest Income**\n\nNoninterest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 totaled $1.6 million and increased $388,000, or 31.9%, compared to $1.2 million for the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to a $252,000 increase in swap fee income and an $81,000 increase in other noninterest income.\n\nNoninterest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased $305,000, or 23.4%, compared to $1.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $259,000 increase in service charges on deposit accounts and a $188,000 increase on other noninterest income, partially offset by a $192,000 decrease in swap fee income.\n\nThe following table represents the notional amount of loans sold during the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023 (in thousands).\n\nThree Months ended  \n---  \nSeptember 30, 2024 | June 30, 2024 | September 30, 2023  \nNotional amount of loans sold | $ | 12,053 | $ | 10,837 | $ | 3,646  \n  \n**Noninterest Expense**\n\nNoninterest expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 totaled $7.2 million and increased $134,000, or 1.9%, compared to $7.1 million for the prior quarter. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to a $159,000 increase in other noninterest expense, partially offset by a $31,000 decrease in salary and employee benefit expense. \n\nNoninterest expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased $466,000, or 6.9%, compared to $6.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to a $194,000 increase in other noninterest expense, a $119,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits, and a $91,000 increase in data processing expense. The increase in other noninterest expense was primarily due to a $135,000 increase in fraud losses on customer accounts, coupled with a $53,000 increase in charitable contributions. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily related to an increase in the number of employees, partially offset by lower deferred compensation incentive plan expense.\n\n**Income Tax Expense**\n\nIncome tax expense was $1.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (effective tax rate of 20.4%), compared to $237,000 for the prior quarter (effective tax rate of 12.3%) and $984,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 (effective tax rate of 19.6%).\n\n**Loans and Loans Held For Sale**\n\nNet loans and leases totaled $1.7 billion at September 30, 2024 and increased $29.4 million, or 1.7%, from the prior quarter and increased $22.9 million, or 1.4%, from December 31, 2023. The increase in net loans and leases during the quarter was primarily due to a $26.9 million increase in loans and leases balances coupled with a $2.5 million decrease in the allowance for credit losses. The increase in loans and leases balances was primarily due to $48.2 million increase in multi-family loan balances and a $10.9 million increase in commercial and industrial (C&I) loan balances, partially offset by a $13.4 million decrease in construction loan balances, a $12.1 million decrease in commercial real estate loan balances, and a $6.6 million decrease in single-family residential loan balances. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses was primarily driven by net charge-offs of $3.3 million, partially offset by the quarterly provision for credit losses on loans of $758,000. \n\nThe increase in net loans and leases from December 31, 2023 was primarily due to a $45.8 million increase in multi-family loan balances, a $14.8 million increase in commercial real estate loan balances, and a $5.0 million increase in home equity lines of credit, partially offset by a $19.2 million decrease in construction loan balances, a $17.1 million decrease in single-family residential loan balances, and a $7.0 million decrease in commercial and industrial (C&I) loan balances. \n\nThe following table presents the recorded investment in loans and leases for certain non-owner-occupied loan types (in thousands).\n\n**September 30, 2024** | **June 30, 2024**  \n---|---  \nConstruction – 1-4 family* | $ | 23,046 | $ | 22,877  \nConstruction – Multi-family* | 111,897 | 118,815  \nConstruction – Non-residential* | 35,608 | 41,271  \nHotel/Motel | 12,074 | 12,144  \nIndustrial / Warehouse | 56,571 | 58,927  \nLand/Land Development | 23,595 | 21,017  \nMedical/Healthcare/Senior Housing | 2,479 | 2,617  \nMulti-family | 227,895 | 181,553  \nOffice | 43,407 | 43,817  \nRetail | 63,074 | 63,604  \nOther | 7,732 | 8,366  \n  \n*CFBank possesses a core competency and deep expertise in Construction Lending.

The increase in nonaccrual loans when compared to the prior quarter end was primarily due to two commercial loans, totaling $7.0 million, becoming nonaccrual during the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by charge-offs of $3.3 million on loans that were in nonaccrual status during the second quarter of 2024. \n\nThe increase in nonaccrual loans when compared to December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by six commercial loans, totaling $11.5 million, and two single-family residential loans, totaling $918,000, becoming nonaccrual during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by $3.3 million in charge-offs. Loans past due more than 30 days totaled $7.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $7.6 million at June 30, 2024 and $2.0 million at December 31, 2023. \n\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans and leases totaled $16.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $19.3 million at June 30, 2024 and $16.9 million at December 31, 2023. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases to total loans and leases was 0.97% at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.13% at June 30, 2024 and 0.99% at December 31, 2023. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by $3.3 million in charge-offs, which included a commercial participation loan that had a $2.9 million additional reserve placed on it in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThere was $558,000 in provision for credit losses expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $3.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and $1.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the provision for credit losses when compared to the prior quarter was primarily driven by additional reserves placed on two individually-evaluated commercial loan participations in the second quarter of 2024. These two loan participations were acquired from regional banks. Net charge-offs for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 totaled $3.3 million, compared to net charge-offs of $2.1 million for the prior quarter and net charge-offs of $126,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**Deposits**\n\nDeposits totaled $1.75 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $49.1 million, or 2.9%, compared to $1.70 billion at June 30, 2024, and an increase of $1.5 million, or 0.09%, when compared to $1.74 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase when compared to June 30, 2024 was primarily due to a $39.9 million increase in noninterest-bearing account balances, coupled with a $9.2 million increase in interest-bearing accounts balances. The increase when compared to December 31, 2023, was primarily due to a $21.8 million increase in noninterest-bearing account balances, partially offset by a $20.3 million decrease in interest-bearing account balances. The decrease in interest-bearing account balances when compared to December 31, 2023 included a $14.7 million reduction in brokered deposits.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, approximately 30.2% of our deposit balances exceeded the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000, as compared to approximately 28.6% at June 30, 2024 and approximately 29.2% at December 31, 2023.\n\n**Borrowings**\n\nFHLB advances and other debt totaled $108.7 million at September 30, 2024 and decreased $28.5 million, or 20.8%, when compared to $137.2 million at June 30, 2024 and decreased $1.3 million when compared to $110.0 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease when compared to June 30, 2024 was primarily due to a $26.0 million short-term borrowing that paid off during the third quarter 2024, coupled with a $2.5 million maturity of a FHLB fixed rate advance. \n\n**Capital**\n\nStockholders' equity totaled $164.0 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of $4.4 million, or 2.8%, when compared to $159.6 million at June 30, 2024, and an increase of $8.6 million, or 5.6%, from $155.4 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in total stockholders' equity during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributed to net income, partially offset by $388,000 in dividend payments. The increase in stockholders' equity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributed to net income, partially offset by $1.2 million in dividend payments.\n\n**USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nThis earnings release contains financial information and performance measures determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\").

(NASDAQ: CFBK) (the \"Company\"), the parent of CFBank, National Association (\"CFBank\"), today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 and YTD Highlights**\n\n  * Net income for Q2 2024 was **$1.7 million**(**$0.26** earnings per diluted common share). Pre-provision, pre-tax net revenue (PPNR) for Q2 2024 was **$5.5 million**. Q2 2024 net income was negatively impacted by **$3.1 million** of additional specific reserves placed on two loan participations acquired from regional banks.\n  * Return on Average Equity (ROE) was **4.23%** and PPNR ROE was **13.71%** for Q2 2024, while Return on Average Assets (ROA) was **0.****34%** and PPNR ROA was **1.10%**.\n  * Excluding the impact of the additional specific reserves on noncore assets in Q2 2024, second quarter adjusted core performance metrics would have been: Adjusted ROA: **0.89%** , Adjusted ROE: **10.25%** and Adjusted earnings per diluted common share: **$0.65**.\n  * Net Interest Margin (NIM) increased **3bps** when compared to the previous quarter. \n  * Service charge income increased **$244,000 (64%)** when compared to Q2 2023 and **$64,000 (11%)** when compared to the previous quarter. Year to date, income from service charges is up **$499,000 (73%)** when compared to the first six months of 2023.\n  * New commercial loan production totaled **$16.8** **million** during Q2 2024. Loan and business pipelines along with quality new business opportunities in our four major regional markets (Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati & Indianapolis) are expanding.\n\n\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\n  * On July 1, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per share on its common stock and a corresponding cash dividend of $6.00 per share on its Series D Preferred Stock. The dividend was paid on July 19, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on July 11, 2024.\n\n\n\n**CEO and Board Chair Commentary**\n\nTimothy T. O'Dell, President and CEO, commented: \"Net After Tax Consolidated Earnings for Q2 were $1.7 million (or $0.26 per diluted common share), which included the impact from $3.6 million in elevated loan provision expense. The increased provisioning was related mostly to two acquired loan participations whose performance we have been tracking closely. Both are loan participations led by regional banks.\n\nThe two loan participations mentioned are not considered core assets because no underlying customer relationship exists. These earning assets were purchased in 2021 to hedge the earning asset loan runoff impact and redeploy excess liquidity following our exit of the DTC Mortgage Lending business and payoffs of PPP loans.\n\nIncluding noncore assets as of June 30, 2024, loans past due 30+ days equaled 0.45% of total loans, classified assets equaled 0.48% of total assets and we held no OREO.\n\nOur core customer loan book continues to perform well as evidenced by the following metrics as of June 30, 2024: core loans past due 30+ days equaled 0.23% of core loans and core classified assets equaled 0.13% of core assets.\n\nCommercial loan generation and loan pipelines remain strong and are increasing. To date, commercial real estate loan payoffs received are offsetting net loan growth.\n\nIn the coming quarters, we foresee lessening amounts of loan payoff's, which would contribute to stronger net loan growth performance.\n\nEarlier investment in strengthening our Regional Banking teams is producing increased business opportunities including loans, deposits and fee income business across our entire footprint. For example, new leadership in Treasury Management has increased fee income by 64% year over year. Additionally, as of this quarter end, we now have a fully staffed, well-seasoned Commercial Banking team in our Indianapolis Market.\n\nWe remain bullish about our business opportunities for the second half of 2024 and believe Our Best is Yet Ahead!\"\n\nRobert E. Hoeweler, Chairman of the Board, added: \"Our underpinning business fundamentals remain very strong. We are buoyed by our continuing success attracting quality new business and banking talent, as our business model and delivery of commercial banking services resonates strongly with entrepreneurs and closely held businesses.\"\n\n**Overview of Results**\n\nNet income for the three months ended June 30, 2024 totaled $1.7 million (or $0.26 per diluted common share) compared to net income of $3.1 million (or $0.47 per diluted common share) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and net income of $4.2 million (or $0.66 per diluted common share) for the three months ended June 30, 2023. Pre-provision, pre-tax net revenue (\"PPNR\") for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $5.5 million compared to PPNR of $5.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and PPNR of $5.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nNet income for the six months ended June 30, 2024 totaled $4.8 million (or $0.74 per diluted common share) compared to net income of $8.7 million (or $1.35 per diluted common share) for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Pre-provision, pre-tax net revenue (\"PPNR\") for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $10.5 million compared to PPNR of $11.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\nNet interest income totaled $11.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and increased $83,000, or 0.7%, compared to $11.3 million for the prior quarter, and decreased $119,000, or 1.0%, compared to $11.5 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe increase in net interest income compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to a $229,000, or 0.8%, increase in interest income, partially offset by a $146,000, or 0.8%, increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was primarily attributed to a 9bps increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets, partially offset by an $11.6 million, or 0.6%, decrease in average interest-earning assets. The increase in interest expense when compared to the prior quarter was attributed to a 6bps increase in the average cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by an $8.3 million, or 0.5%, decrease in average interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest margin of 2.39% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 increased 3bps compared to the net interest margin of 2.36% for the prior quarter.\n\nThe decrease in net interest income compared to the second quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a $3.2 million, or 21.8%, increase in interest expense, partially offset by a $3.1 million, or 11.8%, increase in interest income. The increase in interest expense was attributed to a 68bps increase in the average cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities, coupled with a $56.6 million, or 3.7%, increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in interest income was primarily attributed to a 40bps increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets, coupled with a $84.4 million, or 4.6%, increase in average interest-earning assets outstanding. The net interest margin of 2.39% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 decreased 13bps compared to the net interest margin of 2.52% for the second quarter of 2023.\n\n**Noninterest Income**\n\nNoninterest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 totaled $1.2 million and increased $313,000, or 34.6%, compared to $905,000 for the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to a $419,000 increase in other noninterest income, partially offset by a $167,000 decrease in net gain on sales of commercial loans.\n\nNoninterest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 increased $240,000, or 24.5%, compared to $978,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $244,000 increase in service charges on deposit accounts.\n\nThe following table represents the notional amount of loans sold during the three months ended June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2023 (in thousands).\n\nThree Months ended  \n---  \nJune 30, 2024 | March 31, 2024 | June 30, 2023  \nNotional amount of loans sold | $ | 10,837 | $ | 9,037 | $ | 3,171  \n  \n**Noninterest Expense**\n\nNoninterest expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 totaled $7.1 million and decreased $95,000, or 1.3%, compared to $7.2 million for the prior quarter. The decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to a $188,000 decrease in loan expense, partially offset by a $70,000 increase in franchise taxes. \n\nNoninterest expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 decreased $81,000, or 1.1%, compared to $7.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to a $208,000 decrease in salaries and employee benefits, partially offset by a $162,000 increase in data processing expense. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits was primarily related to a $62,000 decrease in payroll related taxes, due to a one-time tax rate adjustment payment of approximately $54,000 that occurred in the second quarter of 2023, a $50,000 decrease in incentive expense, and a $36,000 decrease in the deferred compensation plan expense. The increase in data processing expense was primarily due to an increase in our average monthly core processing charges of approximately $26,000 per month coupled with a $37,000 one-time implementation fee.\n\n**Income Tax Expense**\n\nIncome tax expense was $237,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 (effective tax rate of 12.3%), compared to $695,000 for the prior quarter (effective tax rate of 18.5%) and $1.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 (effective tax rate of 20.0%).\n\n**Loans and Loans Held For Sale**\n\nNet loans and leases totaled $1.7 billion at June 30, 2024 and decreased $8.0 million, or 0.5%, from the prior quarter and decreased $6.4 million, or 0.4%, from December 31, 2023. The decrease in net loans and leases during the quarter was primarily due to a $6.9 million decrease in loans and leases balances coupled with a $1.1 million increase in the allowance for credit losses. The decrease in loans and leases balances was primarily due to an $8.5 million decrease in commercial loan balances, a $7.4 million decrease in single-family residential loan balances, $2.0 million decrease in commercial real estate loan balances, and a $447,000 decrease in multi-family loan balances, partially offset by a $6.5 million increase in construction loan balances and a $4.8 million increase in home equity lines of credit. The increase in the allowance for credit losses was primarily driven by the provision for credit losses of $3.2 million, partially offset by net charge-offs of $2.1 million. \n\nThe decrease in net loans and leases from December 31, 2023, was primarily due to $4.0 million decrease in loans and leases balances coupled with a $2.4 million increase in the allowance for credit losses. The decrease in loans and leases balances was primarily due to a $17.9 million decrease in commercial loan balances, a $10.4 million decrease in single-family residential loan balances, a $5.8 million decrease in construction loan balances, and a $2.4 million decrease in multi-family loan balances, partially offset by a $26.8 million increase in commercial real estate loan balances and a $4.9 million increase in home equity lines of credit. The increase in the allowance for credit losses was primarily driven by the provision for credit losses of $4.5 million, partially offset by net charge-offs of $2.1 million. \n\nThe following table presents the recorded investment in loans and leases for certain non-owner-occupied loan types (in thousands).\n\n**June 30, 2024** | **March 31, 2024**  \n---|---  \nConstruction – 1-4 family* | $ | 22,877 | $ | 23,622  \nConstruction – Multi-family* | 118,815 | 106,251  \nConstruction – Non-residential* | 41,271 | 46,594  \nHotel/Motel | 12,144 | 12,214  \nIndustrial / Warehouse | 57,368 | 57,837  \nLand/Land Development | 17,139 | 16,348  \nMedical/Healthcare/Senior Housing | 318 | 346  \nMulti-family | 180,511 | 189,539  \nOffice | 40,312 | 44,819  \nRetail | 53,397 | 53,701  \nOther | 30,856 | 31,316  \n  \n*CFBank possesses a core competency and deep expertise in Construction Lending.

The increase in nonaccrual loans when compared to the prior quarter end was primarily due to two commercial loans, totaling $4.7 million, and one single-family residential loan, totaling $547,000, becoming nonaccrual during the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by charge-offs of $1.8 million on loans that went into nonaccrual status during the first quarter of 2024. \n\nThe increase in nonaccrual loans when compared to December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by five commercial loans, totaling $4.9 million, and two single-family residential loans, totaling $919,000, becoming nonaccrual during the six months ended June 30, 2024. Loans past due more than 30 days totaled $7.6 million at June 30, 2024 compared to $5.4 million at March 31, 2024 and $2.0 million at December 31, 2023. \n\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans and leases totaled $19.3 million at June 30, 2024 compared to $18.2 million at March 31, 2024 and $16.9 million at December 31, 2023. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases to total loans and leases was 1.13% at June 30, 2024 compared to 1.06% at March 31, 2024 and 0.99% at December 31, 2023. The increase in the allowance for credit losses during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by additional reserves placed on two individually-evaluated commercial loan participations, totaling $3.1 million, which were acquired from regional banks, partially offset by charge-offs of $2.1 million.\n\nThere was $3.6 million in provision for credit losses expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $1.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and $12,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.

The decrease when compared to March 31, 2024 was primarily due to a $19.1 million decrease in noninterest-bearing account balances, coupled with a $7.5 million decrease in interest-bearing accounts balances. The decrease when compared to December 31, 2023, was primarily due to a $29.4 million decrease in interest-bearing account balances, coupled with a $18.2 million decrease in noninterest-bearing account balances. The decrease in interest-bearing account balances when compared to December 31, 2023 included a $14.2 million reduction in brokered deposits.\n\nAt June 30, 2024, approximately 28.6% of our deposit balances exceeded the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000, as compared to approximately 29.8% at March 31, 2024 and approximately 29.2% at December 31, 2023.\n\n**Borrowings**\n\nFHLB advances and other debt totaled $137.2 million at June 30, 2024 and increased $26.2 million, or 23.6%, when compared to $111.0 million at March 31, 2024 and increased $27.2 million when compared to $110.0 million at December 31, 2023.

The increase in total stockholders' equity during the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily attributed to net income, partially offset by $387,000 in dividend payments. The increase in stockholders' equity during the six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily attributed to net income, partially offset by $773,000 in dividend payments.\n\n**USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nThis earnings release contains financial information and performance measures determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\").

(NASDAQ: CFBK) (the \"Company\"), the parent of CFBank, National Association (\"CFBank\"), today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\n**First Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Net income for Q1 2024 was **$3.1 million**(**$0.47** per diluted common share). Pre-provision, pre-tax net revenue (PPNR) for Q1 2024 was **$5.0 million**. \n  * Book value per share increased to **$24.17** as of March 31, 2024.\n  * Return on Average Equity (ROE) was **7.80%** and PPNR ROE was **12.71%** for the first quarter, while Return on Average Assets (ROA) was **0.****61%** and PPNR ROA was **1.00%**.\n  * Core deposit balances increased **$30.8** million during the first quarter.\n  * New commercial loan production totaled **$37.3** million during the quarter. Loan and business pipelines along with quality new business opportunities remain strong.\n  * CFBank's capital position remains strong with a Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 10.05% and Total Capital ratio of 13.50%.\n  * CFBank recently announced three key leadership additions to its Commercial Bank, as we continue to build and deepen our Regional Banking Teams.\n\n\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\n  * On April 8, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per share on its common stock and a corresponding cash dividend of $6.00 per share on its Series D Preferred Stock. The dividend was paid on April 29, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 18, 2024.\n\n\n\n**CEO and Board Chair Commentary**\n\nTimothy T. O'Dell, President and CEO, commented: \"Our Q1 results were impacted by $1.2 million of provision expense, coupled with approximately $750 thousand of other nonrecurring items including higher payroll tax expense, which is typically elevated during the first quarter, and recruiting fees. PPNR was $5.0 million for the quarter reflective of solid core earnings performance. \n\nOur net interest margin (\"NIM\") remained relatively stable during Q1, which we believe is indicative of greater stabilization going forward. Our NIM for Q1 included some one-time impacts including fewer days along with lower loan fees. In the face of local regional bank competitors promoting ultra-high rates on money market savings accounts, we held the line and successfully maintained our overall cost of funds.\n\nCredit quality remains strong in our core customer loan portfolios. CFBank has sustained minimal loan losses during the previous 12 years, coupled with strong growth performance. We believe our industry, CFBank included, will return to more normalized levels of loan losses going forward.\n\nWe generated $37 million of new commercial loan production during Q1. Net growth was impacted by significant loan payoffs during Q1, mostly from successful CRE projects being refinanced at completion by permanent lenders. We anticipate positive growth in interest income as new loan pricing is adjusted upward, plus existing loans refinancing at higher market rates. An objective is to produce interest income increases which will require lower net loan growth rates and consequently also be beneficial to operations through deploying less capital.\n\nGoing forward we believe our business initiatives will result in fee income growth. In particular, we see opportunities within our Treasury Management and Mortgage Lending lines of business.\n\nWe continue to have success attracting proven banking talent for building and strengthening all of our Regional Banking Teams. Our boutique business model continues to resonate strongly with closely held business owners. Competitively we compete effectively with regional players for banking talent along with quality Business & Personal Banking relationships. \n\nChallenging but with much opportunity is our 2024 theme.\" \n\nRobert E. Hoeweler, Chairman of the Board, added: \"Our seasoned CFBank Team has remained nimble and proactive in the face of unique challenges and the ever-changing landscape the banking industry continues to experience. We believe this ability has us well positioned to opportunistically capture new business as we move through 2024.\"\n\n**Overview of Results**\n\nNet income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 totaled $3.1 million (or $0.47 per diluted common share) compared to net income of $4.2 million (or $0.65 per diluted common share) for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and net income of $4.4 million (or $0.68 per diluted common share) for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Pre-provision, pre-tax net revenue (\"PPNR\") for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $5.0 million compared to PPNR of $6.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and PPNR of $5.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\nNet interest income totaled $11.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and decreased $470,000, or 4.0%, compared to $11.8 million in the prior quarter, and decreased $1.4 million, or 11.4%, compared to $12.7 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe decrease in net interest income compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to a $626,000, or 2.1%, decrease in interest income, partially offset by a $156,000, or 0.9%, decrease in interest expense. The decrease in interest income was primarily attributed to a 9bps decrease in the average yield on interest-earning assets, coupled with a $14.3 million, or 0.74%, decrease in average interest-earning assets. The decrease in interest expense when compared to the prior quarter was attributed to a $21.2 million, or 1.3%, decrease in average interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by a 2bps increase in the average cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest margin of 2.36% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 decreased 8bps compared to the net interest margin of 2.44% for the prior quarter.\n\nThe decrease in net interest income compared to the first quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a $6.4 million, or 55.6%, increase in interest expense, partially offset by a $4.9 million, or 20.3%, increase in interest income. The increase in interest expense was attributed to a 127bps increase in the average cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities, coupled with a $166.4 million, or 11.8%, increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in interest income was primarily attributed to a $176.3 million, or 10.2%, increase in average interest-earning assets outstanding, coupled with a 51bps increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. The net interest margin of 2.36% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 decreased 57bps compared to the net interest margin of 2.93% for the first quarter of 2023.\n\n**Noninterest Income**\n\nNoninterest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 totaled $905,000 and decreased $128,000, or 12.4%, compared to $1.0 million for the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a $270,000 decrease in other noninterest income, partially offset by a $113,000 increase in net gain on sales of commercial loans.\n\nNoninterest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 increased $186,000, or 25.9%, compared to $719,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $255,000 increase in service charges on deposit accounts and a $167,000 increase in the net gain on sales of commercial loans, partially offset by a $299,000 decrease in other noninterest income.\n\nThe following table represents the notional amount of loans sold during the three months ended March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2023 (in thousands).\n\nThree Months ended  \n---  \nMarch 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | March 31, 2023  \nNotional amount of loans sold | $ | 9,037 | $ | 1,990 | $ | 1,991  \n  \n**Noninterest Expense**\n\nNoninterest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 totaled $7.2 million and increased $442,000, or 6.6%, compared to $6.7 million for the prior quarter. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to a $338,000 increase in loan expense and a $179,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits. The increase in salaries and benefits was primarily due to an increase in payroll taxes which on a percentage basis is higher in the first quarter of the year. \n\nNoninterest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 decreased $504,000, or 7.0%, compared to $7.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to a $478,000 decrease in salaries and employee benefits. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to a decrease in the number of employees coupled with lower payroll taxes. \n\n**Income Tax Expense**\n\nIncome tax expense was $695,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 (effective tax rate of 18.5%), compared to $932,000 for the prior quarter (effective tax rate of 18.0%) and $1.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 (effective tax rate of 19.5%).\n\n**Loans and Loans Held For Sale**\n\nNet loans and leases totaled $1.7 billion at March 31, 2024 and increased $1.6 million, or 0.1%, from December 31, 2023. The increase in net loans and leases from December 31, 2023, was primarily due to a $28.8 million increase in commercial real estate loan balances, partially offset by a $12.3 million decrease in construction loan balances, a $9.3 million decrease in commercial loan balances, a $3.0 million decrease in single-family residential loan balances, and a $2.0 million decrease in multi-family loan balances. The increases in the aforementioned loan balances were primarily related to increased sales activity and new relationships. The decrease in construction loan balances was primarily related to loans that were converted to permanent loans upon the completion of construction.\n\nThe following table presents the recorded investment in loans and leases for certain non-owner-occupied loan types (in thousands).\n\n**March 31, 2024** | **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \nConstruction – 1-4 family* | $ | 23,622 | $ | 20,663  \nConstruction – Multi-family* | 106,251 | 109,379  \nConstruction – Non-residential* | 46,594 | 57,459  \nHotel/Motel | 12,214 | 12,284  \nIndustrial / Warehouse | 52,836 | 52,923  \nLand/Land Development | 16,348 | 20,749  \nMedical/Healthcare/Senior Housing | 346 | 373  \nMulti-family | 168,875 | 164,641  \nOffice | 40,680 | 41,072  \nRetail | 35,739 | 37,239  \nOther | 79,082 | 62,226  \n  \n*CFBank possesses a core competency and deep expertise in Construction Lending. The construction lending business sector has produced many full banking relationships with proven developers with long successful track records.\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nNonaccrual loans were $7.9 million, or 0.46%, of total loans at March 31, 2024, an increase of $2.2 million from $5.7 million at December 31, 2023 and an increase of $7.2 million from $718,000 at March 31, 2023. The increase in nonaccrual loans when compared to the prior quarter end was primarily due to two commercial loans, totaling $1.6 million, one single-family residential loan, totaling $372,000, and one consumer loan, totaling $251,000, becoming nonaccrual during the first quarter of 2024. \n\nThe increase in nonaccrual loans when compared to March 31, 2023 was primarily driven by nine commercial loans, totaling $6.6 million, becoming nonaccrual during since March 31, 2023. Loans past due more than 30 days totaled $5.4 million at March 31, 2024 compared to $2.0 million at December 31, 2023 and $973,000 at March 31, 2023. \n\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans and leases totaled $18.2 million at March 31, 2024 compared to $16.9 million at December 31, 2023 and $15.9 million at March 31, 2023. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases to total loans and leases was 1.06% at March 31, 2024 compared to 0.99% at December 31, 2023 and 0.98% at March 31, 2023. The increase in the allowance for credit losses during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in reserves placed on an individually-evaluated commercial loan. \n\nThere was $1.2 million in provision for credit losses expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to $875,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 and $237,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Net recoveries for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 totaled $16,000 compared to net charge-offs of $623,000 for the prior quarter and net charge offs of $5,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.\n\n**Deposits**\n\nDeposits totaled $1.7 billion at March 31, 2024, a decrease of $21.0 million, or 1.2%, when compared to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease when compared to December 31, 2023, is primarily due to a $21.9 million decrease in interest-bearing account balances, partially offset by a $925,000 increase in noninterest-bearing account balances. The decrease in interest-bearing account balances was primarily due to a $51.1 million decrease in brokered account balances, partially offset by an increase of $28.5 million in core deposit balances.\n\nAt March 31, 2024, approximately 29.8% of our deposit balances exceeded the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000, as compared to approximately 29.2% at December 31, 2023.\n\n**Borrowings**\n\nFHLB advances and other debt totaled $111.0 million at March 31, 2023 and increased $1.0 million when compared to $110.0 million at December 31, 2023. The increase when compared to December 31, 2023, was due to a $1.0 million increase on the Company's line of credit with a third party financial institution. \n\n**Capital**\n\nStockholders' equity totaled $158.0 million at March 31, 2024, an increase of $2.6 million, or 1.7%, from $155.4 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in total stockholders' equity during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily attributed to net income, partially offset by $386,000 in dividend payments. \n\n**USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nThis earnings release contains financial information and performance measures determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\").

O'Dell, President and CEO, commented: \"Net earnings were $4.2 million for the fourth quarter, which were impacted by provisions for credit losses of $875,000. \n\nDuring the quarter, our charge offs were $633,000, which were related to two commercial loans in the transportation (trucking) sector. Our exposure to this sector is less than 1% of total loans and leases.\n\nOur Total Assets topped $2 billion at December 31, 2023, and were primarily comprised of net loans and leases totaling $1.7 billion, as we continue to have only a nominal investment portfolio.\n\nLoans grew by $34 million during the fourth quarter. \n\nOur fourth quarter Efficiency Ratio was 52.75%, demonstrating our success in managing overhead and tight expense controls.\n\nDeposits during the fourth quarter increased $59 million, with Non-interest bearing deposits increasing $22 million. \n\nCFBank moved into the top ten Central Ohio Banks ranked by deposits, topping the $1 billion deposit level in Central Ohio.\n\nWe are highly encouraged by the strength of our increasing Business opportunities early in this new year. These opportunities include loans and deposits as well as Fee income business lines: Salable mortgage lending, Treasury management fees & Credit Card fee revenue, all are gaining increasing business traction. \n\nAdditionally, we are attracting top banking talent and quality business from Regional banks and other competitors as we continue building and strengthening our business presence & teams in the four Major Metro Markets we serve (Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati and Indianapolis).\n\nAs we move into 2024, we expect Net Interest Margin (NIM) to remain challenging, however, we are seeing signs of improving stability. Remaining nimble and maintaining efficient operations, positions us to effectively manage through changes in interest rates moving forward, while taking advantage of profitable market growth opportunities.\n\nWe are gaining business momentum and raising the bar through consistently executing well the fundamentals of our business and growth plan.\n\nWe believe \"Our bests are yet Ahead!\"\n\nRobert E. Hoeweler, Chairman of the Board, added: \"Through January 2024, when measured over a 1-year, 5-year and 10-year period, the performance of our stock has significantly outperformed both the KBW Regional Banking ETF and the S&P Regional Banking ETF. Also, since our recap in late 2012, the CFBK stock price has appreciated 164%.

The decrease was primarily due to a $345,000 decrease in swap fee income, partially offset by a $91,000 increase in service charges on deposit accounts. \n\nNoninterest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 increased $382,000, or 58.7%, compared to $651,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to a $175,000 increase in service charges on deposit accounts, a $56,000 increase in the net gain on sales of residential loans and a $173,000 decrease in the loss on the redemption of life insurance.\n\nThe following table represents the notional amount of loans sold during the three months ended December 31, 2023, September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022 (in thousands).\n\nThree Months ended  \n---  \nDecember 31, 2023 |  September 30, 2023 |  December 31, 2022  \nNotional amount of loans sold  |  $ |  1,990 |  $ |  3,646 |  $ |  2,717  \n  \n**Noninterest Expense**\n\nNoninterest expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 totaled $6.7 million and decreased $15,000, or 0.2%, compared to $6.8 million for the prior quarter. The decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to a $91,000 decrease in salaries and employee benefits, partially offset by a $72,000 increase in data processing expense. The decrease in salaries and benefits was primarily due to a decrease in incentive compensation expense. The increase in data processing expense was primarily due to one-time implementation expenses for certain product enhancements.\n\nNoninterest expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 decreased $528,000, or 7.3%, compared to $7.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to a $485,000 decrease in salaries and employee benefits and a $115,000 decrease in advertising and marketing expense, partially offset by a $185,000 increase in FDIC premiums. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to a decrease in the number of employees coupled with lower payroll taxes. The decrease in advertising and marketing expense was due to a reduction in advertising campaigns. The increase in FDIC premiums was related to increased assets and deposit levels and assessment rates.\n\n**Income Tax Expense**\n\nIncome tax expense was $932,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 (effective tax rate of 18.0%), compared to $984,000 for the prior quarter (effective tax rate of 19.6%) and $1.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 (effective tax rate of 20.8%).\n\n**Loans and Loans Held For Sale**\n\nNet loans and leases totaled $1.7 billion at December 31, 2023 and increased $34.4 million, or 2.1%, from the prior quarter and increased $121.9 million, or 7.8%, from December 31, 2022. The increase in net loans and leases from September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a $40.5 million increase in commercial real estate loan balances, an $11.9 million increase in commercial loan balances, and a $6.0 million increase in multi-family loan balances, partially offset by a $26.6 million decrease in construction loan balances. The increases in the aforementioned loan balances were primarily related to increased sales activity and new relationships. The decrease in construction loan balances was primarily related to $35.7 million of loans that paid off and $18.9 million of loans that converted to permanent loans upon the completion of construction, partially offset by $28.0 million of new construction loan advances.\n\nThe increase in net loans and leases from December 31, 2022 was primarily due to a $57.9 million increase in commercial real estate loan balances, a $26.6 million increase in multi-family loan balances, a $13.2 million increase in single-family residential loan balances, a $12.5 million increase in commercial loan balances, a $6.6 million increase in construction loan balances, and a $5.2 million increase in home equity lines of credit. The increases in the aforementioned loan balances were related to increased sales activity and new relationships.\n\nThe following table presents the recorded investment in loans and leases for certain non-owner-occupied loan types (in thousands).\n\n**December 31, 2023** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n---|---  \nConstruction – 1-4 family* |  $ |  20,663 |  $ |  15,788  \nConstruction – Multi-family* |  109,379 |  132,538  \nConstruction – Non-residential* |  57,459 |  60,647  \nHotel/Motel |  12,284 |  12,360  \nIndustrial / Warehouse |  52,923 |  27,966  \nLand/Land Development |  20,749 |  21,281  \nMedical/Healthcare/Senior Housing  |  373 |  395  \nMulti-family |  164,641 |  154,764  \nOffice |  41,072 |  42,432  \nRetail |  37,239 |  25,049  \nOther |  62,226 |  62,275  \n*CFBank possesses a core competency and deep expertise in Construction Lending. The construction lending business sector has produced many full banking relationships with proven developers with long successful track records.  \n  \n**Asset Quality**\n\nNonaccrual loans were $5.7 million, or 0.33%, of total loans at December 31, 2023, an increase of $1.1 million from $4.6 million at September 30, 2023 and an increase of $5.0 million from $761,000 at December 31, 2022. The increase in nonaccrual loans when compared to the prior quarter end was primarily due to three commercial loans, totaling $1.7 million, becoming nonaccrual during the fourth quarter 2023. Of the $1.7 million that became nonaccrual during the quarter, $1.0 million is covered by an SBA guarantee.\n\nThe increase in nonaccrual loans when compared to December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by five commercial loans, totaling $4.9 million, becoming nonaccrual during the year ended December 31, 2023. Loans past due more than 30 days totaled $2.0 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $2.4 million at September 30, 2023 and $2.1 million at December 31, 2022. \n\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans and leases totaled $16.9 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $17.0 million at September 30, 2023 and $16.1 million at December 31, 2022. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases to total loans and leases was 0.99% at December 31, 2023 compared to 1.02% at September 30, 2023 and 1.01% at December 31, 2022. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by a decrease in reserves placed on individually-evaluated commercial loans. This was the result of two individually-evaluated loans being charged down to the fair market value of their collateral.\n\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted the current expected credit loss (CECL) model, which resulted in an increase to the reserve for credit losses of $49,000. There was $875,000 in provision for credit loss expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, a $1.2 million provision for credit loss expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and a $637,000 provision for credit loss expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Net charge-offs for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 totaled $623,000 compared to net charge-offs of $126,000 for the prior quarter and net charge offs of $262,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.\n\n**Deposits**\n\nDeposits totaled $1.7 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $59.1 million, or 3.5%, when compared to $1.7 billion at September 30, 2023, and an increase of $216.1 million, or 14.1%, when compared to $1.5 billion at December 31 2022. The increase when compared to the prior quarter end is primarily due to a $41.2 million increase in checking account balances, a $16.2 million increase in certificate of deposit account balances, and a $2.9 million increase in money market account balances, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in savings account balances. \n\nThe increase in deposits when compared to December 31, 2022 is primarily due to a $105.3 million increase in certificate of deposit account balances, a $102.5 million increase in money market account balances, and an $11.4 million increase in checking account balances, partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease in savings account balances.\n\nNoninterest-bearing deposit accounts totaled $235.9 million at December 31, 2023 and increased $21.6 million from $214.3 million at September 30, 2023 and decreased $27.3 million from $263.2 million at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2023, approximately 29.2% of our deposit balances exceeded the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000, as compared to approximately 28.0% at September 30, 2023 and 31.6% at December 31, 2022.\n\n**Borrowings**\n\nFHLB advances and other debt totaled $110.0 million at December 31, 2023 and at September 30, 2023 and increased $534,000 when compared to $109.5 million at December 31, 2022. The increase when compared to December 31, 2022 was due to a $4.0 million increase on the Company's line of credit with a third party financial institution, partially offset by a $3.5 million decrease in FHLB advances. \n\n**Capital**\n\nStockholders' equity totaled $155.4 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of $4.1 million, or 2.7%, from $151.3 million at September 30, 2023. Stockholders' equity increased $16.1 million, or 11.6%, from $139.2 million at December 31, 2022. The increase in total stockholders' equity during the three months ended December 31, 2023 was primarily attributed to net income, partially offset by $386,000 in dividend payments. The increase in total stockholders' equity during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily attributed to net income, partially offset by $1.5 million in dividend payments and a $253,000 increase in other comprehensive loss. The other comprehensive loss was the result of the mark-to-market adjustment of our investment portfolio.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis earnings release contains financial information and performance measures determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\").
