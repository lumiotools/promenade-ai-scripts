(Nasdaq:VEEE) (\"Twin Vee\" or the \"Company\"), a manufacturer of Twin Vee PowerCats and AquaSport boats known as offshore, family-friendly fishing boats from its factory in Fort Pierce, Florida, today reported operational highlights and financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Highlights: (Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are to the three months ended September 30, 2023, \"Q1\" refers to the three months ended March 31, 2024, \"Q2\" refers to the three months ended June 30, 2024, \"Q3\" refers to the three months ended September 30, 2024, \"Twin Vee\" refers to the gas-powered segment, \"Forza\" refers to the electric boat and development segment, and \"consolidated\" refers to the consolidated results of Twin Vee PowerCats Co.)**\n\n  * Shareholders of both Twin Vee and Forza X1, Inc. (OTC: FRZA) voted in favor of the merger of these two entities.\n\n  * Twin Vee continues to experience industry wide declining demand for recreational marine vehicles.\n\n  * Proactive measures were taken to mitigate slowing demand challenges, including lowering production numbers, tightened financial controls, and a reduction in workforce.\n\n  * Consolidated revenue for Q3 decreased by 64% to $2,901,000 from $8,077,000 in Q3 2023.\n\n  * Consolidated holdings of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities totaled $11,358,000 at the end of Q3 as compared to $15,134,000 at the end of Q2.\n\n  * Consolidated net loss for Q3, was $3,010,000, which includes Twin Vee's Q3 net loss of $2,114,000 and Forza X1 Q3 net loss of $896,000.\n\n  * Twin Vee adjusted net loss was $1,402,000 or $467,000 per month in Q3.\n\n  * Forza adjusted net loss was $427,000 or $155,000 per month in Q3.\n\n  * The decrease in cash reserves was primarily due to the Twin Vee building expansion, new product development, merger related costs and operational cash losses from reduced revenue in the third quarter of 2024 and payments against vendor balances that had grown during the second quarter.\n\n  * At September 30, 2024:\n\n    * Consolidated total assets were $30,140,000.\n\n    * Consolidated total equity was $23,208,000\n\n\n\n\n\"The recreational marine industry has continued to be challenged by declining customer demand. The recent Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show was well-attended and Twin Vee had several models on display, with dealers reporting several sales and leads resulting from the show. Further, the results of the recent election are now behind us removing one uncertainty in the market, and in recent days, the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates by one quarter point. While this interest rate reduction by itself is not significant, we believe the directional move is an important signal to the market,\" explained Joseph Visconti, Chief Executive Officer of Twin Vee PowerCats Co.\n\n\"During the third quarter we again took steps to right-size the labor force while also tightly controlling operating costs. At the same time, we are using this slower period to lay the groundwork for the next market upswing. Twin Vee is investing in new models and expanding our Fort Pierce, FL manufacturing facility to increase production capacity and create a more efficient factory layout. We are also investing in vertical integration and efficiency by adding a state-of-the-art CNC machine into our manufacturing process. This will save on costs associated with outsourcing and enhance the quality of the boat molds we use to build our products.\"\n\nTwin Vee reported a 64% decline in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, to $2,901,000 as compared to $8,058,000 in the same period in 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Twin Vee had a net loss of $2,114,000, as compared to a net loss of $1,393,000 in the prior year.\n\nForza had a net loss of $896,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $1,046,000 for the comparable period in 2023.\n\nThe consolidated net loss attributed to stockholders of Twin Vee was $2,512,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1,862,000 for the comparable period in 2023. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") require Twin Vee to file consolidated financial statements based on Twin Vee's controlling interest in Forza X1, Inc. (Nasdaq: FRZA).\n\nMichael P. Dickerson, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer added, \"The entire team is focused on reducing our operational cash burn by driving sales and reducing operating costs, while continuing to make smart investments in infrastructure, product development, and other revenue generating opportunities. While there can be no assurances, our goal is to achieve a run rate of a consolidated adjusted net loss of $400,000 on a monthly basis as we exit the first quarter of 2025.\"\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nJoseph Visconti, Chief Executive Officer and Michael P. Dickerson, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer, will hold a conference call today, Thursday November 14, 2024, at 12:00 p.m. (Eastern).

(Nasdaq:VEEE) (\"Twin Vee\" or the \"Company\"), a manufacturer of Twin Vee PowerCats and AquaSport boats known as offshore, family-friendly fishing boats from its factory in Fort Pierce, Florida, today reported operational highlights and financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Highlights: (Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are to the three months ended September 30, 2023, \"Q1\" refers to the three months ended March 31, 2024, \"Q2\" refers to the three months ended June 30, 2024, \"Q3\" refers to the three months ended September 30, 2024, \"Twin Vee\" refers to the gas-powered segment, \"Forza\" refers to the electric boat and development segment, and \"consolidated\" refers to the consolidated results of Twin Vee PowerCats Co.)**\n\n  * Shareholders of both Twin Vee and Forza X1, Inc. (OTC: FRZA) voted in favor of the merger of these two entities.\n\n  * Twin Vee continues to experience industry wide declining demand for recreational marine vehicles.\n\n  * Proactive measures were taken to mitigate slowing demand challenges, including lowering production numbers, tightened financial controls, and a reduction in workforce.\n\n  * Consolidated revenue for Q3 decreased by 64% to $2,901,000 from $8,077,000 in Q3 2023.\n\n  * Consolidated holdings of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities totaled $11,358,000 at the end of Q3 as compared to $15,134,000 at the end of Q2.\n\n  * Consolidated net loss for Q3, was $3,010,000, which includes Twin Vee's Q3 net loss of $2,114,000 and Forza X1 Q3 net loss of $896,000.\n\n  * Twin Vee adjusted net loss was $1,402,000 or $467,000 per month in Q3.\n\n  * Forza adjusted net loss was $427,000 or $155,000 per month in Q3.\n\n  * The decrease in cash reserves was primarily due to the Twin Vee building expansion, new product development, merger related costs and operational cash losses from reduced revenue in the third quarter of 2024 and payments against vendor balances that had grown during the second quarter.\n\n  * At September 30, 2024:\n\n    * Consolidated total assets were $30,140,000.\n\n    * Consolidated total equity was $23,208,000\n\n\n\n\n\"The recreational marine industry has continued to be challenged by declining customer demand. The recent Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show was well-attended and Twin Vee had several models on display, with dealers reporting several sales and leads resulting from the show. Further, the results of the recent election are now behind us removing one uncertainty in the market, and in recent days, the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates by one quarter point. While this interest rate reduction by itself is not significant, we believe the directional move is an important signal to the market,\" explained Joseph Visconti, Chief Executive Officer of Twin Vee PowerCats Co.\n\n\"During the third quarter we again took steps to right-size the labor force while also tightly controlling operating costs. At the same time, we are using this slower period to lay the groundwork for the next market upswing. Twin Vee is investing in new models and expanding our Fort Pierce, FL manufacturing facility to increase production capacity and create a more efficient factory layout. We are also investing in vertical integration and efficiency by adding a state-of-the-art CNC machine into our manufacturing process. This will save on costs associated with outsourcing and enhance the quality of the boat molds we use to build our products.\"\n\nTwin Vee reported a 64% decline in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, to $2,901,000 as compared to $8,058,000 in the same period in 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Twin Vee had a net loss of $2,114,000, as compared to a net loss of $1,393,000 in the prior year.\n\nForza had a net loss of $896,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $1,046,000 for the comparable period in 2023.\n\nThe consolidated net loss attributed to stockholders of Twin Vee was $2,512,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1,862,000 for the comparable period in 2023. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") require Twin Vee to file consolidated financial statements based on Twin Vee's controlling interest in Forza X1, Inc. (Nasdaq: FRZA).\n\nMichael P. Dickerson, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer added, \"The entire team is focused on reducing our operational cash burn by driving sales and reducing operating costs, while continuing to make smart investments in infrastructure, product development, and other revenue generating opportunities. While there can be no assurances, our goal is to achieve a run rate of a consolidated adjusted net loss of $400,000 on a monthly basis as we exit the first quarter of 2025.\"\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nJoseph Visconti, Chief Executive Officer and Michael P.

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization\nTwin Vee PowerCats Co. (“Twin Vee” or the “Company”) was incorporated as Twin Vee Catamarans, Inc., in the state of Florida, on December 1, 2009. On April 7, 2021, the\nCompany filed a Certificate of Conversion to register and incorporate in the state of Delaware and changed the company name to Twin Vee PowerCats Co. The Certificate of\nIncorporation for Twin Vee PowerCats Co. was also filed on April 7, 2021.\nOn September 1, 2021, the Company formed Fix My Boat, Inc., (“Fix My Boat”), a wholly owned subsidiary. Fix My Boat will utilize a franchise model for marine mechanics\nacross the country. Fix My Boat has been inactive for the majority of 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024. On July 23, 2024, Fix My Boat, Inc. was merged\ninto Twin Vee PowerCats Co.\nForza X1, Inc. was initially incorporated as Electra Power Sports, Inc. on October 15, 2021, and subsequently changed the name to Forza X1, Inc. (“Forza X1” or “Forza”) on\nOctober 29, 2021. Prior to Forza’s incorporation on October 15, 2021, the electric boat business was operated as the Company’s Electra Power Sports™ Division. Following\nthe Company’s initial public offering that closed on July 23, 2021 (the “IPO”), it determined in October 2021 that for several reasons, it would market the Company’s new\nindependent line of electric boats under a new brand name (and new subsidiary).\nIn an effort to retain cash and reduce expenditures and as a result of current market conditions, on July 11, 2024, Forza’s Board of Directors determined to discontinue and wind\ndown the business related to the development and sale of electric boats utilizing its proprietary outboard electric motor. Forza explored strategic alternatives, including a\npotential merger with Twin Vee PowerCats Co. As part of this decision, Forza obtained an appraisal of its partially constructed facility in Monroe, NC and evaluated the\ncarrying costs of its assets, primarily its inventory and fixed assets. Based on this analysis, Forza recorded an impairment charge of $1,674,000 against the carrying cost of its\npartially constructed building at June 30, 2024. Forza has evaluated any material liabilities resulting from this action and has determined that there are no additional material\nliabilities to be recorded as of September 30, 2024.\nOn April 20, 2023, the Company formed AquaSport Co., a wholly owned subsidiary in the state of Florida in connection with the Company’s plan to lease the assets of former\nAQUASPORT™ boat brand and manufacturing facility in White Bluff, Tennessee. On July 30, 2024, AquaSport Co. was merged into Twin Vee PowerCats Co.\nMerger\nOn December 5, 2022, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 8, 2022 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and between Twin Vee\nPowerCats Co. and Twin Vee PowerCats, Inc., a Florida corporation (“TVPC”), TVPC was merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”).\nAs TVPC did not meet the definition of a business under ASC 805, the merger was not accounted for as a business combination. The Merger was accounted for as a\nrecapitalization of Twin Vee PowerCats, Co., effected through the exchange of TVPC shares for Twin Vee PowerCats, Co. shares, and the cancellation of Twin Vee PowerCats,\nCo. shares held by TVPC. Upon the effective date of the Merger, December 5, 2022, the Company accounted for the Merger by assuming TVPC’s net liabilities. Twin Vee\nPowerCats, Co.’s financial statements reflect the operations of TVPC. prospectively and were not restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of\noperations of TVPC.\n8\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Twin Vee, its wholly owned subsidiaries as of September 30, 2024, AquaSport Co., and Fix My Boat,\nInc., and its publicly traded subsidiary, Forza X1, collectively referred to as the “Company”. The Company’s net loss excludes losses attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nThe Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All inter-company balances and\ntransactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\nof America (“GAAP”) for interim financial statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”). Accordingly, they do not contain all information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for\nannual financial statements.\nIn the opinion of the Company’s management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all the adjustments necessary (consisting only\nof normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.\nThe results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31,\n2023, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the Company changed the classification of production labor and related benefit costs to be included as a component of cost of sales rather than\noperating expenses. The Company has adjusted the statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to be consistent with the accounting\ntreatment in 2024. This resulted in an increase in cost of products sold of $1,929,720 and $4,866,739 and a corresponding decrease in operating expenses for the nine and three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company’s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats, motors and trailers to its independent dealers. The Company recognizes revenue when obligations under the\nterms of a contract are satisfied and control over promised goods is transferred to the dealer. For the majority of sales, this occurs when the product is released to the carrier\nresponsible for transporting it to a dealer. The Company typically receives payment within five business days of shipment. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration\nit expects to receive in exchange for a product. The Company offers dealer incentives that include wholesale rebates, retail rebates and promotions, floor plan reimbursement or\ncash discounts, and other allowances that are recorded as reductions of revenues in net sales in the statements of operations. The consideration recognized represents the amount\nspecified in a contract with a customer, net of estimated incentives the Company reasonably expects to pay. The estimated liability and reduction in revenue for dealer\nincentives is recorded at the time of sale. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible because actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions dictate\nthe need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if dealer achievement or other items vary from historical trends. Accrued dealer incentives are\nincluded in accrued liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n9\nPayment received for the future sale of a boat to a customer is recognized as a customer deposit. Customer deposits are recognized as revenue when control over promised\ngoods is transferred to the customer. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had customer deposits of $38,175 and $44,195, respectively, which is\nrecorded as contract liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. These deposits are expected to be recognized as revenue within a one-year period.\nRebates and Discounts\nDealers earn wholesale rebates based on purchase volume commitments and achievement of certain performance metrics. The Company estimates the amount of wholesale\nrebates based on historical achievement, forecasted volume, and assumptions regarding dealer behavior. Rebates that apply to boats already in dealer inventory are referred to\nas retail rebates. The Company estimates the amount of retail rebates based on historical data for specific boat models adjusted for forecasted sales volume, product mix, dealer\nand consumer behavior, and assumptions concerning market conditions. The Company also utilizes various programs whereby it offers cash discounts or agrees to reimburse its\ndealers for certain floor plan interest costs incurred by dealers for limited periods of time, generally ranging up to nine months. These floor plan interest costs are treated as a\nreduction in the revenue recognized on the sale at an amount estimated at the time of sale.\nOther Revenue Recognition Matters\nDealers generally have no right to return unsold boats. Occasionally, the Company may accept returns in limited circumstances and at the Company’s discretion under its\nwarranty policy. The Company may be obligated, in the event of default by a dealer, to accept returns of unsold boats under its repurchase commitment to floor financing\nproviders, who are able to obtain such boats through foreclosure. The repurchase commitment is on an individual unit basis with a term from the date it is financed by the\nlending institution through the payment date by the dealer, generally not exceeding 30 months.\nThe Company has excluded sales and other taxes assessed by a governmental authority in connection with revenue-producing activities from the determination of the\ntransaction price for all contracts. The Company has not adjusted net sales for the effects of a significant financing component because the period between the transfer of the\npromised goods and the customer’s payment is expected to be one year or less.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the\nreporting period. Some of these judgments can be subjective and complex, and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates.\nConcentrations of Credit and Business Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of trade receivables. Credit risk on trade receivables is mitigated as\na result of the Company’s use of trade letters of credit, dealer floor plan financing arrangements, and the geographically diversified nature of the Company’s customer base. The\nCompany minimizes the concentration of credit risk associated with its cash by maintaining its cash with high quality federally insured financial institutions. However, cash\nbalances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured limit of $250,000 are at risk. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nCompany had $10,414,162 and $15,868,574, respectively, in excess of FDIC insured limits.\n10\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of six months or less at the time of purchase. On September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $11,357,892 and $16,755,233, respectively. Included within restricted cash on the\nCompany’s condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was cash deposited as collateral for irrevocable letters of credit of $212,963\nand $257,530, respectively.\nMarketable Securities\nThe Company’s investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and\nability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at\nfair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on\navailable-for-sale debt securities are included in net income.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company follows accounting guidelines on fair value measurements for financial instruments measured on a recurring basis, as well as for certain assets and liabilities that\nare initially recorded at their estimated fair values. Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market participants as the measurement date. The Company uses the following three-level hierarchy that maximizes the use of observable\ninputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs to value its financial instruments:\n● Level 1: Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments.\n● Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.\n● Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values are determined using\npricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires a significant\njudgment or estimation.\nFinancial instruments measured as fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s\nassessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires it to make judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or\nliability. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on estimated fair values. Accordingly, the fair value estimates disclosed,\nor initial amounts recorded may not be indicative of the amount that the Company or holders of the instruments could realize in a current market exchange.\nThe carrying amounts of cash equivalents approximate their fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature, such as accounts receivable and payable, and other financial\ninstruments in current assets or current liabilities.\n11\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company’s Accounts Receivable is derived from third party financing arrangements that its dealers utilize to finance the purchase of its boats. This “floorplan financing” is\ncollateralized by the finished boat, and cash payment is received within 3-5 days of the finance company’s approval of the dealer’s purchase. At the end of a reporting period,\nsome payment(s) may not yet have been received from the financing company, which creates a temporary account receivable that will be satisfied in just a few days. As such,\nthe Company’s Accounts Receivable at any point in time are 100% collectable, and no valuation adjustment is necessary. Therefore, there is no allowance for credit losses on\nthe Company’s balance sheet.\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost determined using the average cost method on a first-in first -out basis. Net realizable value is\ndefined as sales price, less cost of completion, disposable and transportation and a normal profit margin. Production costs, consisting of labor and overhead, are applied to\nending finished goods inventories at a rate based on estimated production capacity. Excess production costs are charged to cost of products sold. Provisions have been made to\nreduce excess or obsolete inventories to their net realizable value. Provisions for excess and obsolete inventories at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $126,557\nand $419,616, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, using the straight-line method over the assets’ useful life. Leasehold improvements\nare amortized over the shorter of the assets’ useful life or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of property and equipment range from three to five years. Upon sale or\nretirement, the cost and related accumulated depreciation is eliminated from their respective accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is included in results of operations. Repairs\nand maintenance charges, which do not increase the useful lives of the assets, are charged to operations as incurred.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nManagement assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets when indicators of impairment are present. If such indicators are present, recoverability of these assets is\ndetermined by comparing the undiscounted net cash flows estimated to result from those assets over the remaining life to the assets’ net carrying amounts. If the estimated\nundiscounted net cash flows are less than the net carrying amount, the assets would be adjusted to their fair value, based on appraisal or the present value of the undiscounted\nnet cash flows. An impairment charge of $1,674,000 was recorded against the Forza building under construction in the second quarter of 2024 based on a third-party appraisal.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred, and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of\noperations. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, advertising costs incurred by the Company totaled $24,196 and $129,592, respectively. During the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, advertising costs incurred by the Company totaled $151,776 and $374,059, respectively.\n12\nResearch and Development\nThe Company expenses research and development costs relating to new product development as incurred. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, research\nand development costs amounted to $89,403 and $63,867, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, research and development costs amounted to\n$583,878 and $930,497, respectively.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nShipping and handling costs include those costs incurred to transport product to customers and internal handling costs, which relate to activities to prepare goods for shipment.\nThe Company has elected to account for shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has been transferred to a customer as a\nfulfillment cost. The Company includes shipping and handling costs, including cost billed to customers, in cost of sales in the statements of operations. All manufactured boats\nare free on board (FOB) from the Fort Pierce manufacturing plant. Dealers are required to either pick up the boats themselves or contract with a transporter. For the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, shipping and handling costs amounted to $57,149 and $144,388, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, shipping and handling costs amounted to $261,927 and $540,155, respectively.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date\nbased on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, it uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company calculates the associated lease liability and corresponding\nROU asset upon lease commencement using a discount rate based on a credit-adjusted secured borrowing rate commensurate with the term of the lease. The operating lease\nROU asset also includes any lease payments made and is reduced by lease incentives. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it\nis reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expenses for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nSupplier Concentrations\nThe Company is dependent on the ability of its suppliers to provide products on a timely basis and on favorable pricing terms. The loss of certain principal suppliers or a\nsignificant reduction in product availability from principal suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Business risk insurance is in place to mitigate the\nbusiness risk associated with sole suppliers for sudden disruptions such as those caused by natural disasters.\nThe Company is dependent on third-party equipment manufacturers, distributors, and dealers for certain parts and materials utilized in the manufacturing process. During the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company purchased all engines and certain composite materials for its boats under supplier agreements with five vendors. Total\npurchases from these vendors were $4,414,169. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company purchased all engines from three vendors for its boats under\nsupplier agreements. Total purchases from these vendors were $5,654,582.\n13\nEmployee Retention Credit\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was signed into law providing numerous tax provisions and other stimulus\nmeasures, including an employee retention credit (“ERC”), which is a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes. The Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief\nAct of 2020 and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 extended and expanded the availability of the ERC.\nAccounting Standards Codification 105, “Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,” describes the decision-making framework when no guidance exists in US GAAP for a\nparticular transaction. Specifically, ASC 105-10-05-2 instructs companies to look for guidance for a similar transaction within US GAAP and apply that guidance by analogy.\nAs such, forms of government assistance, such as the ERC, provided to business entities would not be within the scope of ASC 958, but it may be applied by analogy under\nASC 105-10-05-2. The Company accounted for the Employee Retention Credit as a government grant in accordance with Accounting Standards Update 2013-06, Not-for-Profit\nEntities (Topic 958) (“ASU 2013-06”) by analogy under ASC 105-10-05-2. Under this standard, government grants are recognized when the conditions on which they depend\nare substantially met. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized income related to the employee retention credit of $0 and $1,267,055,\nrespectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes stock-based compensation costs for its restricted stock measured at the fair value of each award at the time of grant, as an expense over the period\nduring which an employee is required to provide service. Compensation cost is recognized over the service period for the fair value of awards that vest.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to\ndifferences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax\nassets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets,\nmanagement considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is\nentirely dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the\nscheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements\nto Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 aims to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures\nabout significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 requires disclosures of significant expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included\nwithin each reported segment measure of segment profit or loss. The update also required disclosure regarding the chief operating decision maker and expands interim segment\ndisclosure requirements. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU-2023-07 on its consolidated financial statements.\n14\nThe Company has considered all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe the adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on its\nfinancial statements.\n2.

In August of 2023, the then president of Forza,\nJames Leffew, purchased the property, and Forza executed a new lease agreement with Mr. Leffew on the same month-to-month terms. For the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, the lease expense was $7,500 and $12,500, respectively.\n12. Commitments and Contingencies\nRepurchase Obligations\nUnder certain conditions, the Company is obligated to repurchase new inventory repossessed from dealerships by financial institutions that provide credit to the Company’s\ndealers.

Segment\nThe Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making\ndecisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments.\nThe Company reported its financial performance based on the following segments: Gas-powered Boats, Franchise and Electric Boats.\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for business segments are generally based on the sale of\nboats and the sale of franchises. Income (loss) from operations for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly\nattributable to the segment. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expenses. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments\nfor management reporting purposes. Inasmuch as we determined to discontinue and wind down Forza’s business related to the development and sale of electric boats utilizing\nits proprietary outboard electric motor, the Company does not anticipate having an electric boat segment in the future.\nThe following table shows information by reportable segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024\nElectric Boat and\nGas-Powered Boats Franchise Development Total\nNet sales $ 2,901,318 $ — $ — $ 2,901,318\nCost of products sold 3,035,053 — 11,922 3,046,975\nOperating expense 1,990,512 610 852,451 2,843,573\nLoss from operations (2,124,247) (610) (864,373) (2,989,230)\nOther income (expense) 10,857 (205) (31,329) (20,677)\nNet loss $ (2,113,390) $ (815) $ (895,702) $ (3,009,907)\n27\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023\nElectric Boat and\nGas-Powered Boats Franchise Development Total\nNet sales $ 8,057,986 $ — $ 18,559 $ 8,076,545\nCost of products sold 7,459,413 — 11,621 7,471,034\nOperating expense 2,124,980 988 1,258,966 3,384,934\nLoss from operations (1,526,407) (988) (1,252,028) (2,779,423)\nOther income (expense) 133,885 (4,185) 205,714 335,414\nNet loss $ (1,392,522) $ (5,173) $ (1,046,314) $ (2,444,009)\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nElectric Boat and\nGas-Powered Boats Franchise Development Total\nNet sales $ 12,504,482 $ — $ — $ 12,504,482\nCost of products sold 12,102,151 — 68,335 12,170,486\nOperating expense 5,469,191 1,537 5,054,781 10,525,509\nLoss from operations (5,066,860) (1,537) (5,123,116) (10,191,513)\nOther income (expense) 104,284 (5,092) 228,023 327,215\nNet loss $ (4,962,576) $ (6,629) $ (4,895,093) $ (9,864,298)\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nElectric Boat and\nGas-Powered Boats Franchise Development Total\nNet sales $ 24,962,343 $ — $ 18,559 $ 24,980,902\nCost of products sold 21,825,735 — 102,358 21,928,093\nOperating expense 6,326,098 2,386 4,917,498 11,245,982\nLoss from operations (3,189,490) (2,386) (5,001,297) (8,193,173)\nOther income (expense) 1,563,128 (12,369) 466,197 2,016,956\nNet loss $ (1,626,362) $ (14,755) $ (4,535,100) $ (6,176,217)\nProperty and equipment, net, classified by business were as follows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nGas-Powered Boats $ 9,828,812 $ 8,825,027\nFranchise $ — $ —\nElectric-Boats $ 4,388,229 $ 3,468,961\n16.

At the Annual Meeting, the Company’s stockholders approved\nthe issuance of shares of the Company’s common stock to Forza stockholders pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 12, 2024, by and\nbetween Forza, the Company and Twin Vee Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.\nThe Company has evaluated all events or transactions that occurred after September 30, 2024 through November 14, 2024, which is the date that the condensed financial\nstatements were available to be issued. During this period, there were no additional material subsequent events.\n28\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes included in\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”\nOur actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including\nthose discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and notes thereto. You should also review the disclosure under the heading “Risk Factors” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and under\nPart 1, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ\nmaterially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a designer, manufacturer and marketer of recreational and commercial power boats. We believe our company has been an innovator in the recreational and commercial\npower catamaran industry. We currently have 13 gas-powered models in production ranging in size from our 22-foot mono hull, single engine, center console to our newly\ndesigned 40-foot offshore 400 GFX catamaran, quad engines. While our twin-hull catamaran running surface, known as a symmetrical catamaran hull design, adds to the Twin\nVee ride quality by reducing drag, increasing fuel efficiency, and offering users a stable riding boat, our new mono hull line addresses the largest portion of the overall market.\nHistorically, we have organized our business into three operating segments: (i) our gas-powered boat segment which manufactures and distributes gas-powered boats under the\nTwin Vee and AquaSport names; (ii) our electric-powered boat segment which is developing fully electric boats, through our publicly owned subsidiary, Forza X1, Inc., a\nDelaware corporation (“Forza”) and (iii) our franchise segment which is developing a standard product offering and will be selling franchises across the United States.\nInasmuch as we determined to discontinue and wind down Forza’s business related to the development and sale of electric boats utilizing its proprietary outboard electric\nmotor, we do not anticipate having an electric boat segment in the future.\nOur gas-powered boats allow consumers to use them for a wide range of recreational activities including fishing, diving and water skiing and commercial activities including\ntransportation, eco tours, fishing and diving expeditions. We believe that the performance, quality and value of our boats position us to achieve our goal of increasing our\nmarket share and expanding the power catamaran boating market. We currently primarily sell our boats through a current network of 23 independent boat dealers in 37\nlocations across North America and the Caribbean who resell our boats to the end user Twin Vee and AquaSport customers. We continue recruiting efforts for high quality boat\ndealers and seek to establish new dealers and distributors domestically and internationally to distribute our boats as we grow our production and introduce new models. Our\ngas-powered boats are currently outfitted with gas-powered outboard combustion engines.\n29\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we have continued to experience a significant reduction in demand for our products, as has been experienced throughout the boating industry.\nTotal units sold in the quarter were 20 compared to 66 in the third quarter of 2023, a 70% reduction, compared to a 64% reduction in revenue over the same period. This\ndifference is due to the average selling price per unit in each quarter. Sales per unit for the third quarter of 2024 was approximately $145,065 compared to $122,371 the prior\nyear quarter as the company has focused more on larger boats in the current year. The Company’s objectives have been to add new, larger boat models including a new line of\nGFX2 models, expand our dealers and distribution network, and increase unit production to fulfill our customer and dealer orders.\nDue to the growing demand for sustainable, environmentally friendly electric and alternative fuel commercial and recreational vehicles, Forza, entered the business of\ndesigning and developing a line of electric-powered boats. Our electric boats are being designed as fully integrated electric boats including the hull, outboard motor and control\nsystem. To date, Forza X1 has built-out and tested multiple Forza company units, including: three offshore-style catamarans, two bay boat-style catamarans, one deck boat and\nthree 22-foot center console (F22) monohulls. The past year has seen a marked deceleration in the global demand for recreational marine vehicles, influenced heavily by\neconomic uncertainties and shifting consumer priorities. This slowdown reflects broader trends affecting the recreational vehicle industries at large, including electric vehicles\n(EVs). Notably, the global shift towards EV adoption has been much slower than initially anticipated. Several leading automotive manufacturers have adjusted their strategies,\naccordingly, including halting the construction of dedicated EV factories.\nThe slower-than-expected adoption rates have led to cautious consumer spending and investment in EV technology, directly impacting the Company’s market. Specifically, the\nelectric boat segment has experienced even more sluggish growth than the automotive sector. In addition, many of the larger players in the boat industry, such as Mercury\nMarine, have completed their development efforts and have brought their electric outboard motors to market. Despite these challenges, we have managed to sustain operations\nthrough strategic adjustments, including cost management and a focus on strategic partnerships. We have implemented measures that have reduced cash burn and conserved\ncash reserves while seeking to leverage our technological advancements through strategic collaborations and partnerships to enhance shareholder value. We have responded to\nthe industry challenges by tightening our financial reins to mitigate the impacts of reduced demand with a view toward long-term sustainability. In an effort to further retain\ncash and reduce expenditures and as a result of current market conditions, on July 11, 2024, the Board of Directors of Forza determined to discontinue and wind down its\nbusiness related to the development and sale of electric boats utilizing its proprietary outboard electric motor.\nRecent Developments\nOn July 12, 2024, Karl Zimmer was appointed as our President.\nOn August 12, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Forza and Twin Vee Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our\nwholly owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which, among other things, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement,\nForza will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Forza surviving the merger (the “Merger”). The Merger is intended to qualify for federal income tax purposes as a tax-free\nreorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the\neffective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each outstanding share of Forza common stock (other than any shares held by us), will be converted into the right to receive\n0.61166627 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of our common stock, any fractional shares to be rounded down to the nearest whole share of common stock, for an aggregate of\n5,355,000 shares of our common stock. Each outstanding stock option exercisable for shares of Forza common stock that is outstanding at the Effective Time, whether vested or\nunvested, will be assumed by us and converted into a stock option to purchase the number of shares of our common stock that the holder would have received if such holder\nhad exercised such stock option for shares of Forza common stock prior to the Merger and exchanged such shares for our common stock in accordance with the Exchange\nRatio. Each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of Forza common stock will be assumed by us and converted into a warrant to purchase the number of shares of our\ncommon stock that the holder would have received if such holder had exercised such warrant for shares of Forza common stock prior to the Merger and exchanged such shares\nfor shares of our common stock in accordance with the Exchange Ratio, subject to adjustment for any reverse stock split. In addition, at the Effective Time the 7,000,000 shares\nof Forza common stock held by us will be cancelled.\n30\nThe completion of the Merger by each of us and Forza is subject to customary conditions, including (1) (A) adoption of the Merger Agreement by Forza’s stockholders (which\napproval shall include a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy at the Forza annual meeting excluding shares held by us) and (B) approval by our shareholders of\nthe issuance of our shares of common stock to the Forza stockholders, (2) authorization for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market of the shares of our common stock to be issued\nin the Merger, subject to official notice of issuance, (3) effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4 for our common stock to be issued in the Merger, and (4) the\nabsence of any order, injunction, decree or other legal restraint preventing the completion of the Merger or making the completion of the Merger illegal. Each party’s obligation\nto complete the Merger is also subject to certain additional customary conditions, including subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of\nthe other party and performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement. In our capacity as a principal stockholder of Forza, we\nhave agreed to vote the shares of Forza common stock held by us for the approval and adoption of the Merger only if a majority of the other stockholders of Forza present in\nperson or by proxy at the Forza annual meeting vote to approve and adopt the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Forza and the Company. In addition, either the Company or Forza may terminate the Merger Agreement if\nthe Merger is not consummated by December 1, 2024. On November 11, 2024, we held our 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “Annual Meeting”). At the Annual\nMeeting, our stockholders approved the issuance of shares of our common stock to Forza stockholders pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. We believe that all\nclosing conditions will be met and anticipate consummating the Merger in the near future.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe following table provides certain selected financial information for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nNet sales $ 2,901,318 $ 8,076,545 $ (5,175,227) (64%)\nCost of products sold $ 3,046,975 $ 7,471,034 $ (4,424,059) (59%)\nGross (loss) profit $ (145,657) $ 605,511 $ (751,168) (124%)\nOperating expenses $ 2,843,573 $ 3,384,934 $ (541,361) (16%)\nLoss from operations $ (2,989,230) $ (2,779,423) $ (209,807) (8%)\nOther (expense) income $ (20,677) $ 335,414 $ (356,091) (106%)\nNet loss $ (3,009,907) $ (2,444,009) $ (565,898) (23%)\nBasic and dilutive income per share of common stock $ (0.26) $ (0.20) $ (0.06) (31%)\nWeighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding 9,520,000 9,520,000\n31\nNet Sales and Cost of Sales\nOur net sales decreased by $5,175,227, or 64% to $2,901,318 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $8,076,545 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThis decrease was due to a decrease in the number of boats sold during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the mix of boats sold. The number of boats sold during\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 70% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nGross Profit\nGross profits (losses) decreased by $751,168 or 124% to $(145,657) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $605,511 for the three months ended September 30,\n2023. Gross profit as a percentage of sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was -5.0% and 7.5% respectively. On a sequential basis, gross profit\ndeclined $348,997 while sales declined $1,425,503, reflecting our efforts to reduce our cost structure and limit cash burn during this economic downturn in the marine industry.\nWe continue to right size the workforce and drive efficiency in all parts of our cost structure.\nTotal Operating Expenses\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, operating expenses were $2,843,573 and $3,384,934, respectively. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales\nwas 98.0% compared to 41.9% in the prior year. Operating expenses, for the gas-powered boat segment, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were\n$1,990,512 and $2,124,980, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, operating expenses for our gas-powered\nsegment were 68.6% and 26.4%, respectively. Our total operating expenses for Forza, our electric powered boat and development segment, for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 were $852,451 and $1,258,966, respectively.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 22%, or $220,124 to $764,757 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to\n$984,881 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to reductions in marketing, advertising, dealer meeting and travel expenses.\nSalaries and wage related expenses decreased 34%, or $586,366 to $1,145,568 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1,731,934 for the three months\nended September 30, 2023. The majority of the decrease is due to reductions in staffing levels at Forza. Included in salaries and wage related expenses for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 was stock-based compensation expense of $278,867, Forza’s portion of that expense being $174,159. In total, stock-based compensation expense\ndecreased by $185,693 or 40% as compared to the prior year period.\nResearch and development expenses increased by $25,536 to $89,403 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $63,867 for the three months ended September 30,\n2023. This increase was due primarily to the charges for an inventory allowance related to R&D inventory at Forza, partially offset by lower R&D activity.\nProfessional fees increased by 51% or $140,961 to $403,387 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $262,426 for the three months ended September 30,\n2023. This increase was due primarily to higher legal and consulting expenses in the current year related to exploration of strategic options at Forza and the Merger between\nTwin Vee and Forza.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by 29%, or $98,632 to $440,458 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $341,826 for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. This increase is due to the addition of fixed assets, primarily molds, to increase our production levels and throughout.\n32\nOther income decreased by $356,091 to a loss of $20,677 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $355,414 for the three months ended September 30,\n2023. This decrease was due primarily to a reduction in dividend and interest income from lower cash balances and a loss on disposal of assets in the third quarter of 2024.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $3,009,907, as compared to $2,444,009 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase in loss of\n$565,898. Our electric segment, which did not generate any revenue at this time, incurred a loss of $895,702 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, related mostly to\nstaffing costs and professional fees. Our gas-powered segment incurred a loss of $2,113,800 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due largely to the rapid decline in\norders for new boats during 2024. Basic and dilutive loss per share of common stock for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was ($0.26), as compared to ($0.20) for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023.\nComparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe following table provides certain selected financial information for the periods presented:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nNet sales $ 12,504,482 $ 24,980,902 $ (12,476,420) (50%)\nCost of products sold $ 12,170,486 $ 21,928,093 $ (9,757,607) (44%)\nGross profit $ 333,996 $ 3,052,809 $ (2,718,813) (89%)\nOperating expenses $ 10,525,509 $ 11,245,982 $ (720,473) (6%)\nLoss from operations $ (10,191,513) $ (8,193,173) $ (1,998,340) (24%)\nOther income $ 327,215 $ 2,016,956 $ (1,689,741) (84%)\nNet loss $ (9,864,298) $ (6,176,217) $ (3,688,081) (60%)\nBasic and dilutive income per share of common stock $ (0.75) $ (0.46) $ (0.29) (63%)\nWeighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding 9,520,000 9,520,000\nNet Sales and Cost of Sales\nOur net sales decreased by $12,476,420, or 50% to $12,504,482 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $24,980,902 for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. This decrease was due to a decrease in the number of boats sold during the first nine months of 2024 and the mix of boats sold. The number of boats sold during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 decreased 61% compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nGross Profit\nGross profits decreased by $2,178,813 or 89% to $333,996 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $3,052,809 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nGross profit as a percentage of sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 2.7% and 12.2% respectively. Through continuous efficiency improvements,\nthe company was partially able to offset the impact of fixed cost deleveraging in the production facility as revenues declined 50% over the same period last year. We continue to\nright size the workforce and drive efficiency in all parts of our cost structure.\n33\nTotal Operating Expenses\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses were $10,525,509 and included an impairment charge of $1,674,000 related to the Forza impairment of\nproperty & equipment in the second quarter of 2024. Before the impact of this charge, operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were\n$8,851,509 and $11,245,982, respectively, and as a percentage of sales were 70.8% compared to 45.0% in the prior year. Our total operating expenses for our gas-powered boat\nsegment, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $5,469,191 and $11,192,837, respectively, and as a percentage of revenues were 43.7% and 44.8%,\nrespectively. Our total operating expenses for Forza, our electric powered boat and development segment, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were\n$5,054,781 and $4,917,498, respectively.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 24.2%, or $706,846 to $2,214,670 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to\n$2,921,516 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The largest drivers of the decrease were reductions in sales and marketing expenses, hiring costs and office supplies,\nprimarily resulting from the decline in R&D activity at Forza between periods.\nSalaries and wage related expenses decreased 34.7%, or $1,930,671 to $3,641,185 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $5,571,856 for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. The majority of the decrease is due to reductions in staffing levels at Forza, as well as the staffing of Aquasport. Included in salaries and wage\nrelated expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was stock-based compensation expense of $1,022,894, Forza’s portion of that expense being $651,115. In total,\nstock-based compensation expense decreased by $413,991 or 28.8% as compared to the prior year period.\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $346,619, or 37.3%, to $583,878 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from $930,497 for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. This decrease was due primarily to lower R&D activity in the Forza electric motor segment.\nProfessional fees increased by 13.7% or $133,631 to $1,111,079 for the nine months September 30, 2024, compared to $977,448 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nprimarily due to merger related legal and related expenses incurred during the third quarter of 2024.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by 54%, or $456,032 to $1,300,697 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $844,665 for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. This increase is due to the addition of fixed assets, primarily building additions and molds, to increase our production levels and support and\nthroughput.\nOther income decreased by $1,689,741 to $327,215 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $2,016,956 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThis decrease was due primarily to the first half of 2023 recognition of income from the Employee Retention Credit of $1,267,055 and a reduction in income generating\ninvestment amounts.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $9,864,298, as compared to $6,176,217 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase in the net loss\nof $3,688,081. Our electric segment, which did not generate any revenue, incurred a loss of $4,846,882 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, related mostly to\nstaffing costs and research and development. Our gas-powered segment incurred a loss of $4,962,576 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due largely to the rapid\ndecline in orders for new boats during the first nine months of 2024. Basic and dilutive loss per share of common stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was\n($0.75), as compared to ($0.46) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n34\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nA primary source of funds for the year ended December 31, 2023 and through September 30, 2024 was net cash received from our secondary offering, as well as Forza’s initial\npublic and secondary offering and revenue generated from operations. Our primary use of cash was related to funding the expansion of our operations through capital\nimprovements, as well as molds for the expansion of Aquasport and Twin Vee models. With reduced demand, we have been reducing inventory levels. Our priority over the\nnext several months is to continue to reduce production costs and labor to match market demand, complete the Twin Vee facility expansion and efficiency project, complete the\naddition of a wire harness assembly cell, continue to expand the Twin Vee GFX 2 lineup, and develop and introduce a new Twin Vee BayCat line of boats, which will require\nadditional investment in molds and machinery.\nThe following table provides selected financial data about us as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change % Change\nCash and cash equivalents $ 11,144,929 $ 16,497,703 $ (5,352,774) (32.4%)\nRestricted cash $ 212,963 $ 257,530 $ (44,567) (17.3%)\nCurrent assets $ 15,378,981 $ 26,646,318 $ (11,267,337) (42.3%)\nCurrent liabilities $ 3,843,294 $ 4,216,345 $ (373,051) (8.8%)\nWorking capital $ 11,535,687 $ 22,429,973 $ (10,894,286) (48.6%)\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $11,357,892 of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, total current assets of $15,356,981 and total assets of $30,140,476. Our total\nliabilities were $6,932,265. Our total liabilities were comprised of current liabilities of $3,843,294 which included accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $3,153,884, leases\nliability of $651,235, contract liability of $38,175 and long-term liabilities of $3,088,971. As of December 31, 2023, we had $16,497,703 of cash, cash equivalents, and\nrestricted cash, $4,462,942 of marketable securities, total current assets of $26,646,318 and total assets of $39,846,713. Our total current liabilities were $4,216,345 and total\nliabilities of $7,797,098 which included long-term finance and operating leases liabilities of $3,080,853.\nThe accumulated deficit was $21,491,078 as of September 30, 2024 compared to accumulated deficit of $14,346,984 as of December 31, 2023.\nOur working capital decreased by $10,894,286 to $11,535,687 as of September 30, 2024, compared to $22,429,972 on December 31, 2023 primarily due to continued\ndevelopment efforts at Forza which was a non-revenue generating entity, the ongoing construction of the new manufacturing facilities in North Carolina and Ft. Pierce, Florida,\nand investments in molds for new boat designs.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents will provide sufficient resources to finance operations for the next 24 months from the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, we anticipate that we will be able to rely, in part, on cash flows from operations in order to meet our liquidity and\ncapital expenditure needs in the next year. We expect Forza’s expenses to decrease as it curtails its operation and the potential sale of its partially constructed manufacturing\nfacility in McDowell, North Carolina, the cost of which we expect will be paid for through the proceeds of Forza’s public offerings, provided the conditions to receipt of the\ngrant funding are met, of which there can be no assurance.\n35\nCash Flow\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change % Change\nCash used in operating activities $ (4,638,887) $ (6,930,130) $ 2,291,243 33%\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (567,889) $ (11,061,664) $ 10,493,775 95%\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (190,565) $ 6,892,338 $ (7,082,903) (103%)\nNet Change in Cash $ (5,397,341) $ (11,099,456) $ 5,702,115 51%\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows used in operating activities was $4,638,887 compared to $6,930,130 during the nine months ended September\n30, 2023. The use of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to a $9,864,298 net loss partially offset by a $1,591,390 reduction in net inventory\nlevels and depreciation and amortization of $1,300,697, stock-based compensation of $1,022,894, and an impairment of property & equipment of $1,674,000 since December\n31, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash flows used in operating activities was $6,930,130. We increased inventory levels by $4,126,506, due to\nopening the AquaSport production facility and adding two additional engine suppliers. Accounts receivable increased by $494,339, and accounts payable increased by\n$1,568,127. Our accrued expenses decreased by $275,255 and prepaid expenses decreased by $332,142. Our net loss from operation was $6,176,217, and was decreased by\nnon-cash expenses of $2,591,485, the largest of these being stock-based compensation of $1,436,885, change of right-of-use asset and leases liabilities of $355,519, and\ndepreciation of $844,665.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in investing activities was $567,889, due primarily to net sales of marketable securities partially offset by\ninvestments in property, plant and equipment. This compares to a use of cash in investing activities of $11,061,664 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulting from\nthe investment of cash received from the Forza stock issuance into marketable securities and the purchase of property and equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was approximately $190,565 from finance lease obligations compared to net cash provided\nby financing activities of $6,892,338 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily from the issuance of Forza common stock.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nWe believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance. We refer to these policies as “critical” because these specific\nareas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate, and different estimates—which also would have\nbeen reasonable—could have been used, which would have resulted in different financial results.\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been\nprepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on\nhistorical experience and make various assumptions, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, which form the basis for judgments about the\ncarrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or\nconditions.\n36\nThe notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein contain a summary of our significant accounting policies. We consider the following accounting\npolicies critical to the understanding of the results of our operations:\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats, motors and trailers to its independent dealers. We recognize revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract are\nsatisfied and control over promised goods is transferred to the dealer. For the majority of sales, this occurs when the product is released to the carrier responsible for\ntransporting it to a dealer. We typically receive payment within five business days of shipment. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration it expects to receive in\nexchange for a product. We offer dealer incentives that include wholesale rebates, retail rebates and promotions, floor plan reimbursement or cash discounts, and other\nallowances that are recorded as reductions of revenues in net sales in the statements of operations. The consideration recognized represents the amount specified in a contract\nwith a customer, net of estimated incentives we reasonably expect to pay. The estimated liability and reduction in revenue for dealer incentives is recorded at the time of sale.\nSubsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible because actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales\npromotion and incentive programs or if dealer achievement or other items vary from historical trends. Accrued dealer incentives are included in accrued liabilities in the\naccompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nPayment received for the future sale of a boat to a customer is recognized as a customer deposit. Customer deposits are recognized as revenue when control over promised\ngoods is transferred to the customer.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States “U.S. GAAP” requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Included in those estimates are assumptions about\nallowances for inventory obsolescence, useful life of fixed assets, warranty reserves and bad-debt reserves.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Net realizable value is defined as sales price less cost of completion,\ndisposable and transportation and a normal profit margin. Production costs, consisting of labor and overhead, are applied to ending finished goods inventories at a rate based on\nestimated production capacity. Excess production costs are charged to cost of products sold. Provisions are made when necessary to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to\ntheir net realizable value.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nManagement assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets when indicators of impairment are present. If such indicators are present, recoverability of these assets is\ndetermined by comparing the undiscounted net cash flows estimated to result from those assets over the remaining life to the assets’ net carrying amounts. If the estimated\nundiscounted net cash flows are less than the net carrying amount, the assets would be adjusted to their fair value, based on appraisal or the present value of the undiscounted\nnet cash flows.\n37\nProduct Warranty Costs\nAs required by FASB ASC Topic 460, Guarantees, we are including the following disclosure applicable to our product warranties.\nWe accrue for warranty costs based on the expected material and labor costs to provide warranty replacement products. The methodology used in determining the liability for\nwarranty cost is based upon historical information and experience. Our warranty reserve is calculated as the gross sales multiplied by the historical warranty expense return\nrate.\nLeases\nWe adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (“Topic 842”), using the modified retrospective adoption method with an effective date of\nJanuary 1, 2019. This standard requires all lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments.\nUnder Topic 842, we applied a dual approach to all leases whereby we are a lessee and classify leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or\nnot the lease is effectively a financed purchase by us. Lease classification is evaluated at the inception of the lease agreement.\nDeferred Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance\nWe account for income taxes under ASC 740 “Income Taxes.” Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future\ntax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax\nassets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or\nsettled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for\ncertain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that we will not realize tax assets through future operations.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.\n38\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures\nof a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Disclosure controls and\nprocedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits\nunder the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons\nperforming similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We have adopted and maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as\ndefined Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed\nunder the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the\nrules of the SEC. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable\nassurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based\non the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such a date,\nour disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, related to not yet having retained\nsufficient staff or engaged sufficient outside consultants with appropriate experience in GAAP presentation, especially of complex instruments.\nRemediation Plan\nManagement has developed and is executing a remediation plan to address the previously disclosed material weaknesses, due to inadequate staffing levels. We have retained a\nfull-time Senior Staff Accountant as well as a part-time staff accountant and we have implemented a robust ERP system. We will continue to evaluate our needs as business\nconditions warrant.\nTo remediate the existing material weaknesses, additional time is required to demonstrate the effectiveness of the remediation efforts. The material weaknesses cannot be\nconsidered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are\noperating effectively. As of September 30, 2024, controls and procedures have been implemented to remediate the material weakness, however testing of controls continues.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have incurred additional turnover of accounting and finance personnel, and are currently in the process of hiring additional accounting staff and developing and refining our\ncontrols and other procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC are recorded, processed, summarized, and\nreported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and in accordance with GAAP. Other than as set forth in this paragraph, there have been no changes in internal control\nover financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected or is reasonable likely to materially affect our control over financial\nreporting.\n39\nPART II—OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal\nproceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or\ncash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other\nfactors.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risks, together with all the other information in this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q, including our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. If any of the following risks actually materializes, our operating results, financial\ncondition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. The following information updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the information disclosed in\nPart I, Item 1A, ”Risk Factors,” contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Except as disclosed below, there have been no material\nchanges from the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a de-listing of our common stock.\nThe shares of our Common Stock are listed for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “VEEE.” If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The\nNasdaq Capital Market, such as the corporate governance requirements, the stockholder’s equity requirement, or the minimum closing bid price requirement, The Nasdaq\nCapital Market may take steps to de-list our Common Stock. Such a de-listing or even notification of failure to comply with such requirements would likely have a negative\neffect on the price of our Common Stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our Common Stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a de-listing, we would\ntake actions to restore our compliance with The Nasdaq Capital Market’s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow\nour Common Stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price, improve the liquidity of our Common Stock, prevent our Common Stock from dropping below The\nNasdaq Capital Market minimum bid price requirement, or prevent future non-compliance with The Nasdaq Capital Market’s listing requirements.\nOn May 10, 2024, we received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying us that for the preceding 30\nconsecutive business days (March 28, 2024 through May 9, 2024), our common stock did not maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 (“Minimum Bid Price\nRequirement”) per share as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).\nIn accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we had a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until November 6, 2024, to regain compliance with Nasdaq\nListing Rule 5550(a)(2).\n40\nSince we did not achieve compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by November 6, 2024, we were eligible for additional time to comply. Nasdaq granted us until\nMay 6, 2025 in order to cure the deficiency.\nWe intend to actively monitor the bid price of our common stock and will consider available options to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements, including such\nactions as effecting a reverse stock split to maintain our Nasdaq listing.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are\nreferred to as “covered securities.” Because our Common Stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, it is a covered security. Although the states are preempted from\nregulating the sale of covered securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent\nactivity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. Further, if we were to be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, our Common\nStock would cease to be recognized as a covered security and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\nWe have incurred losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, and could continue to incur losses in the future.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred a loss from operations of $11,987,299 and a net loss of $9,782,196. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we\nincurred a loss from operations of $10,191,513 and a net loss of $9,864,298. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $21,491,078. There can be no\nassurance that expenses will not continue to increase in future periods or that the cash generated from operations in future periods will be sufficient to satisfy our operating\nneeds and to generate income from operations and net income.\nWe depend on our network of independent dealers for our gas-powered boats, face increasing competition for dealers, and have little control over their activities.\nA significant portion of our sales of our gas-powered boats are derived from our network of independent dealers. We typically manufacture our gas-powered boats based upon\nindications of interest received from dealers who are not contractually obligated to purchase any boats. While our dealers typically have purchased all of the boats for which\nthey have provided us with indications of interest, it is possible that a dealer could choose not to purchase boats for which it has provided an indication of interest (e.g., if it\nwere to have reached the credit limit on its floor plan), and as a result we once experienced, and in the future could experience, excess inventory and costs. For the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, three individual dealers each represented over 10% of our total sales, or 38% in total. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, one\nindividual dealer represented over 10% of our sales, and that dealer represented 20% of total sales. The loss of a significant dealer could have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition and results of operations. The number of dealers supporting our products and the quality of their marketing and servicing efforts are essential to our ability\nto generate sales. Competition for dealers among other boat manufacturers continues to increase based on the quality, price, value, and availability of the manufacturers’\nproducts, the manufacturers’ attention to customer service, and the marketing support that the manufacturer provides to the dealers. We face intense competition from other boat\nmanufacturers in attracting and retaining dealers, affecting our ability to attract or retain relationships with qualified and successful dealers. Although our management believes\nthat the quality of our products in the performance sport boat industry should permit us to maintain our relationships with our dealers and our market share position, there can\nbe no assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our relationships with our dealers or our market share position. In addition, independent dealers in the boating\nindustry have experienced significant consolidation in recent years, which could result in the loss of one or more of our dealers in the future if the surviving entity in any such\nconsolidation purchases similar products from a competitor. A substantial deterioration in the number of dealers or the quality of our network of dealers would have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n41\nThe loss of one or a few dealers could have a material adverse effect on us.\nA few dealers have in the past, and may in the future, account for a significant portion of our revenues in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. For the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, three individual dealers each represented over 10% of our total sales, those dealers combined represented 38% of total sales. The loss\nof business from a significant dealer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have identified weaknesses in our internal controls, and we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will be effectively remediated or that additional material\nweaknesses will not occur in the future.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The requirements of these rules and regulations continue\nto increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel,\nsystems and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over financial reporting.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we do not yet have effective disclosure controls and procedures, or internal controls over all aspects of our financial reporting. We are continuing to\ndevelop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with\nthe SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and in accordance with GAAP. Our management is responsible for\nestablishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. We will be required to expend time\nand resources to further improve our internal controls over financial reporting, including by expanding our staff. However, we cannot assure you that our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future.\nWe will be required to expend time and resources to further improve our internal controls over financial reporting, including by expanding our staff. However, we cannot assure\nyou that our internal control over financial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future.\nWe are in the process of hiring additional staff and providing them with the required training, we continue to engage outside consultants with appropriate experience in GAAP\npresentation, especially of complex instruments, to devise and implement effective disclosure controls and procedures, or internal controls. We will be required to spend time\nand resources hiring and engaging additional staff and outside consultants with the appropriate experience to remedy these weaknesses. We cannot assure you that management\nwill be successful in locating and retaining appropriate candidates; that newly engaged staff or outside consultants will be successful in remedying material weaknesses thus far\nidentified or identifying material weaknesses in the future; or that appropriate candidates will be located and retained prior to these deficiencies resulting in material and\nadverse effects on our business.\n42\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business, including increased complexity resulting\nfrom our international expansion. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to\ndevelop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our\nreporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting could also adversely affect the results of management reports and independent registered public accounting firm audits of our internal control over financial\nreporting that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures, and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the\nmarket price of our common stock.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is not required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until after we are no longer an\n“emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not\nsatisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and\ninternal control over financial reporting could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results and cause a decline in the market price of our common\nstock.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER\nAll of the Twin Vee and Forza executive officers and most of their directors have conflicts of interest that may influence them to support or approve the Merger without\nregard to your interests.\nAll of the Twin Vee and Forza officers will be employed by the combined company and several of each of their directors will continue to serve on the Board of Directors of the\ncombined company following the consummation of the Merger. In addition, all of the Twin Vee and Forza officers and most of their directors have a direct or indirect financial\ninterest in both Forza and Twin Vee. These interests, among others, may influence such executive officers and directors of Twin Vee and Forza to support or approve the\nMerger.\n43\nThe Exchange Ratio is not adjustable based on the market price of Twin Vee Common Stock so the Merger consideration at the closing may have a greater or lesser value\nthan it had at the time the Merger Agreement was signed.\nThe parties to the Merger Agreement have set the Exchange Ratio for the Forza Common Stock and the Exchange Ratio is not adjustable. Any changes in the market price of\nTwin Vee Common Stock or Forza Common Stock will not affect the number of shares holders of Forza Common Stock will be entitled to receive upon consummation of the\nMerger. Therefore, if the market price of Twin Vee Common Stock declines from the market price on the date of the Merger Agreement prior to the consummation of the\nMerger, Forza stockholders could receive Merger consideration with considerably less value. Similarly, if the market price of Twin Vee Common Stock increases from the\nmarket price on the date of the Merger Agreement prior to the consummation of the Merger, Forza stockholders could receive Merger consideration with considerably more\nvalue than their shares of Forza Common Stock and the Twin Vee stockholders immediately prior to the Merger will not be compensated for the increased market value of the\nTwin Vee Common Stock. If the market price of Forza Common Stock declines from the market price on the date of the Merger Agreement prior to the consummation of the\nMerger, Forza stockholders could receive Merger consideration with considerably more value. Similarly, if the market price of Forza Common Stock increases from the market\nprice on the date of the Merger Agreement prior to the consummation of the Merger, Forza stockholders could receive Merger consideration with considerably less value than\ntheir shares of Forza Common Stock and the Forza stockholders immediately prior to the Merger will not be compensated for the increased market value of the Forza Common\nStock. The Merger Agreement does not include a price-based termination right. Because the Exchange Ratio does not adjust as a result of changes in the value of Twin Vee\nCommon Stock, for each one percentage point that the market value of Twin Vee Common Stock rises or declines, there is a corresponding one percentage point rise or decline,\nrespectively, in the value of the total Merger consideration issued to the Forza stockholders.\nThe Merger may be completed even though material adverse changes may result from the announcement of the Merger, industry-wide changes and other causes.\nIn general, either Twin Vee or Forza can refuse to complete the Merger if there is a material adverse change affecting the other party between August 12, 2024, the date of the\nMerger Agreement, and the closing. However, certain types of changes do not permit either party to refuse to complete the Merger, even if such change could be said to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on Twin Vee or Forza, including:\n● general business or economic conditions affecting the industries in which Twin Vee or Forza operate;\n● acts of war, armed hostilities or terrorism;\n● changes in financial, banking or securities markets;\n● the taking of any action required to be taken by the Merger Agreement;\n● with respect either party, the announcement or pendency of the Merger Agreement or any related transactions; or\n● with respect to either party, any change in their or the other party’s stock price or trading volume stock.\nIf adverse changes occur and Twin Vee and Forza still complete the Merger, the combined company stock price may suffer. This in turn may reduce the value of the Merger to\nthe stockholders of Twin Vee and Forza.\n44\nThe combined company’s stock price is expected to be volatile, and the market price of its common stock may drop following the Merger.\nThe market price of the combined company’s common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations following the Merger especially when the shareholder base is increased.\nMoreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad\nmarket fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of the combined company’s common stock.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those\ncompanies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm the combined\ncompany’s profitability and reputation.\nThe market price of the combined company’s common stock may decline as a result of the Merger.\nThe market price of the combined company’s common stock may decline as a result of the Merger if the combined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the\nMerger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by Twin Vee or Forza or investors, financial or industry analysts.\nThe combined company may not experience the anticipated strategic benefits of the Merger.\nThe respective managements of Twin Vee and Forza believe that the Merger would provide certain strategic benefits that may not be realized by each of the companies\noperating as standalones. There can be no assurance that these anticipated benefits of the Merger will materialize or that if they materialize will result in increased stockholder\nvalue or revenue stream to the combined company.\nTwin Vee and Forza stockholders may not realize a benefit from the Merger commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the Merger.\nIf the combined company is unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger, Twin Vee and Forza securityholders will have\nexperienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests in their respective companies without receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the\ncommensurate benefit to the extent the combined company is able to realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger.\nIf the conditions to the Merger are not met, the Merger will not occur.\nEven if the Merger is approved by the stockholders of Twin Vee and Forza, specified conditions must be satisfied or waived in order to complete the Merger, including, among\nothers:\n● the filing and effectiveness of a registration statement under the Securities Act in connection with the issuance of Twin Vee Common Stock in the Merger;\n● the respective representations and warranties of Twin Vee and Forza, shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the date of the Merger Agreement and the\nclosing;\n45\n● no material adverse effect with respect to Twin Vee or Forza or its subsidiaries shall have occurred since the date of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the\nMerger;\n● performance or compliance in all material respects by Twin Vee and Forza with their respective covenants and obligations in the Merger Agreement;\n● Forza and Twin Vee shall have obtained any consents and waivers of approvals required in connection with the Merger, including for Twin Vee approval of its\nstockholders of the issuance of the Twin Vee Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and for Forza approval of its stockholders of the Merger\nand the Merger Agreement; and\n● no material adverse effect with respect to Twin Vee or Forza or their subsidiaries shall have occurred since the date of the Merger Agreement.\nThese and other conditions are described in detail in the Merger Agreement. Twin Vee and Forza cannot assure you that all of the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied. If\nthe conditions to the Merger are not satisfied or waived, the Merger will not occur or will be delayed, and Twin Vee and Forza each may lose some or all of the intended\nbenefits of the Merger.\nTwin Vee and Forza will incur substantial expenses whether or not the Merger is completed.\nTwin Vee and Forza have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial expenses related to the Merger whether or not the Merger is completed.\nTwin Vee will assume all of Forza’s outstanding liabilities if the Merger is completed.\nBy operation of law, Twin Vee will assume all of Forza’s outstanding liabilities if the Merger is completed.\nDuring the pendency of the Merger, Twin Vee and Forza may not be able to enter into a business combination with another party at a favorable price because of\nrestrictions in the Merger Agreement, which could adversely affect their respective businesses.\nCovenants in the Merger Agreement impede the ability of Twin Vee and Forza to make acquisitions, subject to certain exceptions relating to fiduciary duties, or complete other\ntransactions that are not in the ordinary course of business pending the closing of the merger. As a result, if the Merger is not completed, the parties may be at a disadvantage to\ntheir competitors during that period. In addition, while the Merger Agreement is in effect, each party is generally prohibited from soliciting, initiating, encouraging or entering\ninto certain extraordinary transactions, such as a merger, sale of assets or other business combination outside the ordinary course of business, with any third-party, subject to\ncertain exceptions. Any such transactions could be favorable to such party’s stockholders.\nCertain provisions of the Merger Agreement may discourage third parties from submitting alternative takeover proposals, including proposals that may be superior to the\narrangements contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement prohibit each of Twin Vee and Forza from soliciting alternative takeover proposals or cooperating with persons making unsolicited takeover\nproposals, except in certain circumstances where the Twin Vee Board of Directors or Forza Board of Directors, as applicable, determines in good faith, after consultation with\nits financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that an unsolicited alternative takeover proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a superior takeover proposal and\nthat failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Forza Board of Directors.\n46\nTwin Vee’s business and stock price may be adversely affected if the acquisition of Forza is not completed.\nTwin Vee’s acquisition of Forza is subject to several customary conditions, including the effectiveness of a registration statement under the Securities Act in connection with the\nissuance of Twin Vee Common Stock in the Merger and the approvals of the transaction by the stockholders of Forza and Twin Vee.\nIf Twin Vee’s acquisition of Forza is not completed, Twin Vee could be subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect Twin Vee’s business and stock price, including:\n● the current market price of shares of Twin Vee Common Stock reflects a market assumption that the acquisition will be completed;\n● Twin Vee must pay costs related to the Merger; and\n● Twin Vee would not realize the benefits it expects from acquiring Forza.\nIf Twin Vee’s acquisition of Forza is not completed, Forza could be subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect Twin Vee’s business and stock price, including:\n● the current market price of shares of Forza Common Stock reflects a market assumption that the acquisition will be completed;\n● Forza must pay costs related to the Merger;\n● Forza may not be able to timely effect any stock split required in order for it to maintain its Nasdaq stock listing; and\n● Forza would not realize the benefits it expects from being acquired by Twin Vee.\nShould the Merger not qualify as a tax-free reorganization, Forza stockholders may recognize capital gain or loss with respect to the shares of Twin vee common stock\nreceived in the Merger.\nThe Merger is expected to be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code, however, neither Twin Vee nor Forza has received an Internal Revenue\nServices ruling to that effect. The failure of the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code would result in a Forza stockholder\nrecognizing capital gain or loss with respect to the shares of Forza Common Stock surrendered for Twin Vee Common Stock received in the Merger.\n47\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.\n(a) Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.\nWe did not sell any equity securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 in transactions that were not registered under the Securities Act other than as previously\ndisclosed in our filings with the SEC.\n(c) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nNone.\nITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES.\nNot Applicable.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES.\nNot Applicable.\nITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION.\n(a) Disclosure in lieu of reporting on a Current Report on Form 8-K.\nNone.\n(b) Changes to Procedures for Recommending Nominees to the Board of Directors\nNone.\n(c) Insider Trading Arrangements\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “nonRule 10b5-1\ntrading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\n48\nITEM 6.

Business.\nGeneral\nTwin Vee PowerCats Co. (“Twin Vee” “we”, “us” or the “Company”) is a designer, manufacturer and marketer of recreational and commercial power catamaran boats. We\nbelieve our company, founded in 1996, has been an innovator in the recreational and commercial power catamaran industry. Our twin-hull catamaran running surface, known as\na symmetrical catamaran hull design, adds to the Twin Vee ride quality by reducing drag, increasing fuel efficiency and offering users a stable riding boat. Twin Vee’s home\nbase operations in Fort Pierce, Florida is a 7.5-acre facility with several buildings totaling over 75,000 square feet. We currently employ approximately 80 people.\nWe have organized our business into three operating segments: (i) our gas-powered boat segment, which manufactures and distributes gas-powered boats; (ii) our electric-\npowered boat segment, which is developing fully electric boats, through our controlling interest subsidiary, Forza X1, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Forza”) and (iii) our\nfranchise segment, which is developing a standard product offering and will be selling franchises across the United States through our wholly owned subsidiary, Fix My Boat,\nInc., a Delaware corporation. Initially Forza was also our wholly owned subsidiary that became a majority owned subsidiary in August 2022, when Forza consummated the\ninitial public offering of its shares of common stock, which are now listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Our current ownership is 44% of the outstanding common stock of\nForza, and is considered a controlling interest.\nOur gas-powered boats allow consumers to use them for a wide range of recreational activities including fishing, diving and water skiing and commercial activities including\ntransportation, eco tours, fishing and diving expeditions. We believe that the performance, quality and value of our boats position us to achieve our goal of increasing our\nmarket share and expanding the power catamaran boating market. We currently primarily sell our boats through a current network of 20 independent boat dealers in 34\nlocations across North America and the Caribbean who resell our boats to the end user Twin Vee customers. We continue recruiting efforts for high quality boat dealers and seek\nto establish new dealers and distributors domestically and internationally to distribute our boats as we grow our production and introduce new models. Our gas-powered boats\nare currently outfitted with gas-powered outboard combustion engines.\nDue to the growing demand for sustainable, environmentally friendly electric and alternative fuel commercial and recreational vehicles, our controlling interest subsidiary,\nForza, is designing and developing a line of electric-powered boats utilizing our electric vehicle (“EV”) technology to control and power our boats and proprietary outboard\nelectric motor. Forza’s mission is to inspire the adoption of sustainable recreational boating by producing stylish electric sport boats.\nInformation about Twin Vee can be found on our website, http://www.twinvee.com/. Information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report and\nyou should not consider any information that is contained on or can be accessed through our website as part of this Annual Report. We are subject to the reporting requirements\nof the Exchange Act. The Exchange Act requires us to file periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nThe SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. These\nmaterials may be obtained electronically by accessing the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov.\nBusiness of Our Segments\nGas-powered Boats\nOur gas-powered boat segment accounted for 100% of our net revenue in fiscal years 2023 and 2022. In 2023, our gas powered segment had locations in Fort Pierce, Florida,\nand White Bluff, Tennessee. We believe our company has been an innovator in the recreational and commercial power catamaran industry. We currently have 19 gas-powered\nmodels in production ranging in size from our 24-foot, dual engine, center console to our 40-foot offshore 400 GFX, in 2023 we added 8 mono hull models to our line up. Our\ntwin-hull catamaran running surface, known as a symmetrical catamaran hull design, adds to the Twin Vee ride quality by reducing drag, increasing fuel efficiency and offering\nusers a stable riding boat. Our home base operations for our gas-powered boats is in Fort Pierce, Florida and is a 7.5-acre facility with several buildings totaling over 75,000\nsquare feet. We currently employ approximately 80 people.\n7\nDuring the 2023 fiscal year, we focused our efforts on increased throughput through our facility, and fully integrating the new models that we introduced in 2023. In February\n2023, we announced our launch of our new AquaSport, a new-monohull boat brand that will initially include a 22-foot center console monohull, a 25-foot dual console, single-\nengine day boat, a 22-foot dual console monohull and a 25 foot deck boat, single engine. We delivered our first monohull boats in January of 2023. In May of 2023, we entered\ninto a finance lease, securing the rights to the AquaSport brand and facility in White Bluff, Tennessee. The AquaSport brand is expected to appeal to first-time boat buyers, the\nfreshwater market, and consumers that prefer a monohull boat opening a significantly larger portion of the market share to Twin Vee.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, one individual dealer had sales of over 10% of our total sales, and one customer represented 10.3% of total sales. During the year\nended December 31, 2022, one individual dealer had sales of over 10% of our total sales, and one customer represented 12% of total sales.\nTwin Vee’s Twin-Hull Shape\nTwin Vee catamaran boats are designed for a dry and smooth ride. As a Twin Vee moves through the water, the boat’s symmetrical catamaran hull has lifting strakes on the side\nof each hull. Lifting strakes are known to produce lift at the bow of a boat by displacing water, allowing the boat to, in essence, glide above the water rather than lumber\nthrough it. Twin Vee’s lifting strakes work to not only create lift, but also to make the ride smoother. The forward motion of a catamaran boat lifts water up towards the top of\nthe tunnel while pushing the water inward to form two counter-flowing vortexes. As these vortexes are being formed, the Twin Vee hull design aerates these vortexes with small\nair bubbles, which are then compressed at an increasing rate as the vortexes move down the tunnel. It is the kinetic energy stored in these compressed air bubbles, which creates\na smooth and stable ride. As speed increases, the kinetic energy increases at a non-linear rate as more and more air is induced into the increasingly faster flowing vortexes. The\ntrailing surfaces the Twin Vee hulls are specifically designed to facilitate propulsion efficiency by discharging the kinetic energy and air bubbles from the counter-flowing\nvortexes upon exiting astern, thus providing the propellers with a steady flow of super clean and highly ordered water.\nThis fact, combined with a catamaran’s soft ride, results in Twin Vee’s renowned efficiency and smooth, seaworthy safety. At speed, the Twin Vee’s displacement hull slices\nthrough the water, traveling with the shape of the seas rather than flying over them and experiencing reentry shock. This results in a stable and smooth ride. The following are\nsome benefits of the catamaran, or Twin Vee’s, hull shape.\nPower Catamaran Hull Benefits\n● Catamaran stability. Catamarans have parallel hulls on the outer edges of the boat rather than in the middle, providing superior stability. Twin Vee hulls travel with\nthe wave shapes because the buoyancy is to the outside, resisting the snap roll pendulum motion of deep vee monohulls. A Twin Vee wider footprint negates the effects\nof rolling seas, making them less likely to capsize and reduce seasickness.\n● Shallow draft for travelling in “skinny” waters. The weight of the boat is distributed to two hulls for a shallower draft. The shallow draft of the Twin Vee design\nprovides access to areas that conventional hulls cannot reach. With a Twin Vee, you can enjoy the beach and not have to wade in the water to get there.\n● More usable deck space. The relatively rectangular design of the Twin Vee expanded deck area allows for more usable deck space than monohulls. Twin Vee boats\nare wider in the bows providing more open area in open models and bigger berths in cabins. Lounge in the front of a Twin Vee dual console and then jump into a\nsimilar-sized monohull.\n● Single engine get home capability. Twin Vee catamaran hulls do not need planning speed power to travel rapidly on a single engine. Minimum bow rise for greater\nvisibility, a Twin Vee deck is parallel to the water at all speeds allowing you to maintain your line of sight and giving you greater fuel efficiency.\n● Docking and maneuverability. With the extra separation between the motors, over most mono hull boats, you can cross-clutch the motors and turn or spin the boat up\nto its own length.\n8\n● Maintains a plane at lower speed for fuel efficiency. The catamaran hull can maintain a plane at lower speeds and catamaran boats create less drag in turn offering\nbetter fuel efficiency and a more economical boat to maintain.\n● Fish one side of a Twin Vee. Enjoy fishing without the extreme listing of a monohull.\nTwin Vee’s Monohull\nWe expect our new monohull line to appeal to first-time boat buyers, the freshwater market and consumers that prefer a monohull boat. This new monohull brand will be selling\ninto a much larger portion of the market.\nFranchise\nOur franchise segment is being developed and we plan to utilize a franchise model for marine mechanics across the country through our wholly owned subsidiary, Fix My Boat,\nInc.\nElectric-Powered Boats\nThe mission of Forza is to inspire the adoption of sustainable recreational boating by producing stylish electric sport boats. Forza is focused on the creation, implementation and\nsale of electric boats utilizing our electric vehicle (“EV”) technology to control and power its boats and proprietary outboard electric motor. Forza’s electric boats are being\ndesigned as fully integrated electric boats including the hull, outboard motor and control system.\nWe believe traditional marine manufacturers are at a crossroads and face significant industry-wide challenges. Much like in the automotive industry, the reliance on the\ngasoline-powered internal combustion engine as the principal marine powertrain technology has raised environmental concerns, created dependence among industrialized and\ndeveloping nations on oil-primarily imported from foreign countries, exposed consumers to volatile fuel prices, and inhibited innovation in alternative fuel powertrain\ntechnologies.\nForza was initially our wholly owned subsidiary and prior to Forza’s incorporation on October 15, 2021, it operated as the Electra Power Sports™ Division of Twin Vee.\nFollowing our initial public offering that closed on July 23, 2021, we determined in October 2021 that for several reasons that include, but are not limited to, avoiding\nconfusion in the marketplace between our legacy gas-powered line of boats, that the company would market its new independent line of electric boats under a new brand name\n(and new subsidiary) separate and apart from us. Twin Vee and Forza X1 brands are unique in their own way, including (i) the profile of the targeted Forza X1 customer who is\nenvironmentally conscious and would purchase an electric boat versus gas-powered model, (ii) the marketing and sales strategy of each company, and (iii) Twin Vee’s use of a\nthird-party dealer network whereas Forza X1 plans on implementing a digital direct to consumer model. In addition, electric powered boats will require a specific and unique\nlevel of training and knowledge for supporting and servicing the technical and warranty claims that might arise. The service and support of gas and electric powered boats are\nvery different, and it became clear to us that Forza required its own unique brand.\nTo date, Forza has built-out and tested multiple Forza units, including: three offshore-style catamarans, two bay boat-style catamarans, one deck boat and three 22-foot center\nconsole (F22) monohulls. In addition, we have also electrified two pontoon boats for a major national pontoon manufacturer. We are in the process of an additional pontoon\nelectrification project and are building an additional five monohulls. Each build cycle includes improvements and involves extensive duration and performance testing.\nIn late 2023 – early 2024, Forza’s outboard motor underwent an extensive redesign. This new design incorporates a new simplified frame structure that uses stacked custom\ncastings which are sealed for increased durability and corrosion protection. The overall shape of the motor and cowlings have been updated, and the cowlings redesigned to\nfacilitate higher volume manufacturing processes such as thermoform and injection molding. Furthermore, the motor cooling circuits have been improved to optimize cooling\nflow rates to the inverter, which aims to extend time on the water in a single charge. The Forza team has hired an outside consulting agency that employs many experienced\noutboard engineers and analysists. They have contributed input on the new design and have collaborated on the development of the design verification plan. The engine design\nand lower units and the control systems are continuously improved with each iteration. Cooling system improvements have also been prioritized and have yielded a myriad of\nbenefits to runtime, speed, and range. We continue to iterate the engine design, including value engineering of parts and lightweighting of engine components.\n9\nMoreover, Forza’s propulsion system is currently undergoing extensive design verification testing. This plan consists of over 100 different tests, including safety critical\noperational testing, long term 2000-hour endurance tank testing, log strike testing, wave hop simulation testing, corrosion mitigation, extreme temperature testing and user\ninterface / sea trial runs.\nThe system successfully passed the initial rounds of safety critical operational testing, cooling testing and is tracking for a successful endurance testing using our state-of-the-art\ntank station.\nLater in the summer of 2024 the new motor design is expected to be sent to a third party test lab and will undergo a series of log strike simulations, which is a critical milestone\nin our verification process.\nWe are currently sourcing a lab that will conduct a comprehensive wave hop simulation test which is another important step in the verification process.\nOur Strategy\nOverall Strategy\nWe intend to capitalize on the thriving broader marine industry through the following strategies:\nDevelop New and Innovative Products in Our Core Market. As an innovator, designer, manufacturer, and marketer of catamaran powerboats, we strive to design new and\ninventive products that appeal to a broad customer base. We intend to launch a number of new products and features with best-in-class quality, with the goal of increasing sales\nand significant margin expansion. For example, we currently have 8 gas-powered models in production ranging in size from our 24-foot, dual engine, center console to our\nnewly designed 40-foot offshore 400 GFX. We designed our first monohull boat, a 22 foot, available in both center and dual consoles. This is the first boat in a line of boats,\nthat will be sold under our new AquaSport brand. Furthermore, our unique new product development process enables us to renew our product portfolio with innovative\nofferings at a rate that we believe will be difficult for our competitors to match without significant additional capital investments. We intend to release new products and\nfeatures multiple times during the year, which we believe enhances our reputation as a cutting-edge boat manufacturer and will drive consumer interest in our products.\nIncrease the Power Boat Category Segment. Our near-term product development strategy is to expand our product line to reach underserved segments of the catamaran and\nmonohull powerboat category that are distinct from our traditional customer base. With our existing supplier relationships, material agreements, and manufacturing processes,\nshould allow us to offer this product line at an attractive price point for the consumer while sustaining our gross margins and the product attributes critical to the Twin Vee\nbrand.\nCapture Additional Share from Adjacent Boating Categories. Another focus is to grow our market share is to enhance our ability to introduce new products with increased\nversatility, functionality, and performance to a more expansive customer base that values boats for both water sports and general recreational boating purposes. We intend to\nlaunch several marketing campaigns that will focus on new product launches and help to educate the market on our value proposition to customers.\nEffectively Manage Dealer Inventory and Further Strengthen Our Dealer Network. We view our dealers as our partners and product champions. Therefore, we will continue\nto devote significant time and resources to finding high quality dealers and developing and improving their performance over time. We believe the quality and trust in our dealer\nrelationships are more beneficial to our long-term success than the quantity of dealers. We currently have a network of 20 independent boat dealers in 34 locations across North\nAmerica, the Caribbean and Central America.\nIncrease Our Sales in International Markets. We believe we have a brand that will have natural growth in international markets. Catamaran powerboats have already been\naccepted as the norm in many international markets. For example, the global catamaran market size was worth USD 1.35 billion in 2021 and is expected to expand at a\ncompound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.8% from 2022 to 2030. The U.S. catamaran market size was worth USD 342.5 million in 2021 and is expected to expand at a\nCAGR of 5.4% from 2022 to 2030. With further expansion into global distribution with our expanding dealer network, including Dubai, Puerto Rico, and Costa Rica we are\nable to increase market share. Based on our brand and product offering, as well as out potential distribution strengths,\n10\nwe believe we are well positioned to leverage our reputation and capture additional international sales. We believe that we will increase our international sales by promoting our\nproducts in developed markets where we have a dealer base and in international markets where rising consumer incomes are expected to increase demand for recreational\nproducts, such as Australia, Europe, Israel, Dubai and Brazil. We are also developing new product offerings that will specifically target certain product demand from our\ninternational consumers and that we believe will drive further sales growth in international markets.\nEV/Forza Specific Strategy\nForza plans to market and sell its model offerings in a variety of ways. One way will be to operate in a fundamentally different manner and structure than traditional marine\nmanufacturers and boat dealers by adopting a direct-to-consumer sales and delivery model. Forza is building a dedicated web and app-based platform for sales, deliveries, and\nservice operations to change the traditional boat buying and marine service experience through technological innovation, ease of use, and flexibility. Forza intends to employ an\nintegrated, digital-first strategy that is convenient and transparent for our customers and efficient and scalable to support its growth. Additionally, to support those looking for a\nmore traditional way of purchasing a boat, or to accompany trade-ins, financing needs, and training or in states where there are limitations on direct sales, Forza will also\nmarket its boats through a partnership with One Water Marine, Inc. (“One Water”), one of the largest dealership networks in the United States. Forza believes its approach will\nenable us to provide the best of both worlds to prospective customers and support its mission to electrify recreational boating for mass production.\nCurrently, Forza’s web and app-based platform is expected to include the following:\n● Build and Price Boats. The web and app platform will offer prospective buyers a place to examine photos and videos of our boats, which will all have a single price\nbased on the model type and a few available options. For example, the consumer would have four gel coat exterior choices, three interior upholstery choices, and an\noption to increase the battery pack capacity for extended run times. Other options would include charging cords and plugs, boating items such as bumpers, covers, and\nfun add-ons like clothing, allowing consumers to “personalize” their Forza X1 purchase.\n● Financing. Prospective customers will be able to apply for third-party consumer financing to complete or supplement their purchase through our web and app platform.\n● Delivery. Once manufactured, the boat will be delivered directly to a customer’s home, marina, or wherever they choose. The scheduling, communication, and support\nnecessary for coordinating touchless delivery of our Forza boats would all be accomplished over the website or app.\n● Servicing. Forza intends to offer highly tailored and differentiated services that enable intuitive experiences throughout the entire customer lifecycle, such as warranty,\nrepair, or other service assistance for their boats. Forza expects this all-inclusive approach will provide higher customer satisfaction, create strong brand loyalty, and\nincrease operational efficiency while simultaneously allowing us to capture a more significant share of the entire lifecycle value of every Forza X1 boat produced. Forza\nanticipates having internal staff with the capability to provide an OTA (over the airwaves) update to resolve the issue remotely without the boat ever leaving the\ncustomer’s sight. As part of its customer satisfaction drive, Forza plans for its staff to make mobile service calls to the boat docks. It also intends to enter into partnering\narrangements with third parties to address service needs that require more than a mobile service visit and plans to arrange for the boat to be picked up and brought to one\nof our partnered service centers. If a service center is not available in a customer’s area, for approved warranty repairs we will permit the owners to take their boat to\ntheir local service center who will then invoice us.\n● Customer Service and Feedback. Forza will utilize customer insights and feedback submitted via its web and app-based platform to improve its offerings by adding\nnew capabilities and functionality. Expanded offerings based on consumer-driven feedback and data is expected to attract more customers, deepen existing customer\nrelationships, and allow Forza to innovate more quickly.\n● Training. Forza intends to provide a series of videos that demonstrate our boats’ safe operation and upkeep. These videos would be accessible on Forza’s web and app\nplatform and the boat’s onboard computer for quick access.\n11\nWith respect to the foregoing, Forza has not yet: (i) entered into any arrangements with third parties to provide financing services through its web and app platform, or (ii) hired\nstaff for our intended support and service department. Forza is still in the initial stages of establishing its distribution and service plans. Forza is uncertain as to when they will\ncommence selling to end-user customers. Forza is currently in the process of identifying the states its will be allowed to sell direct-to-consumer. For states that have do not\nallow such an arrangement, Forza intends to make sales through One Water’s locations. One Water will be able to forecast how many fully electric boats they initially require,\nand after production, we will have the boats transported to the dealerships.\nSimilarly, Forza is in the process of identifying potential marine service centers and technicians it would like to form strategic relationships with to ensure that it has a\ncomprehensive service support system in place when its fully electric boats are sold, it will utilize One Water dealerships and service centers where they are available. Forza\nwill also work to establish its 500-mile radius mobile service vans and trucks before selling the first Forza X1 product so that local customers will have that option.\nThe One Water Agreement\nAdditionally, to support those looking for a more traditional way of purchasing a boat, or to accompany trade-ins, financing needs, and training, we will also market our boats\nthrough a partnership with One Water, one of the largest dealership networks in the United States. We believe our approach will enable us to provide the best of both worlds to\nprospective customers and support our mission to electrify recreational boating. On August 17, 2022, we entered into a five-year agreement with One Water to establish our\ncustomer experience and service centers in One Water’s current and future locations and other strategic locations across the United States pursuant to which One Water will be\nthe sole dealer distributing our products and One Water’s retail locations may be used as potential delivery points for customers to pick up our products. We retained the right to\nsell our products directly to customers. The agreement may be terminated by either party for breach upon thirty days’ notice and without cause upon three months’ notice.\nForza’s Future Service Network\nForza intends to develop a support and service department that will include technicians, service representatives, quality control specialists and customer satisfaction agents.\nMoreover, it aims to provide convenient and comprehensive service coverage in all markets where its boats are sold, which customers may access through a comprehensive\nservice and support website and app.\nThe website and app platform will be the cornerstone of Forza’s services and repair program. Forza has selected a web design firm for the development of its website and app.\nForza’s customers would be able to report through its app or interact directly with its service support team to schedule an appointment with a Forza X1 mobile service van,\nperform remote diagnostics or help arrange appointments with partnered boat repair technicians, marinas, and service centers with whom Forza has strategic relationships,\narrange for service or repair work, or even schedule the boat’s transportation back to the Forza X1 factory if needed.\nForza believes that Forza X1 mobile service vans and trucks will be able to perform a majority of physical service calls at a customer’s home, marina, dock, or wherever our\nboats might be located, offering a level of convenience at lower cost than traditional dealer-owned service centers. These mobile service vans and trucks will travel to the\nlocation of the electric boats for repair, or if the boat cannot be repaired at such location, then the Forza technician will have a vehicle capable of towing the boat back to the\nForza factory, where the boat will have access to a more significant amount of repair and support staff.\nForza believes that its electric vehicles will require less service than gas vehicles because electric vehicles are simpler to maintain than internal combustion vehicles. The\noutboard motor system is expected to be less susceptible to wear and tear by exchanging hundreds of moving parts for only a few. There are no spark plugs or engine motor oil\nto change or worry about.\n12\nAdditionally, remote diagnostics will allow Forza to find issues with customer boats remotely, in real time. In many cases, Forza’s service team will be able to provide an OTA\nupdate to resolve the issue without the customer’s boat ever leaving the customer’s sight. Forza’s mission will be to make the servicing of our products as simple as possible by\nconnecting to and utilizing diagnostics technology in every Forza boat. Whether a customer needs maintenance or needs repairs, we intend to provide convenient and\ncomprehensive service and warranty coverage for its customers throughout the country.\nCustomers who lack Forza service access through its network of mobile services vans and trucks will be able to utilize the traditional warranty claim process, which is standard\nthroughout the recreational boat industry. In Forza’s case, a customer will contact Forza through its website or app and speak with its support and service department and\nprovide them with details about the issues they are experiencing with their boat. If over-the-air updates to software or hardware are insufficient to solve the problems and\ncustomer experience and service center or mobile service van are not within range of the customer, its support and service department will provide assistance.\nIn the case of a covered warrantable issue, Forza’s support and service department will put them in contact with a local partnered boat repair service technicians or arrange\ntransportation of the boat to one of our partnered marinas and service centers. If none are available in a customer’s area, our support and service department would instruct the\ncustomer to obtain a quote for the covered warranty repair work and labor at a marine service center of their choosing. They would transmit the quote for the necessary repair\nwork to Forza’s support and service department for approval. Once approved, the work is completed on the covered warrantable repairs, and Forza will pay the marine service\ncenter directly.\nThere may be instances where the customer’s issue is too technical for a traditional marine service center (e.g., issues related to the EV components of the boat). In such cases,\nForza’s support and service department would coordinate with the customer to have the boat picked up on a trailer and towed to our manufacturing facility in Fort Pierce,\nFlorida, for service.\nIf a customer contacts Forza’s support and service department for maintenance or an issue not covered under warranty, then its support and service department would be able to\ncoordinate with them to arrange service with a mobile service van, partnered boat repair technician, or partnered marina or service center and the customer will be responsible\nfor paying them directly.\nForza is still in the initial stages of establishing our service plans. Forza is in the process of identifying potential marinas, service centers, and technicians we would like to form\nstrategic relationships with to ensure that it has a comprehensive service support system in place when our fully electric boats are sold. Although Forza is planning to eventually\ninternalize most aspects of boat warranty and service through our mobile service vans and trucks over time, initially, Forza plans to operate them within 500 miles of the Forza\nfactory and partner with third parties elsewhere to enable nationwide coverage for its customers’ boat service and warranty repair needs.\nForza’s plans for its electric boats include the following strategies:\n● Successfully Launch the fully electric sport boat. Forza believes the successful launch of its first commercially available electric boat is critical to its ability to\ncapitalize on the marine electric vehicle market opportunity and establish itself as leaders in the industry. Forza completed the initial prototype in 2022 and continues\ndeveloping and testing.\n● Invest in Infrastructure. Forza is investing $8.0 million from its August 2022 initial public offering to build a factory solely for the manufacture of Forza’s new line of\nelectric boats. The initial phase of our new factory will be 50,000 square feet, that will have a capacity of 500 units annually. To date, grading has been completed, and\nwe have completed pouring the 60,000 square foot pad. All of the structural steel and rebar has been delivered, and erection of the building began on March 18, 2024.\nThe building will be capable of producing 500 boats annually, or more, and will serve as the technology and fabrication center for Forza.\n● Use a Common Platform to Introduce New Models. Forza intends to design the fully electric sport boat with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric\npowertrain to provide the flexibility to use the platform to launch subsequent electric boat models cost-efficiently.\n13\n● Focus on Technological Advancements and Cost Improvement. Forza intends to constantly look for ways to improve upon and further develop our proprietary\nelectric powertrain system while reducing its manufacturing cost.\n● Build Forza’s Company-Owned Sales and Service Network. Forza is programming and building its expansive and vertically integrated customer-centric web and app\nplatform to connect with customers for an end-to-end experience encompassing everything from buying, financing, delivery, servicing, and training. This customer-\ncentric approach to sales and service will simplify accessing necessary information for potential buyers and current owners in an easily accessible and streamlined\nonline space.\n● Leverage Industry Advancements in Battery Cells. Forza intends to leverage the substantial investments made globally by battery cell manufacturers to improve\npower and capacity.\n● Build and Leverage Strategic Relationships. Forza intends to establish and develop strategic relationships with industry leaders to launch our planned electric boats\nand sell its electric boat powertrain components. Forza envisions significant inroads with boat manufacturers to retrofit various hull configurations, replacing\ntraditional gas outboard motors and existing boat owners who could retrofit their boats with Forza’s outboard motors, controller, and battery packs.\nForza X1 Future Factory\nForza is currently building a state-of-the-art manufacturing plant to incorporate the latest in closed-molded composite boat building technologies and electric engine assembly\nprocesses., On July 28, 2022, Forza received notice that the North Carolina Economic investment committee has approved a Job Development Investment Grant (“JDIG”)\nproviding for reimbursement to Forza of up to $1,367,100 over a twelve year period to establish a new manufacturing plant in McDowell County, North Carolina. The receipt\nof grant funding is conditioned upon us investing over $10.5 million in land, buildings and fixtures, infrastructure and machinery and equipment by the end of 2025 and us\ncreating as many as 170 jobs. Forza has selected its new site in McDowell County, North Carolina to build the Forza X1 factory. Forza is designing a 100,000 square foot\nfacility designed for capacity and production of 1,000 units annually that it intends to build over time in various phases, starting with an initial 50,000 square foot facility that\nwill have a capacity of 500 units annually that it anticipates the cost of which will be $8 million for the construction of the factory. Forza anticipates that the local incentives\nthat it has been approved to receive will help to offset some of the cost to be incurred with respect to the building of the factory. However, there can be no assurance that such\nnegotiations will be successful or that Forza will meet the requirements to receive the anticipated incentives will be granted to us.\nBefore the completion of new factory construction, all fabrication for Forza’s boats will be performed onsite at Twin Vee’s facility.\nOur Strengths and Competitive Advantages\nWe believe that the following are the key investment attributes of our company:\nRecognized Brand. We believe the Twin Vee and AquaSport brands are well-known among boating enthusiasts for performance, quality, and value, and that the market\nrecognizes both Twin Vee and AquaSport as brands that deliver a proposition.\nDiverse Product Offering. We are able to attract consumers across multiple categories within the recreational powerboat industry. We currently have nineteen (19) different\nmodels in production that range from 22-feet monohull to our newly designed 40-foot offshore 400GFX, offered at retail prices that start at approximately $55,000 and go up to\n$900,000. We will further diversify our offerings in 2024, with new models to our monohull line.\nFocus on Innovative Product Offerings. We are currently designing numerous new boat models to meet market demand and grow our business, and our current focus is on\nbring a full line of monohull boats to the market under the AquaSport brand.\n14\nPrice Point. Twin Vee has also made investments in infrastructure and engineering. These investments have resulted in lower material waste, reduced labor hours per boat,\nreduced re-work, and increased production efficiencies. Therefore, we are able to offer favorable pricing while increasing margins by controlling costs through disciplined\nengineering and manufacturing processes.\nOur Markets\nAccording to SSI data (Statistical Surveys Incorporated), 270,809 new watercrafts were sold in the U.S. in 2023 a decline of -14.52% across the entire industry compared to\n2022. Our core market corresponds most directly with the saltwater outboard market defined by SSI and is further categorized by the power catamaran segment. The saltwater\noutboard market is experiencing a decline of -18.71% compared to 2022 with a total of 25, 377 new units sold in the U.S. With the current decline in the market, further\nnormalizing post Covid. Comparatively, Twin Vee has experienced an increase of 4% percent for 2023 sales compared to 2022. Looking ahead to 2024, Twin Vee has expanded\nis market offering to include monohulls with the acquisition of the 60+ year old AquaSport Boats brand as of June 1st, 2023 and will further expand its model lineup with new\nand exciting models across both brands.\nOutboard Motor Market\nAn outboard motor is a propulsion system for boats, consisting of a self-contained unit that includes engine, gearbox and propeller or jet drive, designed to be affixed to the\noutside of the boat. As well as providing propulsion, outboards provide steering control, as they are designed to pivot over their mountings and thus control the direction of\nthrust. Outboard motors tend to be found on smaller watercraft as it is more efficient for larger boats to have an inboard system. Although outboard engines powered by fossil\nfuels have traditionally dominated this market and continue to do so, electric outboard motors are a relatively new phenomenon that have been growing in step with the growth\nin the electric boat market. The boats that we sell and manufacture all have outboard motors.\nAccording to the NMMA, sales of outboard engines in the United States (which includes outboard motors) were $3.6 billion in 2022. Consumer demand for higher-\nperformance engines hit an all-time high in 2020. The market did see a decline of 6% in 2022, over 2021.\nAlthough many recreational boats can be powered by outboard or inboard motors, many consumers prefer outboard motors. Among the reasons for their preference are that,\nunlike inboard motors, outboard motors can be easily removed for storage or repairs, they provide more room in the boat as they are attached to the transom outside of the boat,\nthey tend to have a shallower draft and they can be more easily replaced in the event the motor no longer works or a desire to upgrade to a higher horsepower.\nElectric Boat Market\nAlthough electric boats have been available for over 100 years, interest in them was minimal until the 1990s when the first studies were conducted in the United States\nfollowing the suspicion that motorboats contaminate aquatic environments significantly through loss of gas and lubrication oil. According to Andre Mele, recreational boats\npollute as much as cars and trucks in the United States. In the early 2000’s, 8 million speedboats in the United States released 15 times more pollutants annually into the\nenvironment than the oil spill produced by the oil tanker Exxon Valdez in 1989. The sinking of this tanker in Alaska had released 11 million U.S. gallons of hydrocarbons into\nthe environment. After conversion, this means that each boat releases an average of 78 L of hydrocarbons into aquatic environments each year. If that average is still current, we\nestimate that in 2019 oil losses in the environment via motorboats equaled 150,000 tons of hydrocarbon scaly leaks in Canada (based on 2 million vessels), 750,000 tons of\nhydrocarbon scaly leaks in the United States (based on 10 million vessels) and 450,000 tons of hydrocarbon scaly leaks in Europe (based on 6 million vessels).\nThis explains why some lakes and bodies of water have recently banned motorboats. The total elimination of gas immediately reduces a very large source of marine pollution,\nwith immediate results that would impact beaches, swimming and the reduction of BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) and DCO (direct chemical oxidation) of ambient water.\nSpecifically, hydrocarbons,\n15\nsimilar to the dirt that clings to the walls of a bathtub, contaminate the shores and banks of lakes, rivers and bodies of water, where the development of many living organisms\ntakes place. The ecosystem is then modified with the scarcity or disappearance of certain species.\nIn an effort to tackle air pollution, cities around the world are beginning to ban all gas and diesel fuel powered boats from the center of the city. One of the first cities to\nimplement this change is Amsterdam, Netherlands. This movement to electrically powered boats has been implemented in Venice, where the city has restricted the movement of\ngas and diesel fuel powered boats, while exempting electrically powered boats.\nWe expect that shifting consumer preferences will result in significant growth in the market for electric boats, especially as the demand for recreational powerboats, in general,\nremains strong. We estimate consumers are increasingly willing to consider buying electric-powered boats due to the environmental and economic consequences of using\ngasoline-powered vehicles, as demonstrated by the increased sales of hybrid and electric automobiles in recent years. In its Electric Vehicle Outlook 2023, Bloomberg NEF\nexpects North America passenger electric vehicle sales to total 1.6 million in 2023, with 1.4 million of those located in the United States, up 47% compared to 2022. In 2024,\nthey expect the market to be up 32%, to a total of 1.9 million units in the United States. The prevalence of electric-powered boats is likely to follow suit.\nOur initiative into sustainable marine technologies and products is well-timed. The prevalence of batteries necessary to sustain a marine EV model line is expected to rise and\nbecome cheaper. Bloomberg NEF’s Long-Term Electric Vehicle Outlook reports that annual lithium-battery demand has proliferated in recent years and meeting the demand\nwill require unprecedented but achievable increases in materials, components, and cell production. Battery production capacity is expanding as more factories are brought\nonline. Moreover, battery technology that improves power and capacity is being designed, developed, and adopted regularly. According to Bloomberg NEF’s report, it found\nthat the volume-weighted average price of a lithium-ion battery pack fell 14% in 2023. to $139/kWh (kilowatt-hour). The Company is establishing itself in the market at the\nright time to help keep production costs as low as possible and make our boats affordable for our customers.\nForza believes its solid foundation in boat building, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and planned direct-to-consumer system will help it to rapidly innovate and introduce\nnew boats and technologies cost-effectively. By operating its sales and service network, it believes it can offer a compelling and premium customer-centric experience while\nachieving operating efficiencies and capturing sales and service revenues that traditional boat manufacturers do not receive in the independent dealer model. Forza also plans to\nleverage its electric powertrain technology to develop and sell powertrain components to other boat manufacturers and owners.\nForza believes its proprietary electric powertrain system will enable it to design and develop zero-emission boats that overcome the design, styling, and performance issues that\nhave historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric boats. As a result, Forza believes customers of its vehicles will enjoy many benefits, including:\n● Extended Run Times and Recharging Flexibility. Forza is designing its fully electric sport boat to offer an intermediate-range option and an option that would increase\nthe battery pack capacity for extended run times. Charging stations specifically designed for electric boats will eventually be an option for customers as well. Norway\nand Venice, Italy, are beginning to construct a network of electric boat charging stations. In the United States, Lake Tahoe is now home to a rapid-charging electric boat\ncharging station. While the US and the rest of the world begin to adopt a network of electric boat-specific stations, the design for the Forza X1 boats incorporates an\nonboard charging system, permitting recharging from almost any electrical outlet and residential and commercial charging stations previously only utilized for electric\nautomobiles.\n● Energy Efficiency and Cost of Ownership. Forza believes its fully electric sport boat will offer consumers an attractive cost of ownership compared to similar outboard\npowerboats. By using a single powertrain and customizing the systems within the electric powertrain and the rest of the boat, its boats are more energy-efficient, and\ntherefore less expensive to operate and maintain.\n● Environmental sustainability. Large gas-powered engines often leak and produce carbon emissions, both of which are generally harmful to fragil marine ecosystems.\nBy offering a fully electric boat to its customers and an alternative to traditional propulsion systems, Forza e can foster a more environmentally sustainable boat brand.\nOur greatest hope is to be purposeful stewards of the marine industry and lead by example in environmentally friendly innovation.\n16\n● Noise Level. So often, powerboats create large amounts of noise, disturbing wildlife and making it difficult for fellow passengers to hear one another while underway.\nForza’s electric powertrain will produce little to no sound, making it easier to enjoy the sounds of nature, family, and friends. Forza’s products will also help\ntremendously with fishing and other sporting and water-based activities that favor less noise.\nOur Dealer Network\nWe primarily sell our gas-powered boats through a network of 47 independent dealers in 47 locations across North America, the Caribbean (one in the Bahamas, Puerto Rico\nand Cayman Islands) and Central America (Panama City, Panama). We are always seeking to recruit and establish new dealers and distributors domestically and are striving to\ndevelop international distribution.\nWe establish performance criteria that our dealers must meet in order to be part of our network to ensure our dealer network remains strong, which include minimum annual\npurchase orders. As a member of our network, dealers in North America may qualify for floor plan financing programs, rebates, seasonal discounts, promotional co-op\npayments and other allowances. We expect this will strengthen our dealers’ ability to sell our products.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our top five dealers on a consolidated basis accounted for approximately 35% of our consolidated revenues. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, one individual dealer had sales of over 10% of our total sales, that dealer represented 10% of total sales.\nWe consistently review our distribution network to identify opportunities to expand our geographic footprint and improve our coverage of the market. We believe that our\ndiverse product offering and strong market position in each region of the United States helped us capitalize on growth opportunities as our industry recovered from the\neconomic downturn. We have the ability to opportunistically add new dealers and new dealer locations to previously underserved markets and use data and performance metrics\nto monitor dealer performance. We believe our outstanding dealer network allows us to distribute our products more efficiently than our smaller competitors.\nWe do not have written agreements with our dealers. Prior to the beginning of each year, we establish a minimum number of units that each dealer must acquire based upon\nindications of interest from the dealers. Payment for the units is made by the dealer or a third-party lender once the boat is manufactured and delivered to the dealer. Dealers are\nnot contractually obligated to purchase any boats. Although to date most dealers have purchased boats for which they have provided indications of interest, we could experience\nexcess inventory and costs if a dealer should choose not to purchase a boat for which it has provided an indication of interest.\nFloor Plan Financing\nOur North American dealers often purchase boats through floor plan financing programs with third-party floor plan financing providers. During the year ended December 31,\n2023, a majority of our North American shipments were made pursuant to floor plan financing programs through which our dealers participate. These programs allow dealers\nacross our brands to establish lines of credit with third-party lenders to purchase inventory. Under these programs, a dealer draws on the floor plan facility upon the purchase of\nour boats and the lender pays the invoice price of the boats. As is typical in our industry, we have entered into repurchase agreements with certain floor plan financing providers\nto our dealers. Under the terms of these arrangements, in the event a lender repossesses a boat from a dealer that has defaulted on its floor financing arrangement and is able to\ndeliver the repossessed boat to us, we are obligated to repurchase the boat from the lender. Our obligation to repurchase such repossessed products for the unpaid balance of our\noriginal invoice price for the boat is subject to reduction or limitation based on the age and condition of the boat at the time of repurchase, and in certain cases by an aggregate\ncap on repurchase obligations associated with a particular floor financing program.\nOur exposure under repurchase agreements with third-party lenders is mitigated by our ability to reposition inventory with a new dealer in the event that a repurchase event\noccurs. The primary cost to us of a repurchase event is any margin loss on the resale of a repurchased unit. To date, we have not been required to repurchase any boats under\nrepurchase agreements.\n17\nCompetition\nThe powerboat industry, including the performance sport boat category, is highly competitive for consumers and dealers. Competition affects our ability to succeed in the\nmarkets we currently serve and new markets that we may enter in the future. We compete with several large manufacturers that may have greater financial, marketing and other\nresources than we do. We compete with large manufacturers who are represented by dealers in the markets in which we now operate and into which we plan to expand. We also\ncompete with a wide variety of small, independent manufactures. Competition in our industry is based primarily on brand name, price and product performance.\nWe also compete with other leisure activities. Our boats are not necessities and in times of economic hardship, consumers may cease purchasing non-essential items. Luxury\nitems may not be used for recreational and sport purposes, and demand for our boats may be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers’\nleisure time and by changes in consumer lifestyle, usage pattern or taste.\nWe also face competition for employees. Competition for individuals with experience designing, manufacturing and servicing electric boats is intense, and we may not be able\nto attract, assimilate, train or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future. The failure to attract, integrate, train, motivate and retain these additional employees\ncould seriously harm our business and prospects.\nRaw Materials, Principal Suppliers, and Customers\nWe purchase a number of our product parts and components from third-party suppliers, including the fiberglass we use to manufacture the fiberglass parts of our boats,\nhydrocarbon feedstocks and steel, as well as product parts and components, such as engines and electronic controls, through a sales order process. The most significant\ncomponent used in manufacturing our gas-powered boats, based on cost, are engines. We maintain a strong and long-standing relationship with our sole supplier of engines,\nSuzuki Motor of America, Inc.\nWe do not maintain long-term contracts with preferred suppliers, but instead rely on informal arrangements and off-the-shelf purchases. We purchase motors from three\ndifferent manufactures, we have not experienced any material shortages in any of our product parts, or components. Temporary shortages, when they do occur, usually involve\nmanufacturers of these products adjusting model mix, introducing new product lines, or limiting production in response to an industry-wide reduction in boat demand.\nA few customers have in the past, and may in the future, account for a significant portion of our revenues in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. For\nexample, during the year end December 31, 2023 five dealers represented 35% of our sales. The loss of business from a significant customer could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIntellectual Property\nWe have not protected our intellectual property rights for our gas-powered motor products through patents or formal copyright registration, and we do not currently have any\npatent applications pending related to our gas-powered boats.\nForza X1 Intellectual Property\nWe are working to create a portfolio of proprietary designs and technology that we expect to serve as the foundation of our product development. To date, we have three design\nand four utility patent applications on file with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Certain patent applications were originally filed by, and in the name of, the\nindividual who was the inventor of the technology and since have been assigned to us. Below is a list of pending patent applications that we are seeking approval for from the\nUnited States Patent and Trademark Office. We cannot be certain that the patent applications that we file will issue, or that our issued patents will afford protection against\ncompetitors with similar technology.

Our policies are generally based on our safety record as\nwell as\nmarket trends in the insurance industry and are subject to certain deductibles, limits and policy terms and conditions.\nWe provide limited product warranties, generally covering periods of ten years for the hull and the motors are under warranty by their manufacturer.\nIn addition, we provide a three-year limited fiberglass small parts warranty on some small fiberglass parts and components, such as consoles. Gelcoat is covered up to one year.\nAdditionally, fiberglass lids, plastic lids, electrical panels, bilge pumps, aerator pumps or other electrical devices (excluding stereos, depth finders, radar, chart plotters except\nfor installation if installed by Twin Vee), steering systems, electrical panels, and pumps are covered under a one-year basic limited systems warranty. Some materials,\ncomponents or parts of the boat that are not covered by our limited product warranties are separately warranted by their manufacturers or suppliers. These other warranties\ninclude warranties covering engines purchased from suppliers and other components.\nEnvironmental, Safety and Regulatory Matters\nCertain materials used in our manufacturing, including the resins used in production of our boats, are toxic, flammable, corrosive or reactive and are classified by the federal\nand state governments as “hazardous materials.” Control of these substances is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and state pollution control\nagencies. The United States Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) and corresponding state and provincial rules regulate emissions of air pollutants. The Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration (“OSHA”) standards limit the emissions to which an employee may be exposed without the need for respiratory protection or upgraded plant ventilation. Our\nfacilities are regularly inspected by OSHA and by state and local inspection agencies and departments. We believe that our facility complies in all material aspects with these\nregulations. Although capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws are expected to increase, we do not currently anticipate any material expenditure will\nbe required to continue to comply with existing environmental or safety regulations in connection with our existing manufacturing facilities.\nPowerboats sold in the United States must be manufactured to meet the standards of certification required by the United States Coast Guard. In addition, boats manufactured for\nsale in the European Community must be certified to meet the European Community’s imported manufactured products standards. These certifications specify standards for the\ndesign and construction of powerboats. We believe that all of our boats meet these standards. In addition, safety of recreational boats is subject to federal regulation under the\nBoat Safety Act of 1971, which requires boat manufacturers to recall products for replacement of parts or components that have demonstrated defects affecting safety. We have\ninstituted recalls for defective component parts produced by certain of our third-party suppliers. None of the recalls has had a material adverse effect on our company.\nIn addition to the regulation of our manufacturing operations, the EPA has adopted regulations stipulating that many marine propulsion engines meet certain air emission\nstandards. The engines used in our products, all of which are manufactured by third parties, are warranted by the manufacturers to be in compliance with the EPA’s emission\nstandards. Furthermore, the engines used in our products must comply with the applicable emission standards under the Center for European Policy Analysis (“CEPA”) and\ncorresponding provincial legislation. The additional cost of complying with these regulations has increased our cost to purchase the engines and, accordingly, has increased the\ncost to manufacture our products.\nIf we are not able to pass these additional costs along to our dealers, it may have a negative impact on our business and financial condition.\nEmployees/Human Capital\nWe currently employ approximately 90 employees in our gas-powered boat segment, all of whom are full time employees. Forza has 9 full time employees working on electric-\npowered boats. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.\n21\nCompetitive Pay and Benefits\nOur compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate\nemployees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically:\n● we provide employee wages and benefits that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location;\n● we align our executives’ long-term equity compensation with our shareholders’ interests by linking realizable pay with stock performance; and\n● all employees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, a retirement plan and life and disability/accident coverage.\nHealth and Safety\nThe health and safety of our employees is our highest priority, and this is consistent with our operating philosophy. Accordingly, with the global spread of the ongoing novel\ncoronavirus pandemic, we have implemented plans designed to address and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the safety of our employees and our business,\nwhich include:\n● adding work from home flexibility;\n● adjusting attendance policies to encourage those who are sick to stay home;\n● increasing cleaning protocols across all locations; and\n● initiating regular communication regarding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including health and safety protocols and procedures.\nCorporate Information\nOur principal executive office is located at 3101 S. US-1, Ft. Pierce, Florida 34982 and our telephone number is (772) 429-2525. We maintain our corporate website at\nwww.twinvee.com. The reference to our website is an inactive textual reference only, the information that can be accessed through our website is not part of this Annual Report,\nand investors should not rely on any such information in deciding whether to purchase our common stock.\nWe were incorporated in the State of Florida as Twin Vee Catamarans, Inc. on December 1, 2009 and reincorporated in Delaware on April 7, 2021 under the name to Twin Vee\nPowerCats Co. ValueRich, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the state of Florida on July 11, 2003 and reincorporated in Delaware on March 3, 2006. On February 17,\n2015 ValueRich, Inc. consummated the acquisition of Twin Vee Catamarans, Inc. On April 26, 2016, ValueRich, Inc. changed its name and began operating under the name\nTwin Vee PowerCats, Inc. On December 5, 2022, the merger of Twin Vee PowerCats, Inc. into our company was approved.\nForza X1, Inc. was initially incorporated as Electra Power Sports, Inc. on October 15, 2021, which name was subsequently changed to Forza X1, Inc. on October 29, 2021.\nPrior to Forza’s incorporation on October 15, 2021, the electric boat business was operated as our Electra Power Sports™ Division. Following our initial public offering that\nclosed on July 23, 2021 (the “IPO”), we determined in October 2021 that for several reasons, that we would market our new independent line of electric boats under a new\nbrand name (and new subsidiary).\nFix My Boat, Inc. was incorporated on September 21, 2021 in Delaware.\n22\nImplications of Being an Emerging Growth Company\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and therefore we intend to take advantage of certain\nexemptions from various public company reporting requirements, including not being required to have our internal controls over financial reporting audited by our independent\nregistered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive\ncompensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and any\ngolden parachute payments. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an\n“emerging growth company” can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use the\nextended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised\naccounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our\nfinancial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earlier of\n(1) the last day of the fiscal year: (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering; (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least\n$1.235 billion; or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0\nmillion as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein\nto “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with that term in the JOBS Act.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvestors should carefully consider the risks described below before deciding whether to invest in our securities. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your\ninvestment. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements made throughout this Annual Report a result of different factors,\nincluding the risks we face described below.\nRisks Related to our Business\nThere is limited public information on our operating history.\nOur limited public operating history makes evaluating our business and prospects difficult. Although we were formed in 2003, we did not provide public reports on the results\nof operations until our 2020 fiscal year. We only have a few years of audited financial statements. Any investment decision will not be made with the same data as would be\navailable as if we had a longer history of public reporting.\nWe have incurred losses for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and could continue to incur losses in the future.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, we incurred a loss from operations of $11,987,299 and $6,021,708; and a net loss of $9,782,196 and\n$5,792,414. As of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $14.5 million. There can be no assurance that expenses will not continue to increase in\nfuture periods or that the cash generated from operations in future periods will be sufficient to satisfy our operating needs and to generate income from operations and net\nincome.\nOur ability to meet our manufacturing workforce needs is crucial to our results of operations and future sales and profitability.\nWe rely on the existence of an available hourly workforce to manufacture our products. In addition, Forza relies upon engineers that are specialist in electric engineering. We\ncannot assure you that we or our subsidiaries, will be able to attract and retain qualified employees to meet current or future manufacturing needs at a reasonable cost,\n23\nor at all. For instance, the demand for skilled employees has increased recently with the low unemployment rates in Florida where we have manufacturing facilities and in\nNorth Carolina where Forza is building a manufacturing facility. Also, although none of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements, we cannot\nassure you that our employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher\nwages to attract a sufficient number of employees. Significant increases in manufacturing workforce costs could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or\nresults of operations. Forza intends to continue to hire a number of additional personnel, including design and manufacturing personnel and service technicians for its electric\nboats and powertrains. Competition for individuals with experience designing, manufacturing and servicing electric boats is intense, and Forza may not be able to attract,\nassimilate, train or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future. The failure to attract, integrate, train, motivate and retain these additional employees could\nseriously harm Forza’s business and prospects.\nWe have a large, fixed cost base that will affect our profitability if our sales decrease.\nThe fixed cost levels of operating a powerboat manufacturer can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline. Our profitability depends, in part, on our\nability to spread fixed costs over a sufficiently large number of products sold and shipped, and if we make a decision to reduce our rate of production, gross or net margins\ncould be negatively affected. Consequently, decreased demand or the need to reduce production can lower our ability to absorb fixed costs and materially impact our financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nInterest rates and energy prices affect product sales.\nOur gas-powered products are often financed by our dealers and retail powerboat consumers, we envision this continuing as we expand our operations and grow our network of\ndistributors. This may not occur if interest rates meaningfully rise because higher rates increase the borrowing costs and, accordingly, the cost of doing business for dealers and\nthe cost of powerboat purchases for consumers. Higher energy costs result in increases in operating expenses at our manufacturing facility and in the expense of shipping\nproducts to our dealers. In addition, inflation and increases in energy costs may adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials, such as resins\nand foams that are used in our products. Also, higher fuel prices may have an adverse effect on demand for our gas-powered boats, as they increase the cost of ownership and\noperation and the pries at which we sell the boats. Therefore, higher interest rates and fuel costs can adversely affect consumers’ decisions relating to recreational powerboating\npurchases.\nThe capacity of the manufacturing facility that we and Forza utilize will not be sufficient to support our future growth and business plans.\nWe are currently operating close to full capacity at our current manufacturing facility in Fort Pierce. Forza plans to manufacture its electric boats at a new state of the art carbon\nneutral factory that it plans to build in McDowell County, North Carolina. Until we are able to expand our manufacturing capacity and Forza is able to build the planned\nmanufacturing facility, we will continue to share our current manufacturing facility with Forza, which has a limited capacity and may not be able to satisfy our and their\nmanufacturing needs. Any facility that we build will require a significant capital investment and is expected to take at least one to two years to build and become fully\noperational. As a result of limited capacity at our facility, Forza’s ability to produce any boats will be limited to available capacity of our facility until Forza’s future\nmanufacturing facility is operational. If capacity is not available, Forza will not be able to produce its electric boats as planned.\nIn addition. Forza intends to utilize grant funding to pay for certain costs associated with the building of its manufacturing facility. On July 28, 2022, we received notice that the\nNorth Carolina Economic investment committee has approved a Job Development Investment Grant (“JDIG”) providing for reimbursement to us of up to $1,367,100 over a\ntwelve-year period to establish a new manufacturing plant in McDowell County, North Carolina. The receipt of grant funding is conditioned upon Forza investing over $10.5\nmillion in land, buildings and fixtures, infrastructure and machinery and equipment by the end of 2025 and Forza creating as many as 170 jobs. There can be no assurance that\nForza will meet the conditions necessary to receive the grant funding.\n24\nChanges in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, domestic and foreign trade policies, monetary policies and other factors beyond our control may\nadversely impact our business and operating results.\nOur operations and performance depend on global, regional and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions. General worldwide economic conditions have experienced\nsignificant instability in recent years including the recent global economic uncertainty and financial market conditions. The circumstances relating to the COVID-19 pandemic,\nthe Russian invasion of Ukraine, the war in the Middle East, as well as other global conditions, have caused significant shortages in the supply chain. We are continuously\nevaluating alternative and secondary source suppliers in order to ensure that we are able to source sufficient materials.\nThe uncertain financial markets, disruptions in supply chains, mobility restraints, and changing priorities as well as volatile asset values could impact our business in the future.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and government measures taken in response to the pandemic have also had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce,\nas worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services, such as\nmedical services and supplies, have spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, have fallen. The future progression of the pandemic and its effects on our\nbusiness and operations are uncertain. In addition, the outbreak of a pandemic could disrupt our operations due to absenteeism by infected or ill members of management or\nother employees, or absenteeism by members of management and other employees who elect not to come to work due to the illness affecting others in our office or laboratory\nfacilities, or due to quarantines. Pandemics could also impact members of our Board of Directors resulting in absenteeism from meetings of the directors or committees of\ndirectors, and making it more difficult to convene the quorums of the full Board of Directors or its committees needed to conduct meetings for the management of our affairs.\nFurther, due to increasing inflation, operating costs for many businesses including ours have increased and, in the future, could impact demand or pricing manufacturing of our\ndrug candidates or services providers, foreign exchange rates or employee wages. Inflation rates, particularly in the United States, have increased recently to levels not seen in\nyears, and increased inflation may result in increases in our operating costs (including our labor costs), reduced liquidity and limits on our ability to access credit or otherwise\nraise capital. In addition, the Federal Reserve has raised, and may again raise, interest rates in response to concerns about inflation, which coupled with reduced government\nspending and volatility in financial markets may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks.\nActual events involving reduced or limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions or other companies in the\nfinancial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds, have in the past and may in the future lead to\nmarket-wide liquidity problems.\nWe are actively monitoring the effects these disruptions and increasing inflation could have on our operations.\nThese conditions make it extremely difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.\nOur annual and quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur sales and operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. These\nfactors include, but are not limited to:\n● Seasonal consumer demand for our products;\n● Discretionary spending habits;\n● Changes in pricing in, or the availability of supply in, the powerboat market;\n● Failure to maintain a premium brand image;\n● Disruption in the operation of our manufacturing facilities;\n● Variations in the timing and volume of our sales;\n● The timing of our expenditures in anticipation of future sales;\n25\n● Sales promotions by us and our competitors;\n● Changes in competitive and economic conditions generally;\n● Consumer preferences and competition for consumers’ leisure time;\n● Impact of unfavorable weather conditions;\n● Changes in the cost or availability of our labor; and\n● Increased fuel prices.\nDue to these and other factors, our results of operations may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our\nproducts. We anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future.\nUnfavorable weather conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, especially during the peak boating\nseason.\nAdverse weather conditions in any year in any particular geographic region may adversely affect sales in that region, especially during the peak boating season. Sales of our\nproducts are generally stronger just before and during spring and summer, which represent the peak boating months, and favorable weather during these months generally has a\npositive effect on consumer demand. Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall, reduced rainfall levels, or drought conditions during these periods may close\narea boating locations or render boating dangerous or inconvenient, thereby generally reducing consumer demand for our products. Our annual results would be materially and\nadversely affected if our net sales were to fall below expected seasonal levels during these periods. We may also experience more pronounced seasonal fluctuation in net sales\nin the future as we expand our businesses. There can be no assurance that weather conditions will not have a material effect on the sales of any of our products.\nA natural disaster, the effects of climate change, or other disruptions at our manufacturing facility could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe rely on the continuous operation of our only manufacturing facility in Stuart, Florida for the production of our products. Any natural disaster or other serious disruption to\nour facility due to fire, flood, earthquake, or any other unforeseen circumstance would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in\nclimate could adversely affect our operations by limiting or increasing the costs associated with equipment or fuel supplies. In addition, adverse weather conditions, such as\nincreased frequency and/or severity of storms, or floods could impair our ability to operate by damaging our facilities and equipment or restricting product delivery to\ncustomers. The occurrence of any disruption at our manufacturing facility, even for a short period of time, may have an adverse effect on our productivity and profitability,\nduring and after the period of the disruption. These disruptions may also cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, and\nenvironmental damage. Although we maintain property, casualty, and business interruption insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for the\nindustry, we are not fully insured against all potential natural disasters or other disruptions to our manufacturing facility.\nIf we fail to manage our manufacturing levels while still addressing the seasonal retail pattern for our products, our business and margins may suffer.\nThe seasonality of retail demand for our products, together with our goal of balancing production throughout the year, requires us to manage our manufacturing and allocate our\ngas-powered products to our dealer network to address anticipated retail demand. Our dealers must manage seasonal changes in consumer demand and inventory. If our dealers\nreduce their inventories in response to weakness in retail demand, we could be required to reduce our production, resulting in lower rates of absorption of fixed costs in our\nmanufacturing and, therefore, lower margins. As a result, we must balance the economies of level production with the seasonal retail sales pattern experienced by our dealers.\nFailure to adjust manufacturing levels adequately may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our network of independent dealers for our gas-powered boats, face increasing competition for dealers, and have little control over their activities.\n26\nA significant portion of our sales of our gas-powered boats are derived from our network of independent dealers. We typically manufacture our gas-powered boats based upon\nindications of interest received from dealers who are not contractually obligated to purchase any boats. While our dealers typically have purchased all of the boats for which\nthey have provided us with indications of interest, it is possible that a dealer could choose not to purchase boats for which it has provided an indication of interest (e.g., if it\nwere to have reached the credit limit on its floor plan), and as a result we once experienced, and in the future could experience, excess inventory and costs. For fiscal 2023, our\ntop five dealers accounted for approximately 35% of our consolidated revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2023, one individual dealer had sales of over 10% of our\ntotal sales, that dealer represented 10% of total sales. During the year ended December 31, 2022, one individual dealer had sales of over 10% of our total sales and that dealer\nrepresented 12% of total sales. The loss of a significant dealer could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The number of dealers\nsupporting our products and the quality of their marketing and servicing efforts are essential to our ability to generate sales. Competition for dealers among other boat\nmanufacturers continues to increase based on the quality, price, value, and availability of the manufacturers’ products, the manufacturers’ attention to customer service, and the\nmarketing support that the manufacturer provides to the dealers. We face intense competition from other boat manufacturers in attracting and retaining dealers, affecting our\nability to attract or retain relationships with qualified and successful dealers. Although our management believes that the quality of our products in the performance sport boat\nindustry should permit us to maintain our relationships with our dealers and our market share position, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our\nrelationships with our dealers or our market share position. In addition, independent dealers in the boating industry have experienced significant consolidation in recent years,\nwhich could result in the loss of one or more of our dealers in the future if the surviving entity in any such consolidation purchases similar products from a competitor. A\nsubstantial deterioration in the number of dealers or the quality of our network of dealers would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nOur success depends, in part, upon the financial health of our dealers and their continued access to financing.\nBecause we sell nearly all of our gas-powered products through dealers, their financial health is critical to our success. Our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations may be adversely affected if the financial health of the dealers that sell our products suffers. Their financial health may suffer for a variety of reasons, including a\ndownturn in general economic conditions, rising interest rates, higher rents, increased labor costs and taxes, compliance with regulations, and personal financial issues.\nIn addition, our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchases of our products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that\ncould unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These\nsources of financing are vital to our ability to sell products through our distribution network. Access to financing generally facilitates our dealers’ ability to purchase boats from\nus, and their financed purchases reduce our working capital requirements. If financing were not available to our dealers, our sales and our working capital levels would be\nadversely affected.\nWe may be required to repurchase inventory of certain dealers.\nMany of our dealers have floor plan financing arrangements with third-party finance companies that enable the dealers to purchase our products. In connection with these\nagreements, we may have an obligation to repurchase our products from a finance company under certain circumstances, and we may not have any control over the timing or\namount of any repurchase obligation nor have access to capital on terms acceptable to us to satisfy any repurchase obligation. This obligation is triggered if a dealer defaults on\nits debt obligations to a finance company, the finance company repossesses the boat, and the boat is returned to us. Our obligation to repurchase a repossessed boat for the\nunpaid balance of our original invoice price for the boat is subject to reduction or limitation based on the age and condition of the boat at the time of repurchase, and in certain\ncases by an aggregate cap on repurchase obligations associated with a particular floor plan financing program. To date, we have not been obligated to repurchase any boats\nunder our dealers’ floor plan financing arrangements, and we are not aware of any applicable laws regulating dealer relations which govern our relations with the dealers or\nwould require us to repurchase any boats. However, there is no assurance that a dealer will not default on the terms of a credit line in the future. In addition, applicable laws\nregulating dealer relations may also require us to repurchase our products from our dealers under certain circumstances,\n27\nand we may not have any control over the timing or amount of any repurchase obligation nor have access to capital on terms acceptable to us to satisfy any repurchase\nobligation. If we were obligated to repurchase a significant number of units under any repurchase agreement or under applicable dealer laws, our business, operating results and\nfinancial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers in the manufacturing of our boats.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers to provide components and raw materials essential to the construction of our boats. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the\nCompany purchased all engines for its boats under supplier agreements with three vendors. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company purchased all engines for\nits boats under supplier agreements with one vendor. While we believe that our relationships with our current suppliers are sufficient to provide the materials necessary to meet\npresent production demand, we cannot assure you that these relationships will continue or that the quantity or quality of materials available from these suppliers will be\nsufficient to meet our future needs, irrespective of whether we successfully implement our growth strategy. We expect that our need for raw materials and supplies will increase.\nOur suppliers must be prepared to ramp up operations and, in many cases, hire additional workers and/or expand capacity in order to fulfill the orders placed by us and other\ncustomers. Operational and financial difficulties that our suppliers may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply us with the parts and components we\nneed, which could significantly disrupt our operations.\nTermination or interruption of informal supply arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nAlthough we have long-term relationships with many of our suppliers, we do not have any formal agreements with any suppliers for the purchase of parts needed and our\npurchases are made on a purchase order basis. We have no binding commitment from our suppliers to supply any specified quantity of materials needed within any specified\ntime period. In the event that our suppliers receive a large number of orders from other customers, there is a possibility that they will not be able to support our needs. If any of\nour current suppliers were to be unable to provide needed products to us, there can be no assurance that alternate supply arrangements will be made on satisfactory terms. If we\nneed to enter into supply arrangements on unsatisfactory terms, or if there are any delays to our supply arrangements, it could adversely affect our business and operating\nresults.\nSignificant product repair and/or replacement due to product warranty claims or product recalls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe provide a hull warranty for structural damage of up to ten years for its gas-powered boats. In addition, we provide a three-year limited fiberglass small parts warranty on all\nor some small fiberglass parts and components such as consoles. Gelcoat is covered up to one year. Additionally, fiberglass lids, plastic lids, electrical panels, bilge pumps,\naerator pumps or other electrical devices (excluding stereos, depth finders, radar, chart plotters except for installation if installed by us.), steering systems, electrical panels, and\npumps are covered under a one-year basic limited systems warranty. Some materials, components or parts of the boat that are not covered by our limited product warranties are\nseparately warranted by their manufacturers or suppliers. These other warranties include warranties covering engines purchased from suppliers and other components.\nOur standard warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer. Although we employ quality\ncontrol procedures, sometimes a product is distributed that needs repair or replacement. The repair and replacement costs we could incur in connection with a recall could\nadversely affect its business. In addition, product recalls could harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers, particularly if recalls cause consumers to question the safety\nor reliability of its products.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to workers’ compensation claims and other workplace liabilities.\nCertain materials we use require our employees to handle potentially hazardous or toxic substances. While our employees who handle these and other potentially hazardous or\ntoxic materials receive specialized training and wear protective clothing, there is still a risk that they,\n28\nor others, may be exposed to these substances. Exposure to these substances could result in significant injury to our employees and damage to our property or the property of\nothers, including natural resource damage. Our personnel are also at risk for other workplace-related injuries, including slips and falls. We may in the future be subject to fines,\npenalties, and other liabilities in connection with any such injury or damage. Although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate insurance in excess of\nour self-insured amounts, we may be unable to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or such insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities.\nIf we are unable to comply with environmental and other regulatory requirements, our business may be exposed to material liability and/or fines.\nOur operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those concerning product safety, environmental\nprotection, and occupational health and safety. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain permits and limit our ability to discharge hazardous materials into the\nenvironment. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement actions that could result in the assessment of fines and penalties,\nobligations to conduct remedial or corrective actions, or, in extreme circumstances, revocation of our permits or injunctions preventing some or all of our operations. In\naddition, the components of our boats must meet certain regulatory standards, including stringent air emission standards for boat engines. Failure to meet these standards could\nresult in an inability to sell our boats in key markets, which would adversely affect our business. Moreover, compliance with these regulatory requirements could increase the\ncost of our products, which in turn, may reduce consumer demand.\nWhile we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory requirements, and hold all licenses and permits required\nthereunder, we cannot assure you that we will, at all times, be able to continue to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. Compliance with increasingly stringent\nregulatory and permit requirements may, in the future, cause us to incur substantial capital costs and increase our cost of operations, or may limit our operations, all of which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.\nAs with most boat construction businesses, our manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage, and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous substances\nand wastes. The failure to manage or dispose of such hazardous substances and wastes properly could expose us to material liability or fines, including liability for personal\ninjury or property damage due to exposure to hazardous substances, damages to natural resources, or for the investigation and remediation of environmental conditions. Under\nenvironmental laws, we may be liable for remediation of contamination at sites where our hazardous wastes have been disposed or at our current facility, regardless of whether\nour facility is owned or leased or whether the environmental conditions were created by us, a prior owner or tenant, or third-party. While we do not believe that we are presently\nsubject to any such liabilities, we cannot assure you that environmental conditions relating to our prior, existing, or future sites or operations or those of predecessor companies\nwill not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.\nOur industry is characterized by intense competition, which affects our sales and profits.\nThe performance sport boat category and the powerboat industry as a whole are highly competitive for consumers and dealers. We also compete against consumer demand for\nused boats. Competition affects our ability to succeed in both the markets we currently serve and new markets that we may enter in the future. Competition is based primarily\non brand name, price, product selection, and product performance. We compete with several large manufacturers that may have greater financial, marketing, and other resources\nthan we do and who are represented by dealers in the markets in which we now operate and into which we plan to expand. We also compete with a variety of small, independent\nmanufacturers. We cannot assure you that we will not face greater competition from existing large or small manufacturers or that we will be able to compete successfully with\nnew competitors. Our failure to compete effectively with our current and future competitors would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also compete with other manufacturers for employees.\n29\nWe face increasing competition for dealers and have little control over their activities.\nWe face intense competition from other performance sport boat manufacturers in attracting and retaining dealers and customers, affecting our ability to attract or retain\nrelationships with qualified and successful dealers and consumers looking to purchase boats. Although our management believes that the quality of our products in the boat\nindustry should permit us to maintain our relationships with our dealers and our market share position, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our\nrelationships with our dealers or our market share position. In addition, independent dealers in the boating industry have experienced significant consolidation in recent years,\nwhich could result in the loss of one or more of our dealers in the future if the surviving entity in any such consolidation purchases similar products from a competitor. A\nsubstantial deterioration in the number of dealers or quality of our network of dealers would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nOur sales may be adversely impacted by increased consumer preference for other leisure activities or used boats or the supply of new boats by competitors in excess of\ndemand.\nOur boats are not necessities and in times of economic hardship, consumers may cease purchasing non-essential items. Demand for our boats may be adversely affected by\ncompetition from other activities that occupy consumers’ leisure time and by changes in consumer lifestyle, usage pattern or taste. Similarly, an overall decrease in consumer\nleisure time may reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase and enjoy our boats.\nDuring the economic downturn that commenced in 2008, there was a shift in consumer demand toward purchasing more used boats, primarily because prices for used boats are\ntypically lower than retail prices for new boats. If this were to occur again, it could have the effect of reducing demand among retail purchasers for our new boats. Also, while\nwe have balanced production volumes for our boats to meet demand, our competitors could choose to reduce the price of their products, which could have the effect of reducing\ndemand for our new boats. Reduced demand for new boats could lead to reduced sales by us, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial\ncondition.\nOur sales and profitability depend, in part, on the successful introduction of new products.\nMarket acceptance of our products depends on our technological innovation and our ability to implement technology in our boats. Our sales and profitability may be adversely\naffected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable or innovative new products. Our failure to introduce new technologies and\nproduct offerings that consumers desire could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we fail to introduce new features or those we\nintroduce fail to gain market acceptance, our bottom line may suffer.\nIn addition, some of our direct competitors and indirect competitors may have significantly more resources to develop and patent new technologies. It is possible that our\ncompetitors will develop and patent equivalent or superior technologies and other products that compete with ours. They may assert these patents against us and we may be\nrequired to license these patents on unfavorable terms or cease using the technology covered by these patents, either of which would harm our competitive position and may\nmaterially adversely affect our business.\nWe also cannot be certain that our products or features have not infringed or will not infringe the proprietary rights of others. Any such infringement could cause third parties,\nincluding our competitors, to bring claims against us, resulting in significant costs and potential damages.\nOur success depends upon the continued strength of our brand, the value of our brand, and sales of our products could be diminished if we, the consumers who use our\nproducts, or the sports and activities in which our products are used are associated with negative publicity.\nWe believe that our brand is a significant contributor to the success of our business and that maintaining and enhancing our brand is important to expanding our consumer and\ndealer base. Failure to continue to protect our brand may adversely affect our business, financial condition,\n30\nand results of operations. We expect that our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the Twin Vee, AquaSport and Forza brands will also depend heavily on the success of\nour marketing efforts. To further promote our brands and Forza’s brand, we and Forza may be required to change our marketing practices, which could result in substantially\nincreased advertising expenses, including the need to use traditional media such as television, radio and print. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater name\nrecognition, broader customer relationships and substantially greater marketing resources than we do. If we do not develop and maintain strong brands, our business, prospects,\nfinancial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely impacted.\nNegative publicity, including that resulting from severe injuries or death occurring in the sports and activities in which our products are used, could negatively affect our\nreputation and result in restrictions, recalls, or bans on the use of our products. If the popularity of the sports and activities for which we design, manufacture, and sell products\nwere to decrease as a result of these risks or any negative publicity, sales of our products could decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our net sales, profitability, and\noperating results. In addition, if we become exposed to additional claims and litigation relating to the use of our products, our reputation may be adversely affected by such\nclaims, whether or not successful, including by generating potential negative publicity about our products, which could adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to execute our manufacturing strategy successfully, which could cause the profitability of our products to suffer.\nOur manufacturing strategy is designed to improve product quality and increase productivity, while reducing costs and increasing flexibility to respond to ongoing changes in\nthe marketplace. To implement this strategy, we must be successful in our continuous improvement efforts, which depend on the involvement of management, production\nemployees, and suppliers. Any inability to achieve these objectives could adversely impact the profitability of our products and our ability to deliver desirable products to our\nconsumers.\nWe will rely on complex machinery for our operations, and production involves a significant degree of risk and uncertainty in terms of operational performance, safety,\nsecurity, and costs.\nWe expect to rely heavily on complex machinery for our operations and our production will involve a significant degree of uncertainty and risk in terms of operational\nperformance, safety, security, and costs. Our manufacturing plant consists of large-scale machinery combining many components. The manufacturing plant components are\nlikely to suffer unexpected malfunctions from time to time and will depend on repairs and spare parts to resume operations, which may not be available when needed.\nUnexpected malfunctions of the manufacturing plant components may significantly affect operational efficiency. Operational performance and costs can be difficult to predict\nand are often influenced by factors outside of our control, such as, but not limited to, scarcity of natural resources, environmental hazards and remediation, costs associated with\ndecommissioning of machines, labor disputes and strikes, difficulty or delays in obtaining governmental permits, damages or defects in electronic systems, industrial accidents,\npandemics, fire, seismic activity, and natural disasters. Should operational risks materialize, it may result in the personal injury to or death of workers, the loss of production\nequipment, damage to manufacturing facilities, products, supplies, tools and materials, monetary losses, delays and unanticipated fluctuations in production, environmental\ndamage, administrative fines, increased insurance costs, and potential legal liabilities, all which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial\ncondition, results of operations, and cash flows. Although we generally carry insurance to cover such operational risks, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be\nsufficient to cover potential costs and liabilities arising therefrom. A loss that is uninsured or exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which could\nadversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may need to raise additional capital that may be required to grow our business, and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nOperating our business and maintaining our growth efforts will require significant cash outlays and advance capital expenditures and commitments. Although the proceeds of\nour initial public offering and follow on offering should be sufficient to fund our operations, if cash on hand and cash generated from operations and from our initial public\noffering and follow on offering are not sufficient to meet our cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital,\n31\npotentially through debt or equity financings, to fund our growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise needed cash on terms acceptable to us or at all. Financings\nmay be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower\nthan the price per share of our common stock in our initial public offering. The holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to\nthose of existing holders of common stock. If new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we will be required to modify our growth and operating\nplans based on available funding, if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business.\nIf we fail to manage future growth effectively, we may not be able to market or sell our products successfully.\nAny failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We plan to expand our\noperations in the near future. Our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage this expansion and growth successfully. Risks that we face in\nundertaking this expansion include:\n● training new personnel;\n● forecasting production and revenue;\n● expanding our marketing efforts, including the marketing of a new powertrain that we intend to develop;\n● controlling expenses and investments in anticipation of expanded operations;\n● establishing or expanding design, manufacturing, sales and service facilities;\n● implementing and enhancing administrative infrastructure, systems and processes; and\n● addressing new markets.\nWe intend to continue to hire a number of additional personnel, including design and manufacturing personnel and service technicians for our electric boats and powertrains.\nCompetition for individuals with experience designing, manufacturing and servicing electric boats is intense, and we may not be able to attract, assimilate, train or retain\nadditional highly qualified personnel in the future. The failure to attract, integrate, train, motivate and retain these additional employees could seriously harm our business and\nprospects\nThe loss of one or a few dealers could have a material adverse effect on us.\nA few dealers have in the past, and may in the future, account for a significant portion of our revenues in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. For\nexample, during the year ended December 31, 2023, one individual dealer had sales of over 10% of our total sales, and that one dealer represented 10% of total sales. During\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, one dealer represented 12% of our sales. The loss of business from a significant dealer could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend upon our executive officers and we may not be able to retain them and their knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be difficult to replace.\nOur future success will depend in significant part upon the continued service of our Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers. We cannot assure you that we will be\nable to continue to attract or retain such persons. We do not have an insurance policy on the life of our chief executive officer, and we do not have “key person” life insurance\npolicies for any of our other officers or advisors. The loss of the technical knowledge and management and industry expertise of any of our key personnel could result in delays\nin product development, loss of customers and sales and diversion of management resources, which could adversely affect our operating results.\n32\nCertain of our shareholders have sufficient voting power to make corporate governance decisions that could have a significant influence on us and the other stockholders.\nOur Chief Executive Officer owns 27.4% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, our Chief Executive Officer does and will have significant influence over our\nmanagement and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. In addition, this\nconcentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in our control and might affect the market price of our common stock, even when a change in control may be in the\nbest interest of all stockholders. Furthermore, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders.\nAccordingly, our Chief Executive Officer could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that we would not otherwise consider.\nWe may attempt to grow our business through acquisitions or strategic alliances and new partnerships, which we may not be successful in completing or integrating.\nWe may in the future enter into acquisitions and strategic alliances that will enable us to acquire complementary skills and capabilities, offer new products, expand our\nconsumer base, enter new product categories or geographic markets, and obtain other competitive advantages. We cannot assure you, however, that we will identify acquisition\ncandidates or strategic partners that are suitable to our business, obtain financing on satisfactory terms, complete acquisitions or strategic alliances, or successfully integrate\nacquired operations into our existing operations. Once integrated, acquired operations may not achieve anticipated levels of sales or profitability, or otherwise perform as\nexpected. Acquisitions also involve special risks, including risks associated with unanticipated challenges, liabilities and contingencies, and diversion of management attention\nand resources from our existing operations. Similarly, our partnership with leading franchises from other industries to market our products or with third-party technology\nproviders to introduce new technology to the market may not achieve anticipated levels of consumer enthusiasm and acceptance, or achieve anticipated levels of sales or\nprofitability, or otherwise perform as expected.\nWe rely on network and information systems and other technologies for our business activities and certain events, such as computer hackings, viruses or other destructive\nor disruptive software or activities may disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNetwork and information systems and other technologies are important to our business activities and operations. Network and information systems-related events, such as\ncomputer hackings, cyber threats, security breaches, viruses, or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns or malicious or other activities could result in a\ndisruption of our services and operations or improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information, which could damage our reputation and require us to expend\nresources to remedy any such breaches. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not\nbe sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our businesses that may result, and the occurrence of any such events or security\nbreaches could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The risk of these systems-related events and security breaches occurring has intensified,\nin part because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our businesses in digital form stored on cloud servers. While we develop and maintain systems seeking to\nprevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and\nupdating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite these efforts, there can be no assurance that disruptions and\nsecurity breaches will not occur in the future. Moreover, we may provide certain confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties in connection with our\nbusinesses, and while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information, there is a risk that this information may be compromised.\nMaintaining the secrecy of confidential, proprietary, or trade secret information is important to our competitive business position. While we have taken steps to protect such\ninformation and invested in information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches in our systems or the\nunauthorized or inadvertent wrongful use or disclosure of confidential information that could adversely affect our business operations or result in the loss, dissemination, or\nmisuse of critical or sensitive information. A cyber-attack or other significant disruption involving our information technology systems, or those of our vendors, suppliers and\nother partners,\n33\ncould also result in disruptions in critical systems, corruption or loss of data and theft of data, funds or intellectual property. A breach of our security measures or the accidental\nloss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination, misappropriation or misuse of trade secrets, proprietary information, or other confidential information, whether as a\nresult of theft, hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, or for any other reason, could enable others to produce competing products, use our proprietary technology\nor information, or adversely affect our business or financial condition. We may be unable to prevent outages or security breaches in our systems. We remain potentially\nvulnerable to additional known or yet unknown threats as, in some instances, we, our suppliers and our other partners may be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and\neffects. We also face the risk that we expose our vendors or partners to cybersecurity attacks. Any or all of the foregoing could adversely affect our results of operations and our\nbusiness reputation.\nLikewise, data privacy breaches by employees or others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to\nthe public. While we have invested in protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our\nsystems that could adversely affect our business. The occurrence of any of such network or information systems-related events or security breaches could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses,\nmalware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the internet, attachments to emails, persons inside\nour organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions,\nincluding by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber-terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and\nintrusions from around the world have increased. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our current\nor future product development programs. For example, the loss of any customer data could impact our ability to retain customers or attract new customers. To the extent that\nany disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could\nincur material legal claims and liability, damage to our reputation, and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology, and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including cybersecurity and data leakage risks.\nSignificant disruptions to our information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business. In the ordinary course of business, we\ncollect, store and transmit confidential information, and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential\ninformation. The size and complexity of our information technology systems, and those of our third-party vendors with whom we contract, make such systems potentially\nvulnerable to service interruptions and security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, partners or vendors, from attacks by malicious third parties,\nor from intentional or accidental physical damage to our systems infrastructure maintained by us or by third parties. Maintaining the secrecy of this confidential, proprietary, or\ntrade secret information is important to our competitive business position. While we have taken steps to protect such information and invested in information technology, there\ncan be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches in our systems or the unauthorized or inadvertent wrongful use or disclosure of\nconfidential information that could adversely affect our business operations or result in the loss, dissemination, or misuse of critical or sensitive information. A breach of our\nsecurity measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination, misappropriation or misuse of trade secrets, proprietary information, or other\nconfidential information, whether as a result of theft, hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, or for any other reason, could enable others to produce competing\nproducts, use our proprietary technology or information, or adversely affect our business or financial condition. Further, any such interruption, security breach, loss or\ndisclosure of confidential information, could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\nposition, results of operations or cash flow.\n34\nUninsured losses could result in payment of substantial damages, which would decrease our cash reserves and could harm our cash flow and financial condition.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to losses resulting from product liability, accidents, acts of God and other claims against us, for which we may have no\ninsurance coverage. While we currently carry commercial general liability, commercial boat liability, excess liability, product liability, cybersecurity, crime, special crime,\ndrone, cargo stock throughput, builder’s risk, owner controlled insurance program, property, owners protective, workers’ compensation, employment practices, employed\nlawyers, production, fiduciary liability and directors’ and officers’ insurance policies, we may not maintain as much insurance coverage as other original equipment\nmanufacturers do, and in some cases, we may not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we have may include significant deductibles, and we cannot be certain that\nour insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all or any future claims against us. A loss that is uninsured or exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts,\nwhich could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further, insurance coverage may not continue to be available to us or, if available, may be at a\nsignificantly higher cost, especially if insurance providers perceive any increase in our risk profile in the future.\nRisks Related to our Electric-Powered Boats\nForza’s planned fully electric sport boat has not yet been developed, and even if developed, interest in it may not develop.\nForza has not yet commercialized any boats. There can be no assurance that Forza will be able to complete development of the fully electric sport boat when anticipated, if at\nall, that we will be able to mass produce the fully electric sport boat or that the anticipated features or services to be included in the fully electric will create substantial interest\nor a market, and therefore Forza’s anticipated product, its sales and growth for our product may not develop as expected, or at all. For example, in May 2021 we experienced a\nsmall fire in connection with the sea trial of a prototype of our electric boat which resulted in a six-month delay in our design timetable as we implemented changes to the\ndesign for outboard electric motor system as a result of the fire. We cannot guarantee that similar events will not occur in the future, or that we will be able to contain such\nevents without damage or delay. Even if such a market for the fully electric sport boat develops, there can be no assurance that Forza would be able to maintain that market.\nForza’s operations to date have been primarily limited to finalizing the design and engineering of its electric sport boat as well as organizing and staffing Forza in preparation\nfor launching the fully electric boat. As such, Forza has not yet demonstrated, and the success of Forza is wholly dependent upon, its ability to commercialize its products. The\nsuccessful commercialization of any products will require us to perform a variety of functions, including:\n● completing the design and testing for the fully electric sport boat and our Forza’s proprietary outboard electric motor;\n● manufacturing the fully electric sport boats;\n● developing a vertically integrated direct-to-consumer distribution system; and\n● conducting sales and marketing activities.\nForza cannot be certain that its business strategy for its electric-powered boats will be successful or that we will successfully address these risks. In the event that we do not\nsuccessfully address these risks, our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and Forza may not have the\nresources to continue or expand the business operations of its electric-powered boats business.\nForza may be unable to adequately control the capital expenditures and costs associated with our business and operations.\nForza will require significant capital to develop and grow our business, including developing its first boat to be manufactured, as well as building its brand. Forza expects to\nmake additional capital expenditures and incur substantial costs as it completes the design and engineering of the fully electric sport boat and prepare to commercially launch\nsales of its boats and grow its business, including research and development expenses,\n35\nraw material procurement costs, sales and distribution expenses as we build our brand and market its boats and general and administrative expenses as Forza scales its\noperations, identifies and commits resources to investigate new areas of demand and incurs costs as a public company. Forza’s ability to become profitable in the future will not\nonly depend on its ability to complete the design and development of its boats but also to control its capital expenditures and costs. As Forza expands its product portfolio, it\nwill need to manage costs effectively to sell those products at our expected margins. If Forza is unable to cost efficiently design, manufacture, market, sell and distribute and\nservice its boats and provide its services, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected.\nForza’s planned distribution model is different from the predominant current distribution model for boat manufacturers, which subjects us to substantial risk and makes\nevaluating our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows difficult.\nForza’s distribution model is still in the planning stages. Forza currently plans to mainly sell its electric-powered boats directly to customers rather than through franchised\ndealerships (unless required to do so by certain states), primarily through the Forza X1 website and app platform, subject to obtaining applicable dealer licenses and equivalent\npermits in such jurisdictions. The digital customer experience via our online platform will allow customers to research, shop, choose boat hull color, interior upholstery color,\nand a possible upgrade of an additional battery to extend run times, order, track and take delivery through our web-based and app platform. Forza has not yet: (i) entered into\nany arrangements with third parties to provide financing services through Forza X1’s web and app platform, (ii) hired staff for our intended support and service department or\n(iii) partnered with any third parties to address service needs or operate service centers. Once the customer places the order, their Forza X1 account will request several\ndocuments, including license, insurance, etc., which can be uploaded online without ever speaking with a salesperson. If the customer has questions, concerns, or needs support\nthrough the sales and purchase process, they will be able to contact Forza X1 through the website or app with any questions or concerns.\nSince Forza’s planned sales and marketing platform is a newer way to shop, buy and take delivery of a new boat through a mostly virtual process, we are unable to predict or\nconclude precisely what the customer will experience. Forza intends to follow up customer transactions with review and quality control questionnaires to collect the data and\ncontinue to better our platform and how we interact with customers.\nIn addition to the Forza website and app platform, Forza also intends to establish Forza X1 customer experience and service centers to be operated as product showrooms and\nlocations where Forza X1 boats may be taken for service and warranty repairs. They will be located in jurisdictions where direct-to-consumer sales or manufacturer-owned\ndealerships are permissible and allow prospective customers to see our products in person before purchasing. Forza anticipates staffing these centers with well-trained Forza X1\nemployees. Forza will initially set up a single office, but if and as its grows, Forza plans to open additional customer experience and service centers to support our expansion,\nhelp bolster sales, and introduce its electric boat product to markets across the country that are more familiar purchasing boats at a traditional boat dealership.\nThis model of boat distribution is relatively new, different from the predominant current distribution model for boat manufacturers and, with limited exceptions, unproven,\nwhich subjects us to substantial risk. We and Forza have no experience in selling or leasing boats direct-to-consumer and therefore this model may require significant\nexpenditures and provide for slower expansion than the traditional dealer franchise system. For example, Forza will not be able to utilize long established relationships\ndeveloped by Twin Vee with its dealer network. Moreover, Forza will be competing with companies with well established distribution channels. Forza’s success will depend in\nlarge part on our its ability to effectively develop our its own sales channels and marketing strategies.\nImplementing a direct sales model is subject to numerous significant challenges, including obtaining permits and approvals from government authorities, and we may not be\nsuccessful in addressing these challenges. If Forza’s direct sales model does not develop as expected or develops more slowly than expected, it may be required to modify or\nabandon our sales model, which could materially and adversely affect its business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n36\nForza’s ability to generate meaningful product revenue from our electric-powered boats will depend on consumer adoption of electric boats.\nForza’s ability to generate meaningful product revenue from electric-powered boats will highly depend on sustained consumer demand for alternative fuel vehicles in general\nand electric boats in particular. If the market for electric boats does not develop as expected or develops more slowly than expected, or if there is a decrease in consumer\ndemand for electric vehicles, Forza’s business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed. The market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles\nis relatively new, rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, additional competitors, evolving government regulation (including\ngovernment incentives and subsidies) and industry standards, frequent new vehicle announcements and changing consumer demands and behaviors. Any number of changes in\nthe industry could negatively affect consumer demand for electric vehicles in general and Forza’s electric boats in particular.\nIn addition, demand for electric boats may be affected by factors directly impacting boat prices or the cost of purchasing and operating boats such as sales and financing\nincentives including tax credits, prices of raw materials and parts and components, cost of fuel, availability of consumer credit, and governmental regulations, including tariffs,\nimport regulation and other taxes. Volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales, which may result in downward price pressure and adversely affect Forza’s business,\nprospects, financial condition and results of operations. Further, sales of boats in the marine industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased\nvolatility, especially as Forza expands and adjust its operations and retail strategies. Specifically, it is uncertain how such macroeconomic factors will impact us as a new entrant\nin an industry that has globally been experiencing a recent decline in sales.\nOther factors that may influence the adoption of electric boats include:\n● perceptions about electric vehicle quality, safety, design, performance and cost;\n● perceptions about the limited range over which electric boats may be driven on a single battery charge;\n● perceptions about the total cost of ownership of electric boats, including the initial purchase price and operating and maintenance costs, both including and excluding\nthe effect of any government and other subsidies and incentives designed to promote the purchase of electric boats;\n● perceptions about the sustainability and environmental impact of electric boats, including with respect to both the sourcing and disposal of materials for electric\nvehicle batteries and the generation of electricity provided in the electric grid;\n● the availability of other alternative fuel boats;\n● improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine;\n● the quality and availability of service for electric boats;\n● volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline;\n● government regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy;\n● access to charging stations and cost to charge an electric vehicle and related infrastructure costs and standardization;\n● the availability of tax and other governmental incentives to purchase and operate electric boats or future regulation requiring increased use of nonpolluting boats; and\n● macroeconomic factors.\n37\nThe influence of any of the factors described above or any other factors may cause a general reduction in consumer demand for electric vehicles or Forza’s electric boats in\nparticular, either of which would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nForza depends upon third parties to manufacture and to supply key semiconductor chip components necessary for its electric boats. Forza does not have long-term\nagreements with any semiconductor chip manufacturers and suppliers, and if these manufacturers or suppliers become unwilling or unable to provide an adequate supply\nof semiconductor chips, with respect to which there is a global shortage, Forza would not be able to find alternative sources in a timely manner and Forza’s and our\nbusiness would be adversely impacted.\nSemiconductor chips are a vital input component to the electrical architecture of our electric boats, controlling wide aspects of the Forza boats’ operations. Many of the key\nsemiconductor chips Forza intends to use in its electric boats come from limited or single sources of supply, and therefore a disruption with any one manufacturer or supplier in\nour supply chain would have an adverse effect on our ability to effectively manufacture and timely deliver its boats. Forza does not have any long- term supply contracts with\nany suppliers and purchase chips on a purchase order basis. Due to its reliance on these semiconductor chips, Forza is subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in\ntheir supply. Forza in the process of identifying alternative manufacturers for semiconductor chips. Forza has in the past experienced, and may in the future experience,\nsemiconductor chip shortages, and the availability and cost of these components would be difficult to predict. For example, Forza’s manufacturers may experience temporary or\npermanent disruptions in their manufacturing operations due to equipment breakdowns, labor strikes or shortages, natural disasters, component or material shortages, cost\nincreases, acquisitions, insolvency, changes in legal or regulatory requirements, or other similar problems.\nIn particular, increased demand for semiconductor chips in 2020, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased demand for consumer electronics that use these chips,\nhas resulted in a continued global shortage of chips through 2022. As a result, Forza’s ability to source semiconductor chips to be used in our electric boats has been adversely\naffected. This shortage may result in increased chip delivery lead times, delays in the production of boats, and increased costs to source available semiconductor chips. To the\nextent this semiconductor chip shortage continues, and Forza is unable to mitigate the effects of this shortage, its ability to deliver sufficient quantities of its boats to fulfill its\npreorders and to support Forza’s growth through sales to new customers would be adversely affected. In addition, Forza may be required to incur additional costs and expenses\nin managing ongoing chip shortages, including additional research and development expenses, engineering design and development costs in the event that new suppliers must\nbe onboarded on an expedited basis. Further, ongoing delays in production and shipment of electric boats due to a continuing shortage of semiconductor chips may harm\nForza’s reputation and discourage additional preorders and boat sales, and otherwise materially and adversely affect Forza’s business and operations.\nThe electric boats will use lithium-ion battery cells, which, if not appropriately managed and controlled, have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame.\nThe battery packs within Forza’s electric boats are being designed to use of lithium-ion cells. If not properly managed or subject to environmental stresses, lithium-ion cells can\nrapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. While the battery pack is\ndesigned to contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, a field or testing failure of battery packs in our electric boats could occur, which\ncould result in bodily injury or death and could subject Forza to lawsuits, field actions (including product recalls), or redesign efforts, all of which would be time consuming\nand expensive and could harm Forza’s brand image. Also, negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of lithium-ion cells for boating applications, the social and\nenvironmental impacts of mineral mining or procurement associated with the constituents of lithium-ion cells, or any future incident involving lithium-ion cells, such as a\nvehicle or other fire, could materially and adversely affect Forza’s reputation and business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe electronic vehicle (EV) industry and its technology are rapidly evolving and may be subject to unforeseen changes which could adversely affect the demand for Forza’s\nboats or increase Forza’s operating costs.\n38\nForza may be unable to keep up with changes in EV technology or alternatives to electricity as a fuel source and, as a result, its competitiveness may suffer. Developments in\nalternative technologies, such as advanced diesel, hydrogen, ethanol, fuel cells, or compressed natural gas, or improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion\nengine or the cost of gasoline, may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we do not currently anticipate. Existing and other battery cell\ntechnologies, fuels or sources of energy may emerge as customers’ preferred alternative to Forza’s boats. Any failure by Forza to develop new or enhanced technologies or\nprocesses, or to react to changes in existing technologies, could materially delay its development and introduction of new and enhanced alternative fuel and EVs, which could\nresult in the loss of competitiveness of our electric boats, decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors. Forza’s research and development efforts may not be\nsufficient to adapt to changes in alternative fuel and electric vehicle technology. As technologies change, Forza plans to upgrade or adapt its electric boats with the latest\ntechnology. However, Forza’s electric boats may not compete effectively with alternative systems if Forza is not able to source and integrate the latest technology into its boats.\nAdditionally, the introduction and integration of new technologies into the electric boats may increase costs and capital expenditures required for the production and\nmanufacture of boats and, if Forza is unable to cost efficiently implement such technologies or adjust its manufacturing operations, its business, prospects, financial condition,\nresults of operations, and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected.\nForza may not be able to commence production of our electric boats as planned.\nForza currently plans to manufacture its electric boats at a new state of the art carbon neutral factory that we plan to build in McDowell County, North Carolina. Until it is able\nto expand our manufacturing capacity and build the planned manufacturing facility, it expects to continue to share Twin Vee’s current manufacturing facility, which has a\nlimited capacity and may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing needs. Although they have entered into a Transition Services Agreement with Twin Vee, the Transition\nServices Agreement does not provide for any dedicated manufacturing capacity for Forza. Our ability to utilize Twin Vee’s manufacturing capacity pending completion of its\nown facility will be subject to its availability as determined by Twin Vee and Twin Vee has no obligation to make any manufacturing capacity available to Forza under the\nTransition Services Agreement. As a result, its ability to produce any boats will be limited to the available capacity of the Twin Vee facility until our future manufacturing\nfacility is operational. If Twin Vee does not provide manufacturing capacity, it will not be able to produce its electric boats unless or until we lease or purchase facilities and\nequipment necessary for our production purposes. Any facility that it builds will require a significant capital investment and is expected to take at least one to two years to build\nand become fully operational. In addition, even if the construction of our planned facility is completed when anticipated, production at its facility could be delayed whether due\nto lack of equipment, workforce issues or other reasons. If Forza is unable to complete our own facility and commence production as planned, its business, prospects, financial\ncondition, results of operations, and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected and the value of your investment in its company may be materially adversely\naffected.\nForza may not receive the anticipated grant funding.\nOn July 28, 2022, Forza received notice that the North Carolina Economic investment committee has approved the JDIG providing for reimbursement to us of up to $1,367,100\nover a twelve-year period to establish a new manufacturing plant in McDowell County, North Carolina. The receipt of grant funding is conditioned upon us investing over\n$10.5 million in land, buildings and fixtures, infrastructure and machinery and equipment by the end of 2025 and us creating as many as 170 jobs.\nIf Forza’s electric boats fail to perform as expected, its ability to develop, market and sell or lease its products could be harmed.\nOnce commercialization commences, Forza’s electric boats may contain defects in design and manufacture that may cause them not to perform as expected or that may require\nrepairs, recalls, and design changes, any of which would require significant financial and other resources to successfully navigate and resolve. The boats will use a substantial\namount of software code to operate, and software products are inherently complex and may contain defects and errors when first introduced. If the boats contain defects in\ndesign and manufacture that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair, or certain features of the boats take longer than expected to become available, are\nlegally restricted or become subject to additional regulation, Forza’s ability to develop, market and sell its products and services could be harmed. Although Forza will attempt\nto remedy any issues it observes in its products as effectively and rapidly as possible, such efforts could significantly distract management’s attention from other important\nbusiness objectives,\n39\nmay not be timely, may hamper production or may not be to the satisfaction of its customers. Further, Forza’s limited operating history and limited field data reduces its ability\nto evaluate and predict the long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance characteristics of its battery packs, powertrains and boats. There can be no assurance that\nForza will be able to detect and fix any defects in its products prior to their sale or lease to customers.\nAny defects, delays or legal restrictions on boat features, or other failure of Forza’s boats to perform as expected, could harm its reputation and result in delivery delays, product\nrecalls, product liability claims, breach of warranty claims and significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of\noperations, prospects and financial condition. As a new entrant to the industry attempting to build customer relationships and earn trust, these effects could be significantly\ndetrimental to us. Additionally, problems and defects experienced by other electric consumer vehicles could by association have a negative impact on perception and customer\ndemand for Forza’s boats.\nIn addition, even if Forza’s boats function as designed, Forza expects that the battery efficiency, and hence the range, of its electric boats, like other electric vehicles that use\ncurrent battery technology, will decline over time. Other factors, such as usage, time and stress patterns, may also impact the battery’s ability to hold a charge, or could require\nForza to limit boat battery charging capacity, including via over-the-air or other software updates, for safety reasons or to protect battery capacity, which could further decrease\nthe boats’ range between charges. Such decreases in or limitations of battery capacity and therefore range, whether imposed by deterioration, software limitations or otherwise,\ncould also lead to consumer complaints or warranty claims, including claims that prior knowledge of such decreases or limitations would have affected consumers’ purchasing\ndecisions. Further, there can be no assurance that Forza will be able to improve the performance of its battery packs, or increase its boats range, in the future. Any such battery\ndeterioration or capacity limitations and related decreases in range may negatively influence potential customers’ willingness to purchase Forza boats and negatively impact its\nbrand and reputation, which could adversely affect Forza’s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nForza’s boats will rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and if these systems contain errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or design defects, or if Forza is\nunsuccessful in addressing or mitigating technical limitations in our systems, our business could be adversely affected.\nForza’s boats are expected to rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and complex and may require modification and updates over the life of the boats. In\naddition, the boats will depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store, retrieve, process and manage large amounts of data. Forza’s software and hardware may\ncontain errors, bugs, vulnerabilities or design defects, and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise its ability to meet its objectives. Some\nerrors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or design defects inherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use.\nAlthough Forza will attempt to remedy any issues it observes in its boats effectively and rapidly, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not be to the\nsatisfaction of its customers.\nAdditionally, if Forza deploys updates to the software (whether to address issues, deliver new features or make desired modifications) and its over-the-air update procedures fail\nto properly update the software or otherwise have unintended consequences to the software, the software within its customers’ boats will be subject to vulnerabilities or\nunintended consequences resulting from such failure of the over-the-air update until properly addressed.\nIf Forza is unable to prevent or effectively remedy errors, bugs, vulnerabilities or defects in its software and hardware, or fails to deploy updates to its software properly, it\nwould suffer damage to its reputation, loss of customers, loss of revenue or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial\ncondition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nForza’s patent applications may not issue as patents, which may have a material adverse effect on its ability to prevent others from commercially exploiting products\nsimilar to its products.\n40\nForza cannot be certain that it is the first inventor of the subject matter to which it has filed a particular patent application, or that it is the first party to file such a patent\napplication. If another party has filed a patent application for the same subject matter as it has, it may not be entitled to the protection sought by the patent application. Further,\nthe scope of protection of issued patent claims is often difficult to determine. As a result, we cannot be certain that the patent applications that Forza files will issue, or that our\nissued patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technology. In addition, its competitors may design around Forza’s issued patents, which may adversely\naffect its and our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe and Forza may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could harm our business and competitive position.\nWe and Forza may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could harm our and Forza’s business and competitive position. We\nand Forza rely on a combination of patent, trade secret (including those in our know-how), and other intellectual property laws, as well as employee and third-party\nnondisclosure agreements, intellectual property licenses, and other contractual rights to establish and protect rights in our technology and intellectual property. Our and Forza’s\npatent or trademark applications may not be granted, any patents or trademark registrations that may be issued to us may not sufficiently protect our and Forza’s intellectual\nproperty and any of our or Forza’s issued patents, trademark registrations or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by third parties. Any of these scenarios may\nresult in limitations in the scope of our or Forza’s intellectual property or restrictions on our or Forza’s use of our intellectual property or may adversely affect the conduct of\nour or Forza’s business. Despite our or Forza’s efforts to protect our or Forza’s intellectual property rights, third parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our or\nForza’s intellectual property or seek court declarations that they do not infringe upon our or Forza’s intellectual property rights. Monitoring unauthorized use of our or Forza’s\nintellectual property is difficult and costly, and the steps we and Forza have taken or will take to prevent misappropriation may not be successful. From time to time, we and\nForza may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources.\nPatent, trademark, and trade secret laws vary significantly throughout the world. A number of foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same\nextent as do the laws of the United States. Therefore, our and Forza’s intellectual property rights may not be as strong or as easily enforced outside of the United States.\nFailure to adequately protect our and Forza’s intellectual property rights could result in competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of\ncompetitive advantage and a decrease in our and Forza’s revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash\nflows.\nIf Forza’s patents expire or are not maintained, Forza’s patent applications are not granted or patent rights are contested, circumvented, invalidated or limited in scope, Forza\nmay not be able to prevent others from selling, developing or exploiting competing technologies or products, which could have a material adverse effect on its and our business,\nprospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nForza cannot assure that its pending applications will issue as patents. Even if its patent applications issue into patents, these patents may be contested, circumvented or\ninvalidated in the future. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with adequate protection or competitive advantages. The claims under any\npatents that issue from Forza’s patent applications may not be broad enough to prevent others from developing technologies that are similar or that achieve results similar to\nForza’s technology. The intellectual property rights of others could also bar Forza from licensing and exploiting any patents that issue from Forza’s pending applications.\nNumerous patents and pending patent applications owned by others exist in the fields in which Forza has developed and are developing its technology. Many of these existing\npatents and patent applications might have priority over its patent applications and could subject its patents to invalidation or its patent applications to rejection. Finally, in\naddition to patents and patent applications that were filed before its patents and patent applications, any of its existing or future patents may also be challenged by others on the\nbasis that they are invalid or unenforceable.\n41\nWe and Forza may in the future become, subject to claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our or Forza’s employees’\nformer employers.\nMany of our and Forza’s employees were previously employed by other companies with similar or related technology, products or services. We and Forza are, and may in the\nfuture become, subject to claims that we, they or these employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of former\nemployers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we or Forza fail to defend such claims, we or they may be forced to pay monetary damages or be\nenjoined from using certain technology, products, services or knowledge. Even if we or they are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in\nsubstantial costs and demand on management resources.\nOur and Forza’s use of open-source software in our applications could subject our proprietary software to general release, adversely affect our ability to sell our and\nForza’s services and subject us to possible litigation, claims or proceedings.\nWe and Forza plan to use open-source software in connection with the development and deployment of our and Forza’s products and services. Companies that use open-source\nsoftware in connection with their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the use of open-source software and/or compliance with open-source license terms.\nAs a result, we or Forza could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what are believed to be open-source software or claiming noncompliance with open- source\nlicensing terms. Some open-source software licenses may require users who distribute proprietary software containing or linked to open- source software to publicly disclose all\nor part of the source code to such proprietary software and/or make available any derivative works of the open-source code under the same open- source license, which could\ninclude proprietary source code. In such cases, the open- source software license may also restrict us or Forza from charging fees to licensees for their use of our or Forza’s\nsoftware. While we and Forza will monitor the use of open-source software and try to ensure that open-source software is not used in a manner that would subject our or\nForza’s proprietary source code to these requirements and restrictions, such use could inadvertently occur, in part because open-source license terms are often ambiguous and\nhave generally not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts.\nFurther, in addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open-source software carries greater technical and legal risks than does the use of third-party\ncommercial software. For example, open-source software is generally provided as-is without any support or warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement\nor the quality of the code, including the existence of security vulnerabilities. To the extent that our or Forza’s platformer the platform of our subsidiaries depends upon the\nsuccessful operation of open-source software, any undetected errors or defects in open-source software that we or Forza use could prevent the deployment or impair the\nfunctionality of our systems and injure our reputation. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for attackers to target and compromise our or\nForza’s platform through cyber-attacks. Any of the foregoing risks could materially and adversely affect our and Forza’s business, prospects, financial condition, results of\noperations, and cash flows.\nA significant portion of our and Forza’s intellectual property is not protected through patents or formal copyright registration. As a result, neither we nor Forza have the\nfull benefit of patent or copyright laws to prevent others from replicating our or Forza’s products, product candidates and brands.\nWe have not protected our intellectual property rights with respect to our gas-powered boats through patents or formal copyright registration, and we do not currently have any\npatent applications pending.\nThere can be no assurance that any patent will issue or if issued that the patent will protect our intellectual property. As a result, we may not be able to protect our intellectual\nproperty and trade secrets or prevent others from independently developing substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or from otherwise gaining access to\nour intellectual property or trade secrets. In such an instance, our competitors could produce products that are nearly identical to ours or Forza’s resulting in us selling less\nproducts or generating less revenue from our or Forza’s sales.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe and Forza rely on trade secrets, know-how and technology, which are not protected by patents, to protect the intellectual property behind our boats and the intellectual\nproperty behind Forza’s electric powertrain and for the construction of its boats. We and Forza have recently begun to use confidentiality agreements with our and its\ncollaborators, employees,\n42\nconsultants, outside collaborators and other advisors to protect its proprietary technology and processes. We and Forza intend to use such agreements in the future, but these\nagreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential\ninformation. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases we and Forza could not assert any trade secret rights\nagainst such party. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade\nsecret protection could adversely affect our or Forza’s competitive business position.\nWe and Forza may need to defend ourselves against patent, copyright or trademark infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and would cause us and Forza to\nincur substantial costs.\nThe status of the protection of our and Forza’s intellectual property is unsettled as we and Forza do not have any issued patents, registered trademarks or registered copyrights\nfor most of our and Forza’s intellectual property and other than three design, five utility and two full non-provisional patent applications, neither we nor Forza have applied for\nthe same. Companies, organizations or individuals, including our competitors, may hold or obtain patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit or\ninterfere with our or Forza’s ability to make, use, develop, sell or market our powerboats and electric powertrains or use third-party components, which could make it more\ndifficult for us or Forza to operate. From time to time, we or Forza may receive communications from third parties that allege our or Forza’s products or components thereof are\ncovered by their patents or trademarks or other intellectual property rights. Companies holding patents or other intellectual property rights may bring suits alleging infringement\nof such rights or otherwise assert their rights. If we or Forza are determined to have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights, we or Forza may be required to do\none or more of the following:\n● cease making, using, selling or offering to sell processes, goods or services that incorporate or use the third-party intellectual property;\n● pay substantial damages;\n● seek a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all;\n● redesign our boats or other goods or services to avoid infringing the third-party intellectual property;\n● establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services; or\n● find-third providers of any part or service that is the subject of the intellectual property claim.\nIn the event of a successful claim of infringement against us or Forza and our or Forza’s failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology or other intellectual\nproperty right, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, any litigation or claims, whether or not\nvalid, could result in substantial costs, negative publicity and diversion of resources and management attention.\nRisks Related to our Industry\nDemand in the powerboat industry is highly volatile.\nVolatility of demand in the powerboat industry, especially for recreational powerboats and electric powerboats, may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects,\noperating results and financial condition. The markets in which we will be competing have been subject to considerable volatility in demand in recent periods. Demand for\nrecreational powerboat and electric powerboat sales depends to a large extent on general, economic and social conditions in a given market. Historically, sales of recreational\npowerboats decrease during economic downturns. We have fewer financial resources than more established powerboat manufacturers to withstand adverse changes in the\nmarket and disruptions in demand.\n43\nGeneral economic conditions, particularly in the U.S., affect our industry, demand for our products and our business, and results of operations.\nDemand for premium boat brands has been significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, low consumer confidence, high unemployment, and increased market\nvolatility worldwide, especially in the U.S. In times of economic uncertainty and contraction, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and tend to defer or avoid\nexpenditures for discretionary items, such as our products. Sales of our products are highly sensitive to personal discretionary spending levels. Our business is cyclical in nature\nand its success is impacted by economic conditions, the overall level of consumer confidence and discretionary income levels. Any substantial deterioration in general\neconomic conditions that diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may reduce our sales and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations. We cannot predict the duration or strength of an economic recovery, either in the U.S. or in the specific markets where we sell our products. Corporate\nrestructurings, layoffs, declines in the value of investments and residential real estate, higher gas prices, higher interest rates, and increases in federal and state taxation may\neach materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nConsumers often finance purchases of our products. Although consumer credit markets have improved, consumer credit market conditions continue to influence demand,\nespecially for boats, and may continue to do so. There continue to be fewer lenders, tighter underwriting and loan approval criteria, and greater down payment requirements\nthan in the past. If credit conditions worsen, and adversely affect the ability of consumers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a\ndecrease in the sales of our products.\nGlobal economic conditions could materially adversely impact demand for our products and services.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on economic conditions. Global financial conditions continue to be subject to volatility arising from international\ngeopolitical developments and global economic phenomenon, as well as general financial market turbulence, including a significant recent market reaction to the novel\ncoronavirus (COVID-19), resulting in a significant reduction in many major market indices. Uncertainty about global economic conditions could result in material adverse\neffects on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Access to public financing and credit can be negatively affected by the effect of these events on U.S. and\nglobal credit markets. The health of the global financing and credit markets may affect our ability to obtain equity or debt financing in the future and the terms at which\nfinancing, or credit is available to us. These instances of volatility and market turmoil could adversely affect our operations and the trading price of our common shares\nresulting in:\n● customers postponing purchases of our products and services in response to tighter credit, unemployment, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset\nvalues and other macroeconomic factors, which could have a material negative effect on demand for our products and services; and\n● third-party suppliers being unable to produce parts and components for our products in the same quantity or on the same timeline or being unable to deliver such parts\nand components as quickly as before or subject to price fluctuations, which could have a material adverse effect on our production or the cost of such production.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock\nTerms of subsequent financings may adversely impact your investment.\nWe may have to engage in common equity, debt, or preferred stock financing in the future. Your rights and the value of your investment in our securities could be reduced.\nInterest on debt securities could increase costs and negatively impacts operating results. Preferred stock could be issued in series from time to time with such designation,\nrights, preferences, and limitations as needed to raise capital. The terms of preferred stock could be more advantageous to those investors than to the holders of common shares.\nIn addition, if we need to raise more equity capital from the sale of common shares, institutional or other investors may negotiate terms at least as, and possibly more, favorable\nthan the terms of your investment. Common shares which we sell could be sold into any market which develops, which could adversely affect the market price.\n44\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our company, or if they issue unfavorable commentary about us or our industry or downgrade our common\nstock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that third-party securities analysts publish about our company and our industry. We\nmay be unable or slow to attract research coverage and if one or more analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market. In addition, one or more\nof these analysts could downgrade our common stock or issue other negative commentary about our company or our industry. As a result of one or more of these factors, the\ntrading price of our common stock could decline.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company will require significant resources and management attention, which may divert from our business operations.\nAs a result of our initial public offering, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Exchange Act requires that we file\nannual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain\neffective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. As a result, we have and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not\npreviously incur.\nWe have identified weaknesses in our internal controls, and we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will be effectively remediated or that additional material\nweaknesses will not occur in the future.\nAs a public company, we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We expect that the requirements of these rules and\nregulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming and costly, and place significant\nstrain on our personnel, systems and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over financial reporting.\nWe do not yet have effective disclosure controls and procedures, or internal controls over all aspects of our financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our\ndisclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and in accordance with GAAP. Our management is responsible for establishing and\nmaintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. We will be required to expend time and resources to\nfurther improve our internal controls over financial reporting, including by expanding our staff. However, we cannot assure you that our internal control over financial\nreporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future.\nWe will be required to expend time and resources to further improve our internal controls over financial reporting, including by expanding our staff. However, we cannot assure\nyou that our internal control over financial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future.\nWe have not yet retained sufficient staff or engaged sufficient outside consultants with appropriate experience in GAAP presentation, especially of complex instruments, to\ndevise and implement effective disclosure controls and procedures, or internal controls. We will be required to expend time and resources hiring and engaging additional staff\nand outside consultants with the appropriate experience to remedy these weaknesses. We cannot assure you that management will be successful in locating and retaining\nappropriate candidates; that newly engaged staff or outside consultants will be successful in remedying material weaknesses thus far identified or identifying material\nweaknesses in the future; or that appropriate candidates will be located and retained prior to these deficiencies resulting in material and adverse effects on our business.\n45\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business, including increased complexity resulting\nfrom our international expansion. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to\ndevelop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our\nreporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting could also adversely affect the results of management reports and independent registered public accounting firm audits of our internal control over financial\nreporting that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures, and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the\nmarket price of our common stock.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is not required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until after we are no longer an\n“emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not\nsatisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and\ninternal control over financial reporting could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results and cause a decline in the market price of our common\nstock.\nOur failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as a public company\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business and share price.\nSection 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our management is\nrequired to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for such year. Additionally, once we are no longer an emerging growth company, as\ndefined by the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to attest to the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over\nfinancial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation.\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We are in the process of reviewing, documenting, and testing our internal control over financial\nreporting, but we are not currently in compliance with, and we cannot be certain when we will be able to implement, the requirements of Section 404(a). We may encounter\nproblems or delays in implementing any changes necessary to make a favorable assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we may encounter\nproblems or delays in completing the implementation of any public accounting firm after we cease to be an emerging growth company. If we cannot favorably assess the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our\ninternal controls after we cease to be an emerging growth company, investors could lose confidence in our financial information and the price of our common stock could\ndecline.\nAdditionally, the existence of the material weakness has required management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material\nweaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner. The\nexistence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our\nfinancial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business and share price.\nFor as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, including those relating to accounting\nstandards and disclosure about our executive compensation, that apply to other public companies.\n46\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain\nexemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, (i) not\nbeing required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive\ncompensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and (iii) exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and\nof stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We have elected to adopt these reduced disclosure requirements. We cannot predict if\ninvestors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions and as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our\ncommon stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe could remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years or until the earliest of (a) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed\n$1.235 billion, (b) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common\nstock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed fiscal quarter, and (c) the date on which we have issued more\nthan $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the preceding three-year period.\nWe are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in the Exchange Act, and have elected to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting\ncompanies. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company” as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, after we cease to qualify\nas an emerging growth company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an “emerging growth company” may continue to be available to us as a “smaller reporting\ncompany,” including exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements pursuant to SOX and reduced disclosure about our executive compensation\narrangements. We will continue to be a “smaller reporting company” until we have $250 million or more in public float (based on our common stock) measured as of the last\nbusiness day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or, in the event we have no public float (based on our common stock) or a public float (based on our common\nstock) that is less than $700 million, annual revenues of $100 million or more during the most recently completed fiscal year.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a de-listing of our common stock.\nThe shares of our Common Stock are listed for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “VEE.” If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The\nNasdaq Capital Market, such as the corporate governance requirements, the stockholder’s equity requirement, or the minimum closing bid price requirement, The Nasdaq\nCapital Market may take steps to de-list our Common Stock. Such a de-listing or even notification of failure to comply with such requirements would likely have a negative\neffect on the price of our Common Stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our Common Stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a de-listing, we would\ntake actions to restore our compliance with The Nasdaq Capital Market’s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow\nour Common Stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price, improve the liquidity of our Common Stock, prevent our Common Stock from dropping below The\nNasdaq Capital Market minimum bid price requirement, or prevent future non-compliance with The Nasdaq Capital Market’s listing requirements.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are\nreferred to as “covered securities.” Because our Common Stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, it is a covered security. Although the states are preempted from\nregulating the sale of covered securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent\nactivity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. Further, if we were to be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, our Common\nStock would cease to be recognized as a covered security and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past, has recently been volatile, and may be volatile in the future, and as a result, investors in our Common Stock could incur\nsubstantial losses.\n47\nInvestors should consider an investment in our Common Stock risky and invest only if they can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuations in the market value of their\ninvestment. Investors who purchase our Common Stock may not be able to sell their shares at or above the purchase price. Our stock price has been volatile and may be volatile\nin the future. The price of our common stock has experienced volatility. On January 20, 2023, the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq was $1.33 per share, on\nMarch 14, 2024, the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq was $1.12 per share It is possible that an active trading market will not continue or be sustained, which\ncould make it difficult for investors to sell their shares of our common stock at an attractive price or at all. The stock market in general has been, and the market price of our\nCommon Stock in particular, will likely be subject to fluctuation, whether due to, or irrespective of, our operating results and financial condition. The market price of our\nCommon Stock may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n● actual or anticipated variations in our and our competitors’ results of operations and financial condition;\n● market acceptance of our diagnostic tests and therapeutic products;\n● the mix of products that we sell and related services that we provide;\n● changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if our Common Stock is covered by analysts;\n● development of technological innovations or new competitive diagnostic tests or therapeutic products by others;\n● announcements of technological innovations or new diagnostic tests or therapeutic products by us;\n● our failure to achieve a publicly announced milestone;\n● delays between our expenditures to develop and market new or enhanced diagnostic tests or therapeutic products and the generation of sales from those diagnostic tests\nand therapeutic products;\n● developments concerning intellectual property rights, including our involvement in litigation;\n● our sale or proposed sale, or the sale by our significant shareholders, of our Common Stock or other securities in the future\n● changes in key personnel;\n● success or failure of our research and development projects or those of our competitors;\n● the trading volume of our Common Stock; and\n● general economic and market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance.\nThese factors and any corresponding price fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock and result in substantial losses being\nincurred by our investors. In the past, following periods of market volatility, public company shareholders have often instituted securities class action litigation. If we were\ninvolved in securities litigation, it could impose a substantial cost upon us and divert the resources and attention of our management from our business.\nOur Common Stock has often been thinly traded, so investors may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if investors need to sell shares to raise money or otherwise\ndesire to liquidate their shares.\nTo date, there have been many days on which limited trading of our Common Stock took place. We cannot predict the extent to which investors’ interests will lead to an active\ntrading market for our Common Stock or whether the market price of our Common Stock will be volatile. If an active trading market does not develop, investors may have\ndifficulty selling our Common Stock. We are likely to be too small to attract the interest of many brokerage firms and analysts. We cannot give investors any assurance that an\nactive public trading market for our Common Stock will develop or be sustained. The market price of our Common Stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to\nquarterly variations in our revenues and operating expenses, announcements of new products or services by us, significant sales of our Common Stock, including “short” sales,\nthe operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us, and news reports relating to trends in our markets or general economic\nconditions.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe presently have no intention to pay dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be\nmade at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition,\n48\ncash requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Furthermore, our ability to declare and pay dividends may be\nlimited by instruments governing future outstanding indebtedness we may incur.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may limit your ability to buy and sell our common shares, which could depress the price of our shares.\nFINRA rules require broker-dealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending that investment to the\ncustomer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about\nthe customer’s financial status, tax status and investment objectives, among other things. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability\nsuch speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, FINRA requirements may make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend\nthat their customers buy our common shares, which may limit an investor’s ability to buy and sell our shares, have an adverse effect on the market for our shares and, thereby,\ndepress their market prices.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more\ndifficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that stockholders may\nconsider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be\nwilling to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible\nfor appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management\nby making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things included in these provisions:\n● our board of directors is divided into three classes, one class of which is elected each year by our stockholders with the directors in each class to serve for a three-year\nterm;\n● the authorized number of directors can be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n● directors may be removed only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of our voting stock, whether for cause or without cause;\n● our bylaws may be amended or repealed by our board of directors or by the affirmative vote of sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of our stockholders;\n● stockholders may not call special meetings of the stockholders or fill vacancies on the board of directors;\n● our board of directors will be authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock, the rights of which will be determined at the discretion of the board of\ndirectors and that, if issued, could operate as a ”poison pill” to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that our board of\ndirectors does not approve;\n● our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights, and therefore our stockholders holding a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding will be able to\nelect all of our directors; and\n● our stockholders must comply with advance notice provisions to bring business before or nominate directors for election at a stockholder meeting.\n49\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person\nwho owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person\nacquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain types of state actions that may be\ninitiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum\nfor (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other\nemployees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws (as either may be amended\nfrom time to time), or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce any\nliability or duty created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. To the extent that any such claims\nmay be based upon federal law claims, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the\nExchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits\nbrought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThese exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, employees,\ncontrol persons, underwriters, or agents, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, employees, control persons, underwriters, or agents. Additionally, a court\ncould determine that the exclusive forum provision is unenforceable, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws\nand the rules and regulations thereunder. If a court were to find these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types\nof actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity.\nWe maintain a cyber risk management protocol designed to identify, assess, manage, mitigate, and respond to cybersecurity threats.\nThe underlying processes and controls of our cyber risk management protocol incorporate recognized best practices and standards for cybersecurity and information\ntechnology, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework (“CSF”). We have undertaken, on an annual basis, to conduct an\nassessment of our cyber risk management processes and controls to identify, quantify, and categorize material cyber risks. In addition, we have developed a risk mitigation plan\nto address such risks, and where necessary, remediate potential vulnerabilities identified through the annual assessment process.\nIn addition, we maintain policies over areas such as information security, access on/offboarding, and access and account management, to help govern the processes put in place\nby management designed to protect our IT assets, data, and services from threats and vulnerabilities. We consult with a third-party specialist with regard to our cyber risk\nmanagement processes and controls.\n50\nOur management team is responsible for oversight and administration of our cyber risk management protocol, and for informing senior management and other relevant\nstakeholders regarding the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. Our Audit Committee also provides oversight of risks from\ncybersecurity threats.\nAs part of its review of the adequacy of our system of internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, the Audit Committee is specifically\nresponsible for reviewing the adequacy of our computerized information system controls and security related thereof. The cybersecurity stakeholders, including member(s) of\nmanagement assigned with cybersecurity oversight responsibility and/or third-party consultants providing cyber risk services, brief the Audit Committee on cyber\nvulnerabilities identified through the risk management process, the effectiveness of our cyber risk management program, and the emerging threat landscape and new cyber risks\non at least an annual basis. This includes updates on Forza’s processes to prevent, detect, and mitigate cybersecurity incidents. In addition, cybersecurity risks are reviewed by\nour Board of Directors at least annually, as part of the Company’s corporate risk oversight processes.\nWe face risks from cybersecurity threats that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reputation. We\nacknowledge that the risk of cyber incidents is prevalent in the current threat landscape and that a future cyber incident may occur in the normal course of its business. To date,\nwe have not had a cybersecurity incident. We proactively seek to detect and investigate unauthorized attempts and attacks against our IT assets, data, and services, and to\nprevent their occurrence and recurrence where practicable through changes or updates to internal processes and tools and changes or updates to service delivery; however,\npotential vulnerabilities to known or unknown threats will remain. Further, there is increasing regulation regarding responses to cybersecurity incidents, including reporting to\nregulators, investors, and additional stakeholders, which could subject us to additional liability and reputational harm. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information on\ncybersecurity risks.\nItem 2. Properties.\nThe Company leases its office and production facilities, and the land which are located at 3101 S US-1, Fort Pierce, Florida from Visconti Holdings, LLC. Visconti Holdings,\nLLC is a single member LLC that holds the ownership of the property, and its sole member is Joseph C Visconti, our CEO. We entered into the lease on January 1, 2020, and as\namended January 1, 2021, the lease has a term of five years. The current base rent payment is $31,500 per month including property taxes and the lease required a\n$25,000 security deposit. The base rent will increase five percent (5%) on the anniversary of each annual term. We have engaged in several building improvement projects\nduring the last year.\nForza currently shares our corporate headquarters.\nOn July 28, 2022, Forza received notice that the North Carolina Economic investment committee has approved a Job Development Investment Grant (“JDIG”) providing for\nreimbursement of up to $1,367,100 over a twelve-year period to establish a new manufacturing plant in McDowell County, North Carolina. The receipt of grant funding is\nconditioned upon us investing over $10.5 million in land, buildings and fixtures, infrastructure and machinery and equipment by the end of 2025 and Forza creating as many as\n170 jobs.\nIn October of 2022, Forza signed a two-year lease agreement, on a warehouse facility to begin building out our prototype engines. The monthly base rent will be $7,517 the first\nyear, including taxes and common area maintenance, the lease required a $7,517 security deposit. The bases rent will increase three (3%) on the anniversary of the annual term.\nWhile Forza believe these headquarters and the leased facility are adequate for current operational needs, Forza does believe that the capacity at the facility will not be\nsufficient to support both Twin Vee’s full-scale production and our full-scale production.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal\nproceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or\ncash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other\nfactors.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable\n51\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket Information\nOur common stock has traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol “VEEE” since July 21, 2021. The last price of our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq\nCapital Market LLC on March 20, 2024 was $1.23 per share.\nStockholders\nWe have two classes of stock, undesignated preferred stock and $0.001 par value common stock. No shares of preferred stock have been issued or are outstanding. As of March\n27, 2024, we had 278 common stock stockholders of record. The number of holders of record is based on the actual number of holders registered on the books of our transfer\nagent and does not reflect holders of shares in “street name” or persons, partnerships, associations, corporations or other entities identified in security position listings\nmaintained by depository trust companies.\nOn May 13, 2021, the Company effected a forty thousand (40,000)-for-one stock split to the shareholders of record as of May 13, 2021. The stock split was in the form of a\ncommon stock dividend of 3,999,900 new shares and all share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.\nDividend Policy\nWe did not pay a cash dividend during the 2023 or 2022 fiscal years. We presently intend to retain our earnings, if any, to finance the development and growth of our business\nand operations and do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the declaration and\npayment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our operating results, financial condition,\ncontractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Interwest Transfer Company, Inc. (also known as Direct Transfer LLC).\nPerformance Graph and Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information required under this item.\nUse of Proceeds\nOn July 23, 2021, we closed our initial public offering pursuant to which we offered and sold 3,000,000 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $6.00 per share (for\naggregate gross proceeds of $18,000,000), pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-1 (as amended) (File No. 333-255134), which was declared effective by the SEC\non July 20, 2021, as amended by the Registration Statement on Form S-1 MEF (File No. 333-258058) filed with the SEC on July 20, 2021 and effective as of the date of filing.\nAfter deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $1,260,000, and other offering expenses payable by us of approximately $1,567,150, we received\napproximately $15,849,037 in net proceeds from our initial public offering. ThinkEquity LLC acted as the representative of the several underwriters for the offering. We also\ngranted a 45-day option to the representative of the underwriters to purchase up to 450,000 additional shares of common stock solely to cover over-allotments, if any, which\nexpired unexercised.\n52\nAt the time of the initial public offering, the primary use of the net proceeds was as follows: (i) approximately $1,500,000 for production and marketing of our larger fully\nequipped boats.; (ii) approximately $2,500,000 for the design, development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of our new line of electric boats; (iii) approximately\n$6,000,000 for the design, development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of our fully electric propulsion system; (iv) approximately $3,500,000 for acquisition of\nwaterfront property and development of the Electra Power Sports- EV Innovation & Testing Center, in Fort Pierce, Florida to build, design and manufacture our electric\npropulsion systems; and (v) the balance for working capital.\nIt was originally anticipated that we would retrofit a gas-powered boat with an electric motor that would be designed by us and that we would also sell the motors to other third-\nparty boat manufacturers to retrofit their boats. The retrofitting would require extensive development, testing and manufacturing of multiple variations of electric motors.\nHowever, consumer preference in the electric marine market was and is trending towards a single purchase of a fully integrated electric boat rather than a retrofitted existing gas\nand diesel fuel powered boat with electric outboard motors and battery packs. Therefore, we decided not to continue designing electric motors for retrofitting, resulting in us no\nlonger needing any funding for the design, development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of our fully electric propulsion system and instead those funds are anticipated to\nbe used for working capital needs.\nFurther, we originally anticipated that we would acquire waterfront property for a testing center in Fort Pierce, the price of real estate in Florida has prohibited us from moving\nforward. Therefore, we decided to use the $3,500,000 of funds to build additional manufacturing space at our Fort Pierce location.\nThe remaining planned use of proceeds has not changed since the initial public offering.\nRecent Sale of Unregistered Securities\nWe did not sell any equity securities during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 in transactions that were not registered under the Securities Act other than as\ndisclosed in our filings with the SEC.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThere were no issuer purchases of equity securities during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\nTwin Vee\nOn April 8, 2021, our board of directors and our stockholders approved the Twin Vee PowerCats Co. 2021 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated on June 1, 2021 (the\n“2021 Plan”).

[Reserved].\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion, which focuses on our results of operations, contains forward-looking information and statements. Actual events or results may differ materially from\nthose indicated or anticipated, as discussed in the section entitled “Forward Looking Statements.” The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations\nshould also be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes to financial statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCompany Overview\nWe are a designer, manufacturer and marketer of recreational and commercial power catamaran boats. We believe our company has been an innovator in the recreational and\ncommercial power catamaran industry. We currently have 19 gas-powered models in production ranging in size from our 22-foot monohull to our newly designed 40-foot\noffshore 400 GFX. Our twin-hull catamaran running surface, known as a symmetrical catamaran hull design, adds to the Twin Vee ride quality by reducing drag, increasing fuel\nefficiency, and offering users a stable riding boat. We have additionally, launched the AquaSport line of monohull boats which are expected to appeal to first-time boat buyers,\n54\nthe freshwater market, and consumers that prefer a monohull boat, increasing our potential customer base across the nation and moving us outside on the niche catamaran\nmarket. Twin Vee’s home base operations in Fort Pierce Florida is a 7.5-acre facility with several buildings totaling over 75,000 square feet. We currently employe\napproximately 90 employees.\nWe have organized our business into three operating segments: (i) our gas-powered boat segment which manufactures and distributes gas-powered boats; (ii) our electric-\npowered boat segment which is developing fully electric boats, through our controlling interest subsidiary, Forza and (iii) our franchise segment which is developing a standard\nproduct offering and will be selling franchises across the United States through our wholly owned subsidiary, Fix My Boat, Inc., a Delaware corporation.\nOur gas-powered boats allow consumers to use them for a wide range of recreational activities including fishing, diving and water skiing and commercial activities including\ntransportation, eco tours, fishing and diving expeditions. We believe that the performance, quality and value of our boats position us to achieve our goal of increasing our\nmarket share and expanding the power catamaran boating market. We currently primarily sell our boats through a current network of 43 independent boat dealers in locations\nacross North America and the Caribbean who resell our boats to the end user Twin Vee customers. We continue recruiting efforts for high quality boat dealers and seek to\nestablish new dealers and distributors domestically and internationally to distribute our boats as we grow our production and introduce new models. Our gas-powered boats are\ncurrently outfitted with gas-powered outboard combustion engines.\nDue to the growing demand for sustainable, environmentally friendly electric and alternative fuel commercial and recreational vehicles, Forza, is designing and developing a\nline of electric-powered boats. Forza’s electric boats are being designed as fully integrated electric boats including the hull, outboard motor and control system. To date, Forza\nX1 has built-out and tested multiple Forza company units, including: three offshore-style catamarans, two bay boat-style catamarans, one deck boat and three 22-foot center\nconsole (F22) monohulls. In addition, Forza has also electrified a pontoon boat for a major national pontoon manufacturer. Forza is in the process of an additional pontoon\nelectrification project and are building an additional five monohulls. Each build cycle includes improvements and involves extensive duration and performance testing. The\nengine design and lower units and the control systems are continuously improved with each iteration. Cooling system improvements have also been prioritized and have yielded\na myriad of benefits to runtime, speed, and range. Forza continues to iterate the engine design, including value engineering of parts and lightweighting of engine components.\nForza is experimenting with our first 300 HP stacked motor design. Forza is uncertain as to when it will obtain revenues from the sale of these fully integrated electric boats.\nForza will continue to build and test prototype engines and boats for the next six to nine months.\nDuring the year ended December31, 2023, we saw a small increase in revenue. Our Company’s objectives have been to add new, larger boat models to our GFX lineup, expand\nour dealers and distribution network, and increase unit production to fulfill our customer and dealer orders. The average selling price of our units did decrease by 16%, for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, to approximately $137,692. This is due to the inclusion of our monohull boats which have an average selling price of approximately $62,000\nper unit. The addition of the monohull boat accounted for 18% of our total sales for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nRecent Developments\nOn April 20, 2023 we incorporated AquaSport Co., a wholly owned subsidiary, in the state of Florida in connection with our plan to lease the AQUASPORT™ boat brand and\nmanufacturing facility in White Bluff, TN. On May 5, 2023, we and AquaSport Co. entered into an agreement with Ebbtide Corporation (“Ebbtide”) providing AquaSport Co.\nwith the right to acquire assets, AQUASPORT™ boat brand, trademarks, 150,000-square-foot manufacturing facility situated on 18.5 acres in White Bluff, TN, related tooling,\nmolds, and equipment to build five AquaSport models ranging in size from 21 to 25-foot boats (the “AquaSport Assets”).\nUnder the agreement, AquaSport Co. has the right to purchase the AquaSport assets from Ebbtide for $3,100,000 during the five-year term of the Agreement (or extension\nperiod), less credit for a $300,000 security deposit paid by us and $16,000 a month for any rent paid under the Agreement by AquaSport Co. to Ebbtide. AquaSport Co. will\nlease the AquaSport assets from Ebbtide under the agreement at a monthly rent of $22,000 pending AquaSport Co.’s acquisition of the AquaSport assets. The lease is for a term\nof five years, commencing June 1, 2023, with one option to renew the lease for an additional five years.\n55\nThe White Bluff, TN, AquaSport facility was opened to produce the AquaSport legacy line of monohull boats. While there was interest in the legacy models, we’ve seen light\ndemand for these models from our dealer network and customers. We’ve seen much higher demand for the newly designed AquaSport models currently manufactured in our\nFort Pierce, FL, facility.\nLower demand for these legacy models, coupled with the current economic headwinds in the boating industry, led us to close the Tennessee facility in November 2023, and to\nconsolidate its manufacturing operations in our Florida facility. We remain dedicated to the AquaSport brand and will continue to design and produce new models, including the\n240 CC which is now available for sale, and the 280 CC, which will be available over the next quarter.\nIn late December 2023, One Water informed us that they were going to discontinue some of their relationships with manufactures, and Twin Vee was one of those relationships.\nWe have found that One Water struggled to achieve sales of our Twin Vee production line due to their unfamiliarity with powered catamarans. We continue to work with\nOneWater to help them connect and sell units to end users. We have also started working with dealers that are experienced with our products and have proven to be successful\nin understanding the benefits of our products and how to achieve sales.\nFinancial Condition\nWe finished the year with revenue up 4% over the prior year. Our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities were $21 million at December 31, 2023. Our\nproperty, plant, and equipment along with prepaid expenses went up notably, as we have invested in additional boat molds for new model, equipment to support our increased\nproduction levels, and leasehold improvements to improve the quality of our products.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe following table provides certain selected financial information for the years presented:\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022 $ Change % Change\nNet sales $ 33,425,912 $ 31,987,724 $ 1,438,188 4%\nCost of products sold $ 23,702,885 $ 21,330,918 $ 2,371,967 11%\nGross profit $ 9,723,027 $ 10,656,806 $ (933,779) (9%)\nOperating expenses $ 21,710,326 $ 16,678,514 $ 5,031,812 30%\nLoss from operations $ (11,987,299) $ (6,021,708) $ (5,965,591) 99%\nOther income $ (2,205,103) $ (228,294) $ (1,976,809) 866%\nNet loss $ (9,782,196) $ (5,793,414) $ (3,988,782) 69%\nBasic and dilutive income per share of\ncommon stock $ (0.76) $ (0.67) $ (0.10) 15%\nWeighted average number of shares of\ncommon stock outstanding 9,520,000 7,624,938\nNet Sales and Cost Sales\nOur net sales increased $1,438,187, or 4% to $33,425,911 for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $31,987,724 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The number of boats\nsold during fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 increased 21% over the number of our boats sold during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. However, our average cost\nper unit decreased approximately $26,000. In 2023, we introduced our monohull line of boats. These are low-cost entry-level boats, in a very competitive sector. We believe\nthat adding a full line up of monohull boats will allow us to continue to increase our net sales year over year. In 2023, 40% of our sales or approximately $6,000,000, were\nattributed to our 220 monohull,\nGross Profit\nGross profits decreased by $933,779, or 9% to $9,723,027 for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $10,656,806 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Gross profit as a\npercentage of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was 29% and 33% respectively. We attribute the 4% decline in gross profit percentage to decreased\ndemand in the marine sector.\n56\nTotal Operating Expenses\nOur total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $21,710,326 and $16,678,514 respectively. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales\nwere 65% compared to 52% in the prior year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 35%, or $974,781 to $3,734,406 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $2,759,625 for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022. Our advertising and marketing expenses increased 296%, from $112,319 for the year ended December 31, 2022, to $331,911 for the year\nended December 31, 2023. This is due to increased expenses associated with our new AquaSport line and the Forza Electrafication event. Our rent expense increased 31%, or\n$134,456 to $567,602 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was due to Forza Tech Center being rent for a full year compared to only 3 months in 2022, resulting\nin an increase of $118,900; along with a 5% increase for our rent in Fort Pierce. Hiring expense increased $77,889, due to Forza utilizing Recruiting firs to hire two Engineers.\nFiling fee and investor relations fees increased $85,286, due to Forza being public for an entire year in 2023, compared to only a partial year in 2022. Dues and subscriptions\nincreased $163,812 for the year ended December 31, 2023, this is due to subscriptions related to our new ERP system, training and safety, marketing related subscriptions,\noption tracking and engineering related subscriptions. Expenses related to travel increased by $202,619, for the year ended December 31, 2023, this was due to required travel\nfor staff to go to our three different facilities as well as international travel related to Forza. We also saw an increase of $60,341 for the year ended December 31, 2023, for our\nworkers compensation expense due to our increased employment levels. Numerous other items make up the remaining increase approximately $24,000 of increased selling,\ngeneral and administrative expense increase.\nSalaries and wage related expenses increased by approximately 22%, or $2,472,011 to $13,929,580 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $11,457,569 for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022. The increase in salaries and wages of $1,458,260 was the result of aggressively ramping up of production, which required increasing our\nproduction and adding mid-level staff. Included in salaries and wages for the year ended December 31, 2023 was a non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $1,902,749,\nwhich was an increase of $453,997 from the prior year, due to the issuance of options to employees. We have also incurred production and executive bonus expense increase of\n$42,300 for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our cost of benefits, primarily health insurance, holiday pay and 401K, increased by approximately $178,996, due to our\nincrease in headcount. Expenses for board fees increased by $60,375 in 2023, during the year ended December 31, 2022 we only incurred board fees for a portion of the year\nfor Forza. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, we incurred $123,048 and $0 in commission expense. The remaining increase of salaries and\nwages during the year ended December 31, 2021 was associated with payroll taxes and benefits.\nProfessional fees increased by 29%, or $283,351 to $1,249,388 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $966,037 for the year ended 2022. Professional fees related\nto Forza increased $194,692 for the year ended December 31, 2023, as we carried the costs of audit and legal fees of a public organization for an entire year compared to only a\npartial year in 2022. The remaining increase was due to consulting services to install and manage our new ERP system.\nDepreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by 144%, or $799,633 to $1,353,383 for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $553,750 in\nDecember 31, 2022. Since our IPO in 2021 we have made significant investments in equipment, leasehold improvements and boat molds that resulted in an increased our\ndepreciation expense.\nResearch and design expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $1,443,569 compared to $941,533, for the year ended December 31, 2022. These expenses are\nassociated with our development of our electric propulsion system for Forza.\nOther income increased by 866%, or $1,976,809 to $2,205,103 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $228,294 for the year ended, 2022. The increase in other\nincome is primarily the result of $1,267,055 in Employee Retention Credit income. We incurred an increase in net gain in fair value of our marketable securities of $191,722,\ncompared to a net loss in fair value of our marketable securities of $133,988 in 2022, due to improved financial market. Additionally, we recorded $909,215 in dividend income\nduring 2023, compared to $0, in 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023 we did see an increase in interest expense of $57,002.\n57\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $9,479,511, compared to $5,793,414 for the year ended December 31, 2022. We have spent much of the last two year\nassembling the tools and people necessary to increase production levels. While our revenue levels increased, our expenses also increased. Toward the end of 2023, market\ncondition worsened, forcing us to close the Tennessee facility and consolidate operation in Fort Pierce. That coupled with the additional expenses associated with being a public\ncompany and our research and development efforts for our electric boat division, resulted in a net loss for 2023. With these investments, we are building the foundation for our\nfuture, not only for our gas powered boats, but also for our electric boat division. We have decreased our head count significantly and work to right size the business for the\ncurrent state of the economy, while keep our core strengths intact. Basic and dilutive loss per share of common stock increased for the year ended December 31, 2023 to ($0.76)\ncompared to ($0.67) for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nA primary source of funds for the year ended December 31, 2023 was net cash received from our secondary offering, as well as Forza’s initial public and secondary offering\nand revenue generated from operations. Our primary use of cash was related to funding the expansion of our operations through capital improvements, adding staff, and\nincreasing inventory levels. Our priority over the next several months is to minimize new purchase orders and to deploy as much of this inventory as possible into new\nproduction.\nThe following table provide selected financial data about us as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 16,755,233 $ 23,501,007\nMarketable securities $ 4,462,942 $ 2,927,518\nCurrent assets $ 26,646,318 $ 29,887,529\nCurrent liabilities $ 4,216,345 $ 3,791,063\nWorking capital $ 22,429,973 $ 26,096,466\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet ongoing expenses for at least twelve months from the date of the filing of this Annual Report. As\nof December 31, 2023, we had $21,218,175 of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities, total current assets of $26,646,318, and total assets of\n$39,846,713. Our total liabilities were $7,797,098. Our total liabilities were comprised of current liabilities of $4,216,345 which included accounts payable and accrued\nliabilities of $3,474,538, contract liability of $44,195, finance lease liability of $214,715 and current portion of operating lease right of use liability of $482,897, and long-term\nliabilities of $3,580,753. As of December 31, 2022, we had $23,501,007 of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, marketable securities of $2,927,518, total current assets\nof $29,887,529 and total assets of $38,231,480. Our total current liabilities were $3,791,063 and total liabilities of $5,210,591 which included long-term operating lease\nliabilities for the lease of our facility.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents will provide sufficient resources to finance operations for the next 12 months. In addition to cash, cash equivalents, restricted\ncash and marketable securities, we anticipate that we will be able to rely, in part, on cash flows from operations in order to meet our liquidity and capital expenditure needs in\nthe next year. We do anticipate Forza’s expenses to increase during the next year as it constructs its planned manufacturing facility in McDowell, North Carolina, the cost of\nwhich we expect will be paid for through the proceeds of Forza’s initial public offering, its secondary offering and certain grant funding, provided the conditions to receipt of\nthe grant funding are met, of which there can be no assurance.\n58\nCash Flow\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022 Change % Change\nCash used in operating activities $ (6,934,773) $ (4,146,031) (2,788,742) (67%)\nCash used in investing activities $ (6,629,021) $ (195,605) 6,433,416 3,289%\nCash provided by financing activities $ 6,818,020 $ 20,867,340 (14,049,320) (67%)\nCash at end of year $ 16,755,233 $ 23,501,007 (6,745,774) (29%)\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash flows used in operating activities was $6,934,773 compared to $4,146,030 during the year ended December 31, 2022. We have\nincreased inventory levels by $1,296,045, due to having three different manufactures for engines and to bringing inventory in for the Tennessee facility, and due to our\nincreased product offerings. Our net loss was $9,782,196, was decreased by non-cash expenses of approximately $4,062,597 primarily due to stock-based compensation of\n$1,902,749, depreciation of $1,353,383, change of right-of-use asset and lease liabilities of $474,630, change in inventory reserve of $419,616 and net change in fair value of\nmarketable securities of $87,781. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our accounts payable increased $333,346, due to our increase in inventory, prepaid expenses and other\ncurrent assets decreases by $419,195, due to not being required to prepay for incoming engines, as we were in 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our operating lease\nliabilities decreased $479,315 and our accrued liabilities decreased by $165,257. Contract liabilities increased by $38,895. Accounts receivable increased by $65,993.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we used $6,629,021 for investment activities, compared to $195,605 used during the year ended December 31, 2022. We increased\nour property and equipment by $5,162,478, we invested in marketable securities of $1,343,702 and we realized a gain on the sale of marketable securities, available for sale of\n$103,941. The majority of the property and equipment purchased were molds for our boat production, for AquaSport and Twin Vee, investing and additional $3,593,709. We\nfurther spent $1,119,758 on the land in Tennessee and in North Carolina. We also spent approximately $714,991 on machinery and equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $6,818,021 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of\n$20,867,340 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The cash flow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 included proceeds of $6,996,015 and\ndeferred offering cost of $66,463 from a follow on underwritten public offering for Forza in June 2023. Additional cash used for financing activities of $90,153 was related to\nequipment financing, and $21,379 was used for a Forza buy back of stock. The cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31,2022, included\n$20,936,825 in net proceeds from the Forza offering.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nWe believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance. We refer to these policies as “critical” because these specific\nareas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate, and different estimates—which also would have\nbeen reasonable—could have been used, which would have resulted in different financial results.\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and\nmake various assumptions,\n59\nwhich management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, which form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily\napparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe notes to our consolidated financial statements contained herein contain a summary of our significant accounting policies. We consider the following accounting policies\ncritical to the understanding of the results of our operations:\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company accounts for revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606 which was\nadopted at the beginning of fiscal year 2018 using the modified retrospective method. The Company did not recognize any cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings\nupon adoption as the effect was immaterial.\nPayment received for the future sale of a boat to a customer is recognized as a customer deposit, which is included in contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nCustomer deposits are recognized as revenue when control over promised goods is transferred to the customer.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States “U.S. GAAP” requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Included in those estimates are assumptions about\nallowances for inventory obsolescence, useful life of fixed assets, warranty reserves and bad-debt reserves.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Net realizable value is defined as sales price less cost of completion,\ndisposable and transportation and a normal profit margin. Production costs, consisting of labor and overhead, are applied to ending finished goods inventories at a rate based on\nestimated production capacity. Excess production costs are charged to cost of products sold. Provisions have been made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their net\nrealizable value.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nManagement assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets when indicators of impairment are present. If such indicators are present, the recoverability of these assets is\ndetermined by comparing the undiscounted net cash flows estimated to result from those assets over the remaining life to the assets’ net carrying amounts. If the estimated\nundiscounted net cash flows are less than the net carrying amount, the assets would be adjusted to their fair value, based on appraisal or the present value of the undiscounted\nnet cash flows.\nProduct Warranty Costs\nAs required by FASB ASC Topic 460, Guarantees, the Company is including the following disclosure applicable to its product warranties.\nThe Company accrues for warranty costs based on the expected material and labor costs to provide warranty replacement products. The methodology used in determining the\nliability for warranty cost is based upon historical information and experience. The Company’s warranty reserve is calculated as the gross sales multiplied by the historical\nwarranty expense return rate.\n60\nLeases\nThe Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (“Topic 842”), using the modified retrospective adoption method with an effective\ndate of January 1, 2019. This standard requires all lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments.\nUnder Topic 842, the Company applied a dual approach to all leases whereby the Company is a lessee and classifies leases as either finance or operating leases based on the\nprinciple of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the Company. Lease classification is evaluated at the inception of the lease agreement.\nDeferred Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740 “Income Taxes.” Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for\nthe future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be\nrecovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is\nprovided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nNot applicable because we are a smaller reporting company.\nItem 8.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in\nall material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to\nperform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but\nnot for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our\naudits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nGRASSI & CO., CPAs, P.C.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2020.\nJericho, New York\nMarch 27, 2024\nF-2\nTWIN VEE POWERCATS CO.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2023 and 2022\n1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization\nTwin Vee PowerCats Co. (“Twin Vee” or the “Company”) was incorporated as Twin Vee Catamarans, Inc., in the state of Florida, on December 1, 2009. On April 7, 2021, the\nCompany filed a Certificate of Conversion to register and incorporate in the state of Delaware and changed the company name to Twin Vee PowerCats Co. The Certificate of\nIncorporation for Twin Vee PowerCats Co. was also filed on April 7, 2021.\nOn September 1, 2021, the Company formed Fix My Boat, Inc., (“Fix My Boat”), a wholly-owned subsidiary. Fix My Boat will utilize a franchise model for marine mechanics\nacross the country. Fix My Boat has been inactive for 2023 and 2022, we anticipate focusing resources on this entity in the future.\nForza X1, Inc. was initially incorporated as Electra Power Sports, Inc. on October 15, 2021, and subsequently changed its name to Forza X1, Inc. (“Forza X1” or “Forza”) on\nOctober 29, 2021. Prior to Forza’s incorporation on October 15, 2021, the electric boat business was operated as the Company’s Electra Power Sports™ Division. Following\nthe Company’s initial public offering that closed on July 23, 2021 (the “IPO”), it determined in October 2021 that for several reasons, that it would market the Company’s new\nindependent line of electric boats under a new brand name (and new subsidiary).\nOn April 20, 2023, the Company formed AquaSport Co.(“AquaSport”), a wholly owned subsidiary in the state of Florida in connection with the Company’s plan to lease the\nassets of former AQUASPORT™ boat brand and manufacturing facility in White Bluff Tennessee.\nMerger\nOn December 5, 2022, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 8, 2022 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and between Twin Vee\nPowerCats Co. and Twin Vee Powercats, Inc., a Florida corporation (“Twin Vee Inc.” or “TVPC”), TVPC was merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”).\nAs Twin Vee Inc. did not meet the definition of a business under ASC 805, the merger was not accounted for as a business combination. The Merger was accounted for as a\nrecapitalization of Twin Vee PowerCats, Co., effected through the exchange of TVPC shares for Twin Vee PowerCats, Co. shares, and the cancellation of Twin Vee PowerCats,\nCo. shares held by Twin Vee Inc. Upon the effective date of the Merger, December 5, 2022, Twin Vee Co. accounted for the Merger by assuming TVPC’s net liabilities. Twin\nVee PowerCats, Co.’s financial statements reflect the operations of TVPC. prospectively and will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or\nresults of operations of TVPC.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Twin Vee and its wholly owned subsidiary, AquaSport, Fix My Boat, and controlling interest subsidiary, Forza\nX1, collectively referred to as the “Company”.\nThe Company’s net loss excludes losses attributable to noncontrolling interests. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity\nseparate from the Company’s equity. All inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United State\nof America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the accounting and disclosure rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nF-7\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company’s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats, motors and trailers to its independent dealers. The Company recognizes revenue when obligations under the\nterms of a contract are satisfied and control over promised goods is transferred to the dealer. For the majority of sales, this occurs when the product is released to the carrier\nresponsible for transporting it to a dealer. The Company typically receives payment within five business days of shipment. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration\nit expects to receive in exchange for a product. The Company offers dealer incentives that include wholesale rebates, retail rebates and promotions, floor plan reimbursement or\ncash discounts, and other allowances that are recorded as reductions of revenues in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The consideration recognized\nrepresents the amount specified in a contract with a customer, net of estimated incentives the Company reasonably expects to pay. The estimated liability and reduction in\nrevenue for dealer incentives is recorded at the time of sale. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible because actual results may differ from these estimates if\nconditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if dealer achievement or other items vary from historical trends. Accrued dealer\nincentives are included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nTotal accounts receivable\nJanuary 1, 2022 $ 5,137\nJanuary 1, 2023 $ 14,167\nDecember 31, 2023 $ 80,160\nPayment received for the future sale of a boat to a customer is recognized as a customer deposit. Customer deposits are recognized as revenue when control over promised\ngoods is transferred to the customer. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had customer deposits of $44,195 and $5,300, respectively, which is recorded as contract\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. These deposits are refundable, we are uncertain when we will be able to recognize as revenues.\nRebates and Discounts\nDealers earn wholesale rebates based on purchase volume commitments and achievement of certain performance metrics. The Company estimates the amount of wholesale\nrebates based on historical achievement, forecasted volume, and assumptions regarding dealer behavior. Rebates that apply to boats already in dealer inventory are referred to\nas retail rebates. The Company estimates the amount of retail rebates based on historical data for specific boat models adjusted for forecasted sales volume, product mix, dealer\nand consumer behavior, and assumptions concerning market conditions. The Company also utilizes various programs whereby it offers cash discounts or agrees to reimburse its\ndealers for certain floor plan interest costs incurred by dealers for limited periods of time, generally ranging up to nine months.\nOther Revenue Recognition Matters\nDealers generally have no right to return unsold boats. Occasionally, the Company may accept returns in limited circumstances and at the Company’s discretion under its\nwarranty policy. The Company may be obligated, in the event of default by a dealer, to accept returns of unsold boats under its repurchase commitment to floor financing\nproviders, who are able to obtain such boats through foreclosure. The repurchase commitment is on an individual unit basis with a term from the date it is financed by the\nlending institution through the payment date by the dealer, generally not exceeding 30 months.\nThe Company has excluded sales and other taxes assessed by a governmental authority in connection with revenue-producing activities from the determination of the\ntransaction price for all contracts. The Company has not adjusted net sales for the effects of a significant financing component because the period between the transfer of the\npromised goods and the customer’s payment is expected to be one year or less.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the\nreporting period. Some of these judgments can be subjective and complex, and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates.\nF-8\nConcentrations of Credit and Business Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of trade receivables. Credit risk on trade receivables is mitigated as\na result of the Company’s use of trade letters of credit, dealer floor plan financing arrangements, and the geographically diversified nature of the Company’s customer base. The\nCompany minimizes the concentration of credit risk associated with its cash by maintaining its cash with high quality federally insured financial institutions. However, cash\nbalances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured limit of $250,000 are at risk. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had\n$15,868,574 and $22,666,301, respectively, in excess of FDIC insured limits.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. On December 31, 2023 and 2022, the\nCompany had cash and cash equivalents of $16,755,233 and $23,501,007, respectively.\nRestricted cash includes amounts that are collected and are held in connection with assets securing certain of the Company’s financing transactions. Restricted cash is restricted\nfor payment of interest expense and principal on the outstanding borrowings. On December 31,2023 and 2022, included within restricted cash on the Company’s consolidated\nbalance sheets is an irrevocable letter of credit for $257,530 and $0, respectively.\nMarketable Securities\nThe Company’s investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and\nability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at\nfair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on\navailable-for-sale debt securities are included in other income.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company follows accounting guidelines on fair value measurements for financial instruments measured on a recurring basis, as well as for certain assets and liabilities that\nare initially recorded at their estimated fair values. Fair Value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market participants as the measurement date. The Company uses the following three-level hierarchy that maximizes the use of observable\ninputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs to value its financial instruments:\n●Level 1: Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments.\n●Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.\n●Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing\nmodels, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires a significant judgment or\nestimation.\nFinancial instruments measured as fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s\nassessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires it to make judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or\nliability. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on estimated fair values. Accordingly, the fair value estimates disclosed,\nor initial amounts recorded may not be indicative of the amount that the Company or holders of the instruments could realize in a current market exchange.\nThe carrying amounts of cash equivalents approximate their fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature, such as accounts receivable and payable, and other financial\ninstruments in current assets or current liabilities.\nF-9\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company carries its accounts receivables net of an allowance for credit losses. The measurement and recognition of credit losses involves the use of judgment.\nManagement’s assessment of expected credit losses includes consideration of current and expected economic conditions, market and industry factors affecting the Company’s\ncustomers (including their financial condition), the aging of account balances, historical credit loss experience, customer concentrations, and customer creditworthiness.\nManagement evaluates its experience with historical losses and then applies this historical loss ratio to financial assets with similar characteristics. The Company’s historical\nloss ratio or its determination of risk pools may be adjusted for changes in customer, economy, market or other circumstances. The Company may also establish an allowance\nfor credit losses for specific receivables when it is probable that the receivable will not be collected, and the loss can be reasonably estimated. Amounts are written off against\nthe allowance when they are considered to be uncollectible, and reversals of previously reserved amounts are recognized if a specifically reserved item is settled for an amount\nexceeding the previous estimate.\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost determined using the weighted average cost method on a first-in first-out basis. Net realizable\nvalue is defined as sales price less cost of completion, disposable and transportation and a normal profit margin. Production costs, consisting of labor and overhead, are applied\nto ending finished goods inventories at a rate based on estimated production capacity. Excess production costs are charged to cost of products sold. Provisions have been made\nto reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their net realizable value.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the provision for excess or obsolete inventories is $419,616 and $0, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, using the straight-line method over the assets’ useful life. Leasehold improvements\nare amortized over the shorter of the assets’ useful life or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of property and equipment range from three to five years. Upon sale or\nretirement, the cost and related accumulated depreciation is eliminated from their respective accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is included in results of operations. Repairs\nand maintenance charges, which do not increase the useful lives of the assets, are charged to operations as incurred.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nManagement assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets when indicators of impairment are present. If such indicators are present, recoverability of these assets is\ndetermined by comparing the undiscounted net cash flows estimated to result from those assets over the remaining life to the assets’ net carrying amounts. If the estimated\nundiscounted net cash flows are less than the net carrying amount, the assets would be adjusted to their fair value, based on appraisal or the present value of the undiscounted\nnet cash flows.\nProduct Warranty Costs\nAs required by the Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 460, Guarantees, the Company is including the following\ndisclosure applicable to its product warranties.\nThe Company accrues for warranty costs based on the expected material and labor costs to provide warranty replacement products. The methodology used in determining the\nliability for warranty cost is based upon historical information and experience. The Company’s warranty reserve is calculated as the gross sales multiplied by the historical\nwarranty expense return rate.\nThe following table shows the changes in the aggregate product warranty liability for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively:\nF-10\n2023 2022\nBalance as of the beginning of year $ 92,373 $ 75,000\nLess: Payments made (358,129) (227,229)\nAdd: Provision for current years warranty 458,650 244,602\nBalance as of end of year $ 192,894 $ 92,373\nAdvertising\nAdvertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred.

For the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, shipping and handling costs amounted to $718,635 and $179,998, respectively.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date\nbased on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, it uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company calculates the associated lease liability and corresponding\nROU asset upon lease commencement using a discount rate based on a credit-adjusted secured borrowing rate commensurate with the term of the lease. The operating lease\nROU asset also includes any lease payments made and is reduced by lease incentives. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it\nis reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expenses for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nSupplier Concentrations\nThe Company is dependent on the ability of its suppliers to provide products on a timely basis and on favorable pricing terms. The loss of certain principal suppliers or a\nsignificant reduction in product availability from principal suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Business risk insurance is in place to mitigate the\nbusiness risk associated with sole suppliers for sudden disruptions such as those caused by natural disasters.\nThe Company is dependent on third-party equipment manufacturers, distributors, and dealers for certain parts and materials utilized in the manufacturing process. During the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, the Company purchased all engines for its boats under supplier agreements with three vendors. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the\nCompany purchased all engines for its boats under supplier agreements with one vendor. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, total purchases from these vendors\nwere $9,252,915 and $5,020,973, respectively.\nF-11\nEmployee Retention Credit\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was signed into law providing numerous tax provisions and other stimulus\nmeasures, including an employee retention credit (“ERC”), which is a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes. The Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief\nAct of 2020 and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 extended and expanded the availability of the ERC.\nAccounting Standards Codification 105, “Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,” describes the decision-making framework when no guidance exists in US GAAP for a\nparticular transaction. Specifically, ASC 105-10-05-2 instructs companies to look for guidance for a similar transaction within US GAAP and apply that guidance by analogy.\nAs such, forms of government assistance, such as the ERC, provided to business entities would not be within the scope of ASC 958, but it may be applied by analogy under\nASC 105-10-05-2. We accounted for the Employee Retention Credit as a government grant in accordance with Accounting Standards Update 2013-06, Not-for-Profit Entities\n(Topic 958) (“ASU 2013-06”) by analogy under ASC 105-10-05-2. Under this standard, government grants are recognized when the conditions on which they depend are\nsubstantially met.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, the Company received $1,267,055 and $355,987, from the Employee Retention Credit (ERC).\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes stock-based compensation costs for its restricted stock and restricted stock units, measured at the fair value of each award at the time of grant, as an\nexpense over the period during which an employee is required to provide service. Compensation cost is recognized over the service period for the fair value of awards that vest.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to\ndifferences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recover or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets\nand liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management\nconsiders whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is entirely\ndependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled\nreversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments Credit Losses —Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial\nInstruments.” ASU 2016-13 requires a financial asset (or group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected,\nwhich includes the Company’s accounts receivable. This ASU is effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted\nthis standard effective January 1, 2023, and the adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company has considered all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe the adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on its\nconsolidated financial statements.\n2.

During this period, there were no material subsequent events requiring recognition or disclosure, other than the ones described below.\nOn January 1, 2024, our 2021 Stock Incentive Plan automatically increased, and will continue to increase on January 1 of each calendar year for a period of ten years\ncommencing on January 1, 2022 and ending on (and including) January 1, 2031, in a number of shares of common stock equal to 4.5% of the total number of shares of common\nstock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15€ and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of\na company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls\nand procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure. We have adopted and maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the\nExchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual\nReport, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the SEC. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also\ndesigned to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes\nthat any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily\napplies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of\nDecember 31, 2023, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such a date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to\nthe material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, related to not yet having retained sufficient staff or engaged sufficient outside consultants with\nappropriate experience in GAAP presentation, especially of complex instruments, to devise and implement effective disclosure controls and procedures over internal controls.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-\n15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the\npreparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Management conducted an assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023 based on the framework and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated\nFramework (2013) (COSO). Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting were not\neffective.\nThe Company has material weaknesses pertaining to controls that address segregation of duties across financially relevant functions and applications used in financial\nreporting. We have concluded that these material weaknesses existed because, as a small company, we did not have the necessary business processes, systems, personnel, and\nrelated internal controls necessary to satisfy the accounting and financial reporting requirements of a public company.\nWe are in the process of implementing measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting to remediate these material weaknesses. The Company’s plan\nto remediate the material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting includes increasing staffing with its finance department sufficient to facilitate proper\nsegregation of accounting functions and to enable appropriate review of its internally prepared financial statements.\nRemediation Plan\nManagement has developed and is executing a remediation plan to address the previously disclosed material weaknesses, due to inadequate staffing levels. We are actively\nrecruiting a Chief Financial Officer to replace Ms. Gunnerson and a full-time Controller and have retained a full time Staff Accountant; we have selected and are working on\nimplementing a robust operating system and we are utilizing the assistance of outside advisors where appropriate.\n62\nTo remediate the existing material weaknesses, additional time is required to demonstrate the effectiveness of the remediation efforts. The material weaknesses cannot be\nconsidered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are\noperating effectively. As of December 31, 2023, controls and procedures have been implemented to remediate the material weakness, however testing of controls continues.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we hired additional staff in our finance department and have developed and refined our controls and other producers that are\ndesigned to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in SEC rules and in accordance with GAAP.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report by Grassi & Co., CPAs, P.C. (“Grassi”), our independent registered public accounting firm, regarding internal control\nover financial reporting. As a smaller reporting company, our internal control over financial reporting was not subject to audit by our independent registered public accounting\nfirm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management’s report.\nItem 9B. Other Information.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading\narrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nItem 9C.

The number of directors will be fixed by our board of directors, subject to the terms of our certificate of incorporation\nand bylaws. Each of our current directors will continue to serve as a director until the election and qualification of his or her successor, or until his or her earlier death,\nresignation or removal.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors is divided into three (3) classes with staggered three-year terms. Only one class of directors will be elected\nat each annual meeting of stockholders, with the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three-year terms. Our current directors are divided among the\nthree (3) classes as follows:\n● the Class I directors are Neil Ross and Bard Rockenbach, and their terms will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2025;\n● the Class II directors are James Melvin and Preston Yarborough, and their terms will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2026; and\n● the Class III directors are Kevin Schuyler and Joseph Visconti, and their terms will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2024.\nAt each annual meeting of stockholders, upon the expiration of the term of a class of directors, the successor to each such director in the class will be elected to serve from the\ntime of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following his or her election and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified, in accordance with our\ncertificate of incorporation. Any additional directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors will be distributed among the three classes so that, as nearly as\npossible, each class will consist of one-third of our directors.\nThis classification of our board of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control of our company.\n66\nIn addition, under the terms of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws, members of our board of directors may only be removed for cause. This may also have the effect\nof delaying or preventing changes in control of our company.\nDirector Independence\nOur common stock has traded The Nasdaq Capital Market, or Nasdaq, under the symbol “VEEE” since July 21, 2021. Under the rules of Nasdaq, independent directors must\ncomprise a majority of a listed company’s board of directors within one year of the completion of its initial public offering. In addition, the rules of Nasdaq require that, subject\nto specified exceptions, each member of a listed company’s audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees be independent. Audit committee\nmembers and compensation committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 and Rule 10C-1, respectively, under the Exchange Act.\nUnder the rules of Nasdaq, a director will only qualify as an “independent director” if, in the opinion of that company’s board of directors, that person does not have a\nrelationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.\nTo be considered to be independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 and under the rules of Nasdaq, a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in his\nor her capacity as a member of the audit committee, the board of directors, or any other board of directors committee: (1) accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory,\nor other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries; or (2) be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries.\nTo be considered independent for purposes of Rule 10C-1 and under the rules of Nasdaq, the board of directors must affirmatively determine that each member of the\ncompensation committee is independent, including a consideration of all factors specifically relevant to determining whether the director has a relationship to the company\nwhich is material to that director’s ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a compensation committee member, including, but not limited\nto: (i) the source of compensation of such director, including any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee paid by the company to such director; and (ii) whether such\ndirector is affiliated with the company, a subsidiary of the company or an affiliate of a subsidiary of the company.\nOur board of directors undertook a review of its composition, the composition of its committees and the independence of our directors and considered whether any director has\na material relationship with us that could compromise his or her ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities. Based upon information\nrequested from and provided by each non-employee director concerning his or her background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships, our board of\ndirectors has determined that none of Messrs. Rockenbach, Ross, Melvin, and Schuyler have relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in\ncarrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is “independent” as that term is defined under the rules of Nasdaq and Rule 10A-3 and Rule 10C-1\nunder the Exchange Act.\nIn making these determinations, our board of directors considered the current and prior relationships that each non-employee director has with our company and all other facts\nand circumstances our board of directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each non-employee\ndirector, and the transactions involving them described in Part III, Item 13 “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.”\nBoard of Directors Leadership Structure\nOur Chief Executive Officer serves as our Chairman of the Board. Our Board does not have a lead independent director. Our Board has determined its leadership structure is\nappropriate and effective given our stage of development.\nBoard of Directors Committees\nWe currently have an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee, each of which have the composition and the\nresponsibilities described below. The following table shows the directors who are currently members or Chairman of each of these committees.\n67\nNominating and Corporate\nAudit Compensation Governance\nBoard Members Committee Committee Committee\nBard Rockenbach Member Member Member\nJames Melvin Member Member Member\nNeil Ross Member Member Chairman\nKevin Schuyler Chairman Chairman Member\nAudit Committee\nThe members of our audit committee consist of Bard Rockenbach, James Melvin, Neil Ross and Kevin Schuyler.

Neil Ross serves as the chair\nof our nominating and corporate governance committee. Each is independent, as that term is defined under the rules of Nasdaq. Our nominating and corporate governance\ncommittee oversees and assists our board of directors in reviewing and recommending nominees for election as directors. Specifically, the nominating and corporate\ngovernance committee:\n● identifies, evaluates and makes recommendations to our board of directors regarding nominees for election to our board of directors and its committees;\n● considers and make recommendations to our board of directors regarding the composition of our board of directors and its committees;\n● reviews developments in corporate governance practices;\n● evaluates the adequacy of our corporate governance practices and reporting; and\n● evaluates the performance of our board of directors and of individual directors.\nOur nominating and corporate governance committee operates under a written charter that satisfies the applicable rules of the SEC and the listing standards of Nasdaq, a copy\nof which is available on our website at www.twinvee.com\nRisk Oversight\nIn its governance role, and particularly in exercising its duty of care and diligence, the board of directors is responsible for ensuring that appropriate risk management policies\nand procedures are in place to protect the company’s assets and business. Our board of directors has broad and ultimate oversight responsibility for our risk management\nprocesses and programs and executive management is responsible for the day-to-day evaluation and management of risks to the Company.\nCode of Conduct and Ethics\nWe have adopted a written code of conduct and ethics that applies to our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer,\nprincipal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions. The code of business conduct and ethics is available on our website at www.twinvee.com.\nWe intend to disclose future amendments to such code, or any waivers of its requirements, applicable to any principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal\naccounting officer or controller or persons performing similar functions or our directors on our website identified above. The inclusion of our website address in this Annual\nReport does not include or incorporate by reference the information on our website into this Annual Report. We will provide any person, without charge, upon request, a copy\nof our code of conduct and ethics. Such requests should be made in writing to the attention of Glenn Sonoda, Secretary, Twin Vee PowerCats Co., 3101 US-1 Fort Pierce,\nFlorida 34982.\n69\nLimitation of Liability and Indemnification\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, and may indemnify our employees and other agents, to the fullest extent\npermitted by Delaware law. Delaware law prohibits our certificate of incorporation from limiting the liability of our directors for the following:\n● any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to us or to our stockholders;\n● acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;\n● unlawful payment of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions; and\n● any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.\nIf Delaware law is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of a director, then the liability of our directors will be eliminated\nor limited to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, as so amended. Our certificate of incorporation does not eliminate a director’s duty of care and, in appropriate\ncircumstances, equitable remedies, such as injunctive or other forms of non-monetary relief, remain available under Delaware law. This provision also does not affect a\ndirector’s responsibilities under any other laws, such as the federal securities laws or other state or federal laws. Under our bylaws, we will also be empowered to purchase\ninsurance on behalf of any person whom we are required or permitted to indemnify.\nIn the case of an action or proceeding by or in the right of our company or any of our subsidiaries, no indemnification will be provided for any claim where a court determines\nthat the indemnified party is prohibited from receiving indemnification. We believe that these charter and bylaw provisions are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons\nas directors and officers.\nThe limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors\nfor breach of their fiduciary duties. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit\nus and our stockholders. Moreover, a stockholder’s investment may be harmed to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers\npursuant to these indemnification provisions.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions,\nor otherwise, we have been advised that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore,\nunenforceable. There is no pending litigation or proceeding naming any of our directors or officers as to which indemnification is being sought, nor are we aware of any\npending or threatened litigation that may result in claims for indemnification by any director or officer.\nIn addition to the indemnification that will be provided for in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the employment agreements with certain of our executive officers\ninclude indemnification provisions providing for rights of indemnification as set forth in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws.\nItem 11.

The 2021 Plan became effective immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering in July 2021. The principal provisions of the 2021 Plan\nare summarized below.\nAdministration\nThe 2021 Plan vests broad powers in a committee to administer and interpret the 2021 Plan. Our board of directors has initially designated the compensation committee to\nadminister the 2021 Plan. Except when limited by the terms of the 2021 Plan, the compensation committee has the authority to, among other things: select the persons to be\ngranted awards; determine the type, size and term of awards; establish performance objectives and conditions for earning awards; determine whether such performance\nobjectives and conditions have been met; and accelerate the vesting or exercisability of an award. In its discretion, the compensation committee may delegate all or part of its\nauthority and duties with respect to granting awards to one or more of our officers, subject to certain limitations and provided applicable law so permits.\nOur board of directors may amend, alter or discontinue the 2021 Plan and the compensation committee may amend any outstanding award at any time; provided, however, that\nno such amendment or termination may adversely affect awards then outstanding without the holder’s permission. In addition, any amendments seeking to increase the total\nnumber of shares reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan or modifying the classes of participants eligible to receive awards under the 2021 Plan will require ratification by\nour stockholders in accordance with applicable law. Additionally, as described more fully below, neither the compensation committee nor the board of directors is permitted to\nreprice outstanding options or stock appreciation rights without shareholder consent.\nEligibility\nAny of our employees, directors, consultants, and other service providers, or those of our affiliates, are eligible to participate in the 2021 Plan and may be selected by the\ncompensation committee to receive an award.\nVesting\nThe compensation committee determines the vesting conditions for awards. These conditions may include the continued employment or service of the participant, the\nattainment of specific individual or corporate performance goals, or other factors as determined in the compensation committee’s discretion (collectively, “Vesting\nConditions”).\nShares of Stock Available for Issuance\nSubject to certain adjustments, the maximum number of shares of common stock that initially could be issued under the 2021 Plan in connection with awards was 1,630,000\nshares. We have issued options to purchase an aggregate of 1,271,016 shares of our common stock. In addition, the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be\nissued under the 2021 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each calendar year for a period of ten years commencing on January 1, 2022 and ending on (and\nincluding) January 1, 2031, in a number of shares of common stock equal to 4.5% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding\ncalendar year; provided, however that the board of directors may act prior to January 1 of a given calendar year to provide that the increase for such year will be a lesser\nnumber of shares of common stock. All available shares may be utilized toward the grant of any type of award under the 2021 Plan. The 2021 Plan imposes a $250,000\nlimitation on the total grant date fair value of awards granted to any non-employee director in his or her capacity as a non-employee director in any single calendar year. The\ntotal number of shares available for issuance increased on January 1, 2023 to 1,743,400 shares of our common stock.\n75\nDirector Compensation\n2023 Director Compensation\nCash Compensation\nOur directors cash compensation for the year ended December 31, 2023 remained the same as the prior year.

(the “Company”) has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company to adopt this Clawback Policy\n(this “Policy”), which provides for the recovery of certain incentive compensation in the event of an Accounting Restatement (as defined below). This Policy is designed to\ncomply with, and shall be interpreted to be consistent with, Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), Rule 10D-1 promulgated\nunder the Exchange Act (“Rule 10D-1”) and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5608.\n1. Definitions\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth below.\n“Accounting Restatement” means an accounting restatement of the Company’s financial statements due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any financial\nreporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the\npreviously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period.\n“Clawback Period” means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement,\nas well as any transition period (that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years (except that a\ntransition period that comprises a period of at least nine months shall count as a completed fiscal year). The”date on which the Company is required to prepare an Accounting\nRestatement” is the earlier to occur of (a) the date the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if the Board\naction is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement; or (b) the date a court, regulator or\nother legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement.\n“Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means, in the event of an Accounting Restatement, the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation previously received that\nexceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts in such Accounting\nRestatement, and must be computed without regard to any taxes paid by the relevant Executive Officer; provided, however, that for Incentive-Based Compensation based on\nstock price or total stockholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an\nAccounting Restatement: (i) the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation must be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the\nstock price or total stockholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was received; and (ii) the Company must maintain documentation of the determination of\nthat reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”).\n“Executive Officer” means the Company’s president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller),\nany vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other officer who performs a\npolicy-making function, or any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company. An executive officer of the Company’s parent or subsidiary is\ndeemed an “Executive Officer” if the executive officer performs such policy making functions for the Company.\n“Financial Reporting Measure” means any measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company’s\nfinancial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures; provided, however, that a Financial Reporting Measure is not required to be\npresented within the Company’s financial statements or included in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to qualify as a “Financial\nReporting Measure.” For purposes of this Policy, Financial Reporting Measures include, but are not limited to, stock price and total stockholder return.\n“Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting\nMeasure. Incentive-Based Compensation is “received” for purposes of this Policy in the Company’s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the\nIncentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of such Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period.\n2. Policy Application.\nThis Policy applies to Incentive-Based Compensation received by an Executive Officer (a) after beginning services as an Executive Officer; (b) if that person served as an\nExecutive Officer at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation; and (c) while the Company had a listed class of securities on a national\nsecurities exchange.\n3. Policy Recovery Requirement.\nIn the event the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, the Company shall reasonably promptly recoup the amount of any Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation received by any Executive Officer during the Clawback Period. In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Board shall determine, in its sole discretion, the\namount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation for each Executive Officer in connection with such Accounting Restatement.\n4. Method of Recoupment.\nThe Board shall determine, in its sole discretion, the timing and method for promptly recouping such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, which may include without\nlimitation: (a) seeking reimbursement of all or part of any cash or equity-based award, (b) cancelling prior cash or equity-based awards, whether vested or unvested or paid or\nunpaid, (c) cancelling or offsetting against any planned future cash or equity based awards, (d) forfeiture of deferred compensation, subject to compliance with Section 409A of\nthe Internal Revenue Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and (e) any other method authorized by applicable law or contract. Subject to compliance with any\napplicable law, the Board may affect recovery under this Policy from any amount otherwise payable to the Executive Officer, including amounts payable to such individual\nunder any otherwise applicable Company plan or program, including base salary, bonuses or commissions and compensation previously deferred by the Executive Officer.\nThe Company is authorized and directed pursuant to this Policy to recoup Erroneously Awarded Compensation in compliance with this Policy except to the extent the\nCompensation Committee of the Board has determined recovery would be impracticable solely if one (1) of the following limited reasons are met, and subject to the following\nprocedural and disclosure requirements:\n• The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before concluding that it would be\nimpracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on expense of enforcement, the Company must make a reasonable attempt\nto recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover and provide that documentation to Nasdaq;\n• Recovery would violate home country law of the Company where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022. Before concluding that it would be\nimpracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law of the Company, the Company must\nobtain an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to Nasdaq, that recovery would result in such a violation, and must provide such opinion to Nasdaq; or\n• Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to\nmeet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.\n2\n5. No Indemnification of Executives Officers.\nNotwithstanding the terms of any indemnification or insurance policy or any contractual arrangement with any Executive Officer that may be interpreted to the contrary, the\nCompany shall not indemnify any Executive Officers against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, including any payment or reimbursement for the cost of\nthird-party insurance purchased by any Executive Officers to fund potential clawback obligations under this Policy.\n6. Required Policy-Related Filings.\nThe Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of the federal securities laws, including disclosures required by SEC\nfilings.\n7. Acknowledgement.\nEach Executive Officer shall sign and return to the Company within thirty (30) calendar days following the later of (i) the effective date of this Policy set forth below or (ii) the\ndate such individual becomes an Executive Officer, the Acknowledgement Form attached hereto as Exhibit A, pursuant to which the Executive Officer agrees to be bound by,\nand to comply with, the terms and conditions of this Policy.\n8. Administration\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Board or, if so designated by the Board, the Compensation Committee, in which case references herein to the Board shall be deemed\nreferences to the Compensation Committee. Any determinations made by the Board shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.\n9.

All statements other than statements of historical\nfacts contained in this presentation, including statements regarding our strategy, future operations, future financial position, future revenue,\nprospects, plans, objectives of management and expected market growth are forward looking statements. These statements involve known\nand unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially\ndifferent from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the “forward looking statements.\nThe words “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” and\nsimilar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements, although not all forward looking statements contain these identifying\nwords. These “forward looking statements” are only predictions, and we may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed\nin our “forward looking statements,” so you should not place undue reliance on our “forward looking statements.” Actual results or events could\ndiffer materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward looking statements we make. We have based these\n“forward looking statements” largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results. These and other risks and uncertainties are described more fully in the section titled “Risk\nFactors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, or other periodic filings which have been filed with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). “Forward looking statements” contained in this presentation are made as of this date, and we\nundertake no duty to update such information except as required under applicable law. You may access these documents for free by visiting\nEDGAR on the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov.\nThe “forward looking statements” included in this presentation represent our views as of the date of this presentation. We anticipate that\nsubsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. However, while we may elect to update these “forward looking\nstatements” at some point in the future, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. You should,\ntherefore, not rely on these “forward looking statements” as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this presentation.\nThis presentation contains estimates made, and other statistical data published, by independent parties and by us relating to market size and\ngrowth and other data about our industry. We obtained the industry and market data in this presentation from our own research as well as\nfrom industry and general publications, surveys and studies conducted by third parties. This data involves a number of assumptions and\nlimitations and contains projections and estimates of the future performance of the industry in which we operate that are subject to a high\ndegree of uncertainty. We caution you not to give undue weight to such projections, assumptions and estimates.\n2\nMission Statement\nTo Design and Manufacture the Most Stylish and\nFamily-Friendly Fish Sport Boats While Delivering the\nGreatest Value Proposition for our Customers.\n3\nCompany Overview\nLeading Iconic Brands\nCOMPANY OVERVIEW\n● NASDAQ: VEEE\n● 14 newly designed models\n● $15.1M in cash, cash equivalents, restricted\ncash, and marketable securities at June\n30th, 2024\n● $33.8M in total assets at June 30th, 2024\n● Over 90 years of boat building DNA\n4\nInvestment Highlights\nScalable Brands + Manufacturer Infrastructure =\n● Diversified Model Line Up For Greatest Customer Demand\n● Rapid Product Development Infrastructure - : 14 New Boats Models, 6 Models In Pipeline\n● Full In-House Manufacturing - Composite, Upholstery, Rigging, Cnc - End To End Control\n● Pro Direct - Expanding Global Footprint\n● Investing In People, Leadership, Engineering, Finance And Others\n● Strong Balance Sheet; At June 30th 2024 The Company Had:\n○ More Than $33 Million In Total Assets\n○ More Than $15 Million In Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash And Marketable Securities\n○ More Than $25 Million In Equity\n● No Bank Debt\n● Single Class Of Common Stock\n● Management Successfully Navigated And Preserved Cash Position During Downturn\nTwo Iconic Boat Companies With Over 90 Years Of Brand Recognition And Customer Loyalty.\n5\nOne Company - One Mission\nAugust 12, 2024 VEEE +FRZA Merger\n● Twin Vee And Forza Announce A Merger, With Twin Vee\nOwning 64% And Forza 36% Of Twin Vee’s Stock Post-Merger\n● Focus On 90-Year Legacy Of Producing Fuel-Efficient Offshore\nBoats Known For Quality And Performance\n● Strong Financials With Over $1.00/Share In Cash, $2.00/Share\nIn Net Assets, And No Debt As Of June 30, 2024\n● Streamlined Operations By Merging, Reducing Overhead, And\nFocusing On Factory Expansion, Vertical Integration, And\nEngineering Excellence\n6\nTurning Point\nState of Recreational Boating Market\nThe recreational boating industry has gone through a great deal of volatility over the past four\nyears, Twin Vee has leaned into new products, streamlines value products, expanding reach,\nlaunching Pro-Direct for global exposure.\nQuarterly Growth (3/12) -19.1%\nAnnual Growth (12/12) -13.7%\nNEXT 12/12 LOW\nIMMINENT\nNEXT 12/12 HIGH 1Q26\nIndustry Leading ITS Economics is forecasting\nthe return to growth in Q2/ Q3 2025\n7\nSource: https://www.nmma.org/statistics/publications/boat-building-production-forecast\nModel Lineup\nCENTER CONSOLE CENTER CONSOLE CENTER CONSOLE DUAL CONSOLE CENTER CONSOLE\nNEW!
