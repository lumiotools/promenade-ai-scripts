Operating revenues increased 25.2% from the third quarter of 2023 due to higher average AUM and higher other revenues attributable to our European listed exchange-traded products (“ETPs”).\n  * Our average advisory fee was 0.37%, 0.37% and 0.36% during the third quarter of 2024, the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, respectively.\n\n\n\n**Operating Expenses**\n\n  * Operating expenses decreased 1.6% from the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to lower incentive compensation, partly offset by higher fund management and administration expenses.\n  * Operating expenses increased 13.6% from the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher professional fees, which is inclusive of the legal and other related expected to be covered by insurance described above, as well as higher fund management and administration costs, incentive compensation and marketing expenses.\n\n\n\n**Other Income/(Expenses)**\n\n  * Interest expense increased 21.4% and 45.2% from the second quarter of 2024 and third quarter of 2023, respectively, due to a higher level of debt outstanding, partly offset by a lower average interest rate. The increase from the third quarter of 2023 also is due to the recognition of imputed interest on our obligation payable to Gold Bullion Holdings (Jersey) Limited (“GBH”), a subsidiary of the World Gold Council, in connection with our repurchase in November 2023 of our Series C Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock.\n  * Interest income increased 24.8% and 126.9% from the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, respectively, due to a higher level of interest-earning assets.\n  * During the third quarter of 2024, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of convertible notes of $30.6 million arising from the repurchase of $104.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 2028 Notes.\n  * Other losses and gains, net was a loss of $3.1 million for the third quarter of 2024. This included a $4.0 million civil money penalty in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement. Also included are net gains of $0.8 million and $0.6 million on our financial instruments owned and our investments, respectively. Gains and losses also generally arise from the sale of gold and crypto earned from management fees paid by our physically-backed gold and crypto ETPs, foreign exchange fluctuations and other miscellaneous items.\n\n\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\n  * Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 216.0%, resulting in income tax expense of $8.4 million. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to non-deductible loss on extinguishment of convertible notes, a non-deductible civil money penalty of $4.0 million and non-deductible executive compensation. These items were partly offset by a lower tax rate on foreign earnings.\n\n\n  * Our adjusted effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 23.9%(1).\n\n\n\n**NINE MONTH HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n  * Operating revenues increased 22.8% as compared to 2023 due to higher average AUM, higher other revenues attributable to our European listed ETPs and the recognition of $4.1 million of other revenue related to legal and other related expenses expected to be covered by insurance described above.\n  * Operating expenses increased 9.2% as compared to 2023 primarily due to higher incentive and stock-based compensation expense and increased headcount, fund management and administration costs, marketing expenses, sales and business development expenses, third-party distribution fees, as well as higher depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, also includes $4.1 million of legal and other related expenses expected to be covered by insurance that were incurred in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement. These increases were partly offset by lower contractual gold payments.\n  * Significant items reported in other income/(expense) in 2024 include: a loss on extinguishment of convertible notes of $30.6 million arising from the repurchase of $104.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 2028 Notes; a civil money penalty of $4.0 million in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement; an increase in interest expense of 15.8% due to imputed interest on our obligation payable to GBH and higher level of debt outstanding, partly offset by a lower average interest rate; an increase in interest income of 61.1% due to an increase in our interest-earning assets; net gains on our financial instruments owned of $2.6 million; and losses on our investments of $0.6 million. Gains and losses also generally arise from the sale of gold earned on management fees paid by our physically-backed gold ETPs, foreign exchange fluctuations and other miscellaneous items.\n  * Our effective income tax rate for 2024 was 35.6%, resulting in an income tax expense of $21.8 million. Our tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to non-deductible loss on extinguishment of convertible notes, a non-deductible civil money penalty of $4.0 million and non-deductible executive compensation. These items were partly offset by a lower tax rate on foreign earnings.\n\n\n\n**CONFERENCE CALL DIAL-IN AND WEBCAST DETAILS**\n\nWisdomTree will discuss its results and operational highlights during a live webcast on Friday, October 25, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. ET, which can be accessed using the following link: <https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=kZrhyzrd>.\n\nParticipants also can dial in using the following numbers: (877) 407-9210 or (201) 689-8049.

Our management reviews these non-GAAP financial measurements when evaluating our financial performance and results of operations; therefore, we believe it is useful to provide information with respect to these non-GAAP measurements so as to share this perspective of management. Non-GAAP measurements do not have any standardized meaning, do not replace nor are superior to GAAP financial measurements and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measurements should be considered in the context with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measurements contained in this press release include:\n\n**Adjusted Revenues, Operating Income, Operating Expenses, Income Before Income Taxes, Income Tax Expense, Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share**\n\nWe disclose adjusted revenues, operating income, operating expenses, income before income taxes, income tax expense, net income and diluted earnings per share as non-GAAP financial measurements in order to report our results exclusive of items that are non-recurring or not core to our operating business. We believe presenting these non-GAAP financial measurements provides investors with a consistent way to analyze our performance. These non-GAAP financial measurements exclude the following:\n\n**_Legal and other related expenses expected to be covered by insurance:_ **We have incurred $4.1 million of legal and other related expenses in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement that are expected to be covered by insurance. GAAP requires that such covered expenses be reported gross in the income statement such that revenues are recorded to offset expenses incurred. We offset the revenues and related expenses when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as the gross presentation serves to overstate our revenues and expenses recognized in the ordinary course of business.\n\n**_Gains or losses on financial instruments owned:_** We account for our financial instruments owned as trading securities, which requires these instruments to be measured at fair value with gains and losses reported in net income. We exclude these items when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as the gains and losses introduce volatility in earnings and are not core to our operating business.\n\n**_Tax windfalls and shortfalls upon vesting of stock-based compensation awards:_** GAAP requires the recognition of tax windfalls and shortfalls within income tax expense. These items arise upon the vesting of stock-based compensation awards and the magnitude is directly correlated to the number of awards vesting/exercised as well as the difference between the price of our stock on the date the award was granted and the date the award vested or was exercised. We exclude these items when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as they introduce volatility in earnings and are not core to our operating business.\n\n**_Imputed interest on our payable to the Gold Bullion Holdings (Jersey) Limited (“GBH”):_** During the fourth quarter of 2023, we repurchased our Series C Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, which was convertible into approximately 13.1 million shares of WisdomTree common stock, from GBH, a subsidiary of the World Gold Council, for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $84.4 million. Under the terms of the transaction, we paid GBH $40.0 million on the closing date, with the remainder of the purchase price payable in equal annual installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date, with no requirement to pay interest. Under US GAAP, the obligation is recorded at its present value utilizing a market rate of interest on the closing date of 7.0% and the corresponding discount is amortized as interest expense pursuant to the effective interest method of accounting over the life of the obligation. We exclude this item when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as recognition of interest expense is non-cash and contrary to the stated terms of our obligation.\n\n**_Other items:_** Losses on extinguishment of convertible notes, a civil money penalty in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement, gains and losses recognized on our investments, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowance, expenses incurred in response to an activist campaign and impairments are excluded when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements.\n\n**Adjusted Effective Income Tax Rate**\n\nWe disclose our adjusted effective income tax rate as a non-GAAP financial measurement in order to report our effective income tax rate exclusive of items that are non-recurring or not core to our operating business. We believe reporting our adjusted effective income tax rate provides investors with a consistent way to analyze our income taxes. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing adjusted income tax expense by adjusted income before income taxes. See above for information regarding the items that are excluded.\n\n**Gross Margin and Gross Margin Percentage**\n\nWe disclose our gross margin and gross margin percentage as non-GAAP financial measurements because we believe they provide investors with a consistent way to analyze the amount we retain after paying third-party service providers to operate our ETPs. These measures also assist us in analyzing the profitability of our products. We define gross margin as total adjusted operating revenues less fund management and administration expenses. Gross margin percentage is calculated as gross margin divided by total adjusted operating revenues.\n\n**GAAP to NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION (CONSOLIDATED)****(in thousands)****(Unaudited)**\n\n**Three

our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which are, in some cases, beyond our control and could materially affect results. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, the risks described below. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties occur, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual events or results may vary significantly from those implied or projected by the forward-looking statements. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance. You should read this press release completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.\n\nIn particular, forward-looking statements in this press release may include statements about:\n\n  * anticipated trends, conditions and investor sentiment in the global markets and ETPs;\n  * anticipated levels of inflows into and outflows out of our ETPs;\n  * our ability to deliver favorable rates of return to investors;\n  * competition in our business;\n  * whether we will experience future growth;\n  * our ability to develop new products and services and their potential for success;\n  * our ability to maintain current vendors or find new vendors to provide services to us at favorable costs;\n  * our ability to successfully implement our strategy relating to digital assets and blockchain-enabled financial services, including WisdomTree Prime® and WisdomTree Connect™, and achieve its objectives;\n  * our ability to successfully operate and expand our business in non-U.S. markets;\n  * the effect of laws and regulations that apply to our business; and\n  * actions of activist stockholders.\n\n\n\nOur business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, including without limitation:\n\n  * declining prices of securities, gold and other precious metals and other commodities and changes in interest rates and general market conditions can adversely affect our business by reducing the market value of the assets we manage or causing WisdomTree ETP investors to sell their fund shares and trigger redemptions;\n  * fluctuations in the amount and mix of our AUM, whether caused by disruptions in the financial markets or otherwise, including but not limited to events such as a pandemic or war, geopolitical conflicts, political events, acts of terrorism and other matters beyond our control, may negatively impact revenues and operating margins, and may impede our ability to refinance our debt upon maturity or increase the cost of borrowing upon a refinancing;\n  * competitive pressures could reduce revenues and profit margins;\n  * we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of products, and, as a result, our operating results are particularly exposed to investor sentiment toward investing in the products’ strategies and our ability to maintain the AUM of these products, as well as the performance of these products and market-specific and political and economic risk;\n  * a significant portion of our AUM is held in products with exposure to U.S. and international developed markets, and we therefore have exposure to domestic and foreign market conditions and are subject to currency exchange rate risks;\n  * withdrawals or broad changes in investments in our ETPs by investors with significant positions may negatively impact revenues and operating margins;\n  * we face increased operational, regulatory, financial and other risks as a result of conducting our business internationally, and as we expand our digital assets product offerings and services beyond our existing ETP business;\n  * many of our ETPs have a limited track record, and poor investment performance could cause our revenues to decline;\n  * we depend on third parties to provide many critical services to operate our business and our ETPs. The failure of key vendors to adequately provide such services could materially affect our operating business and harm WisdomTree ETP investors; and\n  * actions of activist stockholders against us, which have been costly and may be disruptive and cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.\n\n\n\nOther factors, such as general economic conditions, including currency exchange rate fluctuations, also may have an effect on the results of our operations. For a more complete description of the risks noted above and other risks that could cause our actual results to differ from our current expectations, see “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC.\n\nThe forward-looking statements in this press release represent our views as of the date of this press release. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments may cause our views to change. However, while we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. Therefore, these forward-looking statements do not represent our views as of any date other than the date of this press release.\n\nCategory: Business Update\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241025121692/en/>\n\n**Investor Relations** Jeremy Campbell +1.917.267.3859 jeremy.campbell@wisdomtree.com\n\n**Media Relations** Natasha Ramsammy +1.917.267.3798 nramsammy@wisdomtree.com / wisdomtree@fullyvested.com\n\nSource: WisdomTree, Inc.\n\nReleased October 25, 2024\n\n  * [ Email Alerts ](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [ Company Profile ](/company-information)\n  * [ Contacts ](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [ RSS News Feed ](https://ir.wisdomtree.com/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n"

regarding our results as determined by GAAP, we also disclose certain non-GAAP information which we believe provides useful and meaningful\ninformation. Our management reviews these non-GAAP financial measurements when evaluating our financial performance and results of operations; therefore, we believe it is useful to provide\ninformation with respect to these non-GAAP measurements so as to share this perspective of management. Non-GAAP measurements do not have any standardized meaning, do not replace nor are\nsuperior to GAAP financial measurements and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measurements should be considered in the\ncontext with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measurements contained in this release include:\n• Adjusted revenues, operating income, operating expenses, income before income taxes, income tax expense, net income and diluted earnings per share. We disclose adjusted revenues, operating\nincome, operating expenses, income before income taxes, income tax expense, net income and diluted earnings per share as non-GAAP financial measurements in order to report our results\nexclusive of items that are non-recurring or not core to our operating business. We believe presenting these non-GAAP financialmeasurements provides investors with a consistent way to analyze\nour performance. These non-GAAP financial measurements exclude the following:\n• Legal and other related expenses covered by insurance:We have incurred $4.1 million of legal and other related expenses in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement that are covered by\ninsurance. GAAP requires that such covered expenses be reported gross in the income statement such that revenues are recorded to offset expenses incurred. We offset the revenues and\nrelated expenses when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as the gross presentation serves to overstate our revenuesand expenses recognized in the ordinary course of\nbusiness.\n• Gains or losses on financial instruments owned: We account for our financial instruments owned as trading securities which requires these instruments to be measured at fair value with\ngains and losses reported in net income. We exclude these items when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as the gains and losses introduce volatility in earnings and are not\ncore to our operating business.\n• Tax windfalls and shortfalls upon vesting of stock-based compensation awards: GAAP requires the recognition of tax windfalls and shortfalls within income tax expense. These items arise\nupon the vesting of stock-based compensation awards and the magnitude is directly correlated to the number of awards vesting/exercised as well as the difference between the price of\nour stock on the date the award was granted and the date the award vested or was exercised. We exclude these items when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as they\nintroduce volatility in earnings and are not core to our operating business.\n• Imputed interest on our payable to the Gold Bullion Holdings (Jersey) Limited (“GBH”):During the fourth quarter of 2023, we repurchased our Series C Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock\nwhich was convertible into approximately 13.1 million shares of WisdomTree common stock, from GBH, a subsidiary of the World Gold Council, for aggregate cash consideration of\napproximately $84.4 million. Under the terms of the transaction, we paid GBH $40.0 million on the closing date, with the remainder of the purchase price payable in equal annual\ninstallments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date, with no requirement to pay interest. Under US GAAP, the obligation is recorded at its present value utilizing a\nmarket rate of interest on the closing date of 7.0% and the corresponding discount is amortized as interest expense pursuant to the effective interest method of accounting over the life of\nthe obligation. We exclude this item when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as recognition of interest expense is non-cash and contrary to the stated terms of our\nobligation.\n• Other items: Loss on extinguishment of convertible notes, a civil money penalty in connection with SEC ESG Settlement, gains and losses recognized on our investments, changes in\ndeferred tax asset valuation allowance, expenses incurred in response to an activist campaign and impairments, are excluded whencalculating our non-GAAP financial measurements.\n• Adjusted effective income tax rate. We disclose our adjusted effective income tax rate as a non-GAAP financial measurement inorder to report our effective income tax rate exclusive of items that\nare non-recurring or not core to our operating business. We believe reporting our adjusted effective income tax rate provides investors with a consistent way to analyze our income taxes. Our\nadjusted effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing adjusted income tax expense by adjusted income before income taxes. See above for information regarding the items that are excluded.\n• Gross margin and gross margin percentage. We disclose our gross margin and gross margin percentage as non-GAAP financial measurements because we believe they provide investors with a\nconsistent way to analyze the amount we retain after paying third-party service providers to operate our ETPs. These measures also assist us in analyzing the profitability of our products. We\ndefine gross margin as total adjusted operating revenues less fund management and administration expenses. Gross margin percentage is calculated as gross margin divided by total adjusted\noperating revenues.\nWisdomTree –Q3/24 Results 20\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation to GAAP Results\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended\n($ in thousands) Sept. 30 June 30 Mar. 31 Dec. 31 Sept. 30 ($ in thousands) Sept. 30 June 30 Mar. 31 Dec. 31 Sept. 30\nUnaudited 2024 2024 2024 2023 2023 Unaudited 2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\nAdjusted net income and diluted earnings per share: Adjusted Total Operating Expenses\nNet (loss)/income, as reported $ (4,485) $ 21,759 $ 22,111 $ 19,077 $ 12,984\nTotal operating expenses $ 72,376 $ 73,523 $ 68,888 $ 64,809 $ 63,718\nAdd back: Loss on extinguishment of convertible notes, net of\n3 0,128 -

Operating revenues increased 25.2% from the third quarter of 2023 due to higher average AUM and higher other revenues attributable to our European listed exchange-traded products (“ETPs”).\n  * Our average advisory fee was 0.37%, 0.37% and 0.36% during the third quarter of 2024, the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, respectively.\n\n\n\n**Operating Expenses**\n\n  * Operating expenses decreased 1.6% from the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to lower incentive compensation, partly offset by higher fund management and administration expenses.\n  * Operating expenses increased 13.6% from the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher professional fees, which is inclusive of the legal and other related expected to be covered by insurance described above, as well as higher fund management and administration costs, incentive compensation and marketing expenses.\n\n\n\n**Other Income/(Expenses)**\n\n  * Interest expense increased 21.4% and 45.2% from the second quarter of 2024 and third quarter of 2023, respectively, due to a higher level of debt outstanding, partly offset by a lower average interest rate. The increase from the third quarter of 2023 also is due to the recognition of imputed interest on our obligation payable to Gold Bullion Holdings (Jersey) Limited (“GBH”), a subsidiary of the World Gold Council, in connection with our repurchase in November 2023 of our Series C Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock.\n  * Interest income increased 24.8% and 126.9% from the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, respectively, due to a higher level of interest-earning assets.\n  * During the third quarter of 2024, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of convertible notes of $30.6 million arising from the repurchase of $104.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 2028 Notes.\n  * Other losses and gains, net was a loss of $3.1 million for the third quarter of 2024. This included a $4.0 million civil money penalty in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement. Also included are net gains of $0.8 million and $0.6 million on our financial instruments owned and our investments, respectively. Gains and losses also generally arise from the sale of gold and crypto earned from management fees paid by our physically-backed gold and crypto ETPs, foreign exchange fluctuations and other miscellaneous items.\n\n\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\n  * Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 216.0%, resulting in income tax expense of $8.4 million. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to non-deductible loss on extinguishment of convertible notes, a non-deductible civil money penalty of $4.0 million and non-deductible executive compensation. These items were partly offset by a lower tax rate on foreign earnings.\n\n\n  * Our adjusted effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 23.9%(1).\n\n\n\n**NINE MONTH HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n  * Operating revenues increased 22.8% as compared to 2023 due to higher average AUM, higher other revenues attributable to our European listed ETPs and the recognition of $4.1 million of other revenue related to legal and other related expenses expected to be covered by insurance described above.\n  * Operating expenses increased 9.2% as compared to 2023 primarily due to higher incentive and stock-based compensation expense and increased headcount, fund management and administration costs, marketing expenses, sales and business development expenses, third-party distribution fees, as well as higher depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, also includes $4.1 million of legal and other related expenses expected to be covered by insurance that were incurred in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement. These increases were partly offset by lower contractual gold payments.\n  * Significant items reported in other income/(expense) in 2024 include: a loss on extinguishment of convertible notes of $30.6 million arising from the repurchase of $104.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 2028 Notes; a civil money penalty of $4.0 million in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement; an increase in interest expense of 15.8% due to imputed interest on our obligation payable to GBH and higher level of debt outstanding, partly offset by a lower average interest rate; an increase in interest income of 61.1% due to an increase in our interest-earning assets; net gains on our financial instruments owned of $2.6 million; and losses on our investments of $0.6 million. Gains and losses also generally arise from the sale of gold earned on management fees paid by our physically-backed gold ETPs, foreign exchange fluctuations and other miscellaneous items.\n  * Our effective income tax rate for 2024 was 35.6%, resulting in an income tax expense of $21.8 million. Our tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to non-deductible loss on extinguishment of convertible notes, a non-deductible civil money penalty of $4.0 million and non-deductible executive compensation. These items were partly offset by a lower tax rate on foreign earnings.\n\n\n\n**CONFERENCE CALL DIAL-IN AND WEBCAST DETAILS**\n\nWisdomTree will discuss its results and operational highlights during a live webcast on Friday, October 25, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. ET, which can be accessed using the following link: <https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=kZrhyzrd>.\n\nParticipants also can dial in using the following numbers: (877) 407-9210 or (201) 689-8049.

Our management reviews these non-GAAP financial measurements when evaluating our financial performance and results of operations; therefore, we believe it is useful to provide information with respect to these non-GAAP measurements so as to share this perspective of management. Non-GAAP measurements do not have any standardized meaning, do not replace nor are superior to GAAP financial measurements and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measurements should be considered in the context with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measurements contained in this press release include:\n\n**Adjusted Revenues, Operating Income, Operating Expenses, Income Before Income Taxes, Income Tax Expense, Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share**\n\nWe disclose adjusted revenues, operating income, operating expenses, income before income taxes, income tax expense, net income and diluted earnings per share as non-GAAP financial measurements in order to report our results exclusive of items that are non-recurring or not core to our operating business. We believe presenting these non-GAAP financial measurements provides investors with a consistent way to analyze our performance. These non-GAAP financial measurements exclude the following:\n\n**_Legal and other related expenses expected to be covered by insurance:_ **We have incurred $4.1 million of legal and other related expenses in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement that are expected to be covered by insurance. GAAP requires that such covered expenses be reported gross in the income statement such that revenues are recorded to offset expenses incurred. We offset the revenues and related expenses when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as the gross presentation serves to overstate our revenues and expenses recognized in the ordinary course of business.\n\n**_Gains or losses on financial instruments owned:_** We account for our financial instruments owned as trading securities, which requires these instruments to be measured at fair value with gains and losses reported in net income. We exclude these items when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as the gains and losses introduce volatility in earnings and are not core to our operating business.\n\n**_Tax windfalls and shortfalls upon vesting of stock-based compensation awards:_** GAAP requires the recognition of tax windfalls and shortfalls within income tax expense. These items arise upon the vesting of stock-based compensation awards and the magnitude is directly correlated to the number of awards vesting/exercised as well as the difference between the price of our stock on the date the award was granted and the date the award vested or was exercised. We exclude these items when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as they introduce volatility in earnings and are not core to our operating business.\n\n**_Imputed interest on our payable to the Gold Bullion Holdings (Jersey) Limited (“GBH”):_** During the fourth quarter of 2023, we repurchased our Series C Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, which was convertible into approximately 13.1 million shares of WisdomTree common stock, from GBH, a subsidiary of the World Gold Council, for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $84.4 million. Under the terms of the transaction, we paid GBH $40.0 million on the closing date, with the remainder of the purchase price payable in equal annual installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date, with no requirement to pay interest. Under US GAAP, the obligation is recorded at its present value utilizing a market rate of interest on the closing date of 7.0% and the corresponding discount is amortized as interest expense pursuant to the effective interest method of accounting over the life of the obligation. We exclude this item when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as recognition of interest expense is non-cash and contrary to the stated terms of our obligation.\n\n**_Other items:_** Losses on extinguishment of convertible notes, a civil money penalty in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement, gains and losses recognized on our investments, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowance, expenses incurred in response to an activist campaign and impairments are excluded when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements.\n\n**Adjusted Effective Income Tax Rate**\n\nWe disclose our adjusted effective income tax rate as a non-GAAP financial measurement in order to report our effective income tax rate exclusive of items that are non-recurring or not core to our operating business. We believe reporting our adjusted effective income tax rate provides investors with a consistent way to analyze our income taxes. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing adjusted income tax expense by adjusted income before income taxes. See above for information regarding the items that are excluded.\n\n**Gross Margin and Gross Margin Percentage**\n\nWe disclose our gross margin and gross margin percentage as non-GAAP financial measurements because we believe they provide investors with a consistent way to analyze the amount we retain after paying third-party service providers to operate our ETPs. These measures also assist us in analyzing the profitability of our products. We define gross margin as total adjusted operating revenues less fund management and administration expenses. Gross margin percentage is calculated as gross margin divided by total adjusted operating revenues.\n\n**GAAP to NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION (CONSOLIDATED)****(in thousands)****(Unaudited)**\n\n**Three

our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which are, in some cases, beyond our control and could materially affect results. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, the risks described below. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties occur, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual events or results may vary significantly from those implied or projected by the forward-looking statements. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance. You should read this press release completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.\n\nIn particular, forward-looking statements in this press release may include statements about:\n\n  * anticipated trends, conditions and investor sentiment in the global markets and ETPs;\n  * anticipated levels of inflows into and outflows out of our ETPs;\n  * our ability to deliver favorable rates of return to investors;\n  * competition in our business;\n  * whether we will experience future growth;\n  * our ability to develop new products and services and their potential for success;\n  * our ability to maintain current vendors or find new vendors to provide services to us at favorable costs;\n  * our ability to successfully implement our strategy relating to digital assets and blockchain-enabled financial services, including WisdomTree Prime® and WisdomTree Connect™, and achieve its objectives;\n  * our ability to successfully operate and expand our business in non-U.S. markets;\n  * the effect of laws and regulations that apply to our business; and\n  * actions of activist stockholders.\n\n\n\nOur business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, including without limitation:\n\n  * declining prices of securities, gold and other precious metals and other commodities and changes in interest rates and general market conditions can adversely affect our business by reducing the market value of the assets we manage or causing WisdomTree ETP investors to sell their fund shares and trigger redemptions;\n  * fluctuations in the amount and mix of our AUM, whether caused by disruptions in the financial markets or otherwise, including but not limited to events such as a pandemic or war, geopolitical conflicts, political events, acts of terrorism and other matters beyond our control, may negatively impact revenues and operating margins, and may impede our ability to refinance our debt upon maturity or increase the cost of borrowing upon a refinancing;\n  * competitive pressures could reduce revenues and profit margins;\n  * we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of products, and, as a result, our operating results are particularly exposed to investor sentiment toward investing in the products’ strategies and our ability to maintain the AUM of these products, as well as the performance of these products and market-specific and political and economic risk;\n  * a significant portion of our AUM is held in products with exposure to U.S. and international developed markets, and we therefore have exposure to domestic and foreign market conditions and are subject to currency exchange rate risks;\n  * withdrawals or broad changes in investments in our ETPs by investors with significant positions may negatively impact revenues and operating margins;\n  * we face increased operational, regulatory, financial and other risks as a result of conducting our business internationally, and as we expand our digital assets product offerings and services beyond our existing ETP business;\n  * many of our ETPs have a limited track record, and poor investment performance could cause our revenues to decline;\n  * we depend on third parties to provide many critical services to operate our business and our ETPs. The failure of key vendors to adequately provide such services could materially affect our operating business and harm WisdomTree ETP investors; and\n  * actions of activist stockholders against us, which have been costly and may be disruptive and cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.\n\n\n\nOther factors, such as general economic conditions, including currency exchange rate fluctuations, also may have an effect on the results of our operations. For a more complete description of the risks noted above and other risks that could cause our actual results to differ from our current expectations, see “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC.\n\nThe forward-looking statements in this press release represent our views as of the date of this press release. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments may cause our views to change. However, while we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. Therefore, these forward-looking statements do not represent our views as of any date other than the date of this press release.\n\nCategory: Business Update\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241025121692/en/>\n\n**Investor Relations** Jeremy Campbell +1.917.267.3859 jeremy.campbell@wisdomtree.com\n\n**Media Relations** Natasha Ramsammy +1.917.267.3798 nramsammy@wisdomtree.com / wisdomtree@fullyvested.com\n\nSource: WisdomTree, Inc.\n\nReleased October 25, 2024\n\n  * [ Email Alerts ](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [ Company Profile ](/company-information)\n  * [ Contacts ](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [ RSS News Feed ](https://ir.wisdomtree.com/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n"

The increase from the third quarter of 2023 also is\ndue to the recognition of imputed interest on our obligation payable to Gold Bullion Holdings (Jersey) Limited (“GBH”), a\nsubsidiary of the World Gold Council, in connection with our repurchase in November 2023 of our Series C Non-Voting\nConvertible Preferred Stock.\n• Interest income increased 24.8% and 126.9% from the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, respectively, due to a\nhigher level of interest-earning assets.\n• During the third quarter of 2024, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of convertible notes of $30.6 million arising from the\nrepurchase of $104.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 2028 Notes.\n• Other losses and gains, net was a loss of $3.1 million for the third quarter of 2024. This included a $4.0 million civil money\npenalty in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement. Also included are net gains of $0.8 million and $0.6 million on our financial\ninstruments owned and our investments, respectively. Gains and losses also generally arise from the sale of gold and crypto\nearned from management fees paid by our physically-backed gold and crypto ETPs, foreign exchange fluctuations and other\nmiscellaneous items.\nIncome Taxes\n• Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 216.0%, resulting in income tax expense of $8.4 million. The\neffective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to non-deductible loss on extinguishment of\nconvertible notes, a non-deductible civil money penalty of $4.0 million and non-deductible executive compensation. These items\nwere partly offset by a lower tax rate on foreign earnings.\n• Our adjusted effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 23.9%(1).\nNINE MONTH HIGHLIGHTS\n• Operating revenues increased 22.8% as compared to 2023 due to higher average AUM, higher other revenues attributable to our\nEuropean listed ETPs and the recognition of $4.1 million of other revenue related to legal and other related expenses expected to\nbe covered by insurance described above.\n• Operating expenses increased 9.2% as compared to 2023 primarily due to higher incentive and stock-based compensation expense\nand increased headcount, fund management and administration costs, marketing expenses, sales and business development\nexpenses, third-party distribution fees, as well as higher depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, also includes $4.1 million of legal and other related expenses expected to be covered by\ninsurance that were incurred in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement. These increases were partly offset by lower contractual\ngold payments.\n• Significant items reported in other income/(expense) in 2024 include: a loss on extinguishment of convertible notes of $30.6\nmillion arising from the repurchase of $104.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 2028 Notes; a civil money penalty of\n$4.0 million in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement; an increase in interest expense of 15.8% due to imputed interest on our\nobligation payable to GBH and higher level of debt outstanding, partly offset by a lower average interest rate; an increase in\ninterest income of 61.1% due to an increase in our interest-earning assets; net gains on our financial instruments owned of $2.6\n5\nmillion; and losses on our investments of $0.6 million. Gains and losses also generally arise from the sale of gold earned on\nmanagement fees paid by our physically-backed gold ETPs, foreign exchange fluctuations and other miscellaneous items.\n• Our effective income tax rate for 2024 was 35.6%, resulting in an income tax expense of $21.8 million. Our tax rate differs from\nthe federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to non-deductible loss on extinguishment of convertible notes, a non-deductible\ncivil money penalty of $4.0 million and non-deductible executive compensation. These items were partly offset by a lower tax\nrate on foreign earnings.\nCONFERENCE CALL DIAL-IN AND WEBCAST DETAILS\nWisdomTree will discuss its results and operational highlights during a live webcast on Friday, October 25, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. ET,\nwhich can be accessed using the following link: https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=kZrhyzrd.\nParticipants also can dial in using the following numbers: (877) 407-9210 or (201) 689-8049.

Our management reviews these non-GAAP financial\nmeasurements when evaluating our financial performance and results of operations; therefore, we believe it is useful to provide\ninformation with respect to these non-GAAP measurements so as to share this perspective of management. Non-GAAP measurements\ndo not have any standardized meaning, do not replace nor are superior to GAAP financial measurements and are unlikely to be\ncomparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measurements should be considered in the\ncontext with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measurements contained in this press release include:\nAdjusted Revenues, Operating Income, Operating Expenses, Income Before Income Taxes, Income Tax Expense, Net Income\nand Diluted Earnings per Share\nWe disclose adjusted revenues, operating income, operating expenses, income before income taxes, income tax expense, net\nincome and diluted earnings per share as non-GAAP financial measurements in order to report our results exclusive of items that are\nnon-recurring or not core to our operating business. We believe presenting these non-GAAP financial measurements provides\ninvestors with a consistent way to analyze our performance. These non-GAAP financial measurements exclude the following:\nLegal and other related expenses expected to be covered by insurance: We have incurred $4.1 million of legal and other related\nexpenses in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement that are expected to be covered by insurance. GAAP requires that such covered\nexpenses be reported gross in the income statement such that revenues are recorded to offset expenses incurred. We offset the\nrevenues and related expenses when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as the gross presentation serves to overstate\nour revenues and expenses recognized in the ordinary course of business.\nGains or losses on financial instruments owned: We account for our financial instruments owned as trading securities, which\nrequires these instruments to be measured at fair value with gains and losses reported in net income. We exclude these items when\ncalculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as the gains and losses introduce volatility in earnings and are not core to our\noperating business.\nTax windfalls and shortfalls upon vesting of stock-based compensation awards: GAAP requires the recognition of tax windfalls\nand shortfalls within income tax expense. These items arise upon the vesting of stock-based compensation awards and the magnitude\nis directly correlated to the number of awards vesting/exercised as well as the difference between the price of our stock on the date the\naward was granted and the date the award vested or was exercised. We exclude these items when calculating our non-GAAP financial\nmeasurements as they introduce volatility in earnings and are not core to our operating business.\nImputed interest on our payable to the Gold Bullion Holdings (Jersey) Limited (“GBH”): During the fourth quarter of 2023, we\nrepurchased our Series C Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, which was convertible into approximately 13.1 million shares of\nWisdomTree common stock, from GBH, a subsidiary of the World Gold Council, for aggregate cash consideration of approximately\n$84.4 million. Under the terms of the transaction, we paid GBH $40.0 million on the closing date, with the remainder of the purchase\nprice payable in equal annual installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date, with no requirement to pay\ninterest. Under US GAAP, the obligation is recorded at its present value utilizing a market rate of interest on the closing date of 7.0%\nand the corresponding discount is amortized as interest expense pursuant to the effective interest method of accounting over the life of\nthe obligation. We exclude this item when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as recognition of interest expense is\nnon-cash and contrary to the stated terms of our obligation.\nOther items: Losses on extinguishment of convertible notes, a civil money penalty in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement,\ngains and losses recognized on our investments, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowance, expenses incurred in response to an\nactivist campaign and impairments are excluded when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements.\nAdjusted Effective Income Tax Rate\nWe disclose our adjusted effective income tax rate as a non-GAAP financial measurement in order to report our effective income\ntax rate exclusive of items that are non-recurring or not core to our operating business. We believe reporting our adjusted effective\nincome tax rate provides investors with a consistent way to analyze our income taxes. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is\ncalculated by dividing adjusted income tax expense by adjusted income before income taxes. See above for information regarding the\nitems that are excluded.\nGross Margin and Gross Margin Percentage\nWe disclose our gross margin and gross margin percentage as non-GAAP financial measurements because we believe they\nprovide investors with a consistent way to analyze the amount we retain after paying third-party service providers to operate our ETPs.\nThese measures also assist us in analyzing the profitability of our products. We define gross margin as total adjusted operating\nrevenues less fund management and administration expenses. Gross margin percentage is calculated as gross margin divided by total\nadjusted operating revenues.\n11\nGAAP to NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION (CONSOLIDATED)\n(in thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nSept. 30, June 30, Mar. 31, Dec. 31, Sept. 30,\nAdjusted Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share: 2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\nNet loss, as reported .............................................................................. $ (4,485) $ 21,759 $ 22,111 $ 19,077 $ 12,984\nAdd back: Loss on extinguishment of convertible notes, net of\nincome taxes ............................................................................. 30,128 — — — —\nAdd back: Civil money penalty in connection with SEC ESG\nSettlement ................................................................................ 4,000 — — — —\n(Deduct)/add back: (Gains)/losses on financial instruments\nowned, net of income taxes ......................................................

regarding our results as determined by GAAP, we also disclose certain non-GAAP information which we believe provides useful and meaningful\ninformation. Our management reviews these non-GAAP financial measurements when evaluating our financial performance and results of operations; therefore, we believe it is useful to provide\ninformation with respect to these non-GAAP measurements so as to share this perspective of management. Non-GAAP measurements do not have any standardized meaning, do not replace nor are\nsuperior to GAAP financial measurements and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measurements should be considered in the\ncontext with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measurements contained in this release include:\n• Adjusted revenues, operating income, operating expenses, income before income taxes, income tax expense, net income and diluted earnings per share. We disclose adjusted revenues, operating\nincome, operating expenses, income before income taxes, income tax expense, net income and diluted earnings per share as non-GAAP financial measurements in order to report our results\nexclusive of items that are non-recurring or not core to our operating business. We believe presenting these non-GAAP financialmeasurements provides investors with a consistent way to analyze\nour performance. These non-GAAP financial measurements exclude the following:\n• Legal and other related expenses covered by insurance:We have incurred $4.1 million of legal and other related expenses in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement that are covered by\ninsurance. GAAP requires that such covered expenses be reported gross in the income statement such that revenues are recorded to offset expenses incurred. We offset the revenues and\nrelated expenses when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as the gross presentation serves to overstate our revenuesand expenses recognized in the ordinary course of\nbusiness.\n• Gains or losses on financial instruments owned: We account for our financial instruments owned as trading securities which requires these instruments to be measured at fair value with\ngains and losses reported in net income. We exclude these items when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as the gains and losses introduce volatility in earnings and are not\ncore to our operating business.\n• Tax windfalls and shortfalls upon vesting of stock-based compensation awards: GAAP requires the recognition of tax windfalls and shortfalls within income tax expense. These items arise\nupon the vesting of stock-based compensation awards and the magnitude is directly correlated to the number of awards vesting/exercised as well as the difference between the price of\nour stock on the date the award was granted and the date the award vested or was exercised. We exclude these items when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as they\nintroduce volatility in earnings and are not core to our operating business.\n• Imputed interest on our payable to the Gold Bullion Holdings (Jersey) Limited (“GBH”):During the fourth quarter of 2023, we repurchased our Series C Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock\nwhich was convertible into approximately 13.1 million shares of WisdomTree common stock, from GBH, a subsidiary of the World Gold Council, for aggregate cash consideration of\napproximately $84.4 million. Under the terms of the transaction, we paid GBH $40.0 million on the closing date, with the remainder of the purchase price payable in equal annual\ninstallments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date, with no requirement to pay interest. Under US GAAP, the obligation is recorded at its present value utilizing a\nmarket rate of interest on the closing date of 7.0% and the corresponding discount is amortized as interest expense pursuant to the effective interest method of accounting over the life of\nthe obligation. We exclude this item when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as recognition of interest expense is non-cash and contrary to the stated terms of our\nobligation.\n• Other items: Loss on extinguishment of convertible notes, a civil money penalty in connection with SEC ESG Settlement, gains and losses recognized on our investments, changes in\ndeferred tax asset valuation allowance, expenses incurred in response to an activist campaign and impairments, are excluded whencalculating our non-GAAP financial measurements.\n• Adjusted effective income tax rate. We disclose our adjusted effective income tax rate as a non-GAAP financial measurement inorder to report our effective income tax rate exclusive of items that\nare non-recurring or not core to our operating business. We believe reporting our adjusted effective income tax rate provides investors with a consistent way to analyze our income taxes. Our\nadjusted effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing adjusted income tax expense by adjusted income before income taxes. See above for information regarding the items that are excluded.\n• Gross margin and gross margin percentage. We disclose our gross margin and gross margin percentage as non-GAAP financial measurements because we believe they provide investors with a\nconsistent way to analyze the amount we retain after paying third-party service providers to operate our ETPs. These measures also assist us in analyzing the profitability of our products. We\ndefine gross margin as total adjusted operating revenues less fund management and administration expenses. Gross margin percentage is calculated as gross margin divided by total adjusted\noperating revenues.\nWisdomTree –Q3/24 Results 20\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation to GAAP Results\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended\n($ in thousands) Sept. 30 June 30 Mar. 31 Dec. 31 Sept. 30 ($ in thousands) Sept. 30 June 30 Mar. 31 Dec. 31 Sept. 30\nUnaudited 2024 2024 2024 2023 2023 Unaudited 2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\nAdjusted net income and diluted earnings per share: Adjusted Total Operating Expenses\nNet (loss)/income, as reported $ (4,485) $ 21,759 $ 22,111 $ 19,077 $ 12,984\nTotal operating expenses $ 72,376 $ 73,523 $ 68,888 $ 64,809 $ 63,718\nAdd back: Loss on extinguishment of convertible notes, net of\n3 0,128 -

BUSINESS\nOur Company\nWe are a global financial innovator, offering a well-diversified suite of exchange traded products, or ETPs, models, solutions and products\nleveraging blockchain technology. We empower investors and consumers to shape their future and support financial professionals to better serve their\nclients and grow their businesses. We are leveraging the latest financial infrastructure to create products that provide access, transparency and an\nenhanced user experience. Building on our heritage of innovation, we are also developing and have launched next-generation digital products,\nservices and structures, including digital or blockchain-enabled mutual funds (“Digital Funds”) and tokenized assets, as well as our blockchain-native\ndigital wallet, WisdomTree Prime, which is currently available in the U.S. in 38 states, representing approximately 70% of the U.S. population.\nWe had approximately $100.1 billion in assets under management, or AUM, as of December 31, 2023. Our family of ETPs includes products\nthat provide exposure to equities, fixed income, commodities, leveraged-and-inverse, currency, alternatives and cryptocurrency strategies. We have\nlaunched many first-to-market products and pioneered alternative weighting we call “Modern Alpha,” which combines the outperformance potential\nof active management with the benefits of passive management to offer investors cost-effective funds that are built to perform. Most of our equity-\nbased funds employ a fundamentally weighted investment methodology, which weights securities based on factors such as dividends, earnings or\ninvestment factors, whereas most other industry indexes use a capitalization weighted methodology. These products are distributed through all major\nchannels in the asset management industry, including banks, brokerage firms, registered investment advisers, institutional investors, private wealth\nmanagers and online brokers primarily through our sales force. We believe technology is altering the way financial advisors conduct business and\nthrough our Advisor and Portfolio Solutions programs we offer technology-enabled and research-driven solutions including portfolio construction,\nasset allocation, practice management services and digital tools to help financial advisors address technology challenges and grow and scale their\nbusinesses.\nWe are at the forefront of innovation and believe that tokenization and leveraging the utility of blockchain technology is the next evolution in\nfinancial services. We are building the foundation that we believe will allow us to lead in this coming evolution. WisdomTree Prime, our blockchain-\nnative digital wallet, positions us to expand our blockchain-enabled financial product and services offerings with a new direct-to-consumer channel\nwhere spending, saving and investing are united. As we continue to pursue our digital assets strategy, we are embracing what we refer to as\n“responsible DeFi,” which we believe upholds the foundational principles of regulation in this innovative and quickly evolving space. We believe that\nour expansion into digital assets and blockchain-enabled finance complements our existing core competencies in a holistic manner and will diversify\nour revenue streams and contribute to our growth.\nWe were incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on September 19, 1985 as Financial Data Systems, Inc. and were ultimately\nrenamed WisdomTree, Inc. on November 7, 2022.\n2\nTable of Contents\nAssets Under Management\nWisdomTree ETPs\nWe offer ETPs covering equity, fixed income, commodities, leveraged-and-inverse, currency, alternatives and cryptocurrency. The chart below\nsets forth the asset mix of our ETPs at December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023:\nOur Operating and Financial Results\nWe operate as an ETP sponsor and asset manager, providing investment advisory services globally through our subsidiaries in the U.S. and\nEurope.\nU.S. Listed ETFs\nThe AUM of our U.S. listed exchange traded funds, or U.S. listed ETFs, increased from $56.0 billion at December 31, 2022 to $72.5 billion at\nDecember 31, 2023 due to net inflows and market appreciation.\n3\nTable of Contents\nEuropean Listed ETPs\nThe AUM of our European listed (including internationally cross-listed) ETPs, or European listed ETPs, increased from $26.0 billion at\nDecember 31, 2022 to $27.6 billion at December 31, 2023, due to market appreciation, partly offset by net outflows.\nConsolidated Operating Results\nThe following table sets forth our revenues and net income for the last three years.\n• Revenues – We recorded operating revenues of $349.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, up 15.8% from the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 due to higher average AUM and higher other income from large flows from some of our European products, partly\noffset by a lower average advisory fee.\n• Expenses – Total operating expenses increased 8.4% from the year ended December 31, 2022 to $261.5 million primarily due to higher\nstock-based compensation and headcount, fund management and administration costs, professional fees, marketing expenses, third-party\ndistribution fees, sales and business development expenses and other expenses. These increases were partly offset by the termination of\nour deferred consideration—gold payments obligation on May 10, 2023.\n• Other Income/(Expenses) – Other income/(expenses) includes interest income and interest expense, gains and losses on\nrevaluation/termination of deferred consideration—gold payments, impairments and other losses and gains. See “Other\nIncome/(Expenses)” in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional\ninformation.\n• Net income – We reported net income of $50.7 million and $102.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nSee “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” for additional information.\n4\nTable of Contents\nSeasonality\nWe believe seasonal fluctuations in the asset management industry are common, however such trends are generally masked by global market\nevents and market volatility in general. Therefore, period-to-period comparisons of our or the industry’s flows and operating results may not be\nmeaningful or indicative of results in future periods.\nOur Industry – ETPs\nWe believe ETPs have been one of the most innovative investment products to emerge in the last two decades in the asset management\nindustry. As of December 31, 2023, aggregate AUM of ETPs globally was $11.6 trillion.\nThe chart below reflects the AUM of the global ETP industry since 2006:\nSource: ETFGI LLP\nAs of December 31, 2023, we were the fourteenth largest ETP sponsor globally based on AUM.\nGLOBAL RANKING\nAUM\nRank ETP Sponsor ($ in billions)\n1 iShares 3,552\n2 Vanguard 2,505\n3 State Street 1,303\n4 Invesco 543\n5 Charles Schwab 319\n6 Nomura 230\n7 Amundi 229\n8 Xtrackers 207\n9 First Trust 155\n10 JPMorgan 153\n11 Dimensional 118\n12 Nikko AM 106\n13 Daiwa 101\n14 WisdomTree 100\n15 UBS 97\nSource: Morningstar\nExchange traded funds, or ETFs, have become more popular among a broad range of investors as they come to understand the benefits of ETFs\nand use them for a variety of purposes and strategies, including low-cost index investing and asset allocation, access to specific asset classes,\nprotective hedging, income generation, arbitrage opportunities and diversification.\n5\nTable of Contents\nWhile ETFs are similar to mutual funds in many respects, they also have some important differences:\n• Transparency. ETFs disclose the composition of their underlying portfolios on a daily basis, unlike mutual funds, which typically\ndisclose their holdings every 90 days.\n• Intraday trading, hedging strategies and complex orders. Like stocks, ETFs and other exchange-traded products can be bought and sold\non exchanges throughout the trading day at market prices. ETFs update the indicative values of their underlying portfolios every 15\nseconds. As publicly-traded securities, ETF shares can be purchased on margin and sold short, enabling the use of hedging strategies, and\ntraded using limit orders, allowing investors to specify the price points at which they are willing to trade.\n• Tax efficiency. In the U.S., whenever a mutual fund or ETF realizes a capital gain that is not balanced by a realized loss, it must distribute\nthe capital gain to its shareholders. These gains are taxable to all shareholders, even those who reinvest the gain distributions in additional\nshares of the fund. However, most ETFs typically redeem their shares through “in-kind” redemptions in which low-cost securities are\ntransferred out of the ETF in exchange for fund shares in a non-taxable transaction. By using this process, ETFs can avoid the transaction\nfees and tax impact incurred by mutual funds that sell securities to generate cash to pay out redemptions.\n• Uniform pricing. From a cost perspective, ETFs are one of the most equitable investment products on the market. Investors in a\nU.S. listed ETF pay identical advisory fees regardless of the investors’ size, structure or sophistication. Unlike mutual funds, U.S. listed\nETFs generally do not have different share classes or different expense structures for retail and institutional clients and ETFs typically are\nnot sold with sales loads or 12b-1 fees. In many cases, ETFs offer lower expense ratios than comparable mutual funds.\nETFs are used in various ways by a range of investors, from conservative to speculative uses including:\n• Low-cost index investing. ETFs provide exposure to a variety of broad-based indexes across equities, fixed income, commodities and\nother asset classes and strategies, and can be used as both long-term portfolio holdings or short-term trading tools. ETFs offer an efficient\nand less costly method by which to gain exposure to indexes as compared to individual stock ownership.\n• Improved access to specific asset classes. Investors often use ETFs to gain access to specific market sectors or regions around the world\nor a particular asset, such as physical gold or crypto, by investing in an ETF that holds a portfolio of securities in that sector, region or\nasset rather than gaining exposure by purchasing individual securities, physical commodities or currencies.\n• Asset allocation. Investors seeking to invest in various asset classes to develop an asset allocation model in a cost-effective manner can\ndo so easily with ETFs, which offer broad exposure to various asset classes in a single security.\n• Protective hedging. Investors seeking to protect their portfolios may use ETFs as a hedge against unexpected declines in prices of\nsecurities arising from market movements and changes in currency and interest rates.\n• Income generation. Investors seeking to obtain income from their portfolios may buy fixed income ETFs that typically distribute\nmonthly income or dividend-paying ETFs that encompass a basket of dividend-paying stocks rather than buying individual stocks.\n• Speculative investing. Investors with a specific directional opinion about a market sector may choose to buy or sell (long or short) an\nETF covering or leveraging that market sector.\n• Arbitrage. Sophisticated investors may use ETFs to exploit perceived value differences between the ETF and the value of the ETF’s\nunderlying portfolio of securities.\n• Diversification. By definition, ETFs represent a basket of securities and each fund may contain hundreds or even thousands of different\nindividual securities. The “instant diversification” of ETFs provides investors with broad exposure to an asset class, market sector or\ngeography.\nThe ETF sector of the asset management industry continues to demonstrate that it is favored among investors. According to Morningstar, from\nJanuary 1, 2021 through December 31, 2023, equity ETFs have generated positive inflows of approximately $1.9 trillion, while long-term equity\nmutual funds have generated outflows of approximately ($830) billion. In addition, ETF fixed income flows are benefiting from a broader range of\ninvestors gravitating toward fixed income products in the ETF structure. We believe this trend is due to the inherent benefits of ETFs – transparency,\nliquidity and tax efficiency.\n6\nTable of Contents\nWe believe that our growth, and the growth of the industry in which we operate, will continue to be driven by the following factors:\n• Education and greater investor awareness. Over the last several years, ETPs have been taking a greater share of inflows and AUM from\nmutual funds. We believe investors have become more aware of some of the deficiencies of mutual funds and other financial products and\nare increasing their focus on important characteristics of their traditional investments – namely transparency, tradability, liquidity, tax\nefficiency and fees. Their attention and education focused on these important investment characteristics may be one of the drivers of the\nshift in inflows from traditional mutual funds to ETPs. We believe these products will continue to take market share from traditional\nmutual funds and other financial products or structures such as hedge funds, separate accounts and individual stocks as investors continue\nto become more aware and educated about ETPs and their benefits.\n• Move to fee-based models. Financial advisors are shifting their business model from one that is “transaction-based,” that is, based on\ncommissions for trades or receiving sales loads, to a “fee-based” approach, where an overall fee is charged based on the value of\nAUM. This fee-based approach lends itself to the advisor selecting lower-fee financial products, and in our opinion, better aligns advisers\nwith the interests of their clients. Since ETFs generally charge lower fees than mutual funds, we believe this model shift will benefit the\nETF industry.\n• Innovative product offerings. ETPs are now available for virtually every asset class including equities, fixed income, commodities,\nleveraged-and-inverse, currencies, alternative strategies and cryptocurrencies (with greater access in markets outside the U.S.). However,\nwe believe that there remain substantial areas for sponsors to continue to innovate, including cryptocurrency, liquid alternative, thematic\nand other strategies. We also believe the further expansion of ETPs will fuel additional growth and investments from investors who\ntypically access these products through hedge funds, separate accounts, stock investments or the futures and commodity markets.\n• Changing demographics. As the “baby boomer” generation continues to mature and retire, we expect that there will be a greater demand\nfor a broad range of investment solutions, with an emphasis on income generation and principal protection, and that more of these\ninvestors will seek advice from professional financial advisors. We believe these financial advisors will migrate more of their clients’\nportfolios to ETPs due to their lower fees, better fit within fee-based models, and their ability to provide access to more diverse market\nsectors, improve multi-asset class allocation, and be used for different investment strategies, including income generation. Overall, we\nbelieve ETFs are well-suited to meet the needs of this large and important group of investors. In addition, since many younger investors\nand financial advisors have demonstrated a preference for the ETP structure over traditional product structures, we believe that wealth\ntransfers from one generation to another will also have a positive effect on ETP industry growth.\n• International markets. We believe the growth of ETPs is a global phenomenon. While the U.S. currently represents the vast majority of\nglobal ETP assets, many of the same growth drivers in the U.S. market are also taking hold in global markets.\nOur Industry – Digital Assets\nWe believe that digital assets, tokenization and blockchain technology will help to innovate and evolve financial services from an investments,\nsavings, payments and operational perspective. The digital assets industry has picked up significant momentum among market participants, including\nasset management firms, fintech firms, banks, broker-dealers and investors, which has spurred unprecedented adoption, growth and innovation. We\nbelieve that the benefits of blockchain technology can provide for the best product structures and executions in financial services. We expect that over\ntime, benefits will include the following:\n• Transparency. Blockchain technology employs mutualized standards, protocols and shared processes, acting as a single shared source of\ntruth for network participants. The increased transparency among financial institutions and market participants may also improve\nregulatory reporting and monitoring.\n• Economic benefits. Automated, more efficient processes may lead to reduced operational, transactional and infrastructure costs.\n7\nTable of Contents\n• Streamlined processes. Automation and overall operational efficiency increases with the use of blockchain technology. It enables real-\ntime (near instant) settlement, auditability and reporting; and it reduces processing times, the potential for error and delay, and the\nnumber of steps and intermediaries required to achieve the same levels of confidence in traditional processes, thereby reducing\ncounterparty risks.\n• New products and potential markets. Blockchain technology can make fractionalized ownership of real-world assets and tokenized\neconomies a reality, with the same, if not better, level of security and scalability found in traditional finance.\n• Programmable capabilities. Through the creation and execution of smart contracts, governance protocols, compliance, data privacy,\ncustomer identification (e.g., KYC/AML), system incentives and features can be programmed or built into the assets themselves.\n• Scalability. Blockchain technology supports interoperability between private and public blockchains, thereby expanding the global reach\nand resiliency of transactions.\nThe laws and regulatory frameworks pertaining to digital assets and blockchain technology continue to evolve with an increase in scope and\ncomplexity. Contemporaneously, there has been heightened regulatory scrutiny of digital asset activities, which include material litigation and\nregulatory proceedings (e.g., enforcement actions) by government authorities, an increase in cybersecurity incidents leading to the theft or severe loss\nof assets, and insolvency proceedings (including bankruptcies) resulting from a variety of factors including poor risk management and oversight\ncontrols, speculative or risky behavior, and/or fraud or the misappropriation of customer funds. As a financial innovator seeking to bridge the gap\nbetween traditional finance and blockchain-enabled finance, we are embracing what we refer to as “responsible DeFi” for our digital assets and\nblockchain-enabled products and services, which we believe upholds the foundational principles of regulation in this innovative and rapidly evolving\nspace. We are committed to being a trusted provider of innovative products and services guided by proactive engagement and continued collaboration\nwith current and new regulators.\nCompetition in the digital assets industry on a global basis is increasing, ranging from large, established financial incumbents to smaller, early-\nstage financial technology providers and companies. There are jurisdictions with more stringent and robust regulatory and compliance requirements\nthan others, which could impact the ability of a company to compete in the digital assets industry. We believe that we will continue to successfully\ncompete in the digital assets industry by offering innovative products through digital asset exposures, generating strong after-fee performance and\ntrack records, embracing regulation, developing strategic partnerships with participants in the digital assets ecosystem, promoting thought leadership\nand investor education or awareness, building upon our brand and attracting and retaining talented employees. We remain focused on providing the\nbest structures and executions in financial services through digital assets and blockchain technology.\nOur Competitive Strengths\n• Well-positioned in large and growing markets. We believe that ETPs are well positioned to grow significantly faster than the asset\nmanagement industry as a whole, making our focus on ETPs an advantage over traditional asset management firms. We also believe that\nasset tokenization will be the future of financial services and expect our early-mover position in digital assets will serve to solidify our\nposition as a forward-thinking innovator and industry leader in blockchain-enabled financial services.\n• Strong, seasoned and creative management team. We have built a strong and dedicated senior leadership team. Most of our leadership\nteam has significant ETP or financial services industry experience in fund operations, regulatory and compliance oversight, product\ndevelopment and management or marketing and communications. We also continue to expand our global digital assets team, which is\nfocused on growing existing and developing new investment products, indexes and strategies that provide exposure to digital assets,\nalong with new blockchain-enabled products and services across global markets. Whether through ETPs, digital assets or decentralized\nfinance, we will continue to be a trusted provider of innovative products and services guided by proactive engagement and regulatory\ncollaboration. We believe that our team has demonstrated an ability to innovate as well as recognize and respond to market opportunities\nand effectively execute our strategy and has a proven track record including developing an ETP sponsor from the ground up despite\nsignificant competitive regulatory and operational barriers.\n8\nTable of Contents\n• Strong performance. We create our own indexes, most of which weight companies in our equity ETFs by a measure of fundamental\nvalue and are rebalanced annually. By contrast, traditional indexes are market capitalization weighted and tend to track the momentum of\nthe market. We also offer actively managed ETFs, as well as ETFs based on third-party indexes. In evaluating the performance of our\nU.S. listed equity, fixed income and alternative ETFs against actively managed and index based mutual funds and ETFs, over 80% of our\nU.S. listed AUM covered by Morningstar were in the top two quartiles of peer performance in the 3-year and 10-year timeframes. In\naddition, approximately 50% of our U.S. listed AUM is rated 4- or 5-star by Morningstar.\n• Differentiated product set, powered by innovation and performance. Our products span a variety of traditional and high growth asset\nclasses covering equity, fixed income, commodity, leveraged-and-inverse, currency, alternative strategies and cryptocurrency, and include\nboth passive and actively managed funds. We are also developing and have launched next-generation digital products, services and\nstructures, including Digital Funds and tokenized assets. Our innovations include the following:\n• the launch of the WisdomTree Prime mobile application, our blockchain-native digital wallet that serves as a new direct-to-consumer\nchannel positioning us as an early mover and industry leader in blockchain-enabled financial services; the application is currently\navailable in 38 states in the U.S., representing approximately 70% of the U.S. population;\n• the tokenization of real-world assets like physical gold (i.e., gold tokens) and U.S. dollars (i.e., dollar tokens);\n• 13 Digital Funds accessible through WisdomTree Prime including a government money market fund and other digital funds offering\nasset allocation, fixed income and equity exposures that use blockchain technology to maintain a secondary record of their respective\nshares on one or more blockchains (e.g., Stellar or Ethereum);\n• among the first to launch a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S.;\n• the first ETF to add bitcoin futures exposure;\n• the first gold and oil ETPs via our acquisition of the European exchange-traded commodity, currency and leveraged-and-inverse\nbusiness of ETFS Capital Limited, or ETFS Capital. Throughout this Report, we refer to the acquired business as ETFS and the\nacquisition as the ETFS Acquisition;\n• the first emerging markets small-cap equity ETF;\n• the first actively managed currency ETF;\n• the first ETF to provide investors with access to the Additional Tier 1 Contingent Convertible, or CoCo, bond market;\n• one of the first international local currency denominated fixed income ETFs;\n• the first managed futures strategy ETF;\n• the first currency hedged international equity ETFs in the U.S.;\n• the first 90/60 balanced ETF;\n• the first multifactor ETFs incorporating dynamic currency hedging as a factor; and\n• the first smart beta corporate bond suite.\nOur product development strategy utilizes our Modern Alpha approach, which combines the outperformance potential of active\nmanagement with the benefits of passive management to offer investors cost-effective funds that are built to perform. Self-indexing is a\nsignificant component of this approach. Many of our products are based on proprietary WisdomTree indexes which we believe gives us\nseveral advantages. First, it minimizes our third-party index licensing fees, which increases our profitability. Second, because we develop\nour own intellectual property, we are intimately familiar with our strategies and able to effectively communicate their value proposition in\nthe market with research content and support. Third, it can enhance our speed to market and first mover advantage. Fourth, because these\nindexes are proprietary to WisdomTree, we may face similar competition, but we never face exact competition. Our expertise in product\ndevelopment combined with our self-indexing capabilities provides a strategic advantage, enabling us to launch innovative products.\nBuilding on our heritage of innovation, we are developing and have launched next-generation digital products and structures, including\nDigital Funds and tokenized assets.\n9\nTable of Contents\n• Extensive marketing, research and sales efforts. We have invested significant resources to establish the WisdomTree brand and to\npromote our products through online and television targeted advertising and social media, as well as through our public relations efforts.\nClose to 40% of our employees are dedicated to marketing, research and sales. Our sales professionals are the primary points of contact\nfor financial advisors, independent advisory firms and institutional investors who invest in our ETPs. Their efforts are enhanced through\nvalue-added services provided by our research and marketing efforts. We have strong relationships with financial advisors and\ninstitutional investors and we believe that by strategically aligning these advisor relationships and marketing campaigns with targeted\nresearch and sales initiatives and products that align with market sentiment, we differentiate ourselves from our competitors.\n• Efficient business model with lower risk profile. We have invested heavily in digital tools and data to market and sell our products and in\nthe internal development of our core competencies with respect to product development, marketing, research and sales of our products.\nWe outsource to third parties those services that are not our core competencies or may be resource or risk intensive, such as the portfolio\nmanagement responsibilities and fund accounting operations of our products. In addition, our licensing costs are moderated since we\ncreate our own indexes for most of our ETFs.\nOur Growth Strategies\nWe are a global financial innovator, offering a well-diversified suite of ETPs, models, solutions and products leveraging blockchain-enabled\ntechnology, with AUM of $100.1 billion as of December 31, 2023. We are at the forefront of innovation and believe that tokenization and leveraging\nthe utility of blockchain technology is the next evolution in financial services. We are building the foundation that we believe will allow us to lead in\nthis coming evolution. WisdomTree Prime, our blockchain-native digital wallet, positions us to expand our blockchain-enabled financial services\nproduct offerings with a new direct-to-consumer channel where spending, saving and investing are united. As we continue to pursue our digital assets\nstrategy, we are embracing what we refer to as “responsible DeFi,” which we believe upholds the foundational principles of regulation in this\ninnovative and rapidly evolving space. We believe that our expansion into digital assets complements our existing core competencies in a holistic\nmanner and will diversify our revenue streams and contribute to our growth. Our strategy includes the following:\n• Launch innovative ETPs that diversify our product offerings and revenues. We have launched many first-to-market ETFs in the\nU.S. and pioneered alternative weighting and performance methods we call “Modern Alpha,” which combines the outperformance\npotential of active management with the benefits of passive management to offer investors cost-effective funds that are built to perform.\nOur growth plan focuses on filling strategic gaps and seizing tactical opportunities by launching new products globally.\n• Establish ourselves as a leader in digital assets and blockchain-enabled financial services. Our deep experience with innovation and\nproven track record of entering new asset classes and markets, coupled with our firmwide strategic attention on blockchain-enabled\nfinance and a culture focused on governance and risk management with a regulatory minded approach positions us to become a leader in\nthe digital assets industry. We are an early mover in this space, with the launch of our blockchain-native digital wallet, WisdomTree\nPrime, a new direct-to-consumer channel where spending, saving and investing are united. WisdomTree Prime provides access to bitcoin,\nether, tokenized gold and U.S. dollar tokens, as well as 13 Digital Funds, including a government money market fund and other digital\nfunds offering asset allocation, fixed income and equity exposures. In addition, we have partnered with a financial institution to provide\nco-branded debit cards to our retail customers on the WisdomTree Prime platform. We continue to focus on enhancing the products and\ncapabilities of the platform with plans to allow for peer-to-peer transfers and payments. We are also exploring strategic partnerships and\nother business development opportunities for both our platform and product suite that could unlock additional tokenization revenue\nstreams in the future.\n• Foster deeper client relationships through technology-enabled and research-driven solutions. We believe technology is altering the\nway financial advisors conduct business. Our Advisor and Portfolio Solutions programs provide technology-enabled and research-driven\nsolutions to help financial advisors grow and scale their businesses and address their technology challenges.\n10\nTable of Contents\nThe Advisor and Portfolio Solutions programs include:\n• access to our U.S. model portfolios which are available to over 70,000 advisors across a number of platforms, including, Merrill\nLynch, Morgan Stanley, LPL Financial, Charles Schwab, Envestnet, 55ip and others. Our model portfolios are a natural extension of\nour research capabilities and provide advisors access to an open-architecture approach, a tenured team and a firm dedicated to\ninnovation and value creation. As part of this initiative, we launched a series of model portfolios in collaboration with Professor\nJeremy Siegel;\n• providing customized portfolio and asset allocation services to support registered investment advisers and independent broker\ndealers in building, implementing, and managing their client portfolios while providing strategic guidance for advisors to support\ntheir business growth;\n• access to portfolio construction tools such as our award-winning Portfolio Analysis Tools Hub (PATH), an enhanced portfolio\nconstruction tool that assists financial advisors in analyzing an existing investment portfolio by examining the data and providing\nalternative portfolio approaches to consider in seeking to improve outcomes based on different measures;\n• wealth investment research and ETF education; and\n• practice management resources, including access to thought leaders in behavioral finance, leadership, and transforming wealth\nmanagement technology.\n• Deepen relationships with distribution platforms. We maintain relationships with certain distribution platforms that allow commission-\nfree trading of our ETFs. These relationships are beneficial to us as they can provide greater marketing privileges and access to the\nplatforms’ advisors. As financial advisors continue to migrate away from mutual funds, we use our expertise in ETFs to build new\nrelationships and educate advisors about the benefits of ETFs. Some of these relationships that exist today are with LPL Financial, BNY\nMellon/Pershing, Raymond James, Charles Schwab, Cetera and others.\n• Leverage data intelligence to serve and expand investor base and improve sales and marketing effectiveness. We utilize a cognitive\ncustomer-focused lead prioritization system which has enhanced our distribution efforts. The system evaluates data across structured and\nunstructured sources such as historical investment data, market data and investor activity history, extracting behavioral insights, and is\ndesigned to enable our sales and marketing teams to optimize outreach to our current and potential investor base.\n• Selectively pursue acquisitions or other strategic transactions. We may pursue acquisitions or other strategic transactions that will\nenable us to strengthen our current business, expand and diversify our product offerings, complement our Advisor and Portfolio Solutions\nprograms, increase our AUM or enter into new markets. We believe pursuing acquisitions or other strategic transactions is a cost-effective\nmeans of growing our business and AUM.\nHuman Capital Resources\nWe compete in the highly competitive asset management industry. Attracting, retaining and motivating highly skilled, and sometimes highly\nspecialized, employees in operations, product development, research, technology, sales and marketing and other positions is crucial to our ability to\ncompete effectively. Our ability to recruit and retain such employees depends on a number of factors, including our corporate culture and work\nenvironment, informed by our values and behaviors, talent development and career opportunities and compensation and benefits. We strive to\ndifferentiate ourselves through our sense of community and purpose integrated into our culture, while encouraging a culture where every employee\nhas a voice.\nEmployee Profile\nAt December 31, 2023, we had 303 full-time employees globally, consisting of 190 in the U.S. and 113 in Europe. We consider our relations\nwith employees to be good.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)\nWe recognize that a diverse set of perspectives is critical to innovation and have built a diverse global workforce, inclusive of gender, race,\nethnicity, religion, age, gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation, as well as those in the disabled community. We actively seek\ncandidates from different backgrounds and outside traditional fields and reinforce our commitment to diversity through organizational policies, such\nas mandating fairness and equality for all employees and creating performance appraisal systems that are non-discriminatory.\n11\nTable of Contents\nAt WisdomTree, we envision a future of investment excellence driven by a commitment to continuously strengthen our diverse, equitable and\ninclusive workplace culture. Our DEI Council, formed in 2021, is comprised of senior leaders and employees from both the U.S. and Europe and\nprovides oversight and guidance in connection with the implementation of programs designed to foster a culture where every employee thrives,\nleveraging diverse perspectives and inclusive practices. For example, in 2023, the DEI Council held training sessions on understanding\nneurodiversity, implicit bias and embedding inclusion in feedback, roundtables on success and failure, and financial literacy workshops for\nemployees and secondary school students. The DEI Council also promoted awareness days and months across the firm including with respect to\nblack history, women’s history, pride, mental health and men’s health.\nOur Women’s Initiative Network, or WIN, is a global employee-led network designed to provide opportunities and support from all genders for\nwomen at WisdomTree, career development and professional training opportunities, and female empowerment and leadership within the\norganization. Since its inception in 2019, WIN has held numerous global events, including panel discussions on women in the workforce featuring\nWisdomTree employees and notable guest speakers, interactive seminars on topics including negotiation skills, workshops and coaching sessions to\nenhance confidence to speak up, and various roundtable forums, informal coffee catch-ups and in-person and virtual social gatherings to promote\nconnectivity and increase engagement. WIN also produces regular internal “spotlight” newsletters to increase visibility and raise the profile of our\nfemale employees. Both this initiative and WIN’s coffee catch-up initiative evolved into successful firm-wide initiatives. In addition, through WIN’s\nmentorship program, WIN members of all genders are connected with firm leaders who can help them achieve their career development goals.\nEmployee Wellness, Health and Safety\nThe wellbeing of our employees is a primary focus. We are continuously evolving and refining how we work best to achieve individual, team\nand Company goals. To that end, we have embraced a “Work Smart” philosophy that transcends physical work settings, with a focus on optimizing\nproductivity, efficiency and effectiveness of our work. Time in the office generally is not prescribed, and team leaders are empowered to determine\nhow their teams work best, based on their roles, with employees remaining accountable for achieving individual, team and Company outcomes. To\nfoster employee wellbeing and a healthy work-life balance, we offer numerous wellness programs including meditation and yoga classes, health\nwebinars, a weekly wellness newsletter and access to mental health professionals and other resources. Leveraging technology, we enhance the\nemployee experience through digital wellness platforms, facilitating remote access to health and wellbeing resources. We also offer paid vacation\n(unlimited in the U.S.) and sick leave policies to provide employees additional flexibility, and our U.S. employees enjoy additional “wellness days,”\nwhich are scheduled office closures around major market holidays for employees to collectively disconnect and rejuvenate. We support employees\nwith their information technology needs, provide a monthly stipend to cover remote work-related business expenses and provide guidance for\nmanagers to ensure that employees remain connected and maintain physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.\nIn keeping with “Work Smart,” we now maintain a smaller office footprint globally to better align with the number of employees expected to\ncollaborate in person on any given day, while providing a space for employees to work and socialize. As the safety and security of our employees\nwho choose to work in our office space are of critical importance, we have selected office buildings with robust security procedures, fire safety and\nsanitation and health practices.\nCompliance, Training and Development\nWe comply with all applicable government laws, rules and regulations and it is the responsibility of each employee to adhere to the standards\nand restrictions imposed by those laws, rules and regulations. All new employees attend a compliance training session with a compliance officer, and\nthereafter, employees are required to attend firmwide annual compliance training and to complete compliance certifications annually and in some\ninstances, quarterly. We also conduct mandatory cybersecurity training and other training programs as required by law.\nAs we believe that our employees are our greatest asset, we recognize the importance of investing in their continued development. We provide\na variety of opportunities for our employees to build new skills and further their career development. These include role-specific training courses,\nvirtual lunches with senior leaders in a small group setting and webinars hosted by various departments to gain a holistic view of the Company. We\nalso support employees’ continuing education, including through our educational assistance program. In addition, we invest in our current and future\nleaders through leadership development courses and individual and team coaching. We also hold monthly regional and quarterly global town halls to\ninform our employees of business developments, employee news and job openings, as well as to provide opportunities for employees to hone their\npresentation skills by sharing department updates.\n12\nTable of Contents\nEmployee Engagement\nWe believe engaging our employees is key to fostering new ideas and driving commitment and productivity. We communicate frequently and\ntransparently with our employees through a variety of communication methods, including an annual global virtual offsite where senior leaders review\nthe firm’s prior-year accomplishments and articulate the objectives for the coming year, and each department presents its respective prior-year\naccomplishments and current-year objectives, monthly regional and quarterly global town halls and firmwide weekly emails championing the team’s\nwork. We also seek feedback from our employees through annual engagement surveys and follow-up pulse surveys on various topics. In addition, we\nprovide opportunities for employees to participate in volunteer and charitable events.\nWe also believe it is important to celebrate employee and Company accomplishments. In 2023, we celebrated our fourth annual “Team Alpha”\nAwards to mark significant events and successes and to recognize employees who led those successes while exhibiting extraordinary teamwork and\ndemonstrating strong character. Over 50 nominations were submitted and narrowed down by a selection committee. The winners received a modest\nincentive compensation award, the opportunity to donate to a charity of their choice and to recognize other employees who assisted them.\nThe success of our employee engagement efforts is demonstrated by our employee retention rate of approximately 93.4% in 2023. We also\nachieved overall positive results from our 2023 global employee engagement survey, with a 99% participation rate. Additionally, in the U.S., we were\nnamed a “2023 Best Places to Work in Money Management” by Pensions & Investments for the fourth consecutive year and seventh year since the\naward was created. We ranked second within the category for managers with 100-499 employees, the second consecutive year earning a ranking\namong the top five employers. In the U.K., we were also named Best Workplace for medium-sized companies for a fourth consecutive year and a\n2023 Best Workplace for Women for medium-sized companies by Great Place to Work.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe are committed to rewarding and supporting our employees in order to continue to attract and retain top talent. Our incentive compensation\nprogram has been designed to reward our employees for their individual performance as well as the Company’s performance and includes various\nquantitative metrics and qualitative results that incentivize growth. We believe a key factor in our success has been and continues to be fostering an\nentrepreneurial culture where our employees act and think like our owners. As such, we believe that equity awards are an important part of our\nemployees’ overall compensation package and that incentivizing our employees with equity aligns the interests of our employees with our\nstockholders. We also offer a wide array of benefits including generous healthcare coverage, paid vacation (unlimited in the U.S.), parental,\nsabbatical and sick leave, life and travel insurance, short- and long-term disability benefits and, in the U.S., a 401(k) plan with a matching\ncontribution of up to 50% of eligible employee contributions.\nOur Product Categories\nU.S. Equity\nWe offer equity products that provide access to the securities of large, mid and small-cap companies located in the U.S., as well as particular\nmarket sectors and styles. Our U.S. Equity products track our own indexes, the majority of which are fundamentally weighted as opposed to market\ncapitalization weighted indexes, which assign more weight to stocks with the highest market capitalizations. These fundamentally weighted indexes\nfocus on securities of companies that pay regular cash dividends or on securities of companies that have generated positive cumulative earnings over\na certain period. We believe weighting equity markets by dividends and income, rather than by market capitalization, can provide investors with\nbetter risk-adjusted returns over longer term periods in core equity exposures. Total AUM of our U.S. Equity products was $29.2 billion at\nDecember 31, 2023.\nCommodity & Currency\nWe offer products in Europe with exposure to gold and other precious metals and commodities such as silver and platinum, oil and energy,\nagriculture and broad basket commodities. Our currency products provide investors with exposure to developed and emerging markets currencies, as\nwell as exposures to foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Total AUM of our Commodity & Currency products was $21.3 billion at\nDecember 31, 2023.\n13\nTable of Contents\nFixed Income\nOur Fixed Income products seek to enhance income potential within the fixed income universe. We offer a suite of rising rate bond products\nbased on leading fixed income benchmarks we license from third parties. We also launched the industry’s first smart beta corporate bond suite. Other\nproduct offerings include those that seek to track a yield-enhanced index of U.S. investment grade bonds and international fixed income products\nwhich are denominated in either local or U.S. currencies. Total AUM of our Fixed Income products was $21.2 billion at December 31, 2023.\nInternational Developed Market Equity\nOur International Developed Market Equity products offer a variety of strategies including currency hedged and dynamic currency hedged\nproducts, exposures to large, mid and small-cap companies in these markets and multifactor strategies. Total AUM of our International Developed\nMarket Equity products was $15.1 billion at December 31, 2023.\nEmerging Market Equity\nOur Emerging Market Equity products provide access to exposure of large, mid and small-cap companies located in Taiwan, China, India,\nRussia, South Africa, South Korea and other emerging markets regions. These products also track our own indexes, which are fundamentally\nweighted focusing on securities of companies that pay regular cash dividends or that have generated positive cumulative earnings over a certain\nperiod. Total AUM of our Emerging Market Equity products was $10.7 billion at December 31, 2023.\nLeveraged & Inverse\nWe offer leveraged products which seek to achieve a return that is a multiple of the performance of the underlying index and inverse products\nthat seek to deliver the opposite of the performance in the index or benchmark they track. Strategies span across equity, commodity, government bond\nand currency exposures. Total AUM of our Leveraged & Inverse products was $1.8 billion at December 31, 2023.\nCryptocurrency\nOur cryptocurrency ETPs provide investors with a simple, secure and cost-efficient way to gain exposure to the price of cryptocurrencies, while\nutilizing the best of traditional financial infrastructure and product structuring. We offer exposures to bitcoin, ether, crypto asset baskets and other\ncryptocurrency exposures. Total AUM of our cryptocurrency products was $0.4 billion at December 31, 2023.\nAlternatives\nOur Alternative products include the industry’s first managed futures strategy ETF and a global real return ETF. We also offer a dynamic\nlong/short U.S. equity ETF, a dynamic bearish U.S. equity ETF and a collateralized put write strategy ETF on the S&P 500 index. We also intend to\nexplore additional alternative strategy products in the future. Total AUM of our Alternative products was $0.4 billion at December 31, 2023.\nOur Sales, Marketing and Research Efforts\nSales\nWe distribute our ETPs through all major channels within the asset management industry, including banks, brokerage firms, registered\ninvestment advisers, institutional investors, private wealth managers and online brokers. Our primary sales efforts are not directed towards the retail\nsegment but rather are directed towards the financial or investment adviser who acts as the intermediary between the end-client and us. We do not pay\ncommissions, nor do we offer 12b-1 fees to financial advisors to use or recommend the use of our products.\nWe have developed an extensive network and relationships with financial advisors and we believe that our ETPs and related research are well\nstructured to meet their needs and those of their clients. We have taken steps to enhance and form new relationships through our Advisor and\nPortfolio Solutions programs, including providing customized portfolio and asset allocation services to support registered investment advisers and\nindependent broker dealers in building, implementing and managing their client portfolios while providing strategic guidance for advisors to support\ntheir business growth. Our Advisor and Portfolio Solutions programs also provide technology-enabled and research-driven solutions to help financial\nadvisors grow and scale their businesses.\n14\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, senior and academic advisors of ours, including Professor Jeremy Siegel, Senior Economist to WisdomTree, participate as keynote\nspeakers in various industry and WisdomTree hosted conferences and events. Our sales professionals act in a consultative role to provide financial\nadvisors with value-added services. We seek to consistently grow our network of financial advisors and we opportunistically seek to introduce new\nproducts and services that best deliver our investment strategies to investors through these distribution channels. We have our own team of 77 sales\nprofessionals globally as of December 31, 2023.\nIn addition, we have agreements with third parties to serve as the external marketing agents for our products in Latin America and Israel, as\nwell as with select brokerage firms and independent broker-dealers to allow certain of our products to trade commission free on their platforms in\nexchange for a percentage of our advisory fee revenues from certain AUM. We believe these arrangements expand our distribution capabilities in a\ncost-effective manner and we may continue to enter into such arrangements in the future.\nMarketing\nOur marketing efforts are focused on the following objectives: increase our global brand awareness, leverage a robust data-driven digital sales\nexperience to generate new clients and drive inflows to our products and model portfolios and retain existing clients, with a focus on cross-selling\nadditional WisdomTree ETPs. We also anticipate launching marketing campaigns to drive awareness and user adoption for WisdomTree Prime and to\nposition ourselves to become a leader in asset tokenization and blockchain-enabled funds. We pursue these objectives utilizing the following\nstrategies:\n• Targeted advertising. We create highly targeted multi-media advertising campaigns limited to established core financial media. For\nexample, our television advertising to promote our ETPs runs exclusively on the cable networks CNBC, Fox Business and Bloomberg. It\nis anticipated that television advertising also will be utilized to promote WisdomTree Prime. Also, our digital advertising runs on many\ninvesting and ETF-specific web-sites, such as www.etftrends.com and www.etfdb.com, using targeted dynamic and personalized ad\nmessaging. We also utilize non-linear TV advertising that leverages the same targeted segments of users who use streaming devices. In\nEurope, we filter the targeting of promotions by both region and language, focusing heavily on professional investors.\n• Media relations. We have a full-time global corporate communications and public relations team that has established relationships with\nmajor financial and digital assets media outlets. We utilize these relationships to help increase global awareness of WisdomTree ETPs, the\nETP industry in general in the U.S. and Europe and our digital assets efforts. Several members of our management team and multiple\nmembers of our research team are frequent market commentators and conference panelists.\n• Database Messaging Strategy. We have a database of financial advisors to whom we regularly market through a series of messages\nacross channels (email, display, site) that are triggered based on user interest and predictive analytics, on-demand research presentations,\nETP-specific or educational events and presentations, and market commentary from Professor Jeremy Siegel, Senior Economist to\nWisdomTree. Additionally, in the U.S., we communicate to our retail database about new product launches and provide ETF education\nthrough a monthly newsletter.\n• Social media. We have implemented a social media strategy that allows us to connect directly with financial advisors and investors by\noffering timely access to our research material and more general market commentary. Our social media strategy allows us to continually\nenhance our brand reputation of expertise and thought leadership in the ETP industry. For example, we have an established presence on\nLinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, Reddit and YouTube, and our blog content is syndicated across multiple business-oriented\nwebsites. We also leverage the strength and reach of our existing brand, in addition to utilizing a highly focused “test, learn, iterate” paid\nand social media marketing strategy, to drive awareness and user adoption for WisdomTree Prime.\n• Sales support. We create comprehensive materials to support our sales process of our ETP products, including whitepapers, research\nreports, webinars, blogs, podcasts, videos and performance data for our products. Our marketing automation system connects seamlessly\nto our database of financial advisors to provide the sales team with additional insights about their clients.\nWe will continue to evolve our marketing and communication efforts in response to changes in the ETP industry, market conditions, marketing\ntrends and our evolving strategy around digital assets.\n15\nTable of Contents\nResearch and Chief Investment Office\nOur research team and chief investment office has four core functions: product development and oversight, investment research, model\nportfolio management and sales support across equities, fixed income, alternatives, crypto and asset allocation portfolios. In its index and active\nproduct development and oversight role, the group is responsible for creating the investment methodologies and overseeing the maintenance of\nindexes and active strategies. The team also provides a variety of investment research around these indexes and markets and manages a series of\nmodel portfolios that incorporate WisdomTree and third-party products for various investment platforms, including WisdomTree Prime. Our research\nis typically academic-type research to support our products, including white papers on the strategies underlying our indexes and ETPs, investment\ninsights on current market trends, and types of investment strategies that drive long-term performance. We distribute our research and insights\nthrough our sales professionals, online through our website and blog, targeted emails to financial advisors, or through financial media or social media\noutlets. Finally, the team supports our sales professionals in meetings as market experts and through custom analysis on client portfolio holdings. In\naddition, we consult with our senior advisers, including Professor Jeremy Siegel, Senior Economist to WisdomTree, on product development ideas,\nmodel collaboration and market commentaries.\nProduct Development\nWe are focused on driving continued growth through innovative product development including through our Modern Alpha approach and our\ndigital assets offerings. Modern Alpha combines the outperformance potential of active management with the benefits of passive management to offer\ninvestors cost-effective products that are built to perform.\nDue to our proprietary index development capabilities and a strategic focus on product development, we have demonstrated an ability to launch\ninnovative and differentiated ETPs. Building on our heritage of innovation, we are also developing next-generation digital products and structures,\nincluding Digital Funds and tokenized assets. When developing new products, we seek to position ourselves as first to market, offering improvement\nin structure or strategy relative to an incumbent product or offering some other key distinction relative to an incumbent product. In short, we want to\nadd choice in the market and seek to introduce thoughtful investment solutions. Lastly, when launching new products, we seek to expand and\ndiversify our overall product line.\nCompetition\nThe asset management industry is highly competitive and we face substantial competition in virtually all aspects of our business. Factors\naffecting our business include fees for our products, our offerings and investment performance, brand recognition, business reputation, quality of\nservice and the continuity of our financial advisor and platform relationships. We compete directly with other ETP sponsors and mutual fund\ncompanies and indirectly against other investment management firms, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions.\nMany of the firms we compete with are subsidiaries of large diversified financial companies and many others are much larger in terms of AUM, years\nin operations and revenues and, accordingly, have much larger sales organizations and budgets. In addition, these larger competitors may attract\nbusiness through means that are not available to us, including retail bank offices, investment banking, insurance agencies and traditional broker-\ndealers.\nETPs are now available for virtually every asset class including equities, fixed income, commodities, alternative strategies, leveraged-and-\ninverse, currencies and cryptocurrencies. Existing players have broadened their suite of products offering strategies that are, in some cases, similar to\nours and large traditional asset managers are also launching ETPs, some with similar strategies as well. There remain substantial areas for sponsors to\ncontinue to innovate, including but not limited to cryptocurrency, liquid alternative, thematic and other strategies.\nPrice competition exists in not only commoditized product categories such as traditional, market capitalization weighted index exposures and\ncommodities, but also in non-market capitalization weighted or factor-based exposures and commodities. Fee reductions by certain of our\ncompetitors has been a trend over the last few years and continues to persist and many of our competitors are well positioned to benefit from this\ntrend. Certain larger competitors are able to offer products at lower price points or otherwise as loss leaders due to other revenue sources available\nwithin such competitors that are currently unavailable to us. Newer players have also been entering the ETP industry and frequently seek to\ndifferentiate by offering ETPs at a lower price point. Funds are being offered with fees of 20 basis points or less, which have attracted approximately\n80% of the net flows globally during the last three years. However, while these low-cost products have accumulated a significant amount of AUM\nrecently, we estimate that these same funds represent only approximately 34% of global revenues.\n16\nTable of Contents\nBeing a first mover, or one of the first providers of ETPs in a particular asset class, can be a significant advantage, as the first ETP in a category\nto attract scale in AUM and trading liquidity is generally viewed as the most attractive product. We believe that our early launch of products in a\nnumber of asset classes or strategies, including fundamental weighting and currency hedging, along with commodities including gold, certain fixed\nincome, alternative and thematic categories, positions us well to maintain our standing as one of the leaders of the ETP industry. Additionally, we\nbelieve that our affiliated indexing or “self-indexing” model, as well as our more recent active ETFs, enable us to launch proprietary products that do\nnot have direct competition and are positioned to generate alpha versus benchmarks. As investors increasingly become more comfortable with the\nproduct structure, we believe there will be a greater focus on after-fee performance rather than using ETPs primarily as low-cost market access\nvehicles. While we have selectively lowered fee rates on certain products that have yet to attain scale, and there is no assurance that we will not lower\nfee rates on certain products in the future, our strategy continues to include launching new funds in the same category with a differentiated exposure\nat a lower fee rate, rather than reducing fees on existing products with a significant amount of AUM, long performance track records, and secondary\nmarket liquidity, which continue to remain competitively priced for the value provided, among other factors. We generally believe we are well\npositioned from a product pricing perspective.\nWe also have been positioning ourselves to expand beyond our existing ETP business by leveraging blockchain technology, digital assets and\nprinciples of DeFi to deliver transparency, choice and inclusivity to customers and consumers around the world. Our blockchain-native digital wallet,\nWisdomTree Prime, provides access to bitcoin, ether, tokenized gold and U.S. dollar tokens, as well as 13 Digital Funds, including a government\nmoney market fund and other digital funds offering asset allocation, fixed income and equity exposures. These products have been developed with\nthe ability to be recorded and/or transferred on multiple public and/or permissioned blockchains with interoperability between blockchains. In\naddition, we were among the first to launch a spot bitcoin ETF in the United States. We believe this expansion complements our core competencies in\na holistic manner, will diversify our revenue streams and contribute to our growth. Competition in the digital assets industry on a global basis is\nincreasing, ranging from large, established financial incumbents to smaller, early-stage financial technology providers and companies. There are\njurisdictions with more stringent and robust regulatory and compliance requirements than others which could impact the ability of a company to\ncompete in the digital assets industry. We are embracing what we refer to as “responsible DeFi” for our anticipated and expanded products and\nservices which we believe upholds the foundational principles of regulation in this innovative and quickly evolving space. We remain committed to\nbeing a trusted provider of innovative products and services guided by proactive engagement and continued collaboration with current and new\nregulators.\nOur ability to successfully compete will depend largely on offering innovative products through traditional ETPs and digital asset exposures\n(and more broadly in blockchain-enabled finance, including savings and payments), having strong internal controls and risk management\ninfrastructure to enable customer trust, generating strong after-fee performance and track records, embracing regulation, developing distribution\nrelationships, promoting thought leadership and a differentiated solutions program, building upon our brand and attracting and retaining talented sales\nprofessionals and other employees.\nRegulatory Framework of the ETP Industry and Digital Assets Business\nETPs\nNot all ETPs are ETFs. ETFs are a distinct type of security with features that are different than other ETPs. ETFs are open-end investment\ncompanies or unit investment trusts regulated in the U.S. by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. This\nregulatory structure is designed to provide investor protection within a pooled investment product. For example, the Investment Company Act\nrequires that at least 40% of the Trustees for each ETF must not be affiliated persons of the fund’s investment manager, or Independent Trustees. If\nthe ETF seeks to rely on certain rules under the Investment Company Act, a majority of the Trustees for that ETF must be Independent Trustees.\nETFs generally operate under regulations that allow them to operate within the ETF structure, while ETFs also operate under regulations that prohibit\naffiliated transactions, are subject to standard pricing and valuation rules and have mandated compliance programs. ETPs can take a number of forms\nin addition to ETFs, including exchange-traded notes, grantor trusts or limited partnerships. In the U.S. market, a key factor differentiating ETFs,\ngrantor trusts and limited partnerships from exchange-traded notes is that the former hold assets underlying the ETP. Exchange traded notes, on the\nother hand, are debt instruments issued by the exchange-traded note sponsor. Also, each of these structures has implications for taxes, liquidity,\ntracking error and credit risk.\n17\nTable of Contents\nDigital Assets\nAs we continue to make progress and pursue various initiatives in connection with our digital assets business, we believe it is necessary and\nimportant to do so in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. As a result, we are actively engaged with a variety of U.S. federal and state\nregulators (e.g., the SEC, FINRA, New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and other state regulators) to secure, as necessary, or\nmaintain the appropriate regulatory, registration and/or licensing approvals for various business initiatives and operations, including but not limited\nto: a New York state-chartered limited purpose trust company; money services and money transmitter business; limited purpose broker-dealer;\ntransfer agent; investment adviser; and investment funds. As we seek to expand globally, similar approvals and/or reliance on exemptions will be\nrequired in applicable foreign markets, which also may involve approvals specific to a digital assets or related business. As we secure the appropriate\nregulatory, registration and/or licensing approvals, or otherwise rely on, seek or confirm exemptions therefrom, in connection with our digital assets\nbusiness, we are and will be subject to a myriad of complex and evolving global policy frameworks and associated regulatory requirements that we\nneed to comply with, or otherwise be exempt from, to ensure that our digital assets products and services are successfully brought to different\nmarkets in a compliant manner. We remain committed to being a trusted provider of innovative products and services guided by proactive\nengagement and regulatory collaboration.\nU.S. Regulation\nAll aspects of our business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to\nprotect the end user, which may include retail and institutional customers, investment advisory clients and shareholders of registered investment\ncompanies. These laws generally grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of our\nbusiness and to impose fines, sanctions or other penalties for failure to comply with these laws and regulations. Further, such laws and regulations\nprovide the basis for examination, inquiry, investigation, enforcement action and/or litigation which could materially affect our business.\nWe are primarily subject to the following laws and regulations, among others. The costs of complying with such laws and regulations have\nincreased and will continue to contribute to the costs of doing business:\n• The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Investment Advisers Act). The SEC is the federal agency generally responsible for administering\nthe U.S. federal securities laws. WisdomTree Asset Management, Inc., or WT Asset Management, and WisdomTree Digital Management,\nInc., or WT Digital Management, two of our subsidiaries, are registered as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act and, as\nsuch, are regulated by the SEC. The Investment Advisers Act requires registered investment advisers to comply with numerous\nobligations, including, among others, recordkeeping requirements, fiduciary duties, operational procedures, and registration, reporting\nand disclosure obligations.\n• The Investment Company Act of 1940 (Investment Company Act). All of our Digital Funds and U.S. listed ETFs are registered with the\nSEC pursuant to the Investment Company Act. These products must comply with the applicable requirements of the Investment Company\nAct and other regulations, such as those related to publicly offering and listing shares, as well as requirements of Rule 6c-11, or the ETF\nRule, including, among others, requirements relating to operations, fees charged, sales, accounting, recordkeeping, disclosure,\ntransparency and governance. In addition, the SEC continues to take an active approach in its rulemaking activity by finalizing and\nproposing new rules and/or rule amendments under the Investment Company Act that will impact current and future Digital Fund and\nETF operations and/or investments.\n• Broker-Dealer Regulations. WisdomTree Securities, Inc., or WT Securities, is a FINRA member firm. As a limited purpose broker-\ndealer, WT Securities is operating as a mutual fund retailer for the Digital Funds offered through WisdomTree Prime. This business is\nseparate from other WisdomTree subsidiaries operating as Digital Fund and ETF sponsors in the U.S. which are not required to be\nregistered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act. However, many of\nour employees, including all of our salespersons, are licensed with FINRA and are registered either as associated persons of WT\nSecurities or the distributor of the WisdomTree Digital Funds and U.S. listed ETFs and, as such, are subject to FINRA rules that relate to\nlicensing, continuing education requirements and sales practices. FINRA rules also apply to our fund marketing and sales material.\n18\nTable of Contents\n• Federal Money Services Business and State Money Transmission Laws. WisdomTree Digital Movement, Inc. is a money services\nbusiness registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, and a state licensed money transmitter operating a\nplatform for the purchase, sale and exchange of digital assets, while also providing blockchain-enabled digital wallet services through\nWisdomTree Prime to facilitate such activity. Navigating state regulations across the U.S. provides compliance challenges and significant\ncosts as regulations and expectations differ between states, with different states seeking to achieve different objectives with their\nregulations, from consumer protection to preventing money laundering. In addition, licensure requirements are quickly evolving\n(including regulators not permitting certain activities related to digital assets pursuant to such licenses), with the associated timeframes\nfor licensure increasing and licensure being further complicated by recent market events and bankruptcies of firms in the digital assets\nspace.\n• Internal Revenue Code. The WisdomTree Trust generally has obligations with respect to the qualification of the registered investment\ncompanies for pass-through tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code.\n• U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and National Futures Association (NFA). Regulations adopted by the CFTC\nhave required WT Asset Management to become a member of the NFA and register as a commodity pool operator for a select number of\nour ETFs.\n• Products Exchange Listing Requirements. Each WisdomTree U.S. listed ETF is listed on a secondary market (each, an Exchange),\nincluding NYSE Arca, the NASDAQ Market and the Cboe Exchange, and accordingly is subject to the listing requirements of these\nExchanges. Any new WisdomTree U.S. listed ETF will seek listing on an Exchange and also will need to meet continued Exchange\nlisting requirements, which generally align with requirements of the ETF Rule. However, the SEC or an Exchange may ultimately\ndetermine not to allow the issuance of potential new WisdomTree U.S. listed ETFs or may require strategy or operational modifications\nas part of the registration and/or listing process.\n• Corporate Exchange Listing Requirements. In addition, our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and we are\ntherefore also subject to its rules including corporate governance listing standards, as well as federal and state securities laws.\n• FINRA Rules. FINRA rules and guidance may affect how WisdomTree U.S. listed ETFs are sold by member firms. Although we\ncurrently do not offer so-called leveraged ETFs in the U.S., which may include within their holdings derivative instruments such as\noptions, futures or swaps to obtain leveraged exposures. FINRA guidance, the recently effective SEC Rule 18f-4, or the Derivatives Rule,\nand/or other future rules or regulations may influence how member firms effect sales of certain WisdomTree U.S. listed ETFs, such as\nour currency ETFs, or how such ETFs operate, which also use some forms of derivatives, including forward currency contracts and\nswaps, our international hedged equity ETFs, which use currency forwards, and our rising rates bond ETFs and alternative strategy ETFs,\nwhich use futures or options.\n• Section 17A of the Exchange Act. WisdomTree Transfers, Inc., or WT Transfers, is a transfer agent registered with the SEC. As a\ntransfer agent, WT Transfers provides transfer agency and registrar services for the Digital Funds offered through WisdomTree Prime.\nWT Transfers’ transfer agency and registrar services are subject to Section 17A of the Exchange Act and applicable rules promulgated\nthereunder.\nInternational Regulation\nOur operations outside the U.S. are subject to the laws and regulations of various non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. regulatory agencies and\nbodies. As we have expanded our international presence, a number of our subsidiaries and international operations have become subject to regulatory\nsystems, in various jurisdictions, comparable to those covering our operations in the U.S. Regulators in these non-U.S. jurisdictions may have broad\nauthority with respect to the regulation of financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant or cancel required licenses or\nregistrations.\n19\nTable of Contents\nJersey-Domiciled Issuers (Managed by WisdomTree Management Jersey Limited)\nOne of our subsidiaries, WisdomTree Management Jersey Limited, or ManJer, is a Jersey based management company providing investment\nand other management services to several Jersey-domiciled issuers, or ManJer Issuers, of exchange-traded commodities, or ETCs, each of which was\nestablished as a special purpose vehicle to issue exchange-traded securities. All ETCs are listed and marketed across the European Union, or EU,\nunder Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 (as amended), or the Prospectus Regulation. Since\nJanuary 4, 2021, the Central Bank of Ireland, or Central Bank, approves all ETC Base Prospectuses (with the exception of WisdomTree Issuer X\nLimited’s prospectus which is approved by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority) as meeting the requirements imposed under EU law\npursuant to the Prospectus Regulation. Such approval relates only to those securities to be admitted to trading on a regulated market for the purpose\nof Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (recast) – Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and the Council, or MiFID II, and/or\nwhich are to be offered to the public in any European Economic Area, or EEA, Member State. All ETC prospectuses (except WisdomTree Issuer X\nLimited’s prospectus) are also approved by the Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, as U.K. Listing Authority, as competent authority pursuant to\nthe U.K. version of Regulation (EU) No 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and the Council of 14 June 2017 on the form and content of such\nprospectuses and repealing Directive 2003/71/EC which is part of U.K. law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, or the\nU.K. Prospectus Regulation. Each prospectus (except WisdomTree Issuer X Limited’s prospectus) is prepared, and a copy is sent to the Jersey\nFinancial Services Commission, or JFSC, in accordance with the Collective Investment Funds (Certified Funds – Prospectuses) (Jersey) Order 2012.\nEach ManJer Issuer (other than WisdomTree Issuer X Limited) has obtained a certificate under the Collective Investment Funds (Jersey) Law 1988\n(as amended), to enable it to undertake its functions in relation to its ETCs. At the request of the relevant ManJer Issuer, the Central Bank has notified\nthe approval of the Base Prospectus in accordance with the Prospectus Regulation to other EU listing authorities, including Austria, Belgium,\nDenmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden, by providing them with certificates of\napproval attesting that the Base Prospectus has been prepared in accordance with the Prospectus Regulation. Each issuer may request the Central\nBank to provide competent authorities in other EEA Member States with such certificates for the purposes of making a public offer in such Member\nStates and/or for admission to trading of all or any securities on a regulated market. WisdomTree Issuer X Limited’s program for the issuance of\nWisdomTree digital securities does not constitute a collective investment fund for the purpose of the Collective Investment Funds (Jersey) Law 1988\n(as amended) as it satisfies the requirements of Article 2 of the Collective Investments Funds (Restriction of Scope) (Jersey) Order 2000. A copy of\nWisdomTree Issuer X Limited’s prospectus has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies in Jersey in accordance with Article 5 of the Companies\n(General Provisions) (Jersey) Order 2002, and the Registrar has consented to its circulation. The JFSC has consented under Article 4 of the Control of\nBorrowing (Jersey) Order 1958 to the issue of the WisdomTree digital securities by WisdomTree Issuer X Limited. The prospectus of WisdomTree\nIssuer X Limited is also recognized by the Swiss Prospectus Office.\nThe ManJer Issuers are primarily subject to the following legislation and regulatory requirements:\n• The Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. Each ManJer Issuer is incorporated as a public limited liability company under the Companies\n(Jersey) Law 1991. Therefore, the ManJer Issuers are required to comply with various obligations under this law including, but not\nlimited to, convening general meetings, keeping proper books and records and filing financial statements.\n• The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, a U.S. federal law that was passed as part of the Hiring Incentives to Restore\nEmployment (HIRE) Act, generally requires that foreign financial institutions and certain other non-financial foreign entities report on\nthe foreign assets held by their U.S. account holders or be subject to withholding on withholdable payments. The HIRE Act also\ncontained legislation requiring U.S. persons to report, depending on the value, their foreign financial accounts and foreign assets. ETCs\nbenefit from the so called “listing exemption” and Jersey local authorities have determined that for companies which can benefit from\nsuch exemption the filing of a nil report is optional.\n• The Common Reporting Standards, or CRS, were developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and is a\nglobal reporting standard for the automatic exchange of information. The ManJer Issuers need to conduct FATCA style due diligence and\nannual local reporting in relation to financial accounts held directly and indirectly by residents of those jurisdictions with which the\nForeign Financial Institutions (FFIs) jurisdiction of residence has signed an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) to implement the\nCRS. Unlike FATCA, there is no clear listing exemption available under the CRS so the ManJer Issuers are required to conduct full due\ndiligence to identify such accounts and report on them on an annual basis to their local tax authorities, at least in respect of the\ncertificated interests and primary market issuances. However, Jersey tax authorities have applied less onerous reporting obligations to\ninterests such as ETCs that are regularly traded on an established securities market and are held through CREST, the U.K. based central\nsecurities depository.\n20\nTable of Contents\n• The Collective Investment Funds (Jersey) Law 1988. Each ManJer Issuer (other than WisdomTree Issuer X Limited) is a collective\ninvestment fund and therefore required to comply with the obligations under the Collective Investment Funds (Jersey) Law 1988 and the\nCode of Practice for Certified Funds.\n• The Prospectus Regulation. The Base Prospectus of each ManJer Issuer has been drafted, and any offer of ETCs in any EEA Member\nState that has implemented the Prospectus Regulation is made in compliance with the Prospectus Regulation and any relevant\nimplementing measure in such Member States.\n• Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central\ncounterparties and trade repositories, known as the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”). EMIR, which became\neffective on August 16, 2012, provides for certain over-the-counter, or OTC, derivative contracts to be submitted to central clearing and\nimposes margin posting and other risk mitigation techniques, reporting and record keeping requirements. The clearing obligations under\nEMIR are still under discussion, and currently there are no mandatory clearing obligations in relation to equity, FX or commodity\nderivatives. The clearing obligation only applies to EU-based financial counterparties (defined as those authorized under MiFID, CRR,\nAIFMD, UCITS or insurance regulations) or those non-financial entities that have a rolling three-month notional exposure above a\ncertain amount (between €1 and €3 billion, depending on asset class), which means that the ManJer Issuers are not directly subject to\nthese obligations, but could indirectly be subject to them by virtue of their interaction with EU-based financial counterparties. In terms of\nreporting obligations, being non-EU entities, the ManJer Issuers are only indirectly subject to such obligations when they interact with\ntheir EU-based financial counterparties. Each ManJer Issuer has adhered to the 2013 EMIR Portfolio Reconciliation, Dispute Resolution\nand Disclosure Protocol published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.\n• Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on market abuse (the “Regulation”) and Directive\n2014/57/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on criminal sanctions for market abuse (the “Directive” and, together\nwith the Regulation, “MAD”). Obligations imposed on the relevant ManJer Issuer and distributor under MAD, which became effective\non July 3, 2016, include the requirement to publish inside information in a public and timely manner, to prepare and maintain a list of\ninsiders and to refrain from market manipulation.\n• Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2016 on indices used as benchmarks in\nfinancial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds and amending Directives\n2008/48/EC and 2014/17/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 (“BMR”). Supervised EU entities which issue financial instruments\nthat reference a benchmark are required to comply with applicable obligations as set out under the BMR. The BMR was published on\nJune 30, 2016 and the majority of the provisions became effective on January 1, 2018. The ManJer Issuers are non-EU entities and as a\nresult, BMR application is very limited, although in some circumstances a few residual obligations could be deemed to be applicable\nbecause the ETCs are marketed across Europe.\n• Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 November 2014 on key information documents\nfor packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (“PRIIPS”). PRIIPs became effective on January 1, 2018 and applies to\ninvestment product manufacturers and distributors. Under PRIIPs, manufacturers need to provide a key information document (KIDs) to\ninvestors. The intention of KIDs is to improve transparency for investors on the products and enhance investor protection. The product\nmanufacturer is responsible for drafting the KID and for its content. All ETCs are currently subject to PRIIPs and KIDs have been\nproduced since January 1, 2018.\n• MiFID II. MiFID II covers a wide range of areas that affect the relevant issuer and distributor, such as product governance, a definition\nof complex products which captures all physical and synthetic ETCs and the production of a European MiFID template, or an EMT, to\nfacilitate the dissemination of relevant information to the markets and distributors in relation to each financial product.\n• Regulation (EU) 2015/2365 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on transparency of securities\nfinancing transactions and of reuse and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. (“SFTR”). Counterparties to securities financing\ntransactions must report the transaction to trade repositories. The SFTR introduces a reporting requirement for transactions, and a\ndisclosure requirement to investors with a requirement for prior consent. It also designates that financial instruments used for re-\nhypothecation are transferred to an account in the name of the other counterparty. Since the ManJer Issuers are based in non-EU\njurisdictions, obligations are only indirectly applicable to them, but a certain level of interaction with EU counterparties is required to\ncomply with some of these requirements.\n21\nTable of Contents\nWisdomTree Issuer X Limited is also primarily subject to the following legislation and regulatory requirements:\n• The Control of Borrowing (Jersey) Order 1958. WisdomTree Issuer X Limited is required to comply with the obligations under the\nControl of Borrowing (Jersey) Order 1958 in respect of its issue of the WisdomTree digital securities.\n• The Companies (General Provisions) (Jersey) Order 2002. WisdomTree Issuer X Limited is required to comply with the obligations\nunder the Companies (General Provisions) (Jersey) Order 2002 in respect of its circulation of the WisdomTree digital securities\nprospectus.\nIrish-Domiciled Issuer of UCITS ETFs (Managed by WisdomTree Management Limited)\nThe investment management industry in Ireland is subject to both Irish domestic law and EU law. The Central Bank of Ireland, or the Central\nBank, is responsible for the authorization and supervision of collective investment schemes, or CIS, in Ireland. CIS’s are also commonly known as\nfunds/schemes. There are two main categories of funds authorized by the Central Bank, Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable\nSecurities (UCITS) and funds that are not UCITS known as alternative investment funds. ETFs form part of the Irish and European regulatory\nframeworks that govern UCITS, with ETFs having been the subject of specific consideration at the European level which is then repeated and/or\ninterpreted by Irish regulators and the Central Bank in regulations and related guidance issued by the Central Bank.\nOne of our subsidiaries, WisdomTree Management Limited, is an Ireland based management company authorized in Ireland providing\ncollective portfolio management services to WisdomTree Issuer ICAV, or WTICAV, and WisdomTree UCITS ETFs. The WisdomTree UCITS ETFs,\nor Sub-Funds, are issued by WTICAV. WTICAV, a non-consolidated third party, is an Irish-collective-asset-management vehicle, or ICAV, organized\nin Ireland and is authorized as a UCITS by the Central Bank. All UCITS have their basis in EU legislation and once authorized in one EEA Member\nState, may be marketed throughout the EU, without further authorization. This is described as an EU passport. WisdomTree Management Limited\nregistered with the FCA as an Authorised Schedule 5 – operator of a temporary recognized scheme, and under the Temporary Marketing Permissions\nRegime, the WisdomTree UCITS ETFs continue to be available to U.K. investors.\nWTICAV is established and operated as an ICAV with segregated liability between its Sub-Funds. The Sub-Funds are segregated portfolios,\neach with their own investment objective and policies and assets. Each Sub-Fund has a separate approval from the Central Bank, and each is\nstructured as an ETF. Each Sub-Fund tracks a different index. The index must comply with regulatory criteria that govern, among others, the\neligibility and diversification of its constituents, and the availability of information on the index such as the frequency of calculation of the index, the\nindex’s transparency, its methodology and frequency of calculation. Each Sub-Fund has shares admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange\nand, typically, on various European stock exchanges, and accordingly, is subject to the listing requirements of those exchanges.\nWTICAV is primarily subject to the following legislation and regulatory requirements:\n• European Communities (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) Regulations 2011 (as amended) (“UCITS\nRegulations”). The UCITS Regulations, which transpose Council Directive 2009/65/EC, Commission Directive 2010/43/EC and\nCommission Directive 2010/44/EC into Irish law, became effective on July 1, 2011. UCITS established in Ireland are authorized under\nthe UCITS Regulations.\n• Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48(1)) (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable\nSecurities) Regulations 2019 (“Central Bank UCITS Regulations”). The Central Bank UCITS Regulations were adopted in May 2019\nand, together with the UCITS Regulations, any guidance produced by the Central Bank, and the Central Bank forms, form the basis for\nall the requirements that the Central Bank imposes on UCITS, UCITS management companies and depositaries of UCITS.\n• Central Bank Guidance. The Central Bank also has produced guidance that provides direction on issues relating to the funds industry,\ncertain of which set forth conditions not contained in the UCITS Regulations or the Central Bank Regulations with which UCITS must\nconform.\n• The Irish Collective Asset-Management Vehicle Act 2015 (“ICAV Act”). WTICAV is registered as an ICAV under the ICAV Act.\nTherefore, WTICAV is required to comply with various obligations under the ICAV Act such as, but not limited to, keeping proper books\nand records. The segregation of liability between Sub-funds means there cannot be, as a matter of Irish law, cross-contamination of\nliability between Sub-funds. Therefore, the insolvency of one Sub-fund cannot affect another Sub-fund.\n22\nTable of Contents\n• EMIR. EMIR provides for OTC derivative contracts to be submitted to central clearing and imposes, inter alia, margin posting and other\nrisk mitigation techniques, reporting and record keeping requirements. WTICAV uses OTC derivatives instruments to hedge the currency\nrisk of some of its sub-funds, which are subject to EMIR. WTICAV has adhered to the 2013 EMIR Portfolio Reconciliation, Dispute\nResolution and Disclosure Protocol published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. The Central Bank has been\ndesignated as the competent authority for EMIR.\n• BMR. The BMR is directly applicable law across the EU and applies to certain “administrators,” “contributors” and “users” of\nbenchmarks with the aim of reducing the risk of benchmark manipulation and promoting confidence in their integrity and that of the\nfinancial markets which they support. Since WTICAV issues financial instruments that reference a benchmark, it will be required to\ncomply with applicable obligations as set out under the BMR. In addition, non-EU administrators of benchmarks are required to satisfy a\nnumber of requirements to enable the benchmarks they provide to be used in the EU. To ensure investor protection, the BMR provides\nequivalence, recognition and endorsement conditions under which third country benchmarks may be used by supervised entities in the\nEU. Since we control the provision of benchmarks, we are required to comply with applicable obligations within the timeframes set out\nunder the BMR.\n• Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 November 2014 on key information documents\nfor packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (“PRIIPS”). As above, WisdomTree’s ETCs have been subject to PRIIPS\nsince January 1, 2018. On January 1, 2023, PRIIPS also began to apply to UCITS. WTICAV has been producing and publishing these\nKIDs for share classes of the Sub-funds of the ICAV since January 1, 2023.\n• Regulation on Disclosures (EU/2019/2088) (“SFDR”) and the EU Taxonomy Regulation (2020/852) (“EU Taxonomy”). SFDR\nrequires WisdomTree Management Limited, as a UCITS management company, to disclose in a consistent and harmonized manner how\nenvironmental, social and governance, or ESG, factors are adopted in its decision-making process. SFDR also requires certain pre-\ncontractual and periodic disclosure requirements for in scope WTICAV’s Sub-funds, such as UCITS financial products. Level 1 of SFDR\nrequirements applied from March 1, 2021 and Level 2 of the SFDR requirements applied from January 1, 2023. The EU Taxonomy\nRegulation amends the disclosure requirements in place under SFDR. The EU Taxonomy disclosures for the economically sustainable\nobjectives of climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation were applicable from January 1, 2022, while the requirement for\ndisclosures for the remaining objectives applied from January 1, 2023. The WTICAV Prospectus, as well as supplements and product\npages of the WTICAV Sub-funds in scope of SFDR and EU Taxonomy, have been updated to reflect the respective regulatory\nrequirements.\n• Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 on the cross-border distribution framework (“CBDF”). The CBDF amend the UCITS Directive to increase\nthe harmonization of cross-border marketing between both (a) the UCITS regime and (b) different practices adopted by EU member\nstates and came into effect on August 2, 2021. The CBDF eliminated the need for WTICAV to have local paying agents within EU\nmember states the Sub-funds passported into, but introduced rules around marketing communications, pre-marketing notifications and the\ndiscontinuation of marketing.\n• Regulatory technical standards on settlement discipline (“CSDR”). CSDR introduced measures to prevent settlement failures, with\nsettlement failures resulting in penalty charges applied by the Central Securities Depositaries to failing parties. Since most WTICAV sub-\nfunds employ physical replication using equities and bonds, trades in these equities that take place within the EU come into scope of\nCSDR. This regulation came into force on February 1, 2022.\nIrish-Domiciled Issuer (Managed by WisdomTree Multi Asset Management Limited)\nOne of our subsidiaries, WisdomTree Multi Asset Management Limited, is a Jersey based management company providing investment and\nother management services to WisdomTree Multi Asset Issuer PLC, or WMAI, in respect of the ETPs issued by WMAI. WisdomTree Multi Asset\nManagement Limited operates under the Schedule 2 businesses (Schedule 2 of the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999) must adhere to Jersey\nAML/CFT/CPF regulations, and is supervised for compliance by the JFSC. WMAI, a non-consolidated third party, is a public limited company\nincorporated in the laws of Ireland. It was established as a special purpose vehicle for the purposes of issuing collateralized exchange-traded\nsecurities, or ETP Securities, under the Collateralized ETP Securities Programme described in its Base Prospectus. WMAI is a ‘qualifying company’\nwithin the meaning of section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (as amended), of Ireland. WMAI is not authorized or regulated by the Central\nBank by virtue of issuing ETPs.\n23\nTable of Contents\nThe Central Bank, as competent authority under the Prospectus Regulation, has approved the Base Prospectus as meeting the requirements\nimposed under Irish and EU law pursuant to the Prospectus Regulation. Such approval relates only to ETP Securities which are to be admitted to\ntrading on a regulated market for the purpose of MiFID II and/or which are to be offered to the public in any EEA Member State. The Base\nProspectus also has been approved by the FCA as competent authority pursuant to the U.K. version of Regulation (EU) No 2017/1129 of the\nEuropean Parliament and the Council of 14 June 2017 on the form and content of such prospectuses and repealing Directive 2003/71/EC which is\npart of U.K. law by virtue of the U.K. Prospectus Regulation.\nAt the request of WMAI, the Central Bank has notified the approval of the Base Prospectus in accordance with the Prospectus Regulation to the\nCommissione Nazionale per le Societá e la Borsa (the Italian financial supervisory authority), the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht\n(the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority), the Financial Market Authority of Austria, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur\nFinancier (the financial regulator in Luxembourg), the Finanstilsynet (the Norwegian financial supervisory authority), the Autorité des Services et\nMarchés Financiers (the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority), the Finanstilsynet (the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority), the\nFinanssivalvonta (the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority), the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (the French Authority for the Financial\nMarkets), the Autoriteit Financiële Markten (the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets), the Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego (the Polish\nFinancial Supervisory Authority), the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (the Securities Market Commission in Spain) and\nFinansinspektionen (the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority) by providing them, inter alia, with certificates of approval attesting that the Base\nProspectus has been prepared in accordance with the Prospectus Regulation. WMAI may request the Central Bank to provide competent authorities\nin other EEA Member States with such certificates whether for the purposes of making a public offer in such Member States or for admission to\ntrading of all or any ETP Securities on a regulated market therein or both.\nWMAI is primarily subject to the following legislation and regulatory requirements:\n• The Companies Act. WMAI is incorporated as a public limited liability company under the Companies Act. Therefore, WMAI is\nrequired to comply with various obligations under the Companies Act such as, but not limited to, convening general meetings, keeping\nproper books and records and filing financial statements.\n• The Prospectus Regulation. The Base Prospectus has been drafted, and any offer of ETP Securities in any EEA Member State that has\nimplemented the Prospectus Regulation is made in compliance with the Prospectus Regulation and any relevant implementing measure in\nsuch Member States.\n• EMIR. WMAI hedges its payment obligations in respect of the ETP Securities by entering into swap transactions with swap providers,\nwhich are subject to EMIR. The Central Bank has been designated as the competent authority for EMIR and, to assess compliance with\nEMIR, requests that WMAI submits annually an EMIR Regulatory Return.\n• BMR. Since WMAI issues financial instruments that reference a benchmark, it also will be required to comply with applicable\nobligations within the timeframes set out under the BMR.\n• MAD. MAD has a direct effect in Ireland and strengthens the legal framework underpinning the function of detecting, sanctioning and\ndeterring market abuse. Broadly, MAD applies to any financial instrument admitted to, or for which a request for admission has been\nmade to, trading on a regulated market in at least one member state of the EU or in an EEA Member State. Obligations imposed on\nWMAI under MAD include the requirement to publish inside information in a public and timely manner, to draw up and maintain a list\nof insiders and to refrain from market manipulation.\n• CSDR. As above, CSDR introduced measures to prevent settlement failures, with settlement failures resulting in penalty charges applied\nby the Central Securities Depositaries to failing parties.\nIntellectual Property\nWe regard our name, WisdomTree, as material to our business and have registered the WisdomTree name and logo design as a service mark\nwith the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in various foreign jurisdictions. We also have registered Modern Alpha as a service mark with the\nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in various foreign jurisdictions and have applied for trademark registration of the WisdomTree Prime name\nand logo design.\nMany of our index-based equity ETFs are based on our own indexes and we do not license them from, nor do we pay licensing fees to, third\nparties for these indexes. We do, however, license third-party indexes for certain of our fixed income, currency and alternative ETFs.\n24\nTable of Contents\nOn March 6, 2012, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued to us our patent on Financial Instrument Selection and Weighting System and\nMethod, which is embodied in our dividend weighted equity indexes. We currently do not rely upon our patent for a competitive advantage.\nAvailable Information\nCompany Website and Public Filings\nOur website is located at www.wisdomtree.com, and our investor relations website is located at https://ir.wisdomtree.com.

RISK FACTORS\nAny investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the specific risk factors described below in\naddition to the other information contained in this Report before making a decision to invest in our common stock. If any of these risks actually occur,\nour business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be harmed. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to\ndecline and a loss of all or part of your investment. Certain statements below are forward-looking statements. See the section entitled “Cautionary\nNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”\nMarket Risks\nDeclining prices of securities, gold and other precious metals and other commodities and changes in interest rates and general market conditions\ncan adversely affect our business by reducing the market value of the assets we manage or causing WisdomTree ETP investors to sell their fund\nshares and trigger redemptions.\nWe are subject to risks arising from declining prices of securities, gold and other precious metals and other commodities, which may result in a\ndecrease in demand for investment products, a higher redemption rate and/or a decline in AUM. The financial markets are highly volatile and prices\nfor financial assets may increase or decrease for many reasons, including general economic conditions, trade uncertainties, rising or falling interest\nrates, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar, events such as a pandemic or war, geopolitical conflicts, political events, acts of terrorism\nand other matters beyond our control. Substantially all our revenues are derived from advisory fees earned on our AUM, in both the international and\nU.S. markets. As a result, our business can be expected to generate lower revenues in declining market environments or general economic downturns.\nSuch adverse conditions would likely cause the value of our AUM to decrease, which would result in lower advisory fees, or cause investors in the\nWisdomTree ETPs to sell their shares in favor of investments they perceive to offer greater opportunity or lower risk, thus triggering redemptions that\nwould also result in decreased AUM and lower fees.\nFluctuations in the amount and mix of our AUM may negatively impact revenues and operating margins.\nThe level of our revenues depends on the amount and mix of our AUM. Our revenues are derived primarily from advisory fees based on a\npercentage of the value of our AUM and vary with the nature of the ETPs, which have different fee levels. Fluctuations in the amount and mix of our\nAUM may be attributable in part to market conditions outside of our control that have had, and in the future could have, a negative impact on our\nrevenues and operating margins.\nAbnormally wide bid/ask spreads and market disruptions that halt or disrupt trading or create extreme volatility could undermine investor\nconfidence in the ETP investment structure and limit investor acceptance of ETPs.\nETPs trade on exchanges in market transactions that generally approximate the value of the referenced assets or underlying portfolio of\nsecurities held by the particular ETP. Trading involves risks including the potential lack of an active market for fund shares, abnormally wide bid/ask\nspreads (the difference between the prices at which shares of an ETP can be bought and sold) that can exist for a variety of reasons and losses from\ntrading. These risks can be exacerbated during periods when there is low demand for an ETP, when the markets in the underlying investments are\nclosed, when market conditions are extremely volatile or when trading is disrupted. This could result in limited growth or a reduction in the overall\nETP market and result in our revenues not growing as rapidly as it has in the recent past or even in a reduction of revenues.\n25\nTable of Contents\nConcentration Risks\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of products and, as a result, our operating results are particularly exposed\nto investor sentiment toward investing in the products’ strategies and our ability to maintain the AUM of these products, as well as the\nperformance of these products.\nAt December 31, 2023, 54% of our AUM was concentrated in ten of our WisdomTree ETPs with approximately 18% in three of our domestic\nequity ETFs, 17% in the WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund, or USFR, 10% in three of our precious metal products, 6% in two of our\nemerging markets ETFs, and 3% in one of our international developed market equity ETPs. As a result, our operating results are particularly exposed\nto the performance of these funds and our ability to maintain the AUM of these funds, as well as investor sentiment toward investing in the funds’\nstrategies. If the AUM in these funds were to decline, either because of declining market values or net outflows from these funds, our revenues would\nbe adversely affected.\nDeclining commodity prices, and gold prices in particular, including as a result of changes in demand for commodities and gold as an\ninvestment, could materially and adversely affect our business.\nAt December 31, 2023, approximately 12% of our AUM were in ETPs backed by gold and approximately 10% were in ETPs backed by other\ncommodities. Precious metals such as gold are often viewed as “safe haven” assets as they tend to attract demand during periods of economic and\ngeopolitical uncertainty. Accommodative monetary policies are also favorable as the opportunity cost of forgoing investment in interest-bearing\nassets is low. Market conditions that are not conducive to investment in precious metals, such as a rising interest rate environment, may lead to\ndeclining prices that are linked to our ETPs and thereby adversely affect our AUM and revenues. We cannot provide any assurance that our products\nbacked by precious metals will benefit from favorable market conditions. In addition, changes in long-term demand cycles for commodities generally\nand cyclicality in demand for commodities as an investment asset, could reduce demand for certain of our products, limit our ability to successfully\nlaunch new products and also may lead to redemptions by existing investors.\nAlso, a portion of the advisory fee revenues we receive on our ETPs backed by gold are paid in gold ounces. While we may readily sell the\ngold that we earn under these advisory contracts, we still may maintain a position. We currently do not enter into arrangements to hedge against\nfluctuations in the price of gold and any hedging we may undertake in the future may not be cost-effective or sufficient to hedge against this gold\nexposure.\nA significant portion of our AUM is held in products with exposure to U.S. and international developed markets, and we therefore have exposure\nto domestic and foreign market conditions and are subject to currency exchange rate risks.\nAt December 31, 2023, approximately 29% and 15% of our AUM was held in products with exposure to the U.S. and international developed\nmarkets, respectively. Therefore, the success of our business is closely tied to various conditions in these markets which may be affected by domestic\nand foreign political, social and economic uncertainties, monetary policies conducted in these regions and other factors.\nIn addition, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could reduce the revenues we earn from certain foreign invested products. This\noccurs because an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to non-U.S. currencies may result in a decrease in the dollar value of the AUM in\nthese products, which, in turn, would result in lower revenues. Furthermore, investors may perceive certain foreign invested products, as well as\ncertain of our currency and fixed income products to be a less attractive investment opportunity when the value of the U.S. dollar rises relative to\nnon-U.S. currencies, which could have the effect of reducing investments in these products, thus reducing revenues. Our products exposed to the\nU.S. market may benefit from a rising U.S. dollar, but we can provide no assurance that this will be the case. Also, a weakening U.S. dollar relative to\nthe euro or yen may make less attractive our international hedged equity products, as unhedged alternatives would benefit from the appreciation of\nthe foreign currency or currencies while our products would not, which could result in redemptions in our funds.\nWithdrawals or broad changes in investments in our ETPs by investors with significant positions may negatively impact revenues and operating\nmargins.\nWe have had in the past, and may have in the future, investors who maintain significant positions in one or more of our ETPs. If such an\ninvestor were to broadly change or withdraw its investments in our ETPs because of a change to its investment strategy, market conditions or any\nother reason, it may significantly change the amount and mix of our AUM, which may negatively affect our revenues and operating margins.\n26\nTable of Contents\nThird-Party Provider Risks\nWe primarily depend on Mellon Investments Corporation, Newton Investment Management North America, LLC and Voya Investment\nManagement Co., LLC to provide portfolio management services, State Street Bank and Trust Company to provide us with critical administrative\nservices to operate our business and our U.S. listed ETFs, and other third parties to provide many other critical services to operate our business\nand our U.S. listed ETFs. The failure of key vendors to adequately provide such services could materially affect our operating business and harm\ninvestors in our products.\nWe depend on third-party vendors to provide us with many services that are critical to operating our business, including Mellon Investments\nCorporation, Newton Investment Management North America, LLC and Voya Investment Management Co., LLC as sub-advisers providing portfolio\nmanagement services, and State Street Bank and Trust Company, or State Street, to provide custody services, fund accounting, administration,\ntransfer agency and securities lending services. We also rely on third-party providers to license indexes to certain of our U.S. listed ETFs, perform\nindex calculation services for our indexes and a third-party distributor for our products. The failure of any of these key vendors to provide us and our\nproducts with these services could lead to operational issues and result in financial loss to us and investors in our products.\nWe depend on HSBC and JP Morgan to provide us with critical physical custody services for precious metals that back our ETCs. The failure of\nHSBC and JP Morgan to adequately safeguard the physical assets could materially adversely affect our business and harm investors in our\nproducts.\nWe depend on HSBC and JP Morgan to provide us with critical physical custody services for precious metals that back our ETCs. Such\nproducts that are backed by physical metal are subject to risks associated with the custody of physical assets, including the risk that access to the\nmetal held in the secure facilities managed by HSBC and JP Morgan could be restricted by a pandemic (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), natural\nevents (such as an earthquake) or human actions (such as a terrorist attack). In addition, there is a risk that the physical metal could be lost, stolen,\ndamaged or restricted. The failure of HSBC and JP Morgan to successfully provide us with these services could result in financial loss to us and\ninvestors in our products and our recovery of any losses from a custodian, sub-custodian or insurer may be inadequate.\nWe depend on Swissquote Bank Ltd and Coinbase Custody Trust LLC to provide us with critical custody services for digital currencies that back\nWisdomTree digital assets. The failure of Swissquote and/or Coinbase to adequately safeguard these digital assets could materially adversely\naffect our business and harm investors in this product.\nWe depend on Swissquote Bank Ltd and Coinbase Custody Trust LLC to provide us with critical custody services for digital currencies that\nback WisdomTree digital assets. Products that are backed by digital currencies are subject to the risks associated with the custody of digital assets,\nincluding the risk that the digital currencies or the blockchain infrastructure could be impacted by hacks or other malicious actions. WisdomTree\nIssuer X Limited is reliant on the security procedures and infrastructure of the custodian to safeguard the underlying digital currency cryptographic\nkeys. There is no guarantee that the arrangements of the custodian will fully protect from loss of assets. Damage to the infrastructure or loss of these\nassets may render the digital currency inaccessible and adversely impact the value of an investment in digital assets. The digital currencies may also\nbe exposed to the Internet briefly before reaching the secure accounts of the custodian. There are additional risks involved with an investment backed\nby digital currencies such as changes to the protocol (such as forks) which could damage the reputation of digital assets or result in losses for\ninvestors. The risks associated with digital currencies and the failure of the custodian to safeguard the underlying assets could result in financial loss\nto us and investors in our products and our recovery of any losses from a custodian may be inadequate. The custodians perform additional services to\ncrypto ETPs that may derive additional revenue by delegating a part of our assets to validate transactions on the relevant blockchain (“staking”).\nThere are certain operational and technological risks associated with staking such as penalties due to bad validator behavior. Operational and\ntechnical errors in the context of staking could damage the reputation of digital assets or result in losses for investors.\nWe depend on R&H Fund Services (Jersey) Limited in respect of the products issued by our Jersey-domiciled issuers, or ManJer Issuers, of ETCs\n(except WisdomTree Issuer X Limited), JTC Trust Company Jersey in respect of products issued by WisdomTree Issuer X Limited, APEX IFS\nLimited in respect of the products issued by WMAI and State Street Fund Services (Ireland) Limited in respect of the WisdomTree UCITS ETFs\nto provide us with critical administrative services to those products. The failure of any of those providers to adequately provide such services\ncould materially affect our operating business and harm investors in those products.\nWe depend on R&H Fund Services (Jersey) Limited in respect of the products issued by the ManJer Issuers (except WisdomTree Issuer X\nLimited), JTC Trust Company Jersey in respect of products issued by WisdomTree Issuer X Limited, APEX IFS Limited in respect of the products\nissued by WMAI and State Street Fund Services (Ireland) Limited in respect of the WisdomTree UCITS ETFs, to provide fund accounting,\nadministration and, transfer agency services, as well as custody services in the case of the WisdomTree UCITS ETFs. The failure of any service\nprovider to successfully provide these services could result in financial loss to the products, us and investors in those products. In addition, because\neach of the service providers provides a multitude of important services, changing these vendor relationships would be challenging. It might require\nus to devote a significant portion of management’s time to negotiate a similar relationship with other vendors or have these services provided by\nmultiple vendors, which would require us to coordinate the transfer of these functions to another vendor or vendors.\n27\nTable of Contents\nThe WisdomTree UCITS ETFs primarily depend on either of Assenagon Asset Management S.A. or Irish Life Investment Managers Limited to\nprovide portfolio management services and other third parties to provide many critical services to operate the WisdomTree UCITS ETFs. The\nfailure of key vendors to adequately provide such services could materially affect our operating business and harm investors in the WisdomTree\nUCITS ETFs.\nThe WisdomTree UCITS ETFs depend on third-party vendors to provide many services that are critical to operating our business, including\nAssenagon Asset Management S.A. and Irish Life Investment Managers Limited as investment managers that provide us with portfolio management\nservices and third-party providers of index calculation services. The failure of any of these key vendors to provide the WisdomTree UCITS ETFs\nwith these services could lead to operational issues and result in financial loss to us and investors in the WisdomTree UCITS ETFs.\nFailure of third-party vendors to maintain sufficient internal controls could adversely affect us.\nIf a third-party vendor fails to develop and maintain sufficient internal control processes or adequate data privacy controls and security systems,\nsuch failure could adversely affect us. For example, we have been notified of a deficiency in the internal controls of a third-party vendor of software\nwe utilize in our accounting processes. We have identified sufficient mitigating controls to alleviate the deficiency and do not believe the third-party’s\ndeficiency has a material impact on our operations or financial reporting. Any internal control failures that may arise in the future could adversely\naffect us if not sufficiently mitigated.\nThe products issued by our European business are subject to counterparty risks.\nThe products issued by our European business depend on the services of counterparties, custodians and other agents and are therefore subject to\na variety of counterparty risks, which are detailed above. Products issued by WMAI, certain WisdomTree UCITS ETFs and certain products issued\nby the ManJer Issuers are backed by swap, derivative or similar arrangements, which are subject to risks associated with the creditworthiness of their\ncounterparties, including the risk that a counterparty will not settle a transaction in accordance with its terms and conditions because of a dispute over\nthe terms of the relevant arrangement (whether or not bona fide) or because of a credit, liquidity, regulatory, tax or operational problem. Any\ndeterioration of the credit or downgrade in the credit rating of a counterparty, or the custodian holding the collateral, could cause the associated\nproducts to trade at a discount to the value of the underlying assets.\nThe terms of contracts with counterparties are generally complex, often customized and often not subject to regulatory oversight. A voluntary\nor involuntary default by a counterparty may occur at any time without notice. In the event of any default by, or the insolvency of, any counterparty,\nthe relevant products may be exposed to the under-segregation of assets, fraud or other factors that may result in the recovery of less than all of the\nproperty of our issuers that was held in custody or safekeeping in the case of physically backed products or the recovery of property that is\ninsufficient in value to cover all amounts payable to holders of the applicable products upon their redemption.\nThe impact of market stress or counterparty financial condition may not be accurately foreseen or evaluated and, as a result, we may not take\nsufficient action to reduce counterparty risks effectively. Any losses due to a counterparty’s failure to perform its contractual obligations will be borne\nby the relevant product issuer and there could be a substantial delay in recovering assets due from counterparties or it may not be possible to do so at\nall. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, the solvency of counterparties may increase operational risks or transaction costs, which may\nnegatively affect the investment performance of the relevant products and have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur risk management policies and procedures, and those of our third-party vendors upon which we rely, may not be fully effective in identifying\nor mitigating risk exposure, including employee misconduct. If our policies and procedures do not adequately protect us from exposure to these\nrisks, we may incur losses that would adversely affect our financial condition, reputation and market share.\nWe have developed risk management policies and procedures and we continue to refine them as we conduct our business. Many of our\nprocedures involve oversight of third-party vendors that provide us with critical services such as portfolio management, custody, fund accounting and\nadministration, and index calculation as further described in “Third-Party Provider Risks” above. However, our policies and procedures to identify,\nmonitor and manage risks may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure. Deficiencies in the risk management policies and procedures,\ninternal systems and controls of our third-party vendors may adversely affect our systems and controls. Moreover, we are subject to the risks of errors\nand misconduct by our employees, including fraud and non-compliance with policies. These risks are difficult to detect in advance and deter, and\ncould harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. Although we maintain insurance and use other traditional risk-shifting tools,\nsuch as third-party indemnification, to manage certain exposures, they are subject to terms such as deductibles, coinsurance, limits and policy\nexclusions, as well as risk of counterparty denial of coverage, default or insolvency. If our policies and procedures do not adequately protect us from\nexposure and our exposure is not adequately covered by insurance or other risk-shifting tools, we may incur losses that would adversely affect our\nfinancial condition and could cause a reduction in our revenues as investors in our products shift their investments to the products of our competitors.\n28\nTable of Contents\nCompetition and Distribution Risks\nThe asset management business is intensely competitive, and we may experience pressures on our pricing and market share, which could reduce\nrevenues and profit margins.\nOur business operates in a highly competitive industry. We compete directly with other ETP sponsors and mutual fund companies and\nindirectly against other investment management firms, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer\nproducts that have similar features and investment objectives to those offered by us. This includes fundamentally weighted or factor-based indexes or\ncurrency hedged products with fees that are generally equivalent to, and in some instances lower than, our products. We compete based on a number\nof factors, including name recognition, service, investment performance, product features, breadth of product choices and fees.\nIn addition, the adoption of Rule 6c-11, or the ETF Rule, removed the need to file for exemptive relief in order to issue ETFs, thereby creating\nfewer barriers to entry for competitors. We continue to expect that additional companies, both new and traditional asset managers, will enter and\nexpand in the ETP space.\nAlso, non-transparent active ETFs have been launched. These products are not required to disclose their holdings daily, as most ETFs currently\nare required to do. Such products may allow traditional actively managed mutual fund sponsors to compete more effectively against ETFs.\nSeveral ETP sponsors with whom we directly compete continue to migrate toward offering low and no fee products targeting gains in market\nshare. Price competition exists in not only commoditized product categories such as traditional, market capitalization weighted index exposures and\ncommodities, but also in non-market capitalization weighted or factor-based exposures and commodities. Fee reductions by certain of our\ncompetitors has been a trend over the last few years and continues to persist and many of our competitors are well positioned to benefit from this\ntrend. Certain larger competitors are able to offer products at lower price points or otherwise as loss leaders due to other revenue sources available\nwithin such competitor that are unavailable to us. Newer players have also been entering the ETP industry and frequently seek to differentiate by\noffering ETPs at a lower price point. Funds are being offered with fees of 20 basis points or less, which have attracted approximately 80% of the net\nflows globally during the last three years. Fee reduction by certain of our competitors has been a trend over the last few years and continues to persist\nand many of our competitors are well positioned to benefit from this trend.\nOur competition may have greater market share, offer a broader range of products and platforms and have greater financial resources than we\ndo. Some financial institutions operate in a more favorable regulatory environment and/or have proprietary products, sources of revenue and\ndistribution channels, which may provide them and their investment products with certain competitive advantages, including in pricing ETPs as loss\nleaders. Further consolidation within the industry may also put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWe believe that due to the continuing evolution of the competitive landscape described above, we have experienced, and may in the future\nexperience, pressures on our pricing and market share, which could reduce our revenues and profit margins.\nWe rely on third-party distribution channels to sell our products, and increased competition, a failure to maintain business relationships and\nother factors could adversely impact our business.\nWe rely on various third-party distribution channels, including registered investment advisers, wirehouse and institutional channels to sell our\nproducts. Increasing competition, a failure to maintain business relationships and other factors could impair our distribution capabilities and increase\nthe cost of conducting business. In addition, several of the largest custodial platforms and online brokerage firms eliminated trading commissions for\nETFs. Any inability to access and successfully sell our products through our distribution channels could have a negative effect on our AUM levels\nand adversely impact our business.\n29\nTable of Contents\nPerformance and Investment Risks\nMany of our ETPs have a limited track record and poor investment performance could cause our revenues to decline.\nMany of our ETPs have a limited track record upon which an evaluation of their investment performance can be made. Certain investors limit\ntheir investments to ETPs with track records of ten years or more. Furthermore, as part of our strategy, we continuously evaluate our product\nofferings to ensure that all our funds are useful, compelling and differentiated investment offerings, to align our overall product line more\ncompetitively in the current ETP landscape and to reallocate our resources to areas of greater client interest. As a result, we may further adjust our\nproduct offerings, which may result in the closing of some of our ETPs, changing their investment objective or offering of new funds. The investment\nperformance of our products is important to our success. While strong investment performance could stimulate sales of our ETPs, poor investment\nperformance, on an absolute basis or as compared to third-party benchmarks or competitive products, could lead to a decrease in sales or stimulate\nredemptions, thereby lowering the AUM and reducing our revenues. Our fundamentally-weighted equity products are designed to provide the\npotential for better risk-adjusted investment returns over full market cycles and are best suited for investors with a longer-term investment horizon.\nHowever, the investment approach of our equity products may not perform well during certain shorter periods of time during different points in the\neconomic cycle.\nOperational Risks\nOur European business subjects us to increased operational, regulatory, financial and other risks.\nWe face increased operational, regulatory, financial, compliance, reputational and foreign exchange rate risks as a result of conducting our\nbusiness internationally. The failure of our compliance and internal control systems to properly mitigate such additional risks, or of our infrastructure\nto support our European business, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions. If our European products and operations\nexperience any negative consequences or are perceived negatively in non-U.S. markets, it may also harm our reputation in other markets, including\nthe U.S. market.\nWe have and may continue to pursue acquisitions or other strategic transactions. Any strategic transactions that we are a party to will result in\nincreased demands on our management and other resources, may be significant in size relative to our assets and operations, result in significant\nchanges in our business and materially and adversely affect our stock price. If we were unable to manage our strategic initiatives, it could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\nWe have and may continue to pursue acquisitions or strategic transactions. These initiatives have placed increased demands on our management\nand other resources and may continue to do so in the future. We may not be able to manage our operations effectively or achieve our desired\nobjectives on a timely or profitable basis. To do so may require, among other things:\n• continuing to retain, motivate and manage our existing employees and/or attract and integrate new employees;\n• developing, implementing and improving our operational, financial, accounting, reporting and other internal systems and controls on a\ntimely basis; and\n• maintaining and developing our various support functions including human resources, information technology, legal and corporate\ncommunications.\nIf we are unable to manage these initiatives effectively, there could be a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain or increase revenues\nand profitability.\nManaging strategic initiatives may require continued investment in personnel, information technology infrastructure and marketing activities,\nas well as further development and implementation of financial, operational and compliance systems and controls. We may not be successful in\nimplementing all of the processes that are necessary. Unless such initiatives result in an increase in our revenues that is at least proportionate to the\nincrease in the costs associated with implementing them, our future profitability will be adversely affected.\nIn addition, any future strategic transactions may result in the issuance of a significant amount of our common stock or other securities that\ncould be dilutive to our stockholders, require substantial borrowings, result in changes in our board composition and/or management team, constitute\na change of control of our Company, lead to significant changes in our product offering, business operations and earning and risk profiles, and/or\nresult in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nOur ability to complete future strategic transactions depends upon a number of factors that are not entirely within our control, including our\nability to identify suitable merger or acquisition candidates, negotiate acceptable terms, conclude satisfactory agreements and secure financing. Our\nfailure to complete strategic transactions or to integrate and manage acquired or combined businesses successfully could materially and adversely\naffect our business, results of operations and financial conditions.\n30\nTable of Contents\nWe instruct trades and perform other operational processes in respect of crypto basket ETPs that we have launched in Europe. Operational\nfailures could materially affect our business and harm investors in these products.\nWe have launched products in Europe that are indexed to baskets of cryptocurrencies or that may allow for staking. We have outsourced the\nadministrator, transfer agent and custodial functions for these products. While we typically outsource portfolio management services to third-party\nsub-advisers for our products, in this case, we instead act as determination agent and place buy and sell orders directly with a broker to rebalance\nthese crypto basket ETPs in line with the indices. These rebalances typically occur quarterly. Expanding trading volumes may increase the risk of\ntrading errors. The failure of any of our vendors to provide us and our products with the outsourced services and our failure to correctly place trade\norders could lead to operational issues and result in financial loss to us and/or investors in our products. For products through which we derive\nadditional revenue by staking, we operationally delegate the relevant assets to validators in our role as determination agent. Operational errors in the\nprocess could materially affect our business and harm investors in these products. In addition, staking features, such as lock-up periods, staking\nreward payout periods and reward amounts, are not necessarily fixed over time and can cause liquidity risk or delay the standard settlement period.\nThis may cause redemptions to be delayed and may result in a financial loss to investors.\nCatastrophic and unpredictable events could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA terrorist attack, war, power failure, cyber-attack, natural disaster, pandemic event or other catastrophic or unpredictable event could adversely\naffect our revenues, expenses and operating results by: interrupting our normal business operations; inflicting employee casualties, including loss of\nour key employees; requiring substantial expenditures and expenses to repair, replace and restore normal business operations; and reducing investor\nconfidence. We have a disaster recovery plan to address certain contingencies, but this plan may not be sufficient in responding or ameliorating the\neffects of all disaster scenarios. Similarly, these types of events could also affect the ability of the third-party vendors that we rely upon to conduct\nour business, including parties that provide us with sub-advisory portfolio management services, custodial, fund accounting and administration\nservices or index calculation services, to continue to provide these necessary services to us, even though they may also have disaster recovery plans\nto address these contingencies. In addition, a failure of the stock exchanges on which our products trade to function properly could cause a material\ndisruption to our business. If we or our third-party vendors are unable to respond adequately or in a timely manner, these failures may result in a loss\nof revenues and/or increased expenses, either of which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nTechnology Risks\nAny significant limitation or failure of our technology systems, or of our third-party vendors’ technology systems, or any security breach of our\ninformation and cyber security infrastructure, software applications, technology or other systems that are critical to our operations could\ninterrupt or damage our operations and result in material financial loss, regulatory violations, reputational harm or legal liability.\nWe are dependent upon the effectiveness of our own, and our vendors’, information security policies, procedures and capabilities to protect the\ntechnology systems used to operate our business, to protect the data that reside on or are transmitted through them and to maintain adequate internal\ncontrols. Although we and our third-party vendors take protective measures to secure information, our and our vendors’ technology systems have\nexperienced cybersecurity threats and may still be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other events that could result in\ninaccuracies in our information or system disruptions or failures, which could materially interrupt or damage our operations. These risks have\nincreased with the launch of the WisdomTree Prime mobile application and may continue to increase in the future as the mobile application’s\navailability expands. In addition, technology is subject to rapid change and we cannot guarantee that our competitors may not implement more\nadvanced technology platforms for their products, which could affect our business. Any inaccuracies, delays, system failures or breaches, or\nadvancements in technology, and the cost necessary to address them, could subject us to client dissatisfaction and losses or result in material financial\nloss, regulatory violations, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, could cause a decline in our earnings or stock price.\nHuman Capital Risks\nOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to retain or recruit key personnel.\nThe success of our business is highly dependent on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled, and sometimes highly specialized,\nemployees, including in particular, operations, product development, research, technology, sales and marketing personnel. Our U.S. employees\ngenerally may voluntarily terminate their employment at any time. The market for these individuals is extremely competitive and is likely to become\nmore so as additional investment management firms enter the ETF industry and as the digital assets market continues to develop. Our compensation\nmethods may not enable us to recruit and retain required personnel. For example, price volatility in our common stock may impact our ability to\neffectively use equity grants as an employee compensation incentive. Also, we may need to increase compensation levels, which would decrease our\nnet income or increase our losses. If we are unable to retain and attract key personnel, it could have an adverse effect on our business, our results of\noperations and financial condition.\n31\nTable of Contents\nExpense and Cash Management Risks\nOur expenses are subject to fluctuations that could materially affect our operating results.\nOur results of operations are impacted by the magnitude of our expenses and may fluctuate as a result of inflation, as well as discretionary\nspending, including additional headcount, accruals for incentive compensation, marketing, advertising, sales and other expenses we incur in\nconnection with our operations. We also have launched our digital assets business and expenses ultimately incurred in the near and long-term may be\nhigher than anticipated. Accordingly, fluctuations in our expenses could materially affect our operating results and may vary from quarter to quarter.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nCompliance with extensive, complex and changing regulation imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business, and non-\ncompliance could result in fines and penalties.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation of our business and operations. One of our U.S. subsidiaries, WT Asset Management, is a registered\ninvestment adviser and is subject to oversight by the SEC pursuant to its regulatory authority under the Investment Advisers Act. We also must\ncomply with certain requirements under the Investment Company Act, with respect to the WisdomTree U.S. listed ETFs for which WT Asset\nManagement acts as investment adviser. WT Asset Management is also a member of the NFA and registered as a commodity pool operator for certain\nof our ETFs. As a commodity pool operator, we are subject to oversight by the NFA and the CFTC pursuant to regulatory authority under the\nCommodity Exchange Act. In addition, the content and use of our marketing and sales materials and of our sales force in the U.S. regarding our\nU.S. listed ETFs is subject to the regulatory authority of FINRA. The SEC also has recently adopted rule amendments that are designed to modernize\nsales and marketing materials and, as a result, impact marketing materials. We are also subject to foreign laws and regulatory authorities with respect\nto operational aspects of our products that invest in securities of issuers in foreign countries, in the marketing, offer and/or sales of our products in\nforeign jurisdictions and in our offering of investment products domiciled outside of the U.S., such as our ETPs issued by the ManJer Issuers, UCITS\nETFs and ETPs issued by WMAI. Each of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many aspects of our\nbusiness, including the authority to grant, and, in specific circumstances to cancel, permissions to carry on particular businesses. Our or our ETPs’\nfailure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, censure, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation\nof our registration as an investment adviser. Even if a sanction imposed against us, our personnel or our ETPs is small in monetary amount, the\nadverse publicity arising from the imposition of sanctions against us, our personnel or our ETPs by regulators could harm our reputation and thus\nresult in redemptions from our products and impede our ability to retain and attract investors in WisdomTree ETPs, all of which may reduce our\nrevenues.\nWe face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities, including extended investigation activity, adoption of costly or restrictive\nnew regulations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties. Among other things, we could be fined or be\nprohibited from engaging in some of our business activities. The requirements imposed by our regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the\nfinancial markets and to protect investors in WisdomTree ETPs and our advisory clients and are not designed to protect our stockholders.\nConsequently, these regulations often serve to limit our activities, including through WisdomTree ETP investor protection and market conduct\nrequirements.\nThe regulatory environment in which we operate also is subject to modifications and further regulation. Concerns have been raised at various\ntimes about ETFs’ possible contribution to market volatility as well as the disclosure requirements applicable to certain types of more complex ETFs.\nIn addition, the SEC recently approved a broad set of rules regarding data reporting and fund liquidity, fund valuation and funds’ use of derivatives,\nwhich are imposing additional expense and require additional administrative services and requirements, among other matters, in seeking to comply\nwith these rules. New laws or regulations, or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations, applicable to us or investors in our products\nalso may adversely affect our business, and our ability to function in this environment will depend on our ability to constantly monitor and react to\nthese changes. Compliance with new laws and regulations may result in increased compliance costs and expenses.\nSpecific regulatory changes also may have a direct impact on our revenues. In addition to regulatory scrutiny and potential fines and sanctions,\nregulators continue to examine different aspects of the asset management industry. New regulation, revised regulatory or judicial interpretations,\nrevised viewpoints, outcomes of lawsuits against other fund complexes or growth in our ETP assets and/or profitability related to the annual approval\nprocess for investment advisory agreements may result in the reduction of fees under these agreements, which would mean a reduction in our\nrevenues or otherwise may lead to an increase in costs or expenses.\nOur operations outside the U.S. are subject to the laws and regulations of various non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. regulatory agencies and\nbodies. As we have expanded our international presence, a number of our subsidiaries and international operations have become subject to regulatory\nsystems in various jurisdictions, comparable to those covering our operations in the U.S. Regulators in these non-U.S. jurisdictions may have broad\nauthority with respect to the regulation of financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant or cancel required licenses or\nregistrations.\n32\nTable of Contents\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings that could require significant management time and attention, possibly resulting in\nsignificant expense or in an unfavorable outcome, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to litigation. In any litigation in which we are involved, we may be forced to incur costs and expenses to\ndefend ourselves or to pay a settlement or judgment or comply with any injunctions in connection therewith if there is an unfavorable outcome. The\nexpense of defending litigation may be significant. The amount of time to resolve lawsuits is unpredictable and defending ourselves may divert\nmanagement’s attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and cash flows. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in any such litigation, including actual and potential claims by investors in our\nWisdomTree WTI Crude Oil 3x Daily Leveraged ETP totaling approximately €23.6 million ($26.1 million), could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional\ninformation.\nWe may from time to time be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, which could harm our business.\nThird parties may assert against us alleged patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights to intellectual property that is\nimportant to our business. Any claims that our products or processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others, regardless of the merit or\nresolution of such claims, could cause us to incur significant costs in responding to, defending and resolving such claims, and may divert the efforts\nand attention of our management from our business. As a result of such intellectual property infringement claims, we could be required or otherwise\ndecide that it is appropriate to:\n• pay third-party infringement claims;\n• discontinue selling the particular funds subject to infringement claims;\n• discontinue using the processes subject to infringement claims;\n• develop other intellectual property or products not subject to infringement claims, which could be time-consuming and costly or may not\nbe possible; or\n• license the intellectual property from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially\nreasonable terms.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in unexpected expenses, reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nWe have been issued trademark and other intellectual property rights, but may not be able to enforce or protect such intellectual property rights,\nwhich may harm our business.\nAlthough we have trademarks, including the marks WisdomTree®, WisdomTree Prime™ and Modern Alpha®, and other intellectual property\nrights that are registered in the U.S. and certain other countries, including a patent relating to our index methodology and the operation of our ETFs,\nour ability to enforce such intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks. If we cannot successfully enforce our intellectual property\nrights, we may lose the value of our brand and business reputation. If we seek to enforce our rights, we could be subject to litigation, including\nchallenges to our registered intellectual property right and claims that our intellectual property right is invalid or is otherwise not enforceable in\njurisdictions where our intellectual property right is not registered. Furthermore, our assertion of intellectual property rights could result in the other\nparty seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own or assert other claims against us, which could harm our business. If we are not\nultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation, we may be subject to the risks described in the immediately preceding\nrisk factor entitled “We may from time to time be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, which could harm our\nbusiness.”\nDigital Assets Risks\nAs we endeavor to expand our digital assets product offerings and services beyond our existing ETP business, we believe the risks associated\nwith our digital assets business include, but are not limited to, the following risks:\n33\nTable of Contents\nCompetition risks\nCompetition in the digital assets industry on a global basis is increasing, ranging from large, established financial incumbents to smaller, early-\nstage financial technology providers and companies. There are jurisdictions with more stringent and robust regulatory and compliance requirements\nthan others which could impact the ability of a company to compete in the digital assets industry. Our ability to successfully compete will depend\nlargely on offering innovative products through digital asset exposures (and more broadly in blockchain-enabled finance, including savings and\npayments), having strong internal controls and risk management infrastructure to enable customer trust, embracing regulation, developing strategic\npartnerships with participants in the digital assets ecosystem and broader financial services ecosystem, promoting thought leadership and consumer\neducation or awareness, building upon our brand and attracting and retaining talented employees. Failure to do so could negatively impact the success\nof our digital assets business.\nNew product risks\nWe have and may continue to spend substantial time and resources developing our digital assets product offerings and services. If these\nproducts and initiatives are not successful, or their implementation or launches are delayed, including in connection with our inability to obtain new\nproduct regulatory approvals, we may not be able to offset their costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nOur digital assets business subjects us to risks similar to those associated with any new product offerings, including, but not limited to, our\nability to accurately anticipate market demand and adoption, technical issues with the operation of the products, and legal and regulatory risks as\ndiscussed herein. Substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including rapid technological\nchange in the industry, significant and ongoing investments required to bring new products and services to market in a timely manner at competitive\nprices, protection of intellectual property and other confidential information, the competition for employees with the necessary expertise and\nexperience, and producing sales and other materials that fully and accurately describe the product or service and its underlying risks and that are\ncompliant with applicable regulations. New products or services may fail to operate or perform as expected and may not produce anticipated\nefficiencies, savings or benefits. Our failure to manage these risks and uncertainties also exposes us to enhanced risk of operational lapses and third-\nparty claims, which may result in the recognition of financial statement liabilities.\nFailure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of our digital assets business could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nOutsourced service provider risks\nWe rely on third-party service providers in connection with different facets of our digital assets business, including but not limited to custodial\narrangements, blockchain and wallet infrastructure, banking relationships, cloud computing, payment platforms and processors, data infrastructure,\ncustomer support, compliance support and product development, including mobile application development, all of which are critical to the success of\nour digital assets business. In addition, we have partnered with a financial institution to provide co-branded debit cards to retail customers. The loss\nof, or interruption of service from, a critical third-party service provider could adversely impact our digital assets business, operating results and\nfinancial condition. We may incur significant costs to resolve any such disruptions in service. In addition, such third-party service providers may be\nsubject to financial, legal, regulatory and labor issues, data security and cybersecurity incidents, denial-of-service attacks, sabotage, privacy breaches\nor violations, fraud and other misconduct, which could directly or indirectly have an impact on our digital assets products and services. If any third-\nparty service provider fails to adequately or appropriately render services or fails to meet its contractual requirements (including compliance with\napplicable laws and regulations), we could be subject to regulatory enforcement actions and claims from third parties (including our customers), and\nsuffer economic and reputational harm that could have an adverse effect on our digital assets business, operating results and financial condition.\nCybersecurity risks\nThe use of various technologies is vital to our digital assets business and will become more prevalent, which will make us more susceptible to\noperational and data security risks resulting from a breach in cybersecurity, including cyberattacks. A breach in cybersecurity, intentional or\nunintentional, may have an adverse impact on our digital assets business in many ways, including but not limited to, the loss or destruction of\nproprietary information, theft or corruption of data, denial-of-service attacks on websites or network resources, and the unauthorized release or\nmisuse of confidential information.\nRegulatory risks\nThe digital assets industry is rapidly evolving at an unprecedented rate. There is a high degree of regulatory uncertainty associated with the\ndigital assets industry, which means that the products and services our digital assets business provides or may provide in the future could subject us to\nenhanced regulatory scrutiny or otherwise materially impact the quality or nature of such products or services. The effect of any future legal or\nregulatory change or interpretation both domestically and internationally is unknown and such change could be substantial and adverse to our digital\nassets business.\n34\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, we are actively engaged with a variety of U.S. federal and state regulators (e.g., the SEC, FINRA, NYDFS and other state\nregulators) to secure, as necessary, or maintain the appropriate regulatory, registration and/or licensing approvals for various business initiatives and\noperations, including but not limited to: a New York state-chartered limited purpose trust company; money services and money transmitter business;\nlimited purpose broker-dealer; transfer agent; investment adviser; and investment funds. For example, we are licensed as a money transmitter or the\nequivalent in many U.S. states and the District of Columbia, but we may be unable to obtain such licenses in all U.S. states (including in the state of\nNew York) or may experience significant delays, and this could have an adverse effect on our digital assets business. As we seek to expand globally,\nsimilar approvals and/or reliance on exemptions will be required in applicable foreign markets, which also may involve approvals specific to a digital\nassets or related business. As we secure the appropriate regulatory, registration and/or licensing approvals, or otherwise rely on, seek or confirm\nexemptions therefrom, in connection with our digital assets business, we are and will be subject to a myriad of complex and evolving global policy\nframeworks and associated regulatory requirements that we need to comply with, or otherwise be exempt from, to ensure our digital assets products\nand services are successfully brought to different markets in a compliant manner. Failure to secure and/or comply with any such approvals and\nexemptions could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses or registrations, loss of approved status, private litigation,\nadministrative enforcement actions, sanctions, civil and criminal liability, and constraints on our ability to continue to operate our digital assets\nbusiness, and have an adverse effect on our digital assets business.\nBlockchain infrastructure risks\nThe consensus or governance mechanisms of blockchain networks are subject to change and malfunctions and may not receive adequate\nadoption from users and miners, which could negatively impact the blockchain network’s ability to scale and improve programmability, transparency,\nauditability and security. In addition, blockchain networks face significant challenges in connection with the volume, speed, security and cost of\ntransactions, and their efforts to increase or enhance such characteristics of the blockchain network may not be successful or adversely affect other\ncharacteristics of the blockchain network. If the digital asset awards for verifying and confirming transactions on a blockchain network are not\nsufficiently high to incentivize miners, miners may cease to verify and confirm such transactions or otherwise demand higher fees, which could\nnegatively affect the value of a digital asset.\nBlockchain technology risks\nBlockchain technology is a relatively new and untested technology which operates as a distributed ledger. Blockchain systems could be\nvulnerable to fraud, particularly if a significant minority of participants colluded to defraud the rest. Access to a given blockchain requires an\nindividualized key, which if compromised, could result in loss due to theft, destruction or inaccessibility. There is little regulation of blockchain\ntechnology other than the intrinsic public nature of the blockchain system. Any future regulatory developments could affect the viability and\nexpansion of our use of blockchain technology. There are currently a number of competing blockchain platforms with competing intellectual property\nclaims. The uncertainty inherent in these competing technologies could cause companies to use alternatives to blockchain. In addition, blockchain\nnetworks may undergo technological developments, such as the Ethereum blockchain’s change in September 2022 from proof-of-work mining to a\nblockchain based on proof-of-stake validation. Segments of the mining community were against this change, which was complex and involved a\nmerger of the then existing Ethereum blockchain with the new Ethereum blockchain, which could potentially lead to greater centralization. Further,\ncertain miners and other users resisted adoption of the new Ethereum blockchain and it is possible that the two Ethereum blockchains (among\npotentially others) will endure and compete going forward, which may also slow or impede transactions. The risks associated with blockchain\ntechnology may not emerge until the technology is widely used, which could adversely impact our digital assets business.\nFork risks\nBlockchain software is generally open-source. Any user can download the software, modify it and then propose that the blockchain network\nadopt the modification. When a modification is introduced and a substantial majority of users consent to the modification, the change is implemented\nand the blockchain network remains uninterrupted. However, if less than a substantial majority of users consent to the proposed modification, and the\nblockchain consensus mechanism, such as that used by Ethereum, allows for the modification to nonetheless be implemented by some users and the\nmodification is not compatible with the software prior to its modification, the consequence would be what is known as a “fork” (i.e., “split”) of the\nblockchain network (and the blockchain), with one version running the pre-modified software and the other running the modified software. The effect\nof such a fork would be the existence of two (or more) versions of the blockchain network running in parallel, but with each version’s native asset\nlacking interchangeability. Additionally, a fork could be introduced by an unintentional, unanticipated software flaw in the multiple versions of\notherwise compatible software users run. If a fork occurs, the original blockchain and the forked blockchain could potentially compete with each\nother for users and other participants, leading to a loss of these for the original blockchain. A fork could adversely affect our digital assets business.\n35\nTable of Contents\nAnti-Money Laundering (“AML”) risks\nThe decentralized infrastructure and anonymous or pseudonymous nature of digital assets could facilitate and create the opportunity for money\nlaundering and terrorist financing activities, thereby circumventing certain anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing laws and regulations\ndesigned to prevent financial crimes which could negatively impact our digital assets business. In addition, certain aspects of our digital assets\nbusiness will have significantly greater anti-money laundering risk, including risk of fines or sanctions, than our historical ETP business due to the\ngreater number of potential customers, which may also include customers considered to be higher risk and/or customer types considered to be higher\nrisk, for which anti-money laundering and related obligations will apply.\nData privacy risks\nIn connection with the products or services offered by our digital assets business, we may collect, store, process, or transmit nonpublic\ninformation (including personally identifiable information and sensitive personally identifiable information) of a customer or consumer to a\nsignificantly greater extent than in our historical ETP business. Any change or failure to comply with data privacy laws or regulations related to the\ncollection, processing, use and storage of such nonpublic information could materially affect our digital assets business and overall financial health.\nOther risks\nThe risk of loss in purchasing, selling, trading, using or holding digital assets can be substantial. The price and liquidity of digital assets may be\nsubject to high degrees of volatility resulting in large deviations or fluctuations from normalized levels. There is also heightened custodial risk due to\nthe unique safekeeping attributes associated with public and private keys of digital assets.\nOther Company Risks\nResponding to actions of activist stockholders against us has been costly and the possibility that activist stockholders may wage proxy contests or\nseek representation on our Board of Directors in the future may be disruptive and cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.\nDuring fiscal years 2022 and 2023, we were the target of stockholder activism whereby a certain investor, acting together with other investors\nduring 2022 (the “Investor Group”) and acting alone during 2023 (the “Investor”), notified us of their intention to nominate director candidates to\nstand for election to the Board of Directors at the 2022 and 2023 Annual Meetings of Stockholders. On May 25, 2022, we entered into a cooperation\nagreement (the “Cooperation Agreement”) with the Investor Group whereby we agreed, among other things, to increase the size of our Board of\nDirectors by two to a total of nine directors and appoint two nominees proposed by the Investor Group. At the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders,\nour stockholders elected five of our six nominees to the Board of Directors and one of three nominees proposed by the Investor. Responding to\nactions by the Investor and the Investor Group has been costly and actions by activist stockholders to seek representation on our Board of Directors in\nthe future may similarly impact us.\nActivist stockholders, such as the Investor, may from time to time attempt to effect changes in our strategic direction, and in furtherance\nthereof, may seek changes in how our Company is governed. Our Board of Directors and management strive to maintain constructive, ongoing\ncommunications with our stockholders, including the Investor, and welcome their views and opinions with the goal of enhancing value for all\nstockholders. However, an activist campaign that seeks to replace members of our Board of Directors or changes in our strategic direction could have\nan adverse effect on us because:\n• responding to actions by activist stockholders is costly and may be disruptive, time-consuming and divert the attention of our Board of\nDirectors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and\nfinancial condition;\n• perceived uncertainties about our future direction as a result of changes to the composition of our Board of Directors or changes to our\nstockholder base may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity which may be\nexploited by our competitors, may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain\nqualified personnel and business partners;\n• these types of actions could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or\nother factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business; and\n• if individuals are elected to our Board of Directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our\nbusiness strategy and to create additional value for our stockholders.\n36\nTable of Contents\nA change of control of our Company would automatically terminate our investment management agreements relating to the WisdomTree\nU.S. listed ETFs and Digital Funds, unless the Board of Trustees of the WisdomTree Trust, WisdomTree Digital Trust and shareholders of each\nvoted to continue the agreements. A change in control could occur if a third party were to acquire a controlling interest in our Company.\nUnder the Investment Company Act, an investment management agreement with a fund must provide for its automatic termination in the event\nof its assignment. The fund’s board must vote to continue such an agreement following any such assignment and the shareholders of the WisdomTree\nTrust and WisdomTree Digital Trust must approve the assignment. The cost of obtaining such shareholder approval can be significant and ordinarily\nwould be borne by us. Similarly, under the Investment Advisers Act, a client’s investment management agreement may not be “assigned” by the\ninvestment adviser without the client’s consent.\nAn investment management agreement is considered under both acts to be assigned to another party when a controlling block of the adviser’s\nsecurities is transferred. Under both acts, there is a presumption that a stockholder beneficially owning 25% or more of an adviser’s voting stock\ncontrols the adviser and conversely a stockholder beneficially owning less than 25% is presumed not to control the adviser. In our case, an\nassignment of our investment management agreements may occur if a third party were to acquire a controlling interest in our Company. We cannot be\ncertain that the Trustees of the WisdomTree Trust and WisdomTree Digital Trust would consent to assignments of our investment management\nagreements or approve new agreements with us if a change of control occurs. And even if such approval were obtained, approval from the\nshareholders of the WisdomTree Trust and WisdomTree Digital Trust would be required to be obtained; such approval could not be guaranteed and\neven if obtained, likely would result in significant expense. This restriction may discourage potential purchasers from acquiring a controlling interest\nin our Company.\nOur revenues could be adversely affected if the Independent Trustees of the WisdomTree Trust or WisdomTree Digital Trust, as applicable, do not\napprove the continuation of our advisory agreements or determine that the advisory fees we receive from the WisdomTree U.S. listed ETFs or\nDigital Funds should be reduced.\nOur revenues are derived primarily from investment advisory agreements with related parties. Our advisory agreements with the WisdomTree\nTrust and WisdomTree Digital Trust, and the fees we collect from the WisdomTree U.S. listed ETFs and Digital Funds are subject to review and\napproval by the Independent Trustees of the WisdomTree Trust and WisdomTree Digital Trust, as applicable. The advisory agreements are subject to\ninitial review and approval. After the initial two-year term of the agreement for each ETF or Digital Fund, the continuation of such agreement must\nbe reviewed and approved at least annually by a majority of the Independent Trustees. In determining whether to approve the agreements, the\nIndependent Trustees consider factors such as the nature and quality of the services provided by us, the fees charged by us and the costs and profits\nrealized by us in connection with such services, as well as any ancillary or “fall-out” benefits from such services, the extent to which economies of\nscale are shared with the WisdomTree U.S. listed ETFs or Digital Funds, and the level of fees paid by other similar funds. Our revenues would be\nadversely affected if the Independent Trustees do not approve the continuation of our advisory agreements or determines that the advisory fees we\ncharge to any particular fund are too high, resulting in a reduction of our fees.\nDamage to our reputation could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe we have developed a strong brand and a reputation for innovative, thoughtful products, favorable long-term investment\nperformance and excellent client services. The WisdomTree name and brand is a valuable asset and any damage to it could hamper our ability to\nmaintain and grow our AUM and attract and retain employees, thereby having a material adverse effect on our revenues. Risks to our reputation may\nrange from regulatory issues to unsubstantiated accusations. Managing such matters may be expensive, time-consuming and difficult.\nRisks Relating to our Common and Preferred Stock and Convertible Notes\nThe market price of our common stock has been fluctuating significantly and may continue to do so, and you could lose all or part of your\ninvestment.\nThe market price of our common stock has been fluctuating significantly and may continue to do so, depending upon many factors, some of\nwhich may be beyond our control, including:\n• actions of activist stockholders against us, which have been costly and may be disruptive and may cause uncertainty about the strategic\ndirection of our business;\n• decreases in our AUM;\n• variations in our quarterly operating results;\n• differences between our actual financial operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;\n• publication of research reports about us or the investment management industry;\n• changes in expectations concerning our future financial performance and the future performance of the ETP industry and the asset\nmanagement industry in general, including financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n37\nTable of Contents\n• our strategic moves and those of our competitors, such as acquisitions or consolidations;\n• changes in the regulatory framework of the ETP industry and the asset management industry in general and regulatory action, including\naction by the SEC to lessen the regulatory requirements or shorten the process under the Investment Company Act to become an ETP\nsponsor;\n• the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock;\n• changes in general economic or market conditions; and\n• realization of any other of the risks described elsewhere in this section.\nIn addition, stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular\ncompany. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Furthermore, in the past, market fluctuations\nand price declines in a company’s stock have led to securities class action litigations or other derivative stockholder lawsuits. If such a suit were to\narise, it could cause substantial costs to us and divert our resources regardless of the outcome.\nIf equity research analysts issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our\nbusiness. We do not control the opinions of these analysts. The price and trading volume of our common stock could decline if one or more equity\nanalysts issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes or to repurchase the Convertible Notes\nupon a fundamental change.\nWe currently have outstanding $150.0 million of 3.25% convertible senior notes due 2026 and $130.0 million in aggregate principal amount of\n5.75% convertible senior notes due 2028, which we collectively refer to as the Convertible Notes. Holders of the Convertible Notes have the right to\nrequire us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of certain change of control transactions or liquidation, dissolution or common stock\ndelisting events (each, a “fundamental change”), at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus\naccrued and unpaid interest, if any, as described in the respective indentures between us and the trustee. In addition, upon conversion of the\nConvertible Notes, we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted as described in the indentures. However, we\nmay not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of notes surrendered therefor or\nnotes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the notes may be limited by law, regulatory\nauthority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Further, if the fundamental change also constitutes a change of control under the\nCertificate of Designations for our Series A Preferred Stock and we are required to make other redemption payments as a result of the change of\ncontrol, we would be required to satisfy that obligation before making any payments on the notes. Our failure to repurchase notes at a time when the\nrepurchase is required by the applicable indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the notes as required by the indenture would\nconstitute a default under the indenture.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity.\nWe currently have outstanding $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.25% convertible senior notes due 2026 and $130.0 million in\naggregate principal amount of 5.75% convertible senior notes due 2028, which we collectively refer to as the Convertible Notes. In the event the\nconditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified\nperiods at their option, as described in the indentures. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, we would be required to settle any converted\nprincipal through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity.\nSeries A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock issued in connection with the ETFS Acquisition contain redemption rights, which, if triggered,\ncould materially impact our financial position.\nIn connection with the ETFS Acquisition, we issued 14,750 shares of Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, or Series A Preferred\nStock, to ETFS Capital, which are convertible into 14,750,000 shares of our common stock, subject to certain restrictions. ETFS Capital also has\nredemption rights for the Series A Preferred Stock to protect against corporate events such as our having an insufficient number of shares of\nauthorized common stock to permit full conversion and if, upon a change of control of us, ETFS Capital does not receive the same amount per share\nof Series A Preferred Stock that it would have received had these shares been converted prior to a change of control. Any such redemption will be at a\nprice per share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to the dollar volume-weighted average price for a share of common stock for the 30-trading day\nperiod ending on the date of such attempted conversion or change of control, as applicable, multiplied by 1,000. The redemption value of the Series A\nPreferred Stock was $96.9 million at December 31, 2023.\n38\nTable of Contents\nFuture issuances of our common stock or equity-linked securities could lower our stock price and dilute the interests of existing stockholders.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock or equity-linked securities in the future, either in connection with an acquisition or for\nother business reasons. The issuance of a substantial amount of common stock or equity-linked securities could have the effect of substantially\ndiluting the interests of our current stockholders. In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of common stock or equity-linked securities in the\npublic market, either in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by the target company in an acquisition which received such common stock as\nconsideration or by investors who acquired such common stock in a private placement, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of\nour common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may prevent or delay an acquisition of our Company, which could decrease the market\nvalue of our common stock.\nProvisions of Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation and our by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other\nchange in control that stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions may also prevent or delay attempts by stockholders to replace or\nremove our current management or members of our Board of Directors. These provisions include:\n• limitations on the removal of directors;\n• advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n• the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings;\n• the ability of our Board of Directors to make, alter or repeal our by-laws; and\n• the authority of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as our Board of Directors may determine.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits business combination\ntransactions with stockholders of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock that our Board of Directors has not approved. These provisions and\nother similar provisions make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to acquire us without negotiation. These provisions may apply\neven if some stockholders may consider the transaction beneficial to them.\nAs a result, these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These\nprovisions might also discourage a potential acquisition proposal or tender offer, even if the acquisition proposal or tender offer is at a premium over\nthe then current market price for our common stock.\nOur stockholder rights plan, or “poison pill,” includes terms and conditions that could discourage a takeover or other transaction that\nstockholders may consider favorable.\nOn June 16, 2023, our stockholders voted to ratify the adoption by our Board of Directors of the Stockholder Rights Agreement, dated\nMarch 17, 2023 and subsequently amended on May 4, 2023 and on May 10, 2023 (as amended, the “Stockholder Rights Agreement”), by and\nbetween the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as Rights Agent. The Stockholder Rights Agreement was adopted in\nresponse to stockholder activism concerns and is intended to protect the Company and its stockholders from efforts by a single stockholder or group\nof stockholders to obtain control of the Company without paying a control premium through a number of recognized stockholder protections.\nGenerally, the Stockholder Rights Agreement works by causing substantial dilution to any person or group (other than specified exempt persons) that\nacquires 10% (or 20% in the case of passive stockholders) or more of the shares of common stock without the approval of the Board of Directors\n(such person or group, an “Acquiring Person”) through the issuance of “Rights” to stockholders of record as of, and subsequent to, the close of\nbusiness on March 28, 2023, which Rights entitle the registered holders thereof (other than the Acquiring Person) to receive additional shares of our\ncommon stock upon exercise of such Rights. As a result, the overall effect of the Stockholder Rights Agreement may be to render more difficult or\ndiscourage a merger, tender or exchange offer or other business combination involving our Company that is not approved by the Board of Directors\neven if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. The Rights will expire at the close of business on March 16, 2024, unless\npreviously redeemed or exchanged by the Company. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe payment of dividends to our stockholders and our ability to repurchase our common stock is subject to the discretion of our Board of\nDirectors and may be limited by our financial condition and any applicable laws.\nAny determination as to the payment of dividends or stock repurchases, as well as the level of such dividends or repurchases, will depend on,\namong other things, general economic and business conditions, our level of AUM, our strategic plans, our financial results and condition, limitations\nassociated with new credit facilities or other agreements that could limit the amount of dividends we are permitted to pay or the stock we may\nrepurchase, and any applicable laws, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes an excise tax that would impose a 1% surcharge on stock\nrepurchases. If, as a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, we are unable to generate sufficient income from our business, we may\nneed to reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends on our common stock or cease repurchasing our common stock. Any change in our stock\nrepurchases or the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect our stock price.\nIn addition, our Board of Directors is authorized, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with such terms as our Board of\nDirectors may, in its discretion, determine. Our Board of Directors could, therefore, issue preferred stock with dividend rights superior to that of the\ncommon stock, which could also limit the payment of dividends on the common stock.\n39\nTable of Contents\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nWe have no unresolved comments from the SEC staff relating to our periodic or current reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the\nExchange Act.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nUnder the oversight of our Board of Directors, we have implemented and maintain cybersecurity risk management policies and procedures that\ninclude processes for the identification, assessment and treatment through mitigation, transfer, avoidance and/or acceptance of cybersecurity risks.\nOur cybersecurity risk management policies and procedures are informed by industry standards, and they are designed to address cybersecurity\nrisks identified by external auditors and assessors, threat intelligence providers, internal stakeholders, vulnerability management programs and\nsecurity management programs. Our team of information technology and cybersecurity professionals, led by our Chief Information Officer, or CIO,\nmanages and maintains remediation strategies for identified cybersecurity risks and regularly reports on such risks to senior management, including\nour Governance Committee as described below.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program is designed to be aligned with our business strategy. It shares common methodologies, reporting\nchannels and governance processes that apply to other areas of enterprise risk, including legal, compliance, strategic, operational and financial risk.\nKey elements of our cybersecurity risk management program include:\n• periodic risk assessments designed to help identify cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, services and our\nbroader enterprise information technology environment;\n• a security and infrastructure team principally responsible for managing our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, our security controls\nand our response to cybersecurity incidents;\n• the use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls;\n• employee training and awareness programs that include periodic and ongoing assessments in an effort to drive adoption and awareness of\ncybersecurity processes and controls;\n• a cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; and\n• processes to evaluate cybersecurity risks posed by critical third-party vendors, including through the use of security questionnaires.\nAdditionally, as a public company, we are subject to Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) requirements and must undergo independent audits of Information\nTechnology General Controls (ITGC) in support of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR). These audits assess key information security\nand cybersecurity risks in the environment that may affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of financial reporting systems and data. If any\ncontrol deficiencies that represent material cybersecurity risks were identified, those would be reported to the Audit Committee, and the results of\nthese evaluations would be considered in the overall audit opinion for the Company.\nGovernance Related to Cybersecurity Risks\nOur cybersecurity risk management program and related operations and processes are directed by our CIO. Currently, the CIO role is held by\nan individual who has been in the role for over nine years, has over 22 years of cybersecurity, information technology and systems engineering\nexperience, and has advanced training in the field of technology.\n40\nTable of Contents\nThe CIO is a member of our Governance Committee and regularly reports on cybersecurity risk management to other members of the\nGovernance Committee comprised of the Company’s senior executive officers. The Governance Committee oversees the prioritization and escalation\nof risks from cybersecurity threats and is responsible for strategy, operations, financial management, information technology, compliance, legal,\nadministration and corporate governance. The members of the Governance Committee collectively possess experience in these areas, including\ncybersecurity and risk management.\nThe Audit Committee oversees our management of cybersecurity risks. Pursuant to the Audit Committee charter, the Audit Committee is\nresponsible for discussing cybersecurity-related risks with management and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such risks,\nincluding our risk assessment and risk management policies. The CIO regularly reports to the Audit Committee on our cybersecurity risks, and the\nchair of the Audit Committee reports on these discussions with the full Board of Directors. In addition, the CIO provides periodic reports to our\nBoard of Directors.\nWhile we have not, as of the date of this Report, experienced a cybersecurity incident that resulted in a material adverse impact to our business\nor operations, there can be no guarantee that we will not experience such an incident in the future. For information regarding cybersecurity risks that\nmay materially affect our Company, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in this Report.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur principal executive office is located at 250 West 34th Street, 3rd Floor, New York, New York, pursuant to a license agreement that expires in\nApril 2025, with the option to terminate in April 2024. This reduced footprint, as compared to our prior headquarters, better aligns with the number of\nemployees expected to collaborate in person on any given day. While we believe having a physical office space for employees to work and socialize\nis important, we embrace a “Work Smart” philosophy that transcends physical work settings, with a focus on optimizing productivity, efficiency and\neffectiveness of our work. Time in the office generally is not prescribed, and team leaders are empowered to determine how their teams work best,\nbased on their roles, with employees remaining accountable for achieving individual, team and Company outcomes. We believe that this space is\nsufficient to meet our needs until the expiration of the license agreement.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe may be subject to reviews, inspections and investigations by the SEC, CFTC, NFA, state and foreign regulators, as well as legal\nproceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding\nactual and potential claims by investors in our WisdomTree WTI Crude Oil 3x Daily Leveraged ETP totaling approximately €23.6 million\n($26.1 million).\nITEM 4.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES\nOF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “WT.” As of December 31, 2023, there were 30 holders of\nrecord of shares of our common stock and we believe there were approximately 18,000 beneficial owners of our common stock.\nIn November 2014, we commenced a quarterly cash dividend and intend to continue to pay regular dividends to our stockholders. Any\ndetermination as to the payment of dividends, as well as the level of such dividends, will depend on, among other things, general economic and\nbusiness conditions, our level of AUM, our strategic plans, our financial results and condition, limitations associated with new credit facilities or\nother agreements that could limit the amount of dividends we are permitted to pay, and any applicable laws.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe following table provides information with respect to purchases made by or on behalf of the Company or any “affiliated purchaser” of\nshares of our common stock as part of publicly announced plans or programs.\nOn February 22, 2022, our Board of Directors approved an increase of $85.7 million to our share repurchase program and extended the term for\nthree years through April 27, 2025. There were no shares repurchased under this program during the three months ended December 31, 2023. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, approximately $96.4 million remained under this program for future purchases.\nApproximate\nTotal Number Dollar Value\nof Shares of Shares that\nPurchased May Yet Be\nas Part of Purchased\nTotal Number Publicly Under the\nof Shares Average Price Announced Plans Plans or\nPurchased Paid Per Share or Programs Programs\n(in thousands)\nPeriod\nOctober 1, 2023 to October 31, 2023 — $ — —\nNovember 1, 2023 to November 30, 2023 — $ — —\nDecember 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 — $ — —\nTotal — $ — — $ 96,406\nIn addition, on November 20, 2023, we repurchased our Series C Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the\n“Series C Preferred Stock”), which was convertible into approximately 13.1 million shares of our common stock, for aggregate cash consideration of\napproximately $84.4 million.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated\nfinancial statements and the related notes and the other financial information included elsewhere in this Report. In addition to historical consolidated\nfinancial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results\ncould differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include\nthose discussed below. For a more complete description of the risks noted above and other risks that could cause our actual results to materially\ndiffer from our current expectations, please see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Report. We assume no obligation to update or revise publicly any\nforward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law.\nIntroduction\nWe are a global financial innovator, offering a well-diversified suite of ETPs, models, solutions and products leveraging blockchain technology.\nWe empower investors and consumers to shape their future and support financial professionals to better serve their clients and grow their businesses.\nWe are leveraging the latest financial infrastructure to create products that provide access, transparency and an enhanced user experience. Building on\nour heritage of innovation, we are also developing and have launched next-generation digital products, services and structures, including Digital\nFunds and tokenized assets, as well as our blockchain-native digital wallet, WisdomTree Prime, which is currently available in the U.S. in 38 states,\nrepresenting approximately 70% of the U.S. population.\nWe had approximately $100.1 billion in AUM as of December 31, 2023. Our family of ETPs includes products that provide exposure to\nequities, fixed income, commodities, leveraged-and-inverse, currency, alternatives and cryptocurrency strategies. We have launched many first-to-\nmarket products and pioneered alternative weighting we call “Modern Alpha,” which combines the outperformance potential of active management\nwith the benefits of passive management to offer investors cost-effective funds that are built to perform. Most of our equity-based funds employ a\nfundamentally weighted investment methodology, which weights securities based on factors such as dividends, earnings or investment factors,\nwhereas most other industry indexes use a capitalization weighted methodology. These products are distributed through all major channels in the\nasset management industry, including banks, brokerage firms, registered investment advisers, institutional investors, private wealth managers and\nonline brokers primarily through our sales force. We believe technology is altering the way financial advisors conduct business and through our\nAdvisor and Portfolio Solutions programs we offer technology-enabled and research-driven solutions including portfolio construction, asset\nallocation, practice management services and digital tools to help financial advisors address technology challenges and grow and scale their\nbusinesses.\nWe are at the forefront of innovation and believe that tokenization and leveraging the utility of blockchain technology is the next evolution in\nfinancial services. We are building the foundation that we believe will allow us to lead in this coming evolution. WisdomTree Prime, our blockchain-\nnative digital wallet, positions us to expand our blockchain-enabled financial product and services offerings with a new direct-to-consumer channel\nwhere spending, saving and investing are united. As we continue to pursue our digital assets strategy, we are embracing what we refer to as\n“responsible DeFi,” which we believe upholds the foundational principles of regulation in this innovative and quickly evolving space. We believe that\nour expansion into digital assets and blockchain-enabled finance complements our existing core competencies in a holistic manner, and will diversify\nour revenue streams and contribute to our growth.\nExecutive Summary\nOur business continues to generate significant positive momentum while executing against our long-term strategic initiatives. We ended 2023\nwith record AUM of $100.1 billion. Our revenues and operating income increased 15.8% and 45.6%, respectively, during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 as compared to the prior year, which translated into 520 basis points of operating margin expansion. This past year we generated\nover $10.4 billion of net inflows, representing annual organic flow growth of approximately 13%. Our inflow profile is both broad and deep as we\nhave gathered net inflows into 6 of our 8 major product categories, including fixed income, international equity and emerging markets products,\nrepresenting organic flow growth in these categories of 39%, 28% and 21%, respectively. This diversification is driving upward our year-to-date\naverage fee capture on our flows, which was approximately two times greater than our fee capture in the prior year. AUM diversification and product\nperformance have us well-positioned for this growth trajectory to continue.\n43\nTable of Contents\nOur models strategy is another growth driver where we are succeeding, with our model portfolios available to over 70,000 advisors. We are\nfocused on adding new clients and continuing to deepen our impact on partner platforms such as Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, LPL Financial and\nothers, as well as being an outsourced solution for smaller registered investment advisers and independent broker-dealers to make model portfolios\neasier to trade through our Portfolio Solutions program. In 2023, we observed a 20% increase in the number of clients that hold multiple WisdomTree\nproducts, while at the same time we also grew our overall client base by more than 20%. We believe that continued success penetrating our accessible\nmarket and winning advisor mindshare should lead to model flows that are recurring in nature and stackable on top of our current inflow profile.\nWhile we remain focused on providing investors with the best product structure to access various asset classes through ETFs, we believe that\nby leveraging blockchain technology, tokenized assets are the best product structure of tomorrow and the future of financial services. We are an early\nmover in this space, with the launch of our blockchain-native wallet, WisdomTree Prime, a new direct-to-consumer channel where spending, saving\nand investing are united. WisdomTree Prime provides access to bitcoin, ether, tokenized gold and U.S. dollar tokens, as well as 13 Digital Funds,\nincluding a government money market fund and other digital funds offering asset allocation, fixed income and equity exposures. In addition, we have\npartnered with a financial institution to provide co-branded debit cards to our retail customers on the WisdomTree Prime platform. We continue to\nfocus on enhancing the products and capabilities of the platform with plans to allow for peer-to-peer transfers and payments in the upcoming\nquarters. We are also exploring strategic partnerships and other business development opportunities for both our platform and product suite that could\nunlock additional tokenization revenue streams in the future.\nWe are executing on our long-term growth strategy and expect ongoing flows and AUM growth to translate into further margin expansion and\noutperformance going forward, with our recent investments in digital assets creating additional value for our stockholders over time.\nAdditional business highlights include the following:\n• Strong product performance with over 80% of our U.S. listed AUM covered by Morningstar in the top two quartiles of peer performance\non the 3-year and 10-year timeframes. In addition, approximately 50% of our U.S. listed AUM is rated 4- or 5-star by Morningstar (less\nthan 5% in 1-and 2-star funds).\n• We launched nine new European listed ETPs, three new U.S. listed ETPs (including the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund which was among the\nfirst to launch in the U.S.) and 12 new Digital Funds. The WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund launched in the U.S. on the Cboe BZX Exchange in\nJanuary 2024.\n• We reduced our convertible senior notes outstanding by $45.0 million, by issuing $130.0 million of convertible senior notes due 2028 and\nretiring $175.0 million of convertible senior notes due 2023. We also returned approximately $24.1 million to our stockholders through\nour ongoing quarterly cash dividend and common stock repurchases.\n• In May 2023, we closed a transaction resulting in the termination of our contractual gold payments obligation to ETFS Capital for\n$50.0 million in cash and Series C Preferred Stock convertible into approximately 13.1 million shares of our common stock. The value of\nthese shares was $86.9 million based on the closing price of our common stock on May 9, 2023 of $6.64 per share. The Series C\nPreferred Stock was issued to Gold Bullion Holdings (Jersey) Limited, or GBH, a subsidiary of the World Gold Council, which was the\nentity that ultimately received a portion of the contractual gold payments the Company was previously obligated to make to ETFS\nCapital. The transaction expanded our operating margin by over 500 basis points, was accretive to earnings per share and reduced\nvolatility in our financial results.\n• In November 2023, we repurchased our Series C Preferred Stock, which was convertible into approximately 13.1 million shares of our\ncommon stock from GBH for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $84.4 million. Under the terms of the transaction, we paid\nGBH $40.0 million on the closing date, with the remainder of the purchase price payable in equal, interest-free installments on the first,\nsecond and third anniversaries of the closing date. The implied price per share was $6.02 when considering the interest-free financing\nelement of the transaction, and the repurchase was also accretive to earnings per share.\n44\nTable of Contents\n• In the U.S., we were named a “2023 Best Places to Work in Money Management” by Pensions & Investments for the fourth consecutive\nyear and seventh year since the award was created. We ranked second within the category for managers with 100-499 employees, the\nsecond consecutive year earning a ranking among the top five employers. In the U.K., we were also named Best Workplace for medium-\nsized companies for a fourth consecutive year and a 2023 Best Workplace for Women for medium-sized companies by Great Place to\nWork.\n• We won “Best Leveraged & Inverse ETF Issuer ($100M+)” and “Best Crypto Issuer Linked ETF Issuer ($100M+)” at the 2023 ETF\nExpress Europe Awards and our European business won “Best ETF Issuer” at the Online Money Awards, marking the second consecutive\nyear of winning the award. The WisdomTree Siegel Strategic Value Index™, an index developed by Professor Jeremy Siegel, Senior\nEconomist to WisdomTree, also won the FIA Index of the Year Award by Structured Retail Products.\nMarket Environment\nThe following chart reflects the annual returns of the broad-based equity indexes and gold prices over the last three years.\nSource: FactSet\n45\nTable of Contents\nU.S. Listed ETF Industry Flows\nU.S. listed ETF net flows for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $489.1 billion.

These trends have\naccelerated, as fee compression, cost pressures and increased regulations have weighed on the industry, highlighting the importance of scale and\noperating efficiency to compete in today’s market. We have significant opportunities ahead in both ETPs and the Portfolio Solutions business and as\nan early mover in digital assets and blockchain-enabled financial services, which positions us well for success to grow in this competitive landscape.\nComponents of Operating Revenue\nAdvisory fees\nSubstantially all of our revenues are comprised of advisory fees we earn from our ETPs. These advisory fees are calculated based on a\npercentage of the ETPs’ average daily net assets. As of the date of this Report, our weighted average fee rates by product category are as follows:\nCommodity & Currency: 37bps Leveraged & Inverse: 84bps\nInternational Developed Market Equity: 49bps Fixed Income: 16bps\nU.S. Equity: 31bps Alternatives: 58bps\nEmerging Market Equity: 59bps Cryptocurrency: 36bps\nWe determine the appropriate advisory fee to charge for our ETPs based on the cost of operating each ETP considering the types of securities\nthe ETPs will hold, fees third-party service providers will charge us for operating the ETPs and our competitors’ fees for similar ETPs. From time to\ntime, we implement voluntary waivers of a portion of our advisory fee. In addition, we earn a fee based on daily aggregate AUM of our ETPs in\nexchange for bearing certain fund expenses.\nOur advisory fee revenues may fluctuate based on general stock market trends, which include market value appreciation or depreciation,\ncurrency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar, increased competition and level of inflows or outflows from our ETPs.\nOther income\nOther income includes rebates from swap providers to our European listed ETPs, creation/redemption fees earned on our European non-UCITS\nproducts and fees from licensing our indexes to third parties.\nComponents of Operating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist primarily of costs related to selling, operating and marketing our ETPs as well as the infrastructure needed to\nrun our business.\nCompensation and benefits\nEmployee compensation and benefits expenses are expensed when incurred and include salaries, incentive compensation, and related benefit\ncosts. To attract and retain qualified personnel, we must maintain competitive employee compensation and benefit plans and amounts we pay may be\naffected by inflation. Virtually all of our employees receive incentive compensation which is variable and will fluctuate taking into consideration our\noperating and financial results, as well as discretion.\nAlso included in compensation and benefits are costs related to equity awards granted to our employees. Our executive management and Board\nof Directors strongly believe that equity awards are an important part of our employees’ overall compensation package and that incentivizing our\nemployees with equity in the Company aligns the interests of our employees with that of our stockholders. We use the fair value method in recording\ncompensation expense for equity-based awards. Under the fair value method, compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the\nestimated fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period.\n47\nTable of Contents\nFund management and administration\nFund management and administration expenses are expensed when incurred and are comprised of the following costs we pay third-party\nservice providers to operate our ETPs and Digital Funds:\n• portfolio management of our ETPs (sub-advisory);\n• fund accounting and administration;\n• custodial and storage services;\n• market making;\n• transfer agency;\n• accounting and tax services;\n• printing and mailing of shareholder materials;\n• index calculation;\n• indicative values;\n• distribution fees;\n• legal and compliance services;\n• exchange listing fees;\n• trustee fees and expenses;\n• preparation of regulatory reports and filings;\n• insurance;\n• certain local income taxes; and\n• other administrative services.\nWe are not responsible for extraordinary expenses, taxes and certain other expenses related to the funds.\nWe depend on a number of parties to provide critical portfolio management services to our ETPs. The fees we pay our sub-advisers generally\nare the higher of the fixed minimums per fund, which range from $25,000 to $180,000 per year, or the percentage fee, which ranges between 0.01%\nand 0.50% per annum of average daily AUM at various breakpoint levels depending on the nature of the ETP. In addition, we pay certain costs based\non transactions in our ETPs or based on inflow levels.\nThe fees we pay for accounting, tax, transfer agency, index calculation, indicative values and exchange listing are based on the number of ETPs\nwe have. The remaining fees are based on a combination of both AUM and number of funds, or as incurred.\nMarketing and advertising\nMarketing and advertising expenses are recorded when incurred and include the following:\n• advertising and product promotion campaigns that are initiated to promote our existing and new ETPs as well as brand awareness;\n• development and maintenance of our website; and\n• creation and preparation of marketing materials.\nOur discretionary advertising comprises the largest portion of this expense. In addition, we may incur expenditures in certain periods to attract\ninflows, the benefit of which may or may not be recognized from increases to our AUM in future periods. However, due to the discretionary nature of\nsome of these costs, they can generally be reduced if there were a decline in the markets.\nSales and business development\nSales and business development expenses are recorded when incurred and include the following:\n• travel and entertainment or conference related expenses for our sales force;\n• market data services for our research team;\n• sales related software tools;\n• voluntary payment of certain costs associated with the creation or redemption of ETP shares, as we may elect from time to time; and\n• legal and other advisory fees associated with the development of new funds or business initiatives.\n48\nTable of Contents\nContractual gold payments\nContractual gold payments expense represented an obligation requiring us to pay 9,500 ounces of gold annually from the advisory fee income\nwe earned for managing physically backed gold ETPs. Our obligation to continue making these payments was terminated on May 10, 2023. See\nNote 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nProfessional fees\nProfessional fees are expensed when incurred and consist of fees we pay to corporate advisers including accountants, tax advisers, legal\ncounsel, investment bankers, human resources or other consultants. Professional fees also include expenses we pay third-party service providers\nrelated to WisdomTree Prime and expenses incurred in response to an activist campaign. These expenses fluctuate based on our needs or\nrequirements at the time. Certain of these costs are at our discretion and can fluctuate year to year.\nOccupancy, communications and equipment\nOccupancy, communications and equipment expense includes costs for our corporate headquarters in New York City as well as office related\ncosts in our other locations.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense results from amortization of internally-developed software as well as depreciation on fixed assets,\nwhich are depreciated/amortized over three to five years.\nThird-party distribution fees\nThird-party distribution fees, which are expensed as incurred, include payments made to enable our products and models to be included on\ncertain third-party platforms in exchange for commission-free trading or other preferential access.

This obligation was terminated on May 10, 2023 for\napproximately $137.0 million. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nInterest income\nInterest income, which is recognized on an accrual basis, arises from investing our corporate cash into interest-bearing financial instruments.\n49\nTable of Contents\nOther losses, net\nIncluded herein are gains and losses arising from our financial instruments owned and investments, the sale of gold earned from advisory fees\npaid by physically-backed gold ETPs, foreign exchange and other miscellaneous items. Also included are losses arising from the release of tax-\nrelated indemnification assets upon the expiration of the statute of limitations, for which an equal and offsetting benefit is recognized in income tax\nexpense.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense consists of taxes due to federal, various state and local and certain foreign authorities.\nExpense Guidance for the Year Ending December 31, 2024\nCompensation Expense\nOur compensation expense for the year ending December 31, 2024 is currently estimated to range from $108.0 million to $118.0 million and\ntakes into consideration planned hires as well as year-end compensation adjustments and the annualization of hires made during 2023. The range also\nconsiders variability in incentive compensation with drivers including the magnitude of our flows, revenue and operating income growth, margin\nexpansion and our share price performance in relation to our peers. A wide range is provided in consideration of uncertain market conditions.\nDiscretionary Spending\nDiscretionary spending includes marketing, sales, professional fees, occupancy and equipment, depreciation and amortization and other\nexpenses. We currently estimate our discretionary spending for the year ending December 31, 2024 to range from $64.0 million to $68.0 million.\nNot included in the guidance above are any potential non-recurring expenses we may incur in response to a potential proxy contest. Such\nexpenses could be material to our results of operations for the year ending December 31, 2024.\nGross Margin\nWe define gross margin as total operating revenues less fund management and administration expenses. Gross margin percentage is calculated\nas gross margin divided by total operating revenues. For the year ending December 31, 2024, we currently estimate that our gross margin percentage\nwill be 79.0% to 80.0% at current AUM and revenue levels. If AUM drives higher from continued organic flow growth or favorable market\nconditions, we would anticipate further gross margin expansion.\nThird-Party Distribution Expense\nWe currently estimate third-party distribution expense to be approximately $10.0 million to $11.0 million for the year ending December 31,\n2024, which is dependent upon the AUM growth on our respective platforms.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe currently estimate that our consolidated normalized effective tax rate will be approximately 24.0% to 25.0% for the year ending\nDecember 31, 2024, a slight increase as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 to account for the full year impact of the U.K. tax rate\nchange to 25.0% that went into effect on April 1, 2023.\nThis estimated rate may change and is dependent upon our actual taxable income earned in relation to our forecasts as well as any other items\nwhich may arise that are not currently forecasted. Such items may include, but are not limited to, reductions in unrecognized tax benefits, increases or\ndecreases in valuation allowances and any stock-based compensation windfalls or shortfalls. Additional corporate tax legislation could also impact\nour normalized effective tax rate.\n50\nTable of Contents\nFactors that May Impact our Future Financial Results\nOur AUM is well diversified across the commodity, U.S. equity, international developed markets and emerging markets sectors. As a result, our\noperating results are particularly exposed to investor sentiment toward investing in these products’ strategies and our ability to maintain AUM of\nthese products, as well as the performance of these products.\nOur revenues are also highly correlated to the level and relative mix of our AUM, as well as the fee rate associated with our ETPs. Changes in\nproduct mix have led to a decline in our average advisory fee, which for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 were 0.41%, 0.38% and\n0.36%, respectively.\nThe chart below sets forth the asset mix of our ETPs at December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023:\n51\nTable of Contents\nKey Operating Statistics\nThe following table presents key operating statistics that serve as indicators for the performance of our business:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nGLOBAL ETPs (in millions)\nBeginning of period assets $ 81,993 $ 77,479 $ 67,392\nInflows 10,396 12,182 4,660\nMarket appreciation/(depreciation) 7,735 (7,668) 5,427\nEnd of period assets $ 100,124 $ 81,993 $ 77,479\nAverage assets during the period $ 92,847 $ 76,969 $ 73,430\nAverage advisory fee during the period 0.36% 0.38% 0.41%\nNumber of ETPs—end of the period 337 339 329\nUS LISTED ETFs (in millions)\nBeginning of period assets $ 55,973 $ 48,210 $ 38,517\nInflows 10,795 14,572 4,950\nMarket appreciation/(depreciation) 5,718 (6,809) 4,743\nEnd of period assets $ 72,486 $ 55,973 $ 48,210\nAverage assets during the period $ 64,967 $ 49,723 $ 44,325\nNumber of ETPs—end of the period 76 79 75\nEUROPEAN LISTED ETPs (in millions)\nBeginning of period assets $ 26,020 $ 29,269 $ 28,875\nOutflows (399) (2,390) (290)\nMarket appreciation/(depreciation) 2,017 (859) 684\nEnd of period assets $ 27,638 $ 26,020 $ 29,269\nAverage assets during the period $ 27,880 $ 27,246 $ 29,105\nNumber of ETPs—end of the period 261 260 254\nPRODUCT CATEGORIES (in millions)\nU.S. Equity\nBeginning of period assets $ 24,112 $ 23,860 $ 18,367\nInflows 1,616 3,346 1,544\nMarket appreciation/(depreciation) 3,428 (3,094) 3,949\nEnd of period assets $ 29,156 $ 24,112 $ 23,860\nAverage assets during the period $ 25,701 $ 22,881 $ 21,254\nCommodity & Currency\nBeginning of period assets $ 22,097 $ 24,599 $ 25,879\nOutflows (1,774) (2,912) (1,479)\nMarket appreciation 1,013 410 199\nEnd of period assets $ 21,336 $ 22,097 $ 24,599\nAverage assets during the period $ 22,843 $ 23,406 $ 25,027\nFixed Income\nBeginning of period assets $ 15,273 $ 4,356 $ 3,324\nInflows 5,940 11,300 1,130\nMarket depreciation (16) (383) (98)\nEnd of period assets $ 21,197 $ 15,273 $ 4,356\nAverage assets during the period $ 19,804 $ 9,039 $ 3,565\n52\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nInternational Developed Market Equity\nBeginning of period assets $ 10,195 $ 11,894 $ 9,414\nInflows 2,850 101 1,260\nMarket appreciation/(depreciation) 2,058 (1,800) 1,220\nEnd of period assets $ 15,103 $ 10,195 $ 11,894\nAverage assets during the period $ 12,824 $ 10,568 $ 10,750\nEmerging Market Equity\nBeginning of period assets $ 8,116 $ 10,375 $ 8,539\nInflows 1,678 27 2,041\nMarket appreciation/(depreciation) 932 (2,286) (205)\nEnd of period assets $ 10,726 $ 8,116 $ 10,375\nAverage assets during the period $ 9,287 $ 8,843 $ 10,619\nLeveraged & Inverse\nBeginning of period assets $ 1,754 $ 1,777 $ 1,486\n(Outflows)/inflows (5) 193 41\nMarket appreciation/(depreciation) 66 (216) 250\nEnd of period assets $ 1,815 $ 1,754 $ 1,777\nAverage assets during the period $ 1,813 $ 1,704 $ 1,679\nCryptocurrency\nBeginning of period assets $ 136 $ 357 $ 168\nInflows 50 36 84\nMarket appreciation/(depreciation) 228 (257) 105\nEnd of period assets $ 414 $ 136 $ 357\nAverage assets during the period $ 247 $ 230 $ 312\nAlternatives\nBeginning of period assets $ 310 $ 261 $ 215\nInflows 41 91 39\nMarket appreciation/(depreciation) 26 (42) 7\nEnd of period assets $ 377 $ 310 $ 261\nAverage assets during the period $ 328 $ 298 $ 224\nHeadcount 303 273 241\nNote: Previously issued statistics may be restated due to fund closures and trade adjustments\nSource: WisdomTree\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022\nSelected Operating and Financial Information\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nPercent\n2023 2022 Change Change\nAUM (in millions)\nAverage AUM $ 92,847 $ 76,969 $ 15,878 20.6%\nOperating Revenues (in thousands)\nAdvisory fees $ 333,227 $ 293,632 $ 39,595 13.5%\nOther income 15,808 7,713 8,095 105.0%\nTotal revenues $ 349,035 $ 301,345 $ 47,690 15.8%\n53\nTable of Contents\nOperating Revenues\nAdvisory fees\nAdvisory fee revenues increased 13.5% from $293.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 to $333.2 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 as higher average AUM was partially offset by a decline in our average advisory fee.

The effective tax rate differs from the\nfederal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to a non-taxable gain on revaluation/termination of deferred consideration, a reduction in unrecognized\ntax benefits associated with the release of the tax-related indemnification asset described above and a lower tax rate on foreign earnings. These items\nwere partly offset by a non-deductible loss on extinguishment of our 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 during the first quarter of 2023, an\nincrease in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance on losses recognized on our investments and non-deductible executive compensation.\nOur effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was negative 26.9%, resulting in an income tax benefit of $10.7 million.\nOur tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to a $19.9 million reduction in unrecognized tax benefits associated with the\nrelease of the tax-related indemnification asset described above, a reduction in the valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses, a non-taxable\ngain on revaluation of deferred consideration and a lower tax rate on foreign earnings.

Our effective interest rate was 4.6% during the years ended December 31, 2021\nand 2022.\nGain on revaluation/termination of deferred consideration\nWe recognized a gain on revaluation/termination of deferred consideration—gold payments of $2.0 million and $27.8 million during the years\nended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The gain was primarily due to an increase in the discount rate (from 9.0% to 11.0%) used to\ncompute the present value of the annual payment obligations as well as a steepening of the forward-looking gold curve. The magnitude of any gain or\nloss is highly correlated to changes in the discount rate and the magnitude of the change in the forward-looking price of gold.\nInterest income\nInterest income increased 65.3% from $2.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 to $3.3 million in the comparable period in 2022\ndue to an increase in our interest-bearing assets.\nImpairments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized impairment charges totaling $16.2 million, including a loss of $9.3 million upon the\ntermination of the lease of our former principal executive office at 245 Park Avenue, New York, New York, $6.6 million related to the write-off of\nleasehold improvements and fixed assets associated with our former New York office and $0.3 million upon exiting our London office (See Notes 7,\n8, 13 and 26 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).\nOther losses, net\nOther losses, net were ($7.9) million and ($36.3) million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. This includes a\ncharge of $5.2 million and $19.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, arising from the release of a tax-related\nindemnification asset upon the expiration of the statute of limitations. An equal and offsetting benefit has been recognized in income tax expense.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, we also recognized losses on our financial instruments owned of $3.7 million and $16.5 million,\nrespectively. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a gain of $0.8 million related to the remeasurement of contingent\nconsideration payable to us from the sale of our former Canadian ETF business.\nGains and losses also generally arise from the sale of gold earned from advisory fees paid by our physically-backed gold ETPs, foreign\nexchange fluctuations and other miscellaneous items.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was negative 26.9%, resulting in an income tax benefit of $10.7 million.\nOur tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to a $19.9 million reduction in unrecognized tax benefits associated with the\nrelease of the tax-related indemnification asset described above, a reduction in the valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses, a non-taxable\ngain on revaluation of deferred consideration and a lower tax rate on foreign earnings.

Our effective\nincome tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to a $5.2 million reduction in unrecognized tax benefits and a lower tax\nrate on foreign earnings. These items were partly offset by tax shortfalls associated with the vesting and exercise of stock-based compensation and\nnon-deductible executive compensation.\n60\nTable of Contents\nQuarterly Results\nThe following tables set forth our unaudited consolidated quarterly statement of operations data, both in dollar amounts and as a percentage of\ntotal revenues, and our unaudited consolidated quarterly operating data for the quarters in 2023 and 2022.

information\nwhich we believe provides useful and meaningful information. Our management reviews these non-GAAP financial measurements when evaluating\nour financial performance and results of operations; therefore, we believe it is useful to provide information with respect to these non-GAAP\nmeasurements so as to share this perspective of management. Non-GAAP measurements do not have any standardized meaning, do not replace nor\nare superior to GAAP financial measurements and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These non-\nGAAP financial measurements should be considered in the context with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measurements contained in this\nReport include:\nAdjusted net income and diluted earnings per share.\nWe disclose adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share as non-GAAP financial measurements in order to report our results exclusive of\nitems that are non-recurring or not core to our operating business. We believe presenting these non-GAAP financial measurements provides investors\nwith a consistent way to analyze our performance. These non-GAAP financial measurements exclude the following:\n• Unrealized gains or losses on revaluation/termination of deferred consideration—gold payments: Deferred consideration—gold\npayments was an obligation we assumed in connection with the ETFS Acquisition that was carried at fair value. This item represented the\npresent value of an obligation to pay fixed ounces of gold into perpetuity and is measured using forward-looking gold prices. Changes in\nthe forward-looking price of gold and changes in the discount rate used to compute the present value of the annual payment obligations\nhave had a material impact on the carrying value of the deferred consideration and our reported financial results. We exclude this item\nwhen calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as it was not core to our operating business. The item was not adjusted for\nincome taxes as the obligation was assumed by a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours that is based in Jersey, a jurisdiction where we are\nsubject to a zero percent tax rate. During the second quarter of 2023, we terminated this obligation for aggregate consideration totaling\napproximately $137.0 million.\n65\nTable of Contents\n• Gains or losses on financial instruments owned: We account for our financial instruments owned as trading securities, which requires\nthese instruments to be measured at fair value with gains and losses reported in net income. We exclude these items when calculating our\nnon-GAAP financial measurements as the gains and losses introduce volatility in earnings and are not core to our operating business.\n• Tax windfalls and shortfalls upon vesting and exercise of stock-based compensation awards: GAAP requires the recognition of tax\nwindfalls and shortfalls within income tax expense. These items arise upon the vesting and exercise of stock-based compensation awards\nand the magnitude is directly correlated to the number of awards vesting/exercised as well as the difference between the price of our\nstock on the date the award was granted and the date the award vested or was exercised. We exclude these items when calculating our\nnon-GAAP financial measurements as they introduce volatility in earnings and are not core to our operating business.\n• Imputed interest on our payable to GBH: During the fourth quarter of 2023, we repurchased our Series C Preferred Stock, which was\nconvertible into approximately 13.1 million shares of our common stock, from GBH for aggregate cash consideration of approximately\n$84.4 million. Under the terms of the transaction, we paid GBH $40.0 million on the closing date, with the remainder of the purchase\nprice payable in equal, interest-free installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date. Under U.S. GAAP, the\nobligation is recorded at its present value utilizing a market rate of interest on the closing date of 7.0% and the corresponding discount is\namortized as interest expense pursuant to the effective interest method of accounting over the life of the obligation. We exclude this item\nwhen calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as recognition of interest expense is non-cash and contrary to the stated terms of\nour obligation.\n• Other items: Unrealized gains and losses recognized on our investments, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances, expenses\nincurred in response to an activist campaign, impairment charges, a loss on extinguishment of debt and a gain recognized upon the sale of\nour Canadian ETF business (including the remeasurement of contingent consideration) are excluded when calculating our non-GAAP\nfinancial measurements.\n66\nTable of Contents\nYears Ended December 31,\nAdjusted Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share: 2023 2022 2021\nNet income, as reported $ 102,546 $ 50,684 $ 49,797\nDeduct: Gain on revaluation/termination of deferred consideration (61,953) (27,765) (2,018)\nAdd back: Loss on extinguishment of convertible notes, net of income\ntaxes 9,623 — —\nAdd back: Impairments, net of income taxes 6,013 — 12,247\nAdd back: Expenses incurred in response to an activist campaign, net of\nincome taxes 4,452 3,376 —\nAdd back: Increase in deferred tax valuation allowance on financial\ninstruments owned and investments 2,113 4,729 —\nDeduct: Gain recognized from the sale of Canadian ETF business,\nincluding remeasurement of contingent consideration (1,477) — (787)\nAdd back/(deduct): Unrealized loss/(gain) recognized on our\ninvestments, net of income taxes 607 290 (284)\nAdd back: Losses on financial instruments owned, at fair value, net of\nincome taxes 392 12,505 2,507\nAdd back: Litigation expenses associated with certain provisions of the\nStockholder Rights Agreement, net of income taxes 367 — —\nAdd back: Imputed interest on payable to GBH, net of income taxes 224 — —\nDeduct: Tax windfalls upon vesting and exercise of stock-based\ncompensation awards (176) (541) (110)\nDeduct: Decrease in deferred tax valuation allowance on net operating\nlosses of a European subsidiary — (1,609) —\nAdjusted net income $ 62,731 $ 41,669 $ 61,352\nDeduct: Income distributed to participating securities (2,770) (2,186) (2,168)\nDeduct: Undistributed income allocable to participating securities (5,868) (2,509) (4,630)\nAdjusted net income available to common stockholders $ 54,093 $ 36,974 $ 54,554\nWeighted average diluted shares, excluding participating securities (See\nNote 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements) 147,827 143,295 145,055\nAdjusted earnings per share—diluted $ 0.37 $ 0.26 $ 0.38\nAdjusted net income as reported on a non-GAAP basis during the year ended December 31, 2023 also excludes a gain of $8.0 million\nrecognized upon the repurchase of our Series C Preferred Stock, which was convertible into approximately 13.1 million shares of our common stock.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, this amount is excluded from net income, but is required to be added to net income to arrive at income available to common\nstockholders in the calculation of earnings per share.\n67\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes key data regarding our liquidity, capital resources and use of capital to fund our operations:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nBalance Sheet Data (in thousands):\nCash and cash equivalents $ 129,305 $ 132,101\nFinancial instruments owned, at fair value 58,722 126,239\nAccounts receivable 35,473 30,549\nSecurities held-to-maturity 230 259\nTotal: Liquid assets 223,730 289,148\nLess: Total current liabilities (103,216) (148,434)\nLess: Other assets—seed capital (WisdomTree Digital Funds) (18,308) (1,765)\nLess: Regulatory capital requirements (29,156) (25,988)\nTotal: Available liquidity $ 73,050 $ 112,961\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nCash Flow Data (in thousands):\nOperating cash flows $ 85,600 $ 55,087 $ 75,318\nInvesting cash flows 82,049 (37,657) (99,632)\nFinancing cash flows (171,636) (22,780) 92,553\nForeign exchange rate effect 1,191 (3,258) (955)\n(Decrease)/increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (2,796) $ (8,608) $ 67,284\nLiquidity\nWe consider our available liquidity to be our liquid assets, less our current liabilities and regulatory capital requirements of certain European\nsubsidiaries. Liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, financial instruments owned, at fair value, accounts receivable and securities held-to-\nmaturity. Our financial instruments owned, at fair value are highly liquid investments. Accounts receivable are current assets and primarily represent\nreceivables from advisory fees we earn from our ETPs. Our current liabilities consist primarily of payments owed to vendors and third parties in the\nnormal course of business, deferred consideration and accrued incentive compensation for employees.\nCash and cash equivalents decreased $2.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 due to $184.3 million used to repurchase and settle\nour 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023, $57.4 million used to purchase financial instruments owned, at fair value, $50.0 million used to\nterminate our deferred consideration—gold payments obligation, $40.0 million used to repurchase our Series C Preferred Stock, $20.1 million used to\npay dividends on our common stock, $11.2 million used to purchase investments, $3.6 million used to repurchase our common stock, $3.5 million\nused to pay issuance costs in respect of our 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028, or the 2023 Notes, $2.1 million used for software\ndevelopment and $1.2 million used in other activities. These decreases were partly offset by $130.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of the 2023\nNotes, $123.6 million of proceeds from the sale of financial instruments owned, at fair value, $85.6 million of net cash provided by operating\nactivities, $28.8 million of proceeds from the exit from our investment in Securrency, Inc. in connection with the sale of Securrency, Inc. to an\nunaffiliated third party, $1.5 million from receipt of contingent consideration related to the sale of our Canadian ETF business, and $1.1 million from\nother activities.\nCash and cash equivalents decreased $8.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 due to $55.1 million of net cash provided by\noperating activities and $52.1 million of proceeds from the sale of financial instruments owned, at fair value. These increases were partly offset by\n$67.7 million used to purchase financial instruments owned, at fair value, $21.9 million used to purchase investments, $19.4 million used to pay\ndividends, $3.4 million used to repurchase our common stock and $3.4 million from other activities.\n68\nTable of Contents\nCash and cash equivalents increased $67.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 due to $150.0 million of proceeds from the\nissuance of our 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026, or the 2021 Notes, $75.3 million of net cash provided by operating activities,\n$19.4 million of proceeds from the sale of financial instruments owned, at fair value and $2.4 million of proceeds from the receipt of contingent\nconsideration from the sale of our Canadian ETF business.

As a result\nof this repurchase, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of approximately $9.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The remainder\nof the 2020 Notes matured on June 15, 2023 and were settled for approximately $59.9 million of cash and approximately 1.0 million shares of our\ncommon stock.\nAfter the repurchase and maturity of the 2020 Notes and the issuance of the 2023 Notes (such 2023 Notes, together with the 2021 Notes, the\n“Convertible Notes”), we had $280.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes outstanding.\nKey terms of the Convertible Notes are as follows:\n2023 Notes 2021 Notes\nPrincipal outstanding $ 130.0 $ 150.0\nMaturity date (unless earlier converted, repurchased or redeemed) August 15, 2028 June 15, 2026\nInterest rate 5.75% 3.25%\nConversion price $ 9.54 $ 11.04\nConversion rate 104.8658 90.5797\nRedemption price $ 12.40 $ 14.35\n• Interest rate: Payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year for the 2023 Notes (beginning on August 15,\n2023) and on June 15 and December 15 of each year for the 2021 Notes.\n• Conversion price: Convertible at an initial conversion rate set forth in the table above into shares of our common stock, per $1,000\nprincipal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price set forth in the table above), subject to adjustment.\n69\nTable of Contents\n• Conversion: Holders may convert at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding\nMay 15, 2028 and March 15, 2026 for the 2023 Notes and the 2021 Notes, respectively, only under the following circumstances: (i) if the\nlast reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the\nlast trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the respective\nConvertible Notes on each applicable trading day; (ii) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period\n(the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes for each trading day of the\nmeasurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sales price of our common stock and the conversion rate on\neach such trading day; (iii) upon a notice of redemption delivered by us in accordance with the terms of the indentures but only with\nrespect to the Convertible Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption; or (iv) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On\nor after May 15, 2028 and March 15, 2026 in respect of the 2023 Notes, and the 2021 Notes, respectively, until the close of business on\nthe second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their Convertible Notes at any time,\nregardless of the foregoing circumstances.\n• Cash settlement of principal amount: Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes\nto be converted. At our election, we will also settle our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the\nConvertible Notes being converted in either cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock.\n• Redemption price: We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Convertible Notes, at our option, on or after August 20, 2025 and\nJune 20, 2023 in respect of the 2023 Notes and the 2021 Notes, respectively, and on or prior to the 55th scheduled trading day\nimmediately preceding the maturity date, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion\nprice for the respective Convertible Notes then in effect for at least 20 trading days, including the trading day immediately preceding the\ndate on which we provide notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day\nimmediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount\nof the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the\nConvertible Notes.\n• Limited investor put rights: Holders of the Convertible Notes have the right to require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their\nnotes at 100% of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of certain change of control\ntransactions or liquidation, dissolution or common stock delisting events.\n• Conversion rate increase in certain customary circumstances: In certain circumstances, conversions in connection with a “make-whole\nfundamental change” (as defined in the indentures) or conversions of Convertible Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption may\nresult in an increase to the conversion rate, provided that the conversion rate will not exceed 167.7853 shares and 144.9275 shares of our\ncommon stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2023 Notes and the 2021 Notes, respectively (the equivalent of 43,551,214 shares of\nour common stock), subject to adjustment.\n• Seniority and Security: The 2023 Notes and 2021 Notes rank equal in right of payment, and are our senior unsecured obligations, but are\nsubordinated in right of payment to our obligations to make certain redemption payments (if and when due) in respect of our Series A\nPreferred Stock (See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).\nThe indentures contain customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the trustee\nor the respective holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the respective series of Convertible Notes outstanding may declare the\nentire principal amount of all such respective Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued special interest, if any, to be immediately due\nand payable.\nCapital Resources\nOur principal source of financing is our operating cash flow. We believe that current cash flows generated by our operating activities and\nexisting cash balances should be sufficient for us to fund our operations for the foreseeable future.\n70\nTable of Contents\nOur ability to satisfy our contractual obligations as they arise are discussed in the section titled “Contractual Obligations” below.\nUse of Capital\nOur business does not require us to maintain a significant cash position. However, certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain a\nminimum level of regulatory capital, which at December 31, 2023 was approximately $29.2 million in the aggregate. Notwithstanding these\nregulatory capital requirements, we expect that our main uses of cash will be to fund the ongoing operations of our business. We also maintain a\ncapital return program which includes a $0.03 per share quarterly cash dividend and authority to purchase our common stock through April 27, 2025,\nincluding purchases to offset future equity grants made under our equity plans.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased 635,653 shares of our common stock under the repurchase program for an\naggregate cost of $3.6 million. Currently, approximately $96.4 million remains under this program for future purchases. We also repurchased our\nSeries C Preferred Stock, which was convertible into approximately 13.1 million shares of common stock, from GBH for aggregate cash\nconsideration of approximately $84.4 million. Under the terms of the transaction, we paid GBH $40.0 million on the closing date, with the remainder\nof the purchase price payable in equal, interest-free installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date.\nContractual Obligations\nConvertible Notes\nWe currently have $280.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes outstanding, of which $150.0 million and $130.0 million\nare scheduled to mature on June 15, 2026 and August 15, 2028, respectively, unless earlier converted, repurchased or redeemed. Conditional\nconversions or a requirement to repurchase the Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change may accelerate payment.\nThe Convertible Notes require cash settlement of the principal amount, while settlement of the conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate\nprincipal amount may be satisfied in either cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock. We currently\nanticipate refinancing these obligations when due.\nSee the section titled “Issuance of Convertible Notes” above for additional information.\nDeferred Consideration–Gold Payments\nOn May 10, 2023, we entered into and closed on a Sale, Purchase and Assignment Deed to terminate our obligations relating to the contractual\ngold payments. Pursuant to that agreement, we paid consideration totaling $136.9 million, including an aggregate of $50.0 million in cash and the\nissuance of 13,087 shares of Series C Preferred Stock (valued at $86.9 million, based on the closing price of our common stock on May 9, 2023 of\n$6.64 per share), which was convertible into 13,087,000 shares of our common stock. The Series C Preferred Stock was subsequently repurchased on\nNovember 20, 2023 as described in “Payable to GBH” below. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nPayable to GBH\nOn November 20, 2023, we repurchased our Series C Preferred Stock from GBH for aggregate cash consideration of approximately\n$84.4 million. Under the terms of the transaction, we paid GBH $40.0 million on the closing date, with the remainder of the purchase price payable in\nequal, interest-free installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date. The implied price per share was $6.02 when\nconsidering the interest-free financing element of the transaction.\nOperating Leases\nTotal future minimum lease payments with respect to our operating lease liabilities were $0.6 million at December 31, 2023. Cash flows\ngenerated by our operating activities and existing cash balances should be sufficient to satisfy the future minimum lease payments. See Note 13 to our\nConsolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n71\nTable of Contents\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet financing or other arrangements and have neither created nor are party to any special-purpose or off-\nbalance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating our business.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the identifiable net assets at the acquisition date. We test goodwill for\nimpairment at least annually and at the time of a triggering event requiring re-evaluation, if one were to occur. Goodwill is considered impaired when\nthe estimated fair value of the reporting unit that was allocated the goodwill is less than its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of such reporting\nunit is less than its carrying value, goodwill impairment is recognized based on that difference, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. A\nreporting unit is an operating segment or a component of an operating segment provided that the component constitutes a business for which discrete\nfinancial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that component.\nGoodwill is allocated to our U.S. business and European business components. For impairment testing purposes, these components are\naggregated as a single reporting unit as they fall under the same operating segment and have similar economic characteristics.\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually on November 30th. When performing our goodwill impairment test, we consider a qualitative\nassessment, when appropriate, and the market approach and its market capitalization when determining the fair value of the reporting unit. The results\nof our analysis indicated no impairment based upon a quantitative assessment.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired if their estimated\nfair value is less than their carrying value. We may rely on a qualitative assessment when performing our intangible asset impairment test. Otherwise,\nthe impairment evaluation is performed at the lowest level of reasonably identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. The annual impairment\ntesting date for our intangible assets is November 30th. The results of our analysis identified no indicators of impairment to be recognized based upon\na quantitative assessment (discounted cash flow analysis) which relied upon significant unobservable inputs including projected revenue growth rates\nof 3.0% and a weighted average cost of capital of 10.5%.\nInvestments\nWe account for equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value under the measurement alternative prescribed within\nASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, to the extent such investments\nare not subject to consolidation or the equity method. Under the measurement alternative, these financial instruments are carried at cost, less any\nimpairment (assessed quarterly), plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar\ninvestment of the same issuer. In addition, income is recognized when dividends are received only to the extent they are distributed from net\naccumulated earnings of the investee. Otherwise, such distributions are considered returns of investment and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of\nthe investment. See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information.\nInvestments in debt instruments are accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in other income/(expenses).\nRevenue Recognition\nWe earn substantially all of our revenue in the form of advisory fees from our ETPs and recognize this revenue over time, as the performance\nobligation is satisfied. Advisory fees are based on a percentage of the ETPs’ average daily net assets. Progress is measured using the practical\nexpedient under the output method resulting in the recognition of revenue in the amount for which we have a right to invoice.\n72\nTable of Contents\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe following information, together with information included in other parts of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations, describes key aspects of our market risk.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk to us generally represents the risk of changes in the value of our ETPs that results from fluctuations in securities or commodity\nprices, foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar, and interest rates. Nearly all our revenues are derived from advisory agreements for\nthe WisdomTree ETPs. Under these agreements, the advisory fee we receive is based on the average market value of the assets in the WisdomTree\nETP portfolios we manage.\nFluctuations in the value of the ETPs are common and are generated by numerous factors such as market volatility, the global economy,\ninflation, changes in investor strategies and sentiment, availability of alternative investment vehicles, domestic and foreign government regulations,\nemerging markets developments and others. Accordingly, changes in any one or a combination of these factors may reduce the value of investment\nsecurities and, in turn, the underlying AUM on which our revenues are earned. These declines may cause investors to withdraw funds from our ETPs\nin favor of investments that they perceive as offering greater opportunity or lower risk, thereby compounding the impact on our revenues. We believe\nchallenging and volatile market conditions will continue to be present in the foreseeable future.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe invest our corporate cash in short-term interest earning assets, primarily in federal agency debt instruments, WisdomTree fixed income\nETFs, U.S. treasuries, corporate bonds, money market instruments at a commercial bank and other financial instruments which totaled $127.4 million\nand $109.2 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, we recognized losses on\nthese financial instruments of $16.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively, and any losses recognized in the future may be material to our operating\nresults. We do not anticipate that changes in interest rates will have a material impact on our financial condition or cash flows.\nIn addition, our Convertible Notes bear interest at fixed rates of 5.75% and 3.25% for the 2023 Notes and the 2021 Notes, respectively.\nTherefore, we have no direct financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of the Convertible Notes\nchanges primarily when the market price of our common stock fluctuates or interest rates change.\nExchange Rate Risk\nWe are subject to currency translation exposure on the results of our non-U.S. operations, primarily in the U.K. and Europe. Foreign currency\ntranslation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities’ statements of earnings and balance sheets from\nfunctional currency to our reporting currency (the U.S. dollar) for consolidation purposes. The advisory fees earned on our European listed ETPs are\npredominantly in U.S. dollars (and also paid in gold ounces, as described below); however, expenses for corporate overhead are generally incurred in\nBritish pounds. Currently, we do not enter into derivative financial instruments aimed at offsetting certain exposures in the statement of operations or\nthe balance sheet but may seek to do so in the future.\nExchange rate risk associated with the euro is not considered to be significant.\nCommodity and Cryptocurrency Price Risk\nFluctuations in the prices of commodities and cryptocurrencies that are linked to certain of our ETPs could have a material adverse effect on\nour AUM and revenues. In addition, a portion of the advisory fee revenues we receive on our ETPs backed by gold, other precious metals and\ncryptocurrencies are paid in the underlying metal or cryptocurrency. While we readily sell the gold, precious metals and cryptocurrencies that we earn\nunder these advisory contracts, we still may maintain a position. We currently do not enter into arrangements to hedge against fluctuations in the price\nof these commodities and cryptocurrencies and any hedging we may undertake in the future may not be cost-effective or sufficient to hedge against\nthis exposure.\n73\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of December 31, 2023, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation,\nour Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were\neffective at a reasonable assurance level in ensuring that material information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under\nthe Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules, regulations and forms of the SEC,\nincluding ensuring that such material information is accumulated by and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer\nand Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2023, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nReport of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-\n15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, management has\nconducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). Our system of internal control over financial reporting is\ndesigned to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external\npurposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the\nCompany’s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance\nwith authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nBased on the assessment, management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP,\nan independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.\n74\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9B.

In our\nopinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and\n2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 23, 2024\nexpressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s\nfinancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect\nto the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included\nperforming procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and\n(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way\nour opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a\nseparate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nETFS Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets – Assessment of Carrying Value\nDescription of the Matter At December 31, 2023, the Company held indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the\nright to manage assets under management through customary advisory agreements, which\nhave no expiration date, in connection with the ETFS acquisition, with an aggregate carrying\nvalue of $601,247,000. As described in Notes 2 and 24 to the consolidated financial\nstatements, these assets were assessed for impairment based upon a quantitative test.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired if their estimated fair values are less than their\ncarrying values. The Company determined the fair value of its ETFS intangible assets using\nan income approach (discounted cash flow analysis) with significant unobservable inputs\nthat included the weighted average cost of capital and projected revenue growth rates.\nF-2\nTable of Contents\nAuditing the Company’s quantitative impairment assessment for its ETFS indefinite-lived\nintangible assets was complex due to the significant unobservable inputs required in\ndetermining fair value. In particular, the fair value estimate of the ETFS indefinite-lived\nintangible assets was sensitive to the significant unobservable inputs described above which\nare affected by future economic and market conditions and thus require significant judgment.\nHow we addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of\ncontrols over the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment\nprocess. This included controls around management’s review of the significant unobservable\ninputs described above and the completeness and accuracy of the inputs to the valuation\nmodel.\nTo test the Company’s quantitative impairment assessment of ETFS indefinite-lived\nintangible assets, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the Company’s\nselection of its fair value methodology, testing the significant unobservable inputs used in the\nvaluation model, evaluating the clerical accuracy of the valuation model and testing the\ncompleteness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company to determine fair\nvalue. For example, we agreed certain inputs used to calculate the weighted average cost of\ncapital to market data. We compared the projected revenue growth rates to the Company’s\nhistorical results, to those of other guideline public companies in the same industry, and to\nhistorical returns for the underlying asset classes.

In our opinion, WisdomTree, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control\nover financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2023\nconsolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 23, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the\neffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial\nReporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public\naccounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing\nand evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have\na material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 23, 2024\nF-4\nTable of Contents\nWisdomTree, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Balance

Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and in\nthe opinion of management reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial\nstatements. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and\ntransactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nConsolidation\nThe Company consolidates entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. The Company determines whether it has a controlling\nfinancial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity (“VOE”) or a variable interest entity (“VIE”). The usual\ncondition for a controlling financial interest in a VOE is ownership of a majority voting interest. If the Company has a majority voting interest in a\nVOE, the entity is consolidated. The Company has a controlling financial interest in a VIE when the Company has a variable interest that provides it\nwith (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb\nlosses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nThe Company reassesses its evaluation of whether an entity is a VOE or VIE when certain reconsideration events occur.\nSegment and Geographic Information\nThe Company, through its subsidiaries in the U.S. and Europe, conducts business as a single operating segment as an ETP sponsor and asset\nmanager which is based upon the Company’s current organizational and management structure, as well as information used by the chief operating\ndecision maker to allocate resources and other factors.\nForeign Currency Translation\nAssets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated based on the end of period exchange rates\nfrom local currency to U.S. dollars. Results of operations are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the period. The impact of the\nforeign currency translation adjustment is included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as a component of other\ncomprehensive income/(loss).\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenues and\nexpenses for the periods presented. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company earns substantially all of its revenue in the form of advisory fees from its ETPs and recognizes this revenue over time, as the\nperformance obligation is satisfied. Advisory fees are based on a percentage of the ETPs’ average daily net assets. Progress is measured using the\npractical expedient under the output method resulting in the recognition of revenue in the amount for which the Company has a right to invoice.\nF-12\nTable of Contents\nContractual Gold Payments\nContractual gold payments are measured and paid monthly based upon the average daily spot price of gold (Note 9). The Company’s obligation\nto continue making these payments terminated on May 10, 2023.\nMarketing and Advertising\nMarketing and advertising costs, including media advertising and production costs, are expensed when incurred.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization is provided for using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:\nEquipment 3 to 5 years\nInternally-developed software 3 years\nThe assets listed above are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.\nStock-Based Awards\nAccounting for stock-based compensation requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all equity awards based on\nestimated fair values. Stock-based compensation is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the award and is amortized over the relevant\nservice period. Forfeitures are recognized when they occur.\nThird-Party Distribution Fees\nThe Company pays a percentage of its advisory fee revenues based on incremental growth in assets under management (“AUM”), subject to\ncaps or minimums, to marketing agents to sell WisdomTree ETPs and for including WisdomTree ETPs on third-party customer platforms and\nrecognizes these expenses as incurred.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less at the time of purchase to be classified as cash\nequivalents. The Company maintains deposits with financial institutions in an amount that is in excess of federally insured limits.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are customer and other obligations due under normal trade terms. The Company measures credit losses, if any, by applying\nhistorical loss rates, adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts to amounts outstanding using the aging method.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company performs a review for the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the estimated\nundiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets are less than their carrying amounts or when other events occur which may\nindicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nFinancial Instruments Owned and Financial Instruments Sold, but Not yet Purchased (at Fair Value)\nFinancial instruments owned and financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased are financial instruments classified as either trading or\navailable-for-sale (“AFS”). These financial instruments are recorded on their trade date and are measured at fair value. All equity instruments that\nhave readily determinable fair values are classified by the Company as trading. Debt instruments are classified based primarily on the Company’s\nintent to hold or sell the instrument. Changes in the fair value of debt instruments classified as trading and AFS are reported in other\nincome/(expenses) and other comprehensive income, respectively, in the period the change occurs. Debt instruments classified as AFS are assessed\nfor impairment on a quarterly basis and an estimate for credit loss is provided when the fair value of the AFS debt instrument is below its amortized\ncost basis. Credit-related impairments are recognized in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the instrument’s amortized cost basis if the\nCompany intends to sell the impaired AFS debt instrument or it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the instrument before\nrecovering its amortized cost basis. Other credit-related impairments are recognized as an allowance with a corresponding adjustment to earnings.\nImpairments resulting from noncredit-related factors are recognized in other comprehensive income. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive\nincome are reclassified into earnings upon sale of the AFS debt instrument using the specific identification method.\nF-13\nTable of Contents\nSecurities Held-to-Maturity\nThe Company accounts for certain of its securities as held-to-maturity on a trade date basis, which are recorded at amortized cost. For held-to-\nmaturity securities, the Company has the intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity and it is not more-likely-than-not that the Company\nwill be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are placed\non non-accrual status when the Company is in receipt of information indicating collection of interest is doubtful. Cash received on held-to-maturity\nsecurities placed on non-accrual status is recognized on a cash basis as interest income if and when received.\nThe Company reviews its portfolio of held-to-maturity securities for impairment on a quarterly basis, recognizing an allowance, if any, by\napplying an estimated loss rate after consideration for the nature of collateral securing the financial asset as well as potential future changes in\ncollateral values and historical loss information for financial assets secured with similar collateral.\nInvestments in pass-through government-sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”) are determined to have an estimated loss rate of zero due to an\nimplicit U.S. government guarantee.\nInvestments\nThe Company accounts for equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value under the measurement alternative prescribed\nin Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 321, Investments – Equity Securities (“ASC 321”), to the extent such investments are not\nsubject to consolidation or the equity method. Under the measurement alternative, these financial instruments are carried at cost, less any impairment\n(assessed quarterly), plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of\nthe same issuer. In addition, income is recognized when dividends are received only to the extent they are distributed from net accumulated earnings\nof the investee. Otherwise, such distributions are considered returns of investment and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the investment.\nInvestments in debt instruments are accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in other income/(expenses).\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the identifiable net assets at the acquisition date. The Company tests\ngoodwill for impairment at least annually and at the time of a triggering event requiring re-evaluation, if one were to occur. Goodwill is considered\nimpaired when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit that was allocated the goodwill is less than its carrying value. If the estimated fair value\nof such reporting unit is less than its carrying value, goodwill impairment is recognized based on that difference, not to exceed the carrying amount of\ngoodwill. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component of an operating segment provided that the component constitutes a business for\nwhich discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that component.\nGoodwill is allocated to the Company’s U.S. business and European business components. For impairment testing purposes, these components\nare aggregated as a single reporting unit as they fall under the same operating segment and have similar economic characteristics.\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually on November 30th. When performing its goodwill impairment test, the Company considers a\nqualitative assessment, when appropriate, and a quantitative assessment using the market approach and its market capitalization when determining\nthe fair value of the reporting unit.\nIntangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually and are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes\nin circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired if their\nestimated fair values are less than their carrying values.\nFinite-lived intangible assets, if any, are amortized over their estimated useful life, which is the period over which the assets are expected to\ncontribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the Company. These intangible assets are tested for impairment at the time of a triggering\nevent, if one were to occur. Finite-lived intangible assets may be impaired when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated from the\nassets are less than their carrying amounts.\nF-14\nTable of Contents\nThe Company may rely on a qualitative assessment when performing its intangible asset impairment test. Otherwise, the impairment evaluation\nis performed at the lowest level of reasonably identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. The annual impairment testing date for all of the\nCompany’s intangible assets is November 30th.\nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs incurred after the preliminary project stage is complete are capitalized if it is probable that the project will be\ncompleted and the software will be used as intended. Capitalized costs consist of employee compensation costs and fees paid to third parties who are\ndirectly involved in the application development efforts and are included in intangible assets, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such costs are\namortized over the estimated useful life of the software on a straight-line basis and are included in depreciation and amortization in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations. Once the application development stage is complete, additional costs are expensed as incurred.\nLeases\nThe Company accounts for its lease obligations in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases (“ASC 842”), which requires the recognition of\nboth (i) a lease liability equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments and (ii) an offsetting right-of-use asset. The remaining lease\npayments are discounted using the rate implicit in the lease, if known, or otherwise the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. After lease\ncommencement, right-of-use assets are assessed for impairment and otherwise are amortized over the remaining lease term on a straight-line basis.\nThese recognition requirements are not applied to short-term leases which are those with a lease term of 12 months or less. Instead, lease payments\nassociated with short-term leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nASC 842 also provides a practical expedient which allows for consideration in a contract to be accounted for as a single lease component rather\nthan allocated between lease and non-lease components. The Company has elected to apply this practical expedient to all lease contracts, where\napplicable.\nDeferred Consideration—Gold Payments\nDeferred consideration—gold payments represented the present value of an obligation to pay gold to a third party into perpetuity and was\nmeasured using forward-looking gold prices observed on the CMX exchange, a selected discount rate and perpetual growth rate (Note 9). Changes in\nthe fair value of this obligation were reported as gain on revaluation/termination of deferred consideration—gold payments in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations.\nConvertible Notes\nConvertible notes are carried at amortized cost, net of issuance costs. The Company accounts for convertible instruments as a single liability\n(applicable to the convertible notes) or equity with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features unless the conversion feature meets the\ncriteria for accounting under the substantial premium model or does not qualify for a derivative scope exception. Interest expense is recognized using\nthe effective interest method and includes amortization of issuance costs over the life of the debt.\nContingencies\nThe Company may be subject to reviews, inspections and investigations by regulatory authorities as well as legal proceedings arising in the\nordinary course of business. The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of all legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a\nparty and accrues a loss contingency when the loss is probable and reasonably estimable.\nContingent Payments\nThe Company recognizes a gain on contingent payments when the contingency is resolved and the gain is realized.\nF-15\nTable of Contents\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of\ncommon shares outstanding for the period. Net income available to common stockholders represents net income of the Company reduced by an\nallocation of earnings to participating securities. The Series A non-voting convertible preferred stock (Note 11) and unvested share-based payment\nawards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and are included\nin the computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class method. Stock-based equity awards that do not contain such rights are not deemed participating\nsecurities and are included in diluted shares outstanding (if dilutive).\nDiluted EPS is calculated under the treasury stock method and the two-class method. The calculation that results in the lowest diluted EPS\namount for the common stock is reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The treasury stock method includes the dilutive effect\nof potential common shares including unvested stock-based awards, the Series A non-voting convertible preferred stock and the convertible notes, if\nany. Potential common shares associated with the Series A non-voting convertible preferred stock and the convertible notes are computed under the\nif-converted method. Potential common shares associated with the conversion option embedded in the convertible notes are dilutive when the\nCompany’s average stock price exceeds the conversion price.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities based\non the differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which differences are\nexpected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not\nthat some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nTax positions are evaluated utilizing a two-step process. The Company first determines whether any of its tax positions are more-likely-than-not\nto be sustained upon examination, based solely on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets this recognition\nthreshold, the position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The\nCompany records interest expense and penalties related to tax expenses as income tax expense.\nThe Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions of the Tax Reform Act requires the Company to include in its U.S. income tax\nreturn foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary’s tangible assets. An accounting policy election is\navailable to either account for the tax effects of GILTI in the period that is subject to such taxes or to provide deferred taxes for book and tax basis\ndifferences that upon reversal may be subject to such taxes. The Company accounts for the tax effects of these provisions in the period that is subject\nto such tax.\nNon-income based taxes are recorded as part of other liabilities and other expenses.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nOn November 27, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting—Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures, which requires public entities to provide disclosures of significant segment expenses and other segment items. The\nguidance requires public entities to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently\nrequired annually and also applies to public entities with a single reportable segment. Entities are permitted to disclose more than one measure of a\nsegment’s profit or loss if such measures are used by the chief operating decision-maker to allocate resources and assess performance, as long as at\nleast one of those measures is determined in a way that is most consistent with the measurement principles used to measure the corresponding\namounts in the consolidated financial statements. The guidance is applied retrospectively to all periods presented in financial statements, unless it is\nimpracticable, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early\nadoption is permitted. This standard will only impact disclosures and will be adopted by the Company on January 1, 2024.\nF-16\nTable of Contents\nOn December 13, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08, Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets, which contains final guidance\nrequiring all entities to measure certain crypto assets at fair value each reporting period and to reflect changes from remeasurement in net income.\nEntities are required to present crypto assets measured at fair value separately from other intangible assets on the balance sheet and present changes\nfrom the remeasurement of crypto assets separately from changes in the carrying amounts of other intangible assets in the income statement. Entities\nare required to provide interim and annual disclosures about the types of crypto assets they hold and any changes in their holdings of crypto assets.\nThe guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is\npermitted. The Company has determined that this standard will not have a material impact on its financial statements and will early adopt the\nstandard on January 1, 2024.\nOn December 14, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which establishes new income tax disclosure\nrequirements in addition to modifying and eliminating certain existing requirements. Under the new guidance, entities must consistently categorize\nand provide greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation. They must also further disaggregate income taxes paid. The standard is\nintended to benefit investors by providing more detailed income tax disclosures that would be useful in making capital allocation decisions. The\nguidance applies to all entities subject to income taxes and is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance will be\napplied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company plans to adopt this\nstandard on January 1, 2025.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nOn January 1, 2021, the Company early adopted ASU 2020-06, Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (ASU 2020-06) under the\nmodified retrospective approach. Under the ASU, the accounting for convertible instruments was simplified by removing major separation models\nrequired under current GAAP. Accordingly, more convertible instruments are reported as a single liability or equity with no separate accounting for\nembedded conversion features. Certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception are\nremoved and, as a result, more equity contracts will qualify for the scope exception. The ASU also simplifies the diluted earnings-per-share\ncalculation in certain areas. Upon the adoption of this ASU, the Company reclassified the equity component related to the convertible notes, net of\ndeferred taxes, reducing accumulated deficit by $616, increasing the carrying value of the convertible notes by $4,088, reducing additional paid-in\ncapital by $3,682 and reducing deferred tax liabilities by $1,022. These updates also reduced interest expense recognized on the Company’s\nconvertible notes by approximately $420 per quarter and $1,680 for the year ended December 31, 2021 (Note 10) and the impact on earnings per\nshare was negligible.\n3. Cash and Cash Equivalents\nOf the total cash and cash equivalents of $129,305 and $132,101 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, $116,895 and $131,104, respectively, were\nheld at three financial institutions. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, cash equivalents were approximately $50,226 and $930, respectively.\nCertain of the Company’s subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital, which was $29,156 and $25,988 at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These requirements are generally satisfied by cash on hand.\nF-17\nTable of Contents\n4. Fair Value Measurements\nThe fair value of financial instruments is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., “the exit\nprice”) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, establishes a hierarchy for\ninputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the\nmost observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability\ndeveloped based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs reflect assumptions that market participants would use in\npricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels\nbased on the transparency of inputs as follows:\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nLevel 2 — Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are\nnot active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.\nLevel 3 — Instruments whose significant drivers are unobservable.\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary from product to product and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the\ntype of product, whether the product is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. To the\nextent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more\njudgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by management in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes,\nthe level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is\nsignificant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nThe tables below summarize the categorization of the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value. During the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no transfers between Levels 2 and 3.\nDecember 31, 2023\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nRecurring fair value measurements:\nCash equivalents $ 50,226 $ 50,226 $ — $ —\nFinancial instruments owned, at fair value:\nETFs 35,181 35,181 — —\nPass-through GSEs 10,240 — 10,240 —\nOther assets—seed capital (WisdomTree Digital\nFunds):\nU.S. treasuries 5,007 — 5,007 —\nEquities 6,337 6,337 — —\nFixed income 1,957 1,008 949 —\nTotal $ 108,948 $ 92,752 $ 16,196 $ —\nNon-recurring fair value measurements:\nFnality International Limited—Series B-1 Preference\nShares(1) 9,684 — — 9,684\nOther investments(2) — — — —\nTotal $ 9,684 $ — $ — $ 9,684\n____________\n(1) Fair value determined on October 31, 2023\n(2) Fair value determined on September 30, 2023\nF-18\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2022\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nRecurring fair value measurements:\nCash equivalents $ 930 $ 930 $ — $ —\nFinancial instruments owned, at fair value:\nETFs 23,772 23,772 — —\nU.S. treasuries 2,980 2,980 — —\nPass-through GSEs 96,837 23,290 73,547 —\nFixed income 885 — 885 —\nOther assets—seed capital (WisdomTree Digital\nFunds): 1,765 — 1,765 —\nInvestments in Convertible Notes\nSecurrency, Inc.—convertible note (Note 7) 14,500 — — 14,500\nFnality International Limited—convertible note\n(Note 7) 6,921 — — 6,921\nTotal $ 148,590 $ 50,972 $ 76,197 $ 21,421\nNon-recurring fair value measurements:\nOther investments(1) $ 312 $ — $ — $ 312\nLiabilities:\nRecurring fair value measurements:\nDeferred consideration (Note 9) $ 200,290 $ — $ — $ 200,290\n____________\n(1) Fair value determined on May 10, 2022\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements - Methodology\nCash Equivalents (Note 3) – These financial assets represent cash invested in highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than\n90 days. These investments are valued at par, which approximates fair value, and are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.\nFinancial instruments owned (Note 5) – Financial instruments owned are investments in ETFs, pass-through GSEs, U.S. treasuries, equities\nand fixed income. ETFs, U.S. treasuries and equities are generally traded in active, quoted and highly liquid markets and are therefore classified as\nLevel 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Pricing of pass-through GSEs and fixed income includes consideration given to collateral characteristics and\nmarket assumptions related to yields, credit risk and timing of prepayments and are therefore generally classified as Level 2. Pass-through GSE\npositions invested in through a fund structure with a quoted market price on an exchange are generally classified as Level 1.\nF-19\nTable of Contents\nFair Value Measurements classified as Level 3 – The following table presents a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of recurring\nfair value measurements classified as Level 3:\nThese instruments consist of the following:\nYears Ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nInvestments in Convertible Notes (Note 7):\nBeginning balance $ 21,421 $ —\nPurchases 11,228 21,863\nSettlements (28,818) —\nConversions(1) (9,684) —\nNet realized gains/(losses)(2) 5,853 (442)\nEnding balance $ — $ 21,421\nDeferred Consideration (Note 7):\nBeginning balance $ 200,290 $ 228,062\nNet realized losses(3) 6,069 17,108\nNet unrealized gains(4) (61,953) (27,765)\nSettlements (144,406) (17,115)\nEnding balance $ — $ 200,290\n____________\n(1) The Fnality convertible notes converted into Series B-1 Preference Shares on October 31, 2023 (Note 7).\n(2) Recorded in impairments and other losses, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(3) Recorded as contractual gold payments expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(4) Recorded as gain on revaluation/termination of deferred consideration—gold payments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n5.

(“Securrency”), a\ndeveloper of institutional-grade blockchain-based financial and regulatory technology, in connection with the sale of Securrency to an unaffiliated\nthird party. This resulted in a net impairment charge of $7,630 and additional losses of $1,777, recorded in other losses, net, recognized during the\nyear ended December 31, 2023.\nF-21\nTable of Contents\nDisclosures Pertaining to December 31, 2022\nPreferred Stock\nThe Company owned approximately 22% (or 18% on a fully-diluted basis) of the capital stock of Securrency, issued as a result of strategic\ninvestments totaling $13,612. In consideration of such investments, the Company had received 5,178,488 shares of Series A convertible preferred\nstock (“Series A Shares”) in December 2019 and 2,004,665 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock (“Series B Shares”) in March 2021. The\nSeries B Shares contained a liquidation preference that was pari passu with shares of Series B-1 convertible preferred stock (which were substantially\nthe same as the Series B Shares except that they had limited voting rights) and senior to that of the holders of the Series A Shares, which were senior\nto the holders of common stock. Otherwise, the Series A Shares and Series B Shares had substantially the same terms, were convertible into common\nstock at the option of the Company and contained various rights and protections including a non-cumulative 6.0% dividend, payable if and when\ndeclared by the board of directors of Securrency. In addition, the Series A Shares and Series B Shares (together with the Series B-1 convertible\npreferred stock) were separately redeemable, with respect to all of the shares outstanding of the applicable series of preferred stock (subject to certain\nregulatory restrictions of certain investors), for the original issue price thereof, plus all declared and unpaid dividends, upon approval by holders of at\nleast 60% of the Series A Shares (at any time on or after December 31, 2029) and 90% of the Series B Shares (at any time on or after March 31,\n2031).\nThese investments were accounted for under the measurement alternative prescribed in ASC 321, as they did not have a readily determinable\nfair value and were not considered to be in-substance common stock. The investments were assessed for impairment and similar observable\ntransactions on a quarterly basis. There was no impairment recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 based upon a qualitative\nassessment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a gain of $376 on its Series A Shares, which were re-measured to fair\nvalue upon the issuance of Securrency’s Series B Shares. Fair value was determined using the backsolve method, a valuation approach that\ndetermines the value of shares for companies with complex capital structures based upon the price paid for shares recently issued. Fair value was\nallocated across the capital structure using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nThe table below presents the inputs used in the backsolve valuation approach (classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy):\nInputs\nJune 9, March 8,\n2021 2021\nExpected volatility 50% 55%\nTime to exit (in years) 4.75 5.00\nConvertible Note\nIn April and November 2022, the Company participated in a convertible note financing, making an aggregate investment of $15,000 in\nSecurrency. In consideration for its investment, the Company was issued a 7% Convertible Promissory Note maturing on April 21, 2023.\nThe note was convertible into either Securrency’s common stock or the class of securities convertible into, exchangeable for, or conferring the\nright to purchase Securrency’s common stock that was issued in the event of a future equity financing at a conversion price equal to a discount of\n25% (or, if applicable, a greater discount offered to other holders of convertible securities in such future equity financing round) to the lowest price\npaid per equity share issued in the future equity financing round.\nThe note was redeemable upon the occurrence of a corporate transaction for an amount which was the greater of (i) the principal amount and all\naccrued interest and (ii) the amount that would be received had the note been converted to common stock immediately prior to the occurrence of the\ncorporate transaction. At maturity, redemption or conversion could occur upon the election by the holders of a majority-in-interest of the aggregate\nprincipal amount of outstanding notes. If no such election was made, Securrency could elect to pay or convert the notes in its sole discretion.\nF-22\nTable of Contents\nThe note was accounted for at fair value.

Deferred Consideration—gold payments\nDeferred consideration—gold payments represented an obligation the Company assumed in connection with its acquisition of the European\nexchange-traded commodity, currency and leveraged-and-inverse business of ETFS Capital Limited (“ETFS Capital”) which occurred on April 11,\n2018 (“ETFS Acquisition”). The obligation was for fixed payments to ETFS Capital of physical gold bullion equating to 9,500 ounces of gold per\nyear through March 31, 2058 and then subsequently reduced to 6,333 ounces of gold continuing into perpetuity (“Contractual Gold Payments”).\nETFS Capital passed through these payments to other parties to meet its payment obligations under prior royalty agreements it had with such parties,\nincluding to Gold Bullion Holdings (Jersey) Limited (“GBH”), a subsidiary of the World Gold Council (“WGC”), Graham Tuckwell (“GT”), and\nRodber Investments Limited (“RIL”), an entity controlled by GT, who is also the Chairman of ETFS Capital.\nOn May 10, 2023, the Company terminated its Contractual Gold Payments obligation for aggregate consideration totaling $136,903 pursuant to\na Sale, Purchase and Assignment Deed (the “SPA Agreement”) with WisdomTree International Holdings Ltd, Electra Target HoldCo Limited, ETFS\nCapital, WGC, GBH, GT and RIL. Under the terms of the transaction, GBH received approximately $4,371 in cash and 13,087 shares of Series C\nPreferred Stock, convertible into 13,087,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, and RIL received approximately $45,634 in cash.\nF-24\nTable of Contents\nOn November 20, 2023, the Company repurchased the 13,087 shares of Series C Preferred Stock issued to GBH for aggregate consideration of\n$84,411, $40,000 of which was paid on the closing date, with the remaining $44,411 payable in equal, interest-free installments on the first, second\nand third anniversaries of the closing date. See Note 12 for additional information.\nThe Company determined the present value of the deferred consideration of $0 and $200,290 at December 31, 2022 using the following\nassumptions:\nDecember 31, 2022\nForward-looking gold price (low)—per ounce $ 1,858\nForward-looking gold price (high)—per ounce $ 3,126\nForward-looking gold price (weighted average)—per ounce $ 2,237\nDiscount rate 11.0%\nPerpetual growth rate 1.3%\nThe forward-looking gold prices at December 31, 2022 were extrapolated from the last observable CMX exchange price (beyond 2028) and the\nweighted-average price per ounce was derived from the relative present values of the annual payment obligations. The perpetual growth rate at\nDecember 31, 2022 was determined based upon the increase in observable forward-looking gold prices through 2028. This obligation is classified as\nLevel 3 as the discount rate, the extrapolated forward-looking gold prices and perpetual growth rate are significant unobservable inputs. An increase\nin spot gold prices, forward-looking gold prices and the perpetual growth rate would result in an increase in deferred consideration, whereas an\nincrease in the discount rate would reduce the fair value.\nCurrent and long-term amounts payable were $16,796 and $183,494, respectively, at December 31, 2022.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized the following in respect of deferred consideration:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nContractual gold payments $ 6,069 $ 17,108 $ 17,096\nContractual gold payments—gold ounces paid 3,167 9,500 9,500\nGain on revaluation/termination of deferred consideration—\ngold payments(1) $ 61,953 $ 27,765 $ 2,018\n____________\n(1) Gains on revaluation/termination of deferred consideration—gold payments result from a decrease in spot gold prices, a decrease in the forward-\nlooking price of gold, a decrease in the perpetual growth rate and an increase in the discount rate used to compute the present value of the annual\npayment obligations.\n10.

Due to an\nextreme adverse move in oil futures relative to the oil futures’ closing price, the swap contract underlying 3OIL was terminated by the swap provider,\nwhich resulted in the compulsory redemption of 3OIL, all in accordance with the prospectus.\nIn February 2022, the Court of Udine ruled in the Company’s favor. Also in February 2022, WMAI, WTMAML, WTUK and WT Ireland were\nserved with another writ of summons to appear before the Court of Milan by additional investors seeking damages resulting from the closure of\n3OIL.\nIn March 2022, WMAI and WTUK were served with a writ of summons to appear before the Court of Turin and two writs of summons to\nappear before the Court of Milan by additional investors seeking damages. These writs also were served on the intermediary brokers for the\nrespective claimants, with the claimants alleging joint and several liability of WMAI, WTUK and such intermediary brokers. In July 2023, the Court\nof Milan ruled in favor of WMAI and WTUK in respect of one of these claims.\nTotal damages sought by all investors related to these claims are approximately €15,200 ($16,778) at December 31, 2023.\nAdditionally, in July 2023, WT Ireland received a letter from counsel on behalf of additional investors seeking damages of up to approximately\n€8,400 ($9,272) resulting from the closure of 3OIL. The claim is in its preliminary stages and a writ of summons has not been served.\nThe Company is currently assessing these claims with its external counsel. The Company expects that losses, if any, arising from these claims\nwill be covered under its insurance policies, less a $500 deductible. An accrual has not been made with respect to these matters at December 31, 2023\nand 2022.\n15. Variable Interest Entities\nVIEs are entities with any of the following characteristics: (i) the entity does not have enough equity to finance its activities without additional\nfinancial support; (ii) the equity holders, as a group, lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest; or (iii) the entity is structured with non-\nsubstantive voting rights.\nConsolidation of a VIE is required for the party deemed to be the primary beneficiary, if any. The primary beneficiary is the party who has both\n(a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and (b) an obligation to absorb losses\nof the entity or a right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity. The Company is not the primary\nbeneficiary of any entities in which it has a variable interest as it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the\nentities’ economic performance. Such power is conveyed through the entities’ boards of directors and the Company does not have control over the\nboards.\nF-30\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents information about the Company’s variable interests in non-consolidated VIEs:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nCarrying Amount—Assets (Securrency):\nPreferred stock—Series A Shares $ — $ 8,488\nPreferred stock—Series B Shares — 5,500\nConvertible note — 14,500\nSubtotal—Securrency $ — $ 28,488\nCarrying Amount—Assets (Fnality):\nConvertible note — 6,921\nSeries B-1 Preference Shares 9,684 —\nSubtotal—Fnality $ 9,684 $ 6,921\nCarrying Amount—Assets (Other investments): $ — $ 312\nTotal (Note 7) $ 9,684 $ 35,721\nMaximum exposure to loss $ 9,684 $ 35,721\n16. Revenues from Contracts with Customers\nThe following table presents the Company’s total revenues from contracts with customers:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nRevenues from contracts with customers:\nAdvisory fees $ 333,227 $ 293,632 $ 298,052\nOther 15,808 7,713 6,266\nTotal operating revenues $ 349,035 $ 301,345 $ 304,318\nThe Company recognizes revenues from contracts with customers when the performance obligation is satisfied, which is when the promised\nservices are transferred to the customer. A service is considered to be transferred when the customer obtains control, which is represented by the\ntransfer of rights with regard to the service. Transfer of control happens either over time or at a point in time. When a performance obligation is\nsatisfied over time, an entity is required to select a single method of measuring progress for each performance obligation that depicts the entity’s\nperformance in transferring control of services to the customer.\nSubstantially all the Company’s revenues from contracts with customers are derived primarily from investment advisory agreements with\nrelated parties (Note 17). These advisory fees are recognized over time, are earned from the Company’s ETPs and are calculated based on a\npercentage of the ETPs’ average daily net assets. There is no significant judgment in calculating amounts due which are invoiced monthly in arrears\nand are not subject to any potential reversal. Progress is measured using the practical expedient under the output method resulting in the recognition\nof revenue in the amount for which the Company has a right to invoice.\nThere are no contract assets or liabilities that arise in connection with the recognition of advisory fee revenue. In addition, there are no costs\nincurred to obtain or fulfill the contracts with customers, all of which are investment advisory agreements with related parties.\nOther income includes revenues the Company earns from swap providers associated with certain of the Company’s European listed ETPs, the\nnature of which are either based on a percentage of the ETPs’ average daily net assets or flows associated with certain products. There is no\nsignificant judgment in calculating amounts due, which are invoiced monthly or quarterly in arrears and are not subject to any potential reversal.\nProgress is measured using the practical expedient under the output method resulting in the recognition of revenue in the amount for which the\nCompany has a right to invoice.\nF-31\nTable of Contents\nGeographic Distribution of Revenues\nThe following table presents the Company’s total revenues geographically as determined by where the respective management companies\nreside:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nRevenues from contracts with customers:\nUnited States $ 220,117 $ 184,036 $ 179,016\nJersey 113,325 103,692 114,623\nIreland 15,593 13,617 10,679\nTotal operating revenues $ 349,035 $ 301,345 $ 304,318\n17. Related Party Transactions\nInvestment Advisory Agreements\nThe Company’s revenues are derived primarily from investment advisory agreements with related parties. Under these agreements, the\nCompany has licensed to related parties the use of certain of its own indexes for the U.S. WisdomTree ETFs, WisdomTree Digital Funds and\nWisdomTree UCITS ETFs. The relevant board of trustees or board of directors (including certain officers of the Company) of each of the related\nparties is primarily responsible for overseeing the management and affairs of the entities for the benefit of their respective stakeholders and have\ncontracted with the Company to provide for general management and administration services. The Company is also responsible for certain expenses\nof the related parties, including the cost of transfer agency, custody, fund administration and accounting, legal, audit, and other non-distribution\nservices, excluding extraordinary expenses, taxes and certain other expenses, which are included in fund management and administration in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations. In exchange, the Company receives fees based on a percentage of the ETPs’ and the Digital Funds’ average\ndaily net assets. A majority of the independent members of the respective board of trustees or board of directors are required to initially and annually\n(after the first two years) approve the advisory agreements of the U.S. WisdomTree ETFs and the Digital Funds and these agreements may be\nterminated by such board of trustees or board of directors upon notice.\nThe following table summarizes accounts receivable from related parties which are included as a component of accounts receivable in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nReceivable from WTT $ 21,226 $ 16,399\nReceivable from ManJer Issuers 4,411 4,485\nReceivable from WMAI and WTICAV 2,874 3,255\nTotal $ 28,511 $ 24,139\nThe allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable from related parties is insignificant when applying historical loss rates, adjusted for\ncurrent conditions and supportable forecasts, to the amounts outstanding in the table above. Amounts outstanding are all invoiced in arrears, are less\nthan 30 days aged and are collected shortly after the applicable reporting period.\nThe following table summarizes revenues from advisory services provided to related parties:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nAdvisory services provided to WTT $ 218,834 $ 183,409 $ 178,511\nAdvisory services provided to ManJer Issuers 98,800 96,606 108,862\nAdvisory services provided to WMAI and\nWTICAV 15,593 13,617 10,679\nTotal $ 333,227 $ 293,632 $ 298,052\nF-32\nTable of Contents\nPursuant to a license agreement between WisdomTree, Inc. (“WTI”) and WML to provide indices for a number of the sub-funds of WTICAV,\nWTI earned revenue amounting to €1,044 ($1,128), €642 ($671) and €612 ($710) for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, which has been eliminated in consolidation. No other revenue was earned by WTI from providing indices for use in the European Union\nduring 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nInvestments in WisdomTree Products\nThe Company also has investments in certain WisdomTree products of approximately $52,566 and $25,283 at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. This includes $18,308 and $1,765, respectively, of investments in certain consolidated affiliated Digital Funds advised by WT Digital\nManagement, referred to herein as “other assets–seed capital.” Net unrealized and realized gains and losses related to trading WisdomTree products\nduring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $1,294, ($107) and ($451), respectively, which are recorded in other losses, net on\nthe Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDeferred Consideration—Gold Payments – Termination\nOn May 10, 2023, the Company terminated its contractual gold payments obligation to ETFS Capital, which included the payment of $45,634\nto an entity controlled by GT, a stockholder of the Company. See Note 9 for additional information.\n18. Stock-Based Awards\nOn July 15, 2022, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2022 Equity Plan under which the Company may issue up to 16,000,000 shares of\ncommon stock (less one share for every share granted under the 2016 Equity Plan since March 31, 2022 and inclusive of shares available under the\n2016 Equity Plan as of March 31, 2022) in the form of stock options and other stock-based awards.\nThe Company grants equity awards to employees and directors which include restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units\n(“RSUs”), performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”) and stock options. Certain awards described below are subject to acceleration under\ncertain conditions.\nStock options: Generally issued for terms of ten years and may vest after at least one year of service and have an exercise price equal to\nthe Company’s stock price on the grant date. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options (when granted)\nusing the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nRSAs/RSUs: Awards are valued based on the Company’s stock price on grant date and generally vest ratably, on an annual basis, over\nthree years.\nPRSUs: These awards cliff vest three years from the grant date and contain a market condition whereby the number of PRSUs\nultimately vesting is tied to how the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) compares to a peer group of other\npublicly traded asset managers over the three-year period. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to value these awards.\nThe number of PRSUs vesting ranges from 0% to 200% of the target number of PRSUs granted, as follows:\n• If the relative TSR is below the 25th percentile, then 0% of the target number of PRSUs granted will vest;\n• If the relative TSR is at the 25th percentile, then 50% of the target number of PRSUs granted will vest;\n• If the relative TSR is above the 25th percentile, then linear scaling is applied such that the percent of the target\nnumber of PRSUs vesting is 100% at the 50th percentile and capped at 200% of the target number of PRSUs granted\nfor performance at the 85th percentile; and\n• If the Company’s TSR is negative, the target number of PRSUs vesting is capped at 100% regardless of the relative\nTSR percentile.\nF-33\nTable of Contents\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, total stock-based compensation expense was $16,190, $10,385 and $9,998,\nrespectively, and the related tax benefit recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Operations was $3,919, $2,371 and $2,327, respectively.\nThe actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions for share-based compensation was $1,820, $1,548 and $2,032 during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nA summary of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense and average remaining vesting period is as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023\nWeighted-Average\nUnrecognized Remaining\nStock-Based Vesting Period\nCompensation (Years)\nEmployees and directors $ 19,165 0.92\nStock Options\nThere was no option activity during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and there were no options outstanding as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $51. Cash received from option exercises\nduring the year ended December 31, 2021 was $815.\nRSAs, RSUs and PRSUs\nThe aggregate fair value of RSAs, RSUs and PRSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $10,158,\n$9,466 and $10,940, respectively.

Stockholder Rights Plan\nOn March 17, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a stockholder rights plan, as set forth in the Stockholder Rights\nAgreement, dated March 17, 2023, between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as Rights Agent, as amended by\nAmendment No. 1 thereto, dated May 4, 2023 (“Amendment No. 1”), and by Amendment No. 2 thereto, dated May 10, 2023 (“Amendment No. 2”)\n(as amended, the “Stockholder Rights Agreement”). At the Company’s 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 16, 2023, the Company’s\nstockholders ratified the adoption by the Board of Directors of the Stockholder Rights Agreement.\nPursuant to the terms of the Stockholder Rights Agreement, the Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of (i) one Right (as defined\nbelow) for each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company’s common stock and (ii) 1,000 Rights for each\noutstanding share of the Company’s Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”), to stockholders of record as of\nthe close of business on March 28, 2023 (the “Record Date”). In addition, one Right will automatically attach to each share of common stock and\n1,000 Rights will automatically attach to each share of Series A Preferred Stock, in each case, issued between the Record Date and the earlier of the\nDistribution Date (as defined below) and the expiration date of the Rights. Each “Right” entitles the registered holder thereof to purchase from the\nCompany a unit consisting of one ten-thousandth of a share (a “Unit”) of Series B Junior Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $0.01\nper share, of the Company (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) at a cash exercise price of $32.00 per Unit (the “Exercise Price”), subject to adjustment,\nunder certain conditions specified in the Stockholder Rights Agreement and summarized below.\nInitially, the Rights are not exercisable and are attached to and trade with all shares of common stock and Series A Preferred Stock outstanding\nas of, and issued subsequent to, the Record Date. The Rights will separate from the common stock and Series A Preferred Stock and will become\nexercisable upon the earlier of (i) the close of business on the tenth calendar day following the first public announcement that a person or group of\naffiliated or associated persons (an “Acquiring Person”) has acquired beneficial ownership of 10% (or 20% in the case of a person or group which,\ntogether with all affiliates and associates of such person or group, is the beneficial owner of shares of common stock of the Company representing\nless than 20% of the shares of common stock of the Company then outstanding, and which is entitled to file, and files, a statement on Schedule 13G\npursuant to Rule 13d-1(b) or Rule 13d-1(c) of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act as in effect at the time of the first public\nannouncement of the declaration of the Rights dividend with respect to the shares of common stock beneficially owned by such person or group) or\nmore of the outstanding shares of common stock, other than as a result of repurchases of stock by the Company or certain inadvertent actions by a\nstockholder (the date of such announcement being referred to as the “Stock Acquisition Date”), or (ii) the close of business on the tenth business day\n(or such later day as the Board of Directors may determine) following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that could result upon\nits consummation in a person or group becoming an Acquiring Person (the earlier of such dates being herein referred to as the “Distribution Date”). A\nperson or group who beneficially owned 10% or more (or 20% or more in the case of passive stockholders) of the Company’s outstanding common\nstock prior to the first public announcement by the Company of the adoption of the Stockholder Rights Agreement will not trigger the Stockholder\nRights Agreement so long as they do not acquire beneficial ownership of any additional shares of common stock at a time when they still beneficially\nown 10% or more (or 20% or more in the case of passive stockholders) of such common stock, subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the\nStockholder Rights Agreement.\nF-35\nTable of Contents\nFor purposes of the Stockholder Rights Agreement, beneficial ownership is defined to include ownership of securities that are subject to a\nderivative transaction and acquired derivative securities. Swaps dealers unassociated with any control intent or intent to evade the purposes of the\nStockholder Rights Agreement are excepted from such imputed beneficial ownership. Pursuant to Amendment No. 1, beneficial ownership did not\ninclude the right to vote pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to voting on the proposal to approve and ratify the\nStockholder Rights Agreement presented to the Company’s stockholders at the Company’s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders. Pursuant to\nAmendment No. 2, the parties to the SPA Agreement are not deemed to be “Acquiring Persons” solely by virtue of, or as a result of, the parties’ entry\ninto the SPA Agreement, the issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock to GBH, and the performance or consummation of any of the other transactions\ncontemplated by the SPA Agreement, among other conditions, under the terms and conditions set forth in Amendment No. 2.\nIn the event that a Stock Acquisition Date occurs, proper provision will be made so that each holder of a Right (other than an Acquiring Person\nor its associates or affiliates, whose Rights shall become null and void) will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise, in lieu of a number of\nshares of Series B Preferred Stock, that number of shares of common stock of the Company (or, in certain circumstances, including if there are\ninsufficient shares of common stock to permit the exercise in full of the Rights, Units of Series B Preferred Stock, other securities, cash or property,\nor any combination of the foregoing) having a market value of two times the Exercise Price of the Right (such right being referred to as the\n“Subscription Right”). In the event that, at any time following the Stock Acquisition Date, (i) the Company consolidates with, or merges with and\ninto, any other person, and the Company is not the continuing or surviving corporation, (ii) any person consolidates with the Company, or merges\nwith and into the Company and the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation of such merger and, in connection with such merger, all or\npart of the shares of common stock are changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person or cash or any other property, or\n(iii) 50% or more of the Company’s assets or earning power is sold, mortgaged or otherwise transferred, each holder of a Right (other than an\nAcquiring Person or its associates or affiliates, whose Rights shall become null and void) will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise,\ncommon stock of the acquiring company having a market value equal to two times the Exercise Price of the Right (such right being referred to as the\n“Merger Right”). The holder of a Right will continue to have the Merger Right whether or not such holder has exercised the Subscription Right.\nRights that are or were beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person may (under certain circumstances specified in the Stockholder Rights Agreement)\nbecome null and void.\nThe Rights may be redeemed in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.01 per Right (payable in cash, common stock or other consideration\ndeemed appropriate by the Board of Directors) by the Board of Directors only until the earlier of (i) the time at which any person becomes an\nAcquiring Person or (ii) the expiration date of the Stockholder Rights Agreement. Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors ordering\nredemption of the Rights, the Rights will terminate and thereafter the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the redemption price.\nThe Stockholder Rights Agreement may be amended by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion at any time prior to the time at which any\nperson becomes an Acquiring Person. After such time the Board of Directors may, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Stockholder Rights\nAgreement, amend the Stockholder Rights Agreement only to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, to shorten or lengthen any time period, or\nto make changes that do not adversely affect the interests of Rights holders (excluding the interests of an Acquiring Person or its associates or\naffiliates).\nUntil a Right is exercised, the holder will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company (beyond those as an existing stockholder), including\nthe right to vote or to receive dividends. While the distribution of the Rights will not be taxable to stockholders or to the Company, stockholders may,\ndepending upon the circumstances, recognize taxable income in the event that the Rights become exercisable for shares of common stock, other\nsecurities of the Company, other consideration or for common stock of an acquiring company.\nF-36\nTable of Contents\nThe Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date and will expire at the close of business on March 16, 2024, unless previously\nredeemed or exchanged by the Company.\nThe Stockholder Rights Agreement provides the holders of the common stock with the ability to exempt an offer to acquire, or engage in\nanother business combination transaction involving, the Company that is deemed a “Qualifying Offer” (as defined in the Stockholder Rights\nAgreement) from the terms of the Stockholder Rights Agreement. A Qualifying Offer is, in summary, an offer determined by a majority of the\nindependent members of the Board to have specific characteristics that are generally intended to preclude offers that are coercive, abusive or highly\ncontingent. Among those characteristics are that it be: (i) a fully financed all-cash tender offer or an exchange offer offering shares of common stock\nof the offeror, or a combination thereof, for any and all of the common stock; and (ii) an offer that is otherwise in the best interests of the Company’s\nstockholders. The Stockholder Rights Agreement provides additional characteristics necessary for an acquisition offer to be deemed a “Qualifying\nOffer,” including if the consideration offered in a proposed transaction is stock of the acquiror.\nPursuant to the Stockholder Rights Agreement, if the Company receives a Qualifying Offer and the Board of Directors has not redeemed the\noutstanding Rights or exempted such Qualifying Offer from the terms of the Stockholder Rights Agreement or called a special meeting of\nstockholders (the “Special Meeting”) for the purpose of voting on whether to exempt such Qualifying Offer from the terms of the Stockholder Rights\nAgreement, in each case by the end of the 90 business day period following the commencement of such Qualifying Offer, provided such offer\nremains a Qualifying Offer during such period, the holders of 10% of the common stock may request that the Board call a Special Meeting to vote on\na resolution authorizing the exemption of the Qualifying Offer from the terms of the Stockholder Rights Agreement. If such a Special Meeting is not\nheld by the 90th business day following the receipt of such a request from stockholders to call a Special Meeting, the Qualifying Offer will be\ndeemed exempt from the terms of the Stockholder Rights Agreement on the 10th business day thereafter.\n20.

These capital losses expire between the years 2024 and 2028.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, tax effected capital losses in the amount of $3,278 expired.\nNet Operating Losses – Europe\nOne of the Company’s European subsidiaries generated NOLs outside the U.S. These tax effected NOLs, all of which are carried forward\nindefinitely, were $1,502 at December 31, 2023.\nValuation Allowance\nThe Company’s valuation allowance has been established on its net capital losses, unrealized losses and outside basis differences, as it is more-\nlikely-than-not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company released the valuation allowance on its European net operating losses of $1,609 as it\nis more-likely-than-not that these deferred tax assets will be realized.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nTax positions are evaluated utilizing a two-step process. The Company first determines whether any of its tax positions are more-likely-than-not\nto be sustained upon examination, based solely on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets this recognition\nthreshold, the position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nF-41\nTable of Contents\nIn connection with the ETFS Acquisition, the Company accrued a liability for uncertain tax positions and interest and penalties at the\nacquisition date. The Company also recorded an offsetting indemnification asset provided by ETFS Capital as part of its agreement to indemnify the\nCompany for any potential claims. The table below sets forth the aggregate changes in the balance of these gross unrecognized tax benefits:\nUnrecognized Interest and\nTotal Tax Benefits Penalties\nBalance at January 1, 2022 $ 21,925 $ 18,218 $ 3,707\nDecrease—Settlements(1) (13,052) (11,865) (1,187)\nDecrease—Lapse of statute of limitations(1) (6,845) (4,825) (2,020)\nIncreases 26 — 26\nForeign currency translation(2) (701) (571) (130)\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ 1,353 $ 957 $ 396\nDecrease—Lapse of statute of limitations (1,353) (957) (396)\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ — $ — $ —\n____________\n(1) In January 2022, an audit of ManJer’s tax returns (a Jersey-based subsidiary) for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018 were\nresolved in favor of ManJer. The settlement, as well as the reduction in unrecognized tax benefits from the lapse of the statute of limitations\ntotaling $19,897 during the year ended December 31, 2022 was recorded as an income tax benefit along with an equal and offsetting amount\nrecorded in other losses and gains, net, to recognize a reduction in the indemnification asset.\n(2) The gross unrecognized tax benefits were accrued in British pounds.\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefits and interest and penalties totaling $1,353 at December 31, 2022 is included in other non-current liabilities\non the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIncome Tax Examinations\nThe Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state, local and certain foreign jurisdictions.\nManJer’s tax returns (a Jersey-based subsidiary) were previously under review for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\nIn January 2022, the audit was resolved in favor of ManJer. In addition, the Company’s tax returns were previously under review by the State of\nMichigan for the years ended 2017 through 2020.

The Company repatriates earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and therefore has recognized a deferred tax liability of $186 and $205 at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n23.

Included under the Company’s share repurchase program are purchases to\noffset future equity grants made under the Company’s equity plans and purchases made in open market or privately negotiated transactions. This\nauthority may be exercised from time to time, subject to regulatory considerations. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend\non a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, market conditions and other corporate liquidity requirements and\npriorities.

(renamed WisdomTree Transfers, Inc.) for an\naggregate purchase price of $985 (net of cash acquired). The acquisition has been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in\naccordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, and resulted in all consideration being allocated to goodwill.\nGoodwill was tested for impairment on November 30, 2023. The quantitative impairment test was performed using a market approach,\nwhereby the market capitalization of the Company (a single reporting unit) was compared to its carrying value. The market capitalization was derived\nfrom the Company’s publicly traded stock price plus a reasonable control premium. The fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value\nand therefore no impairment was recognized.\nOf the total goodwill of $86,841 at December 31, 2023, $85,042 is not deductible for tax purposes as the acquisitions that gave rise to the\ngoodwill were structured as stock acquisitions. The remainder of the goodwill is deductible for U.S. tax purposes.\nIntangible Assets\nThe table below sets forth the Company’s intangible assets which are tested annually for impairment on November 30th:\nBalance at December 31, 2023\nAccumulated\nItem Gross Asset Amortization Net Asset\nETFS acquisition $ 601,247 $ — $ 601,247\nSoftware development 4,519 (684) 3,835\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 605,766 $ (684) $ 605,082\nBalance at December 31, 2022\nAccumulated\nItem Gross Asset Amortization Net Asset\nETFS acquisition $ 601,247 $ — $ 601,247\nSoftware development 2,370 (50) 2,320\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ 603,617 $ (50) $ 603,567\nF-43\nTable of Contents\nETFS Acquisition (Indefinite-Lived)\nIn connection with the ETFS Acquisition, which was completed on April 11, 2018, the Company identified intangible assets valued at $601,247\nrelated to the right to manage AUM through customary advisory agreements. These intangible assets were determined to have indefinite useful lives\nand are not deductible for tax purposes.\nThe Company performed its indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test related to these customary advisory agreements on November 30,\n2023. The results of this analysis identified no indicators of impairment to be recognized based upon a quantitative assessment (discounted cash flow\nanalysis) which relied upon significant unobservable inputs including a projected revenue growth rate of 3% and a weighted average cost of capital of\n10.5%.\nSoftware Development (Finite-Lived)\nInternally-developed software is amortized over a useful life of three years. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company\nrecognized amortization expense on internally-developed software of $634 and $50, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, expected amortization expense for the unamortized finite-lived intangible assets for the next five years and thereafter\nis as follows:\n2024 $ 1,375\n2025 1,440\n2026 873\n2027 130\n2028 17\n2029 and thereafter —\nTotal expected amortization expense $ 3,835\nThe weighted-average remaining useful life of the finite-lived intangible assets is 2.6 years.\n25.

(“WTAM”), a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, whose name is set forth on the signature page of this Agreement (the\n“Employee”). Capitalized terms used and not defined in this Agreement have the respective meanings assigned\nto them in the Company’s 2022 Equity Plan (the “Plan”).\nWHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) or the Compensation Committee of\nthe Board (the “Committee”) has authorized the issuance to the Employee of the aggregate number of shares of\nthe authorized but unissued common stock of the Company, $0.01 par value per share, set forth on Schedule A\nincluded on the signature page of this Agreement (the “Shares”), pursuant and subject to the terms and\nconditions of the Plan and conditioned upon the Employee’s acceptance thereof upon the terms and conditions\nset forth in this Agreement; and\nWHEREAS, the Employee desires to acquire the Shares on the terms and conditions set forth in this\nAgreement and subject to the terms of the Plan.\nIT IS AGREED:\n1. Grant of Shares.\n1.1 The Company has issued to the Employee, effective as of the grant date set forth on\nSchedule A included on the signature page of this Agreement (the “Grant Date”), the Shares on the terms and\nconditions set forth herein and in the Plan. Subject to Section 1.6 hereof, the Shares shall be subject to forfeiture\nin the event the Employee’s employment by WTAM is terminated for any reason prior to the vesting date(s) set\nforth on Schedule A (each, a “Vesting Date”). The period prior to the applicable Vesting Date is considered the\n“Restriction Period” for the Shares relating to such Vesting Date.\n1.2 The Shares shall constitute issued and outstanding shares of common stock for all\ncorporate purposes, and the Employee shall have the right to vote such Shares and to exercise all of the rights,\npowers and privileges of a holder of common stock with respect to such Shares, except that (a) the Employee\nshall not be entitled to delivery of evidence of book-entry or a share certificate until the Shares vest in\naccordance with Section 1.3 or 1.6, as the case may be; and (b) the Company will retain custody of all\ndistributions and dividends made, paid or declared with respect to the Shares during the applicable Restriction\nPeriod (“Retained Distributions”), and such Retained Distributions shall accrue and shall not be paid to the\nEmployee until and only to the extent the Shares with respect to which such Retained Distributions relate vest.\n1.3 If the Employee is still an employee of WTAM at the end of a Restriction Period, all\nthe Shares relating to the applicable Vesting Date shall vest and shall no longer be subject to forfeiture by the\nEmployee. After the date that any Shares become vested, the Company, in its discretion, shall either instruct its\ntransfer agent to issue and deliver to the Employee evidence of book-entry or a certificate for the Shares that\nhave vested or otherwise permit the Shares that have vested to be transferred by the Employee. In addition, after\nthe Shares become vested, the Company shall pay or distribute, as applicable, the Retained Distributions with\nrespect thereto to the Employee. Subject to the provisions of Section 1.6, if, at any time prior to the vesting of\nthe Shares in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 1.3, the Employee’s employment is terminated\nfor any reason, then the Shares that have not then vested (and the Retained Distributions with respect thereto)\nshall be automatically forfeited to the Company and the Employee shall not thereafter have any rights with\nrespect to such Shares (or the Retained Distributions with respect thereto). In such event, the Company is\nauthorized by the Employee to instruct the Company’s transfer agent to cancel and return the Shares (and, if\napplicable, the Retained Distributions with respect thereto, to the extent such Retained Distributions were in the\nform of shares) to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock and to return to the Company\nany Retained Distributions in the form of cash.\n1 The name of the Company was changed to “WisdomTree, Inc.” effective November 7, 2022.\n1.4 “Employment”. The Employee shall be considered to be employed by WTAM for\npurposes hereof if the Employee is a full-time employee of WTAM (or of the Company or any Subsidiary of the\nCompany) or, if the Committee (or the Board in the absence of a decision by the Committee or in over-riding\nthe decision of the Committee) determines in its sole and absolute discretion, the Employee is rendering\nsubstantial services to the Company (or any Subsidiary of the Company, including WTAM) as a part-time\nemployee, consultant or contractor of the Company (or of any Subsidiary of the Company, including WTAM).\nThe Committee (or the Board in the absence of a decision by the Committee or in over-riding the decision of the\nCommittee) shall have the sole and absolute discretion to determine whether the Employee has ceased to be\nemployed by WTAM (or the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company) and the effective date on which such\nemployment terminated. For purposes of this Agreement, if the Employee’s employment is transferred from\nWTAM to the Company or to a Subsidiary of the Company, references herein to WTAM shall be read to be such\nnew employing entity, as applicable.\n1.5 No Right to Employment. Nothing in the Plan or in this Agreement shall confer on\nthe Employee any right to continue in the employ of, or in any other relationship with, WTAM or the Company\n(or with any Subsidiary of the Company) or limit in any way the right of WTAM and the Company (or of any\nSubsidiary of the Company) to terminate the Employee’s employment or other relationship with WTAM or the\nCompany (or with any Subsidiary of the Company) at any time, with or without cause.\n1.6 Accelerated or Continued Vesting in Certain Circumstances.\n1.6.1 Defined Terms. As used in this Section 1.6, the terms “Cause”, “Change of\nControl”, “Disability,” “Good Reason”, and “Involuntary Termination” shall have the definitions given thereto\nin the then effective employment agreement between the Employee and WTAM.\n1.6.2 Upon the Employee’s Death. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections\n1.1 and 1.3, in the event of the Employee’s death prior to the end of a Restriction Period, all the Shares that are\nsubject to forfeiture at the time of death shall immediately vest and shall no longer be subject to forfeiture by\nthe Employee. After the date of the Employee’s death, the Company, in its discretion, shall either instruct its\ntransfer agent to issue and deliver to the legal representative of the estate or the legatee of the Employee under\nthe will of the Employee evidence of book-entry or a certificate for the Shares that have vested, and pay or\ndistribute the Retained Distributions, if any, with respect to such Shares to such legal representative or legatee,\nor otherwise permit the Shares that have vested and Retained Distributions with respect to such Shares to be\ntransferred by the legal representative of the estate or the legatee of the Employee under the will of the\nEmployee.\n2\n1.6.3 Upon Termination of Employment Due to the Occurrence of a Disability.\nNotwithstanding the provisions of Sections 1.1 and 1.3, in the event of the termination by the Company or\nWTAM of the Employee’s employment due to the occurrence of a Disability prior to the end of a Restriction\nPeriod, all the Shares that are subject to forfeiture at the time of termination due to the occurrence of a\nDisability shall immediately vest and shall no longer be subject to forfeiture by the Employee. After the date of\nthe termination of the Employee’s employment due to the occurrence of a Disability, the Company, in its\ndiscretion, shall either instruct its transfer agent to issue and deliver to the Employee evidence of book-entry or\na certificate for the Shares that have vested, and pay or distribute the Retained Distributions, if any, with\nrespect to such Shares, to the Employee or otherwise permit the Shares that have vested and Retained\nDistributions with respect to such Shares to be transferred by the Employee.\n1.6.4 Upon the Employee’s Normal Retirement. Notwithstanding the provisions\nof Sections 1.1 and 1.3, in the event of the Employee’s Normal Retirement (as defined below) prior to the end\nof a Restriction Period, all the Shares that are subject to forfeiture at the time of Normal Retirement shall\nimmediately vest and shall no longer be subject to forfeiture by the Employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\nin the event that the Employee commences work in the asset management or financial services industries\n(other than serving as a non-employee director) after the date of the Employee’s Normal Retirement but prior\nto the end of the Restriction Period, the Employee shall be required to pay to WTAM an amount in cash equal\nto (a) the Fair Market Value of the Shares (as of the date of the Employee’s Normal Retirement) that would\nhave remained subject to forfeiture as of the date of such commencement of work under the original vesting\nschedule set forth on Schedule A, plus (b) the value of the Retained Distributions paid with respect to such\nShares. After the date of the Employee’s Normal Retirement prior to the end of a Restriction Period, the\nCompany, in its discretion, shall either instruct its transfer agent to issue and deliver to the Employee evidence\nof book-entry or a certificate for the Shares that have vested, and pay or distribute the Retained Distributions,\nif any, with respect to such Shares, to the Employee or otherwise permit the Shares that have vested and\nRetained Distributions with respect to such Shares to be transferred by the Employee. For purposes of this\nAgreement, the term “Normal Retirement” means retirement from active employment on or after reaching age\n62 and having been employed by WTAM (or the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company) for at least\nseven (7) years as of the retirement date, provided that the Employee provides WTAM with written notice of\nthe Employee’s intent to retire at least six (6) months in advance of the date of such retirement, which written\nnotice specifies the retirement date. The Committee (or the Board in the absence of a decision by the\nCommittee or in over-riding the decision of the Committee) shall have the sole and absolute discretion to\ndetermine whether a Normal Retirement has occurred and whether the Employee has commenced work in the\nasset management or financial services industries (other than serving as a non-employee director) after the date\nof the Employee’s Normal Retirement and prior to the end of the Restriction Period. For purposes of clarity,\nthe definition of “Normal Retirement” set forth herein shall only apply to this Agreement and shall not impact\nthe Employee’s rights under circumstances of retirement under applicable law in the ordinary course.\n1.6.5 Upon a Change of Control. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 1.1\nand 1.3, in the event of a Change of Control while the Employee is employed by WTAM, the vesting of any\nShares that are unvested at such time shall accelerate and all Shares shall be vested simultaneously with such\nChange of Control.\n1.6.6 Involuntary Termination. In the event of an Involuntary Termination of the\nEmployee’s employment prior to the end of a Restriction Period: (i) all of the Shares (and the Retained\nDistributions with respect thereto), if any, that would have vested during the 12-month period immediately\nfollowing the date of such termination (“Post-Employment Period”) if the Employee’s employment had not\nbeen so terminated shall immediately vest upon the date of such termination; (ii) except as provided in clause\n(iii) below, vesting shall otherwise cease as of the last day of the Employee’s employment, but any Shares (and\nthe Retained Distributions with respect thereto) which have not then vested (after taking into account the\nvesting of Shares pursuant to the preceding clause (i)) shall not be automatically forfeited until the last day of\nthe Post-Employment Period; and (iii) if a Change of Control occurs during the Post-Employment Period, the\nremaining unvested Shares (and the Retained Distributions with respect thereto) shall automatically vest upon\nthe Change of Control as if the Employee had been employed on the date of the Change of Control. For the\navoidance of doubt, if no Change of Control occurs during the Post-Employment Period, then all Shares which\nare not then vested on the last day of the Post-Employment Period (and the Retained Distributions with respect\nthereto) shall be automatically forfeited to the Company and the Employee shall not thereafter have any rights\nwith respect to such Shares (or the Retained Distributions with respect thereto).\n3\n1.6.7 Post-Change of Control Termination. Notwithstanding anything to the\ncontrary in this Agreement, if a Change of Control occurs and the Employee’s employment is terminated either\n(i) by the Company (or its successor) without Cause or (i) by the Employee for Good Reason, in each case\nwithin 18 months after such Change of Control, then (x) all of the Shares (and the Retained Distributions with\nrespect thereto) that would otherwise have vested within the 21-month period following the date of such\ntermination if the Employee’s employment had not been so terminated shall automatically vest upon the date\nof such termination, and (y) vesting shall otherwise cease as of the last day of the Employee’s employment.\n2. Withholding Tax. Not later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includible in the\ngross income of the Employee for Federal income tax purposes with respect to the Shares, the Employee shall\npay to WTAM, or make arrangements satisfactory to WTAM regarding the payment of, any Federal, state and\nlocal taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld or paid with respect to such amount. Notwithstanding\nanything in this Agreement to the contrary, the obligations of the Company under the Plan and pursuant to this\nAgreement shall be conditional upon such payment or arrangements with WTAM, and WTAM shall, to the\nextent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to\nthe Employee from WTAM. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee (or the Board in the absence of a\ndecision by the Committee or in over-riding the decision of the Committee), WTAM’s tax withholding\nobligation shall be satisfied, in whole or in part, by the Company withholding from the Shares to be issued or\nreleased by the transfer agent a number of shares with an aggregate Fair Market Value (as of the date the\nwithholding is effected) that would satisfy the withholding amount due; provided, however, that the amount\nwithheld does not exceed the maximum statutory tax rate or such lesser amount as is necessary to avoid liability\naccounting treatment. The Employee is advised to consult with the Employee’s counsel or tax advisor about the\nEmployee’s tax status and tax treatment of the Shares granted under the Plan pursuant to this Agreement.\nNeither the Company nor any Subsidiary may be held liable for the personal tax treatment of any Employee\nunder this Agreement or the Plan.\n3. Nonassignability of Shares. The Shares shall not be assignable or transferable until they have\nvested. Upon vesting, the Employee will have the right to sell or transfer the Shares, subject to the provisions of\nthe Company’s insider trading policy.\n4. Employee Representations. The Employee hereby represents and warrants to the Company that:\n(i) the Employee has received a copy of the Plan and the prospectus filed\npursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement;\n(ii) the Employee has received a copy of all reports and documents required to be\nfiled by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, within the last twenty-four (24) months and all reports issued by the Company to its\nstockholders;\n4\n(iii) the Employee (x) has reviewed with the Employee’s own tax advisors the\napplicable tax (U.S. federal, state, local and foreign) consequences of the transactions contemplated by this\nAgreement, (y) is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company\nor WTAM or any of their respective agents, and (z) understands that the Employee (and not the Company or its\nSubsidiaries) shall be responsible for any tax liability that may arise as a result of the transactions contemplated\nby this Agreement;\n(iv) the Employee understands that the Employee must bear the economic risk of\nthe investment in the Shares;\n(v) the Employee has had such an opportunity as the Employee has deemed\nadequate to obtain from the Company such information as is necessary to permit the Employee to evaluate the\nmerits and risks of the Employee’s investment in the Company and has had the opportunity to consult with the\nEmployee’s own advisers with respect to the investment in the Company; and\n(vi) the Employee understands and agrees that if a stock certificate evidencing\nthe Shares is issued prior to the Vesting Date, it shall also bear the following legend:\n“The shares represented by this certificate have been acquired pursuant to a\nRestricted Stock Agreement, a copy of which is on file with the Company, and may\nnot be transferred, pledged or disposed of except in accordance with the terms and\nconditions thereof and the terms and conditions of the WisdomTree Investments, Inc.\n2022 Equity Plan.”\n5.

(formerly known as WisdomTree Investments, Inc.), a Delaware corporation (the\n“Company”), has adopted this Amended and Restated Compensation Clawback Policy (this “Policy”) as of the\ndate set forth above. This Policy supersedes and replaces the Company’s Compensation Clawback Policy\nadopted as of March 12, 2022, with respect to Incentive-Based Compensation received after the Effective Date.\nCapitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in Section\n3 below.\n1. Overview\nThe Policy sets forth the circumstances and procedures under which the Company shall recover Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation from (i) Covered Persons in accordance with rules issued by the United States\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n“Exchange Act”), and the New York Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) and (ii) Participating Employees.\n2. Compensation Recovery Requirement\nIn the event the Company is required to prepare a Financial Restatement, the Company shall recover reasonably\npromptly all Erroneously Awarded Compensation with respect to such Financial Restatement.\n3. Definitions\na. “Applicable Recovery Period” means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the\nRestatement Date for a Financial Restatement. In the event the Company has changed its fiscal\nyear: (i) any transition period of less than nine months occurring within or immediately following\nsuch three completed fiscal years shall also be part of such Applicable Recovery Period and (ii)\nany transition period of nine to 12 months will be deemed to be a completed fiscal year.\nb. “Applicable Rules” means any rules or regulations adopted by the Exchange pursuant to Rule\n10D-1 under the Exchange Act and any applicable rules or regulations adopted by the SEC\npursuant to Section 10D of the Exchange Act.\nc. “Board” means the Board of Directors of the Company.\nd. “Committee” means the Compensation Committee of the Board or, in the absence of such\ncommittee, a majority of independent directors serving on the Board.\ne. “Covered Person” means any Executive Officer. A person’s status as a Covered Person with\nrespect to Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall be determined as of the time of receipt of\nsuch Erroneously Awarded Compensation regardless of the person’s current role or status with the\nCompany (e.g., if a person began service as an Executive Officer after the beginning of an\nApplicable Recovery Period, that person would not be considered a Covered Person with respect\nto Erroneously Awarded Compensation received before the person began service as an Executive\nOfficer, but would be considered a Covered Person with respect to Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation received after the person began service as an Executive Officer where such person\nserved as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for such Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation).\nf. “Effective Date” means October 2, 2023.\ng. “Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means the amount of any Incentive-Based Compensation\nreceived by a Covered Person on or after the Effective Date and during the Applicable Recovery\nPeriod that exceeds the amount that otherwise would have been received by the Covered Person\nhad such compensation been determined based on the restated amounts in a Financial Restatement,\ncomputed without regard to any taxes paid. Calculation of Erroneously Awarded Compensation\nwith respect to Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return,\nwhere the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical\nrecalculation directly from the information in a Financial Restatement, shall be based on a\nreasonable estimate of the effect of the Financial Restatement on the stock price or total\nshareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was based, and the Company\nshall maintain documentation of the determination of such reasonable estimate and provide such\ndocumentation to the Exchange in accordance with the Applicable Rules. Incentive-Based\nCompensation is deemed received in the fiscal period when the Financial Reporting Measure is\nattained, not when the actual payment, grant, or vesting occurs.\nh. “Executive Officer” means any person who served the Company in any of the following roles at\nany time during the performance period applicable to Incentive-Based Compensation and received\nIncentive-Based Compensation after beginning service in any such role (regardless of whether\nsuch Incentive-Based Compensation was received during or after such person’s service in such\nrole): the president; principal financial officer; principal accounting officer (or if there is no such\naccounting officer, the controller); any vice president in charge of a principal business unit,\ndivision, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance); any other officer who performs a\npolicy making function; or any other person who performs similar policy making functions for the\nCompany. Officers of subsidiaries of the Company may be deemed Executive Officers if they\nperform such policy making functions for the Company.\ni. “Financial Reporting Measures” mean measures that are determined and presented in accordance\nwith the accounting principles used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, any\nmeasures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures (including, for example, a non-\nGAAP financial measure), and stock price and total shareholder return.\n2\nj. “Financial Restatement” means a restatement of previously issued financial statements of the\nCompany due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting\nrequirement under the securities laws, including any required restatement to correct an error in\npreviously-issued financial statements that is material to the previously-issued financial statements\nor that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or\nleft uncorrected in the current period.\nk. “Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation provided, directly or indirectly, by the\nCompany or any of its subsidiaries that is granted, earned or vested based, in whole or in part,\nupon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure and any other equity-based compensation\nprovided by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, including, without limitation, stock options,\nrestricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights, regardless of whether\nsuch equity-based compensation is granted, earned, or vested based, in whole or in part, upon the\nattainment of a Financial Reporting Measure.\nl. “Restatement Date” means, with respect to a Financial Restatement, the earlier to occur of: (i) the\ndate the Board concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to\nprepare the Financial Restatement or (ii) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized\nbody directs the Company to prepare the Financial Restatement.\n4. Exception to Compensation Recovery Requirement\nThe Company may elect not to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation pursuant to this Policy if the\nCommittee determines that recovery would be impracticable, and one or more of the following conditions,\ntogether with any further requirements set forth in the Applicable Rules, are met: (i) the direct expense paid to\nthird parties including outside legal counsel, to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be\nrecovered, and the Company has made a reasonable attempt to recover such Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation; or (ii) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan to fail to be so\nqualified under applicable regulations.\n3\n5. Recovery from Participating Employees\nIn addition to (and without limiting) the provisions of paragraph 2 above, in the event the Company is required\nto prepare a Financial Restatement after the Effective Date, the Company will use reasonable efforts to recover\nfrom any current or former employee of the Company who is not a Covered Person but received Incentive-\nBased Compensation from the Company during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date\non which the Board concludes that the Company is required to prepare a Financial Restatement (each a\n“Participating Employee”), the amount that exceeds what would have been paid to the Participating Employee\nunder the Financial Restatement; provided that, this paragraph 5 will apply only to the extent the Board (or a\nduly established committee thereof), in its sole discretion, determines that the Participating Employee\ncommitted any act or omission that materially contributed to the circumstances requiring the Financial\nRestatement and which involved any of the following: (i) misconduct, wrongdoing, or a violation of any of the\nCompany’s rules or of any applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the course of the Participating\nEmployee’s employment by, or service with, the Company; or (ii) a breach of a fiduciary duty to the Company\nor its stockholders by the Participating Employee.\n6. Recovery for Intentional Misconduct\nIn addition to (and without limiting) the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 5 above, in the event that the Company\nis required to prepare a Financial Restatement after the Effective Date and the Board (or a duly established\ncommittee thereof), in its sole discretion, determines that a Covered Person’s or a Participating Employee’s act\nor omission contributed to the circumstances requiring the Financial Restatement and such act or omission\ninvolved any of the following: (i) willful, knowing, or intentional misconduct or a willful, knowing, or\nintentional violation of any of the Company’s rules or any applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the\ncourse of the Covered Person’s or the Participating Employee’s employment by, or service with, the Company;\nor (ii) fraud in the course of the Covered Person’s or the Participating Employee’s employment by, or service\nwith, the Company, then in each such case, the Company will use reasonable efforts to recover from such\nCovered Person or Participating Employee, up to 100% (as determined by the Board or a duly established\ncommittee thereof in its sole discretion) of the Incentive-Based Compensation received by such Covered Person\nor Participating Employee from the Company during the three fiscal years immediately preceding the date on\nwhich the Board concludes that the Company is required to prepare such Financial Restatement, and not just the\namount that is in excess of what would have been paid to the Covered Person or the Participating Employee had\nsuch compensation been determined based on the restated amounts in such Financial Restatement.\n7. Tax Considerations\nTo the extent that, pursuant to this Policy, the Company is entitled to recover any compensation, the gross\namount of the recoverable compensation received (i.e., the amount the Covered Person or Participating\nEmployee received, or was entitled to receive, before any deductions for tax withholding or other payments)\nshall be returned by the Covered Person or Participating Employee, as applicable.\n4\n8. Method of Compensation Recovery\nThe Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recovering Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation or other compensation recoverable hereunder, which may include, without limitation, any one or\nmore of the following:\na. requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive-Based Compensation previously paid;\nb. seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or\nother disposition of any equity-based awards;\nc. cancelling or rescinding some or all outstanding vested or unvested equity-based awards;\nd. adjusting or withholding from unpaid compensation or other offset;\ne. cancelling or offsetting against planned future grants of equity-based awards; and/or\nf. any other method permitted by applicable law or contract.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, a Covered Person or Participating Employee will be deemed to have satisfied\nsuch person’s obligation to return Erroneously Awarded Compensation or other recoverable compensation to the\nCompany if such compensation is returned in the exact same form in which it was received; provided that\nequity withheld to satisfy tax obligations will be deemed to have been received in cash in an amount equal to\nthe tax withholding payment made.\n9. Policy Interpretation\nThis Policy shall be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the Applicable Rules and any other\napplicable law. The Committee shall take into consideration any applicable interpretations and guidance of the\nSEC in interpreting this Policy, including, for example, in determining whether a financial restatement qualifies\nas a Financial Restatement hereunder. To the extent the Applicable Rules require recovery of Incentive-Based\nCompensation in additional circumstances besides those specified above, nothing in this Policy shall be deemed\nto limit or restrict the right or obligation of the Company to recover Incentive-Based Compensation to the fullest\nextent required by the Applicable Rules.\n10. Policy Administration\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Committee; provided, however, that the Board shall have exclusive\nauthority to authorize the Company to prepare a Financial Restatement. In doing so, the Board may rely on a\nrecommendation of the Audit Committee of the Board. Except for such authority reserved for the Board, the\nCommittee shall have such powers and authorities related to the administration of this Policy as are consistent\nwith the governing documents of the Company and applicable law. The Committee shall have full power and\nauthority to take, or direct the taking of, all actions and to make all determinations required or provided for\nunder this Policy and shall have full power and authority to take, or direct the taking of, all such other actions\nand make all such other determinations not inconsistent with the specific terms and provisions of this Policy\nthat the Committee deems to be necessary or appropriate to the administration of this Policy. The interpretation\nand construction by the Committee of any provision of this Policy and all determinations made by the\nCommittee under this Policy shall be final, binding, and conclusive.\n5\n11. Compensation Recovery Repayments not Subject to Indemnification\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any agreement with, or the organizational documents of,\nthe Company or any of its subsidiaries, Covered Persons and Participating Employees are not entitled to\nindemnification for Erroneously Awarded Compensation or other recoverable compensation or for any losses\narising out of or in any way related to Erroneously Awarded Compensation or other recoverable compensation\nrecovered under this Policy.\n6"
