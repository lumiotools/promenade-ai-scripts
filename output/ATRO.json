Adjusted\nEBITDA was $27.1\nmillion for the quarter\nand $91 million for\nAstronics Segment Sales and Bookings (Graphic: Business Wire) the trailing twelve\nmonths. Operating\nmargins improved from both volume and the initiatives we have executed to drive\nprofitability. Our Aerospace segment adjusted operating margin was 14.2%. We are clearly\nmaking progress towards our operational goals, though our results include the impact of\nexpenses related to our July refinancing, a customer bankruptcy and a warranty reserve. All\nin all, we feel it was another quarter of progress as we continue to recover from the\ndisruption of the past few years.”\n1 Adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted segment operating\nprofit, adjusted segment operating margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted\nearnings per share (“EPS”) are Non-GAAP Performance Measures.

Aerospace sales increased $35.5\nmillion and Test Systems sales increased $5.3 million.\nGross profit increased $22.1 million to $42.7 million, or 21.0% of sales. Adjusted gross\nprofit1 for the 2024 third quarter was $47.2 million, or 23.2% of sales. Third quarter gross\nprofit was negatively impacted by a $3.5 million atypical warranty reserve related to a new\nproduct launch that requires a field modification, and a $0.9 million inventory reserve related\nto a bankruptcy filing for an Aerospace customer. The comparator quarter of 2023 included a\n$3.6 million write-down of inventory related to a separate customer bankruptcy.\nThird quarter 2024 selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) included $1.3\nmillion in reserves for outstanding receivables and fixed asset impairment related to the\nbankruptcy filing of an Aerospace customer compared to a separate bankruptcy reserve of\n$7.5 million against outstanding receivables in the prior year.\nDespite the unusual impacts to gross profit and operating income, consolidated operating\nincome increased $22.9 million to $8.4 million, or 4.1% of sales, compared with operating\nloss of $14.5 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted operating income1 for the 2024 third\nquarter was $19.6 million, or 9.6% of sales.\nImproved operating income reflects the operating leverage gained on higher sales volume,\npartially offset by $4.5 million for resumed incentive programs, an increase of $1.9 million in\nlitigation-related legal expenses and reserve adjustments in 2024 and a $3.2 million increase\nin non-bankruptcy related inventory reserves.\nThird quarter 2024 expenses included a $3.2 million call premium on the previous term loan\nand the write-off of $3.8 million of associated deferred financing costs. The $7.0 million total\nhas been reflected as Loss on Extinguishment of Debt.\nTax expense in the quarter was $6.6 million, primarily due to a valuation allowance applied\nagainst the deferred tax asset associated with research and development costs that are\nrequired to be capitalized for tax purposes.\nConsolidated net loss was $11.7 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, measurably improved\ncompared with the net loss of $17.0 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, in the prior year.\nAdjusted net income1 for the 2024 third quarter was $12.2 million, or $0.35 per diluted share.\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA1 increased to $27.1 million, or 13.3% of consolidated sales,\ncompared with adjusted EBITDA1 of $8.8 million, or 5.4% of consolidated sales, in the prior-\nyear period primarily as a result of increased profitability from higher sales.\nBookings were $189.2 million in the quarter resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.93:1. For the\ntrailing twelve months, bookings totaled $795.5 million and the book-to-bill ratio was 1.02:1.\nAerospace Segment Review (refer to sales by market and segment data in accompanying\ntables)\nAerospace Third Quarter 2024 Results (compared with the prior-year period, unless noted\notherwise)\nAerospace segment sales increased $35.5 million, or 24.9%, to $177.6 million. The\nimprovement was driven by a 31.6% increase, or $32.1 million, in Commercial Transport\nsales. Sales to this market were $133.9 million, or 65.8% of consolidated sales in the\nquarter, compared with $101.7 million, or 62.5% of consolidated sales in the third quarter of\n2023. Growth was primarily related to increased demand by airlines for inflight entertainment\n& connectivity (“IFEC”) products which are in Electrical Power & Motion and Avionics product\ngroups.\nMilitary Aircraft sales increased $5.0 million, or 30.0%, to $21.7 million, driven by progress\non the FLRAA program. General Aviation sales increased $1.9 million, or 11.6%, to $18.1\nmillion due to higher VVIP sales. Other sales decreased $3.6 million as the Company is\nwinding down its non-core contract manufacturing arrangements.\nAerospace segment operating profit of $14.3 million was up $21.7 million compared with\noperating loss of $7.5 million in the same period last year. Operating margin was 8.0%.\nAdjusted Aerospace operating profit1 was $25.3 million, an increase of $20.3 million, or over\nfive times the prior-year period. Adjusted Aerospace operating margin1 expanded 10.7\npoints to 14.2% reflecting the leverage gained on higher volume and improving production\nefficiencies.\nThe segment’s operating profit in the third quarter of 2024 was impacted by $3.5 million in\nwarranty expense related to the previously-mentioned field modification, $5.1 million in\nlitigation-related legal expenses and reserve adjustments related to an ongoing patent\ndispute, $3.9 million in inventory reserves, $3.2 million in compensation expense related to\nthe resumption of the Company’s incentive programs, and a non-cash reserve associated\nwith a customer bankruptcy of $2.2 million.\nAerospace bookings were $173.6 million for a book-to-bill ratio of 0.98:1. Backlog for the\nAerospace segment was $543.6 million at quarter end and excludes $9.3 million of backlog\nthat was associated with the customer bankruptcy referred to previously.\nMr. Gundermann commented, “Our Aerospace business had a strong quarter, with sales up\n24.9% over the comparator quarter and adjusted operating income1 achieving our targeted\nmid-teens level of 14.2%. We achieved this despite the Boeing strike, which hurt revenue in\nthe quarter by about $2 million, with bookings impacted by approximately $7 million to $8\nmillion. Given the measurably improved profitability, we are pleased with our Aerospace\nperformance during the quarter.”\nTest Systems Segment Review (refer to sales by market and segment data in\naccompanying tables)\nTest Systems Third Quarter 2024 Results (compared with the prior-year period, unless\nnoted otherwise)\nTest Systems segment sales were $26.1 million, up $5.3 million. The improvement was\ndriven by the U.S. Marine Corps’ Handheld Radio Test Sets (“HHRTS”) and the U.S. Army’s\nTS-4549/T programs, which contributed $5.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively, in sales\nduring the quarter.\nTest Systems segment operating loss was near break-even, compared with operating loss of\n$1.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. The improvement was the result of lower litigation-\nrelated legal expenses, partially offset by additional compensation expense from the\nresumption of the Company’s incentive programs. Test Systems continues to be negatively\naffected by mix and under absorption of fixed costs at current volume levels.\nAdditional restructuring initiatives were implemented in the 2024 fourth quarter. In October\n2024, the Company offered a voluntary separation program which is currently expected to\nprovide annualized savings of approximately $2 million, beginning in the first quarter of 2025.\nThe Company expects to record severance expense of approximately $1 million in the fourth\nquarter of 2024 related to this initiative.\nBookings for the Test Systems segment in the quarter were $15.6 million. The book-to-bill\nratio was 0.60:1 for the quarter. Backlog for the Test Systems segment was $68.2 million at\nquarter end.\nMr. Gundermann commented, “Our Test business had some success in the third quarter,\nwith revenue up 25.6%. The business has initiated further restructuring to focus on the most\ncritical initiatives going forward, including the radio test program for the U.S. Army, which is\nnow expected to enter volume production in the second half of 2025.”\nLiquidity and Financing\nCash provided by operations in the third quarter of 2024 was $8.5 million, primarily the result\nof increased net income, after adjusted for non-cash expenses.\nCapital expenditures in the quarter were $1.9 million and $5.2 million year-to-date. Net debt\nwas $174.6 million, up from $161.2 million at December 31, 2023.\nOn July 11, 2024, the Company announced it had amended and expanded its revolving line\nof credit and refinanced its term loan. The refinancing provided improved liquidity, lower cash\ncosts, and greater financial flexibility for the Company. The refinancing was comprised of an\nexpanded asset-based line of credit and a reduced, lower-cost term loan. Both mature in\nJuly 2027.\nLegal Proceedings\nSince 2010, the Company has been defending itself in a long-running series of patent\ninfringement cases brought by a single plaintiff. Cases were filed in the United States,\nFrance, Germany, and the United Kingdom (UK).\nThe United States case was resolved in 2017, when the court found that the patent was not\nnovel and was therefore invalid.\nThe French case similarly found that the subject patent was invalid, though the plaintiff is\nseeking to appeal that decision.\nThe German court dismissed some claims of the patent but upheld others and found that\nAstronics had been infringing. The Company has paid $3.5 million in penalties and interest\nto date and has taken a reserve of $17.3 million to cover estimated damages and associated\ninterest. Damages proceedings in this case are likely to conclude in 2026.\nUnlike in the US, French, and German proceedings, the UK court fully upheld the subject\npatent and found that the Company was infringing. A damages hearing was conducted in\nOctober 2024 and a ruling is expected later this year or early in 2025. Astronics reserved\n$7.4 million to cover anticipated damages, but the plaintiff is seeking damages of up to\napproximately $105 million, excluding interest. Based on UK legal practices, the Company\nexpects that some amount of damages may be due in early 2025. The Company is engaged\nwith its lenders to seek to arrange financing to cover the wide range of possible outcomes\nand satisfy any potential damages award as required.\nThe Company believes that permission will be granted to either or both of the parties to\nappeal the judgement to a higher court subsequently.\nAll patents related to the infringement cases have expired years ago and the lawsuits do not\nrestrict the Company’s current business activities.\n2024 Outlook\nThe Company expects fourth quarter sales of $190 million to $210 million and is adjusting its\n2024 revenue guidance to $777 million to $797 million. The midpoint of this range would be\na 14.2% increase over 2023 sales. Astronics considered the broad range of factors affecting\nthe business, including the work stoppage at Boeing, in issuing its guidance.\nBacklog at the end of the third quarter was $611.9 million. Planned capital expenditures in\n2024 are expected to be in the range of $9 million to $11 million.\nMr. Gundermann commented, “We are closing in on another year of strong double-digit\ngrowth. Assuming we attain the mid-point of the range for 2024, we will have averaged 21%\ngrowth over each of the last three years. Our profitability has benefited from the growth and\nthe many improvement initiatives we have implemented over the last several years, and we\nbelieve 2025 will see a continuation of these trends.”\nThird Quarter 2024 Webcast and Conference Call\nThe Company will host a teleconference today at 4:45 p.m. ET.

Nevertheless, the\nCompany believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted Operating\nIncome and Adjusted Operating Margin, are important for investors and other readers of the\nCompany’s financial statements and assists in understanding the comparison of the current\nquarter’s and current year's income from operations to the historical periods' income from\noperations and operating margin, as well as facilitates a more meaningful comparison of the\nCompany’s income from operations and operating margin to that of other companies.\nASTRONICS CORPORATION\nRECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE\nTO ADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE\n(Unaudited, $ in thousands, except per share amounts)\nConsolidated\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n9/28/2024 9/30/2023 9/28/2024 9/30/2023\nNet loss $ (11,738) $ (16,983) $ (13,383) $ (33,397)\nAdd back (deduct):\nAmortization of intangibles 3,188 3,381 9,728 10,577\nRestructuring-related charges including severance 259 — 1,033 564\nLegal reserve, settlements and recoveries (332) (1,227) (332) (2,532)\nLitigation-related legal expenses 5,558 4,574 13,680 14,024\nEquity investment accrued payable write-off — — — (1,800)\nNet gain on sale of business — — — (3,427)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt 6,987 — 6,987 —\nNon-cash reserves for customer bankruptcy 2,203 11,074 2,203 11,074\nWarranty reserve 3,527 — 3,527 —\nDeferred liability recovery — — — (5,824)\nNormalize tax rate1 2,511 (3,081) (2,156) 6,849\n$ 12,163 $ (2,262) $ 21,287 $ (3,892)\nAdjusted net income (loss)\n35,011 33,000 34,961 32,707\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding (in thousands)\nDiluted loss per share $ (0.34) $ (0.51) $ (0.38) $ (1.02)\nAdjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share $ 0.35 $ (0.07) $ 0.61 $ (0.12)\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS are defined as net income and diluted EPS\nas reported, adjusted for certain items, including amortization of intangibles, and also\nadjusted for a normalized tax rate.

At this time,\nall participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a\nreminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Craig Mychajluk, Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.\nCraig Mychajluk\nInvestor Relations\nThank you. And good afternoon, everyone. We certainly appreciate your time today and your interest in Astronics.\nJoining me on the call are Pete Gundermann, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dave Burney, our Chief Financial\nOfficer; and Nancy Hedges, our Corporate Controller.\nYou should have a copy of our third quarter 2024 financial results, which crossed the wires after the market's\nclose today. If you do not have the release, you can find it on our website at astronics.com.\nAs you are aware, we may make forward-looking statements during the formal discussion and the Q&A session of\nthis conference call. These statements apply to future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties as well as\nother factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from what is stated here today. These risks and\nuncertainties and other factors are provided in the earnings release as well as with other documents filed with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. You can find these documents on our website or at sec.gov.\nDuring today's call, we'll also discuss some non-GAAP measures. We believe these will be useful in evaluating our\nperformance. You should not consider the presentation of this additional information in isolation or as a\nsubstitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. We have provided reconciliations of non-GAAP measures\nwith comparable GAAP measures in the tables that accompany today's release.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Pete to begin.\nPeter J. Gundermann\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Astronics Corp.\nThank you, Craig. And good afternoon, everybody. I would like to begin this call by saying a few words about a\ncouple of people here in the room with me. Dave Burney will be retiring as our CFO early in 2025 after a tenure of\n29 years with the company. 22 years ago, he and I took over the C-suite at about the same time, and revenues for\nour company at that time were about $33 million, and this year, we expect to again be in the $800 million range.\nSo, it has been quite a ride over these 29 years with Dave, but he's been a tireless leader within our company and\na trusted friend and partner for me and he will be missed. Although I do have his cellphone number and I know\nwhere he lives, if needed, we'll pull him back in.\nAlso with me is Nancy Hedges. She is a new name probably for most of the people on this call, but she will be\nsucceeding Dave as our CFO in January. Nancy has been on for a while. She joined in 2014 as Controller & Principal\nAccounting Officer of our company, and over the time since, has established herself internally as a leader and top-\nPage 3 of 12\nAstronics Corporation\nThird Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call\nNovember 6, 2024\ntier performer on our team. She's very familiar with our personnel, our operations and the improvement\ninitiatives we seek, and I'm confident the investor community will get to know her and appreciate her talents as\ntime goes on. I'm very confident she will do a very good job as CFO going forward. We'll hear from both Dave and\nNancy in just a few minutes.\nI want to move to a couple of comments on the top line trends that are affecting our company. Nothing really new\nhere, but we felt operationally that the third quarter was a very good quarter for Astronics. Sales were strong, up\n25% year-over-year and in the high end of our forecasted range, once again. Adjusted net income was $12.2\nmillion or $0.35 a share. Adjusted EBITDA was $27 million, 13% of sales, and our trailing 12-month adjusted\nEBITDA is $91 million.\nOur Aerospace segment gets a lot of the credit for the improvement. Sales for our Aerospace segment again were\nup 25% for the quarter and 19% for the year, and adjusted operating margin was 14.2% in the quarter, up from\n3.5% in the period a year ago. We continue to recover with volume and margin improvement initiatives, and\nthey're starting to show up strongly on the bottom line. We have more progress ahead but we continue to make\nprogress.\nThere are macro tailwinds, which have been helping us over recent quarters and continue to help us. I'm not going\nto go into any of these in too much detail, but it's worth reminding ourselves kind of where we've been and where\nwe're going. And the first and probably the most important thing is that our supply chain continues to improve\nand perform. We do regular reviews of our business units, and not too long ago, every problem was attributed\none way or another to the supply chain. Today, those comments are fewer and farther between, but there are still\nissues and there always will be. But in general, the supply chain continues to improve and enables our improved\nperformance.\nSimilarly, input cost pressures continue to subside. The inflation that we experienced over the last year and a half\nhas gotten much quieter. Our workforce continues to improve and get more efficient. Some of you might\nremember, on the last call, I mentioned that we had something like 45% of our 3,000 employees have been with\nus for three years or less. That kind of turnover, which again was attributable to the pandemic, is really hard to\noperate in. As time goes on and people get more familiar with what they're doing and how to work with each\nother, our efficiency improves.\nSimilarly, pricing adjustments, which we negotiated through that period of inflation, are now coming more and\nmore into effect. Some of our major programs are beginning to take on new pricing structures, which will be a\ncontributor as we move forward through 2025.\nFinally, demand continues to be pretty strong. We are entering the fourth quarter with a backlog of $612 million. If\nyou look back to 2018 or 2019, when we were last at an $800 million run rate, our backlog was much lower, like in\nthe $400 million to $420 million range. We're entering the fourth quarter at $612 million. That sets us up, we think,\nfor continued results and continued improvement on the top line, as we move forward.\nThe press release talks a lot about adjusted measures. I thought it would be worth spending just a minute talking\nabout some of the major adjustments in our third quarter. There were a few of them. We did a refinance in July,\nand as part of that refinance, we had to expense about $7 million of assets related to the old credit facility that are\nPage 4 of 12\nAstronics Corporation\nThird Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call\nNovember 6, 2024\nno longer applicable on our financial statements. We also had legal expenses during the quarter of $5.6 million\nthat was ramping up to a hearing that happened in the UK that I will talk about again later in the call.\nAnd finally, one of our eVTOL customers, Lilium, filed for bankruptcy just a couple of weeks ago, and we took a\ntotal of about $2.2 million in charges related to that. I wanted to comment that we are involved with a number of\neVTOL customers, but we were more heavily involved with Lilium than we are with the others. So for people who\nare concerned about whether this is the first shoe of many shoes to drop in this segment, I would tell you, I don't\nthink that's the case.\nWhat we have done with most customers is developed a kind of a standard architecture, off-the-shelf products\nthat can be relatively easily integrated into their aircraft without a high degree of customization. So I don't feel we\nhave the same level of exposure, though we are working with a pretty wide range of eVTOL aircraft that are being\ndeveloped currently.\nFinally, we had a rare warranty reserve of $3.5 million. This was related to an electrical power system for a\nbusiness jet aircraft that was experiencing less than desirable reliability over time. It's something that we\nintroduced a few years ago, and it's supposed to perform better and longer than it has been. So we need to take\nsome actions to fix that. That's part of being a supplier with integrity and living up to our promises to our\ncustomers. So it's kind of a long list and it's high dollars. We also broke out a lot of our tables in our press release,\nmore than we usually do, to help everybody understand where the expenses were fitting in and what the\nadjustments were and how the company was performing absent those adjustments.\nThat said, I'm going to turn it over to Dave, who's going to talk about our consolidated results and then we'll go to\nNancy to talk more a little bit about segment results.\nDavid C. Burney\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Astronics Corp.\nAll right. Thanks, Pete. As Pete mentioned, there's quite a bit of noise in the quarter, so we presented some tables\nto help show where on the income statement the impacts of these items are reflected and to highlight the\nperformance of the underlying business.\nI'll review the operational results on a consolidated basis, and I'll pass it over to Nancy to review the segment\nresults. With higher sales volume, our operating leverage was demonstrated with stronger gross profit and\nmargins. The GAAP gross margins improved to 21%, up 8.3 points over the prior year. On an adjusted basis, gross\nmargin improved to 23%.\nImpacting reported results was a $3.5 million for warranty reserve for a product that's been in the field for several\nyears that requires modification. We also recorded an inventory reserve of $900,000 in the quarter related to the\nLilium bankruptcy filing. I should point out that last year's third quarter also had an inventory reserve of $3.6\nmillion also relating to the bankruptcy of a contract manufacturing customer. We adjusted both periods\naccordingly in the non-GAAP comparison.\nPage 5 of 12\nAstronics Corporation\nThird Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call\nNovember 6, 2024\nSG&A expense was also impacted by the bankruptcy in the amount of $1.3 million with $800,000 in outstanding\nreceivables being reserved for and $500,000 in fixed asset impairment for equipment relating specifically to\nLilium. Adjusting for the impacts of the warranty reserve, the bankruptcy and the other unusual items that are\nhighlighted in the tables provided in the release, adjusted operating margin for the third quarter was about 9.6%\ncompared with an adjusted operating margin in the prior-year third quarter of 0%. Below the operating line was\nthe $7 million in costs relating to the extinguishment of our previous term loan that we had discussed last quarter.\nOur GAAP loss per share for the quarter was $0.34. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.35 for the third quarter\nthis year and compares to a GAAP loss per share in last year's third quarter of $0.51 and an adjusted loss per\nshare in last year's quarter of $0.07.\nIn the third quarter, we generated $8 million in cash from operations. We expected better, but between the\nBoeing strike and two IFE-related programs that were moved to the right by a few quarters, our inventory remains\nabove where we would like it to be. The improved cash flow was driven primarily by improvement of our net loss,\nwhich was $11.7 million, adjusted for $23.8 million of noncash expenses and lower increase in our net operating\nassets. And you can see this on the cash flow statement.\nOur net debt at the end of the quarter was about $174 million, about even with our second quarter. Thus far in\nthe fourth quarter, we had strong cash flow with our net debt today down to about $168 million and roughly $60\nmillion available to draw on our revolver.\nWith that, I'll turn it to Nancy to review the segments.\nNancy L. Hedges\nCorporate Controller & Principal Accounting Officer, Astronics Corp.\nThanks, Dave. As you have the results available in the press release, I'll just help pull out the major drivers of\nprofitability for each of the segments. Starting with Aerospace, which represented about 88% of the business, the\nnearly $22 million improvement in operating income was driven primarily by higher sales volume and improved\nproductivity. The comparator period was more heavily impacted by a customer bankruptcy, making the year-over-\nyear comparisons challenging on a GAAP basis. That's why we decided to include adjusted operating profit by\nsegment to clearly delineate the noise of the two quarters.\nAdjusted operating profit was $25.3 million in the quarter compared with $5 million in the prior-year period.\nAdjusted operating margin improved 10.7 points on the same impacts of higher volume and improve productivity,\nas well as the benefit of higher pricing that's rolling through now. Litigation expenses were more elevated in both\nthe quarter and year-to-date periods as we've been in court more this year, especially as it relates to the UK, which\nPete will discuss in more detail.\nTurning to the Test segment. The Test business was near breakeven in the quarter, primarily the result of lower\nlegal fees compared with the prior period. We're seeing positive results from our rightsizing efforts, but we were\naffected by less favorable sales mix in the quarter as well as under-absorption of fixed costs at our current\nvolumes.\nPage 6 of 12\nAstronics Corporation\nThird Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call\nNovember 6, 2024\nWe also presented non-GAAP adjustments for the segment that shows a significant decline in litigation-related\nexpenses that were associated with the Teradyne lawsuit, as there were no major developments in the quarter\nassociated with that matter.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Pete.\nPeter J. Gundermann\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Astronics Corp.\nThank you, Nancy. Moving to this legal situation that we have in the UK. By way of background, we've been in a\nlengthy patent infringement suit brought by a European plaintiff relative to our in-seat power product line.\nHearings have been going on since 2010 and they have moved around in the USA, France, Germany and the UK.\nIn the USA and France, the subject patent was found to be invalid, though the French decision is being appealed.\nGermany dismissed some of the claims of the patent, but upheld others and found that Astronics had been\ninfringing. The company paid $3.5 million in penalties and interest in 2020 and has taken a reserve of $17.3 million\nto cover remaining estimated damages and associated interest. We expect proceedings may commence on the\nGerman matter in 2026.\nThe UK court, however, maintained the entire patent and found Astronics to be infringing. A damages hearing was\nheld last month in October, and a ruling is expected in December or January. We have reserved $7.4 million to\ncover anticipated damages, but the plaintiff is seeking damages of up to approximately $105 million, excluding\ninterest.\nBased on UK legal practices, the company expects that some amount of damages may be due in early 2025. The\ncompany is engaged with its lenders to arrange financing to cover the range of possible outcomes and satisfy any\npotential damages awards as required. The company believes that an appeal to a higher court is likely in the\nmatter brought by one or both of the parties. That appeal would start in late 2025 or 2026, and most importantly,\nrest assured that all of the subject patents expired years ago and do not restrict the business of Astronics today in\nany way.\nApart from that and looking ahead, we are expecting our fourth quarter sales to be in the range of $190 million to\n$210 million. That's a little bit wider than usual, due in part to the Boeing strike situation. The Boeing strike hurt\nour third quarter revenues marginally by about $3 million as we got shut down in direct sales to Seattle in mid-to\nlate September. The fourth quarter will get hurt more and the turn-on schedule is a little bit uncertain, so we have\na wider range than we normally would at this point in a quarter.\nAssuming we hit the midpoint, or actually that range of $190 million to $210 million brings our 2024 year-end sales\nforecast to the range of $777 million to $797 million. At the midpoint, that would show a 14.2% increase for the\nyear, another year of strong growth.\nLooking a little further, we are working on our 2025 plan, which looks like another year of solid growth, though\nmaybe not as high as what we're experiencing in 2024 and continued margin improvement. We expect to release\na sales forecast to our shareholders in December or January.\nPage 7 of 12\nAstronics Corporation\nThird Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call\nNovember 6, 2024\nI think that ends our prepared remarks, Latanya. Maybe we can open it up for questions at this point.\nQuestion and Answer Section\nOperator\nSure. Thank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Jon\nTanwanteng with CJS Securities. Please proceed.\nJon Tanwanteng\nHi. Thank you for taking my questions, and nice quarter. Congrats also, Dave, on the retirement and Nancy on the\nappointment. I'm looking forward to working with you. Pete, I was going to ask you if you could quantify the\nimpact from Boeing on a monthly basis and kind of what run rate do expect to see as we ramp through 2025, as\nthat program restarts and kind of what kind of initial levels they'll start shipping out and what you will be shipping\nto Boeing?\nPeter J. Gundermann\nWe don’t have a clear answer to that question at the moment, Jon, but let me explain the situation a bit. Because\nthey shut us down, we accumulated some inventory during the quarter, which will affect our rates going forward.\nAdditionally, they also accumulated inventory as part of the strike process, so there will be some inventory that\nneeds to be worked through. We expect a slow start, but we anticipate that the pace will accelerate as the year\nprogresses. We believe they have internal goals of catching up quickly to the rate they were at before the strike,\nthough we'll have to see how realistic those plans are.\nWhat we expect is that they will maintain a certain rate for us, which will be enough to keep us operational and\nmaintain the supply chain, but not so high that we get too far ahead of them. We'll likely find out more about this\nplan soon, but at this point, we don't have all the details.\nAdditionally, it's important to note that the main plane they manufacture in Seattle is the 737. The situation I\ndescribed primarily involves products Boeing buys directly from us, which we ship to them for 737 line-fit\ninstallations. There are also a range of products, primarily related to in-flight entertainment (IFE), which are\ninstalled on 737s during production but are not purchased by Boeing or shipped by us to Seattle. These are\ninstead shipped directly to airlines or seat companies. The value of this content is typically around $60,000 to\n$70,000 per airplane, and shipments have continued through the shutdown and up to today.\nWe assume that these shipments will continue, and that Boeing will eventually resume the direct shipments to us,\nbut at a lower rate. Before the shutdown, we were shipping about 32 to 33 units per month, but we expect that\nnumber to drop to somewhere around 20 units per month, though we don’t know that for certain yet. This is a\ncrucial part of our operating plan for 2025, so we need to clarify this soon.\nPage 8 of 12\nAstronics Corporation\nThird Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call\nNovember 6, 2024\nJon Tanwanteng\nGot it. And at the lower ship rate per month, does that impact your margins or can you get that back in pricing\nsomehow?\nPeter J. Gundermann\nI think it's still a very profitable business. While higher volumes lead to higher profits, I don't believe it will\nmaterially affect our margins across the business.\nJon Tanwanteng\nOkay. Great. And then just with the inventory situation, I guess, do you see the cash flow or at least the net debt\nimproving in Q4? Do you have to extend that out when you start shipping to Boeing again?\nDavid C. Burney\nYes, I continue to see strong cash flow heading into the fourth quarter. As I mentioned, we're a month into it, and\ncash flow has been very positive and strong. I believe it will remain solid for the rest of the quarter.\nJon Tanwanteng\nOkay. Great. Thank you. I'll jump back in queue.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities. Please proceed.\nMichael Ciarmoli\nHey. Good evening, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Dave, congratulations. Nancy, as well. Look forward to\nworking with you. And Dave, best in retirement there. Hey, Pete, just maybe asking this another way, just\nobviously impossible to predict how fast Boeing ramps up, Airbus having their own challenges. If you look at that\nrevenue forecast in the fourth quarter, how much is new production versus retrofit or aftermarket?\nPeter J. Gundermann\nWe've been operating with a 50/50 split between line-fit and aftermarket. The slowdown in 737 production will\nlikely impact that, potentially costing us around $8 million to $10 million if they don't resume operations with us.\nMichael Ciarmoli\nOkay.\nPage 9 of 12\nAstronics Corporation\nThird Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call\nNovember 6, 2024\nPeter J. Gundermann\nThe focus will likely shift towards aftermarket. However, overall trends remain quite positive. What’s interesting to\nme is that, for the most part, our airline customers have stayed consistent with their demand schedules. They\nhaven’t pushed much out. Occasionally, there are slight delays here and there, but they haven’t been a major\nfactor. It seems that, despite Boeing's strike, many of our customers have been able to look past it and haven’t\ngotten too concerned.\nMichael Ciarmoli\nOkay. Okay. That's helpful. And then could you maybe talk just, I guess, specifically, if there's an opportunity for\nIFE, power, all of your related products at Southwest, given kind of the major changes and overhaul they're going\nthrough? It sounds like the majority of their cabins are going to be retrofitted here. I know they've got a pretty\naggressive schedule. Is that on your radar? And is it something you can maybe give us a little bit more detail on if it\nis?\nPeter J. Gundermann\nAbsolutely. Southwest is already a major customer of ours, and we're doing a lot of work on their cabin refreshes.\nLooking back, we developed a new in-seat power architecture, specifically designed around USB Type-C power.\nWhile this wasn’t developed exclusively for Southwest, we worked closely with them on it. We've been pursuing\nthem for many years, and we finally made it happen. This new system is prominently featured in their updated\ncabins, and you can see it in some of the photos.\nNot only is this new architecture, which is USB Type-C-based, lighter and more cost-effective, but it has also been\nvery successful in global sales. It's becoming an increasingly important part of our in-seat power and IFE (in-flight\nentertainment) offerings. We're certainly involved with Southwest, and the current modifications they’re making to\ntheir cabins could present further opportunities for us to increase our content. However, there's not much I can\nshare about that at this point.\nMichael Ciarmoli\nOkay. Okay. Last one for me. I mean, I know, the legal battle has been going on for a long time here. And I hate to\nget into the hypothetical. But $105 million in damages, given your balance sheet, is a significant percent of the\nmarket cap. I mean, how are you guys kind of thinking about this? I know I typically think of you guys as having the\ndominant position in some of these product categories. I guess the damage is one potential question, but then\ndoes this also sort of make your products a little bit more vulnerable? And do you see more competition coming in\nin some of those in-seat power and other related offerings?\nPeter J. Gundermann\nPage 10 of 12\nAstronics Corporation\nThird Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call\nNovember 6, 2024\nThe second part of your question is the easiest to answer: No. The patents in question have all expired and have\nbeen expired for years. So, in a sense, this is a dispute over history. It doesn’t restrict our business in any way\ntoday, and, as far as I can see, it’s not a material issue competitively.\nMichael Ciarmoli\nGot you.\nPeter J. Gundermann\nThat's really a non-issue. I could get into speculation about damages, but I’ll just say that we’re recovering and\ngaining financial strength very quickly. In that sense, we now have financial options that we didn’t have a year and\na half or two years ago. So, I don’t view it as a major crisis. Additionally, given that it seems the court will allow\nappeals—or even anticipates them—it’s clear that this whole battle, which has been ongoing for 14 years, will\ncontinue for at least a couple more. This will be one of those twists in the road that, someday, we’ll look back on\nand be glad it’s over.\nOperator\nWe have a follow-up from Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Please proceed.\nJon Tanwanteng\nThanks for the follow-up. I was just wondering if you could talk about the strength in the Test business in the\nquarter. What do you see in the run rate going forward? And I think you had another restructuring that you talked\nabout in the press release. Do you expect that to be doing a positive operating profit going forward?\nPeter J. Gundermann\nI think we’re going to get closer. The $25 million figure has increased from the typical run rate of $20 million, but I\ndon’t think it will stay at that level. It might retrench. The situation remains the same. We’re awaiting the start of\nthe radio test program for the US Army, called TS-4549/T, and the current outlook is that series production should\nbegin at the very end of 2025.\nWe need to get through the first three quarters of 2025, and this restructuring is designed to make that process as\nsmooth as possible. While I don’t expect the company to be highly profitable during this time, we are making\nprogress and doing what’s necessary to get the TS-4549/T program underway. This includes shipping the low-rate\ninitial production units so the Army can conduct the tests to ensure everything meets their requirements,\nultimately leading to the start of series production.\nThe restructuring is intended to help us navigate the next nine months successfully, in anticipation of that high-\nvolume program kicking in at the end of 2025.\nPage 11 of 12\nAstronics Corporation\nThird Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call\nNovember 6, 2024\nJon Tanwanteng\nGot it. Thank you. And just wondering if you could just – is there any other bigger legal expense coming? What\nshould we expect from just the litigation expense side, not the reserves, but just paying your lawyers?\nPeter J. Gundermann\nWell, it's something we do quite well, so I think it should be relatively quiet. However, I’m not sure about the\nparameters or timing of an appeal in the UK case. If we reach that point, it’s likely to be a late-2025 event. Our\nexperience in Germany has been relatively quiet, and we expect that to be more of a 2026 matter. In France, we\nhave a victory, but the other side is attempting to appeal it. We don’t know where that will go or when, but there is\nactually a possibility that things could remain quiet for a few months.\nJon Tanwanteng\nGot it. Thank you.\nPeter J. Gundermann\nThank you, Jon.\nOperator\nThank you. At this time, there are no further questions in queue. I would like to turn the call back to management\nfor closing comment.\nPeter J. Gundermann\nNo closing comments. Thank you for your attention. Again, we thought it was a pretty good quarter, a lot of\nsubsequent events and an exciting future going forward. So thank you for your attention.\nOperator\nThank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for\nyour participation, and have a great day.\nNote: This transcript has been edited slightly to make it more readable.

Astronics also granted the initial purchasers of the Notes an option to purchase up to an additional $15 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes, for settlement within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the first date on which the Notes are issued. The offering of the Notes is expected to close on December 3, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. \n\nThe Notes will be Astronics’ senior unsecured obligations. The Notes will mature on March 15, 2030, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.500% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2025. \n\nPrior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 15, 2029, noteholders will have the right to convert their Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. On or after December 15, 2029, noteholders may convert all or any portion of their Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion, Astronics will satisfy its conversion obligations by paying and/or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election. The initial conversion rate for the Notes is 43.6814 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $22.89 per share of common stock), which represents an approximately 30% conversion premium over the last reported sale price of $17.61 per share of Astronics’ common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market on November 25, 2024. The conversion rate (and accordingly the conversion price) is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, upon certain corporate events or upon a notice of redemption (as described below), Astronics will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for noteholders who convert Notes in connection with such a corporate event or convert their Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption during the related redemption period, as the case may be. \n\nThe Notes will not be redeemable before March 20, 2028. The Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, for cash at Astronics’ option at any time, and from time to time, on or after March 20, 2028 and prior to the 51st scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, if the last reported sale price per share of Astronics’ common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time. The redemption price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. \n\nIf a \"fundamental change\" (as will be defined in the indenture for the Notes) occurs, then, subject to limited exceptions, noteholders may require Astronics to repurchase their Notes for cash. The repurchase price will be equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date. \n\nAstronics expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay all outstanding borrowings under its term loan facility. Astronics expects to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the repayment of a portion of its outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the offering. \n\nThe Notes were offered to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The offer and sale of the Notes and any shares of Astronics’ common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities law, and the Notes and any such shares may not be offered or sold absent registration under, or pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. \n\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, including the Notes or any shares of Astronics’ common stock, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or sale of any Notes or any such shares of Astronics’ common stock in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. \n\n**About Astronics** Astronics Corporation (NASDAQ: ATRO) serves the world’s aerospace, defense and other mission-critical industries with proven innovative technology solutions. Astronics works side-by-side with customers, integrating its array of power, connectivity, lighting, structures, interiors and test technologies to solve complex challenges.

Today, global airframe manufacturers, airlines, military branches, completion centers and Fortune 500 companies rely on the collaborative spirit and innovation of Astronics. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** This press release contains statements that are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. One can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of the words “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “feeling” or other similar expressions and include all statements with regard to the completion, timing and size of the proposed offering, the intended use of proceeds, and the terms of the Notes being offered. Because such statements apply to future events, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from what may be stated here include the trend in growth with passenger power and connectivity on airplanes, the state of the aerospace and defense industries, the market acceptance of newly developed products, internal production capabilities, the timing of orders received, the status of customer certification processes and delivery schedules, the demand for and market acceptance of new or existing aircraft which contain the Company’s products, the impact of regulatory activity and public scrutiny on production rates of a major U.S. aircraft manufacturer, the need for new and advanced test and simulation equipment, customer preferences and relationships, the effectiveness of the Company’s supply chain, and other factors which are described in filings by Astronics with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as required by applicable law, the Company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking information in this news release whether to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in future operating results, financial conditions or prospects, or otherwise. \n\nView source version on businesswire.com: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241126969679/en/>\n\n**Company:** David C.

Gundermann, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We delivered a solid third quarter operationally. Revenue was at the high end of our range, up 25% over the comparator quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $27.1 million for the quarter and $91 million for the trailing twelve months. Operating margins improved from both volume and the initiatives we have executed to drive profitability. Our Aerospace segment adjusted operating margin was 14.2%. We are clearly making progress towards our operational goals, though our results include the impact of expenses related to our July refinancing, a customer bankruptcy and a warranty reserve. All in all, we feel it was another quarter of progress as we continue to recover from the disruption of the past few years.” \n\n1 _Adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted segment operating profit, adjusted segment operating margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) are Non-GAAP Performance Measures.

Aerospace sales increased $35.5 million and Test Systems sales increased $5.3 million. \n\nGross profit increased $22.1 million to $42.7 million, or 21.0% of sales. Adjusted gross profit1 for the 2024 third quarter was $47.2 million, or 23.2% of sales. Third quarter gross profit was negatively impacted by a $3.5 million atypical warranty reserve related to a new product launch that requires a field modification, and a $0.9 million inventory reserve related to a bankruptcy filing for an Aerospace customer. The comparator quarter of 2023 included a $3.6 million write-down of inventory related to a separate customer bankruptcy. \n\nThird quarter 2024 selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) included $1.3 million in reserves for outstanding receivables and fixed asset impairment related to the bankruptcy filing of an Aerospace customer compared to a separate bankruptcy reserve of $7.5 million against outstanding receivables in the prior year. \n\nDespite the unusual impacts to gross profit and operating income, consolidated operating income increased $22.9 million to $8.4 million, or 4.1% of sales, compared with operating loss of $14.5 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted operating income1 for the 2024 third quarter was $19.6 million, or 9.6% of sales. \n\nImproved operating income reflects the operating leverage gained on higher sales volume, partially offset by $4.5 million for resumed incentive programs, an increase of $1.9 million in litigation-related legal expenses and reserve adjustments in 2024 and a $3.2 million increase in non-bankruptcy related inventory reserves. \n\nThird quarter 2024 expenses included a $3.2 million call premium on the previous term loan and the write-off of $3.8 million of associated deferred financing costs. The $7.0 million total has been reflected as Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. \n\nTax expense in the quarter was $6.6 million, primarily due to a valuation allowance applied against the deferred tax asset associated with research and development costs that are required to be capitalized for tax purposes. \n\nConsolidated net loss was $11.7 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, measurably improved compared with the net loss of $17.0 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, in the prior year. Adjusted net income1 for the 2024 third quarter was $12.2 million, or $0.35 per diluted share. \n\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA1 increased to $27.1 million, or 13.3% of consolidated sales, compared with adjusted EBITDA1 of $8.8 million, or 5.4% of consolidated sales, in the prior-year period primarily as a result of increased profitability from higher sales. \n\nBookings were $189.2 million in the quarter resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.93:1. For the trailing twelve months, bookings totaled $795.5 million and the book-to-bill ratio was 1.02:1. \n\n**Aerospace Segment Review** _(refer to sales by market and segment data in accompanying tables)_\n\n_Aerospace Third Quarter 2024 Results (compared with the prior-year period, unless noted otherwise)_\n\nAerospace segment sales increased $35.5 million, or 24.9%, to $177.6 million. The improvement was driven by a 31.6% increase, or $32.1 million, in Commercial Transport sales. Sales to this market were $133.9 million, or 65.8% of consolidated sales in the quarter, compared with $101.7 million, or 62.5% of consolidated sales in the third quarter of 2023. Growth was primarily related to increased demand by airlines for inflight entertainment & connectivity (“IFEC”) products which are in Electrical Power & Motion and Avionics product groups. \n\nMilitary Aircraft sales increased $5.0 million, or 30.0%, to $21.7 million, driven by progress on the FLRAA program. General Aviation sales increased $1.9 million, or 11.6%, to $18.1 million due to higher VVIP sales. Other sales decreased $3.6 million as the Company is winding down its non-core contract manufacturing arrangements. \n\nAerospace segment operating profit of $14.3 million was up $21.7 million compared with operating loss of $7.5 million in the same period last year. Operating margin was 8.0%. Adjusted Aerospace operating profit1 was $25.3 million, an increase of $20.3 million, or over five times the prior-year period. Adjusted Aerospace operating margin1 expanded 10.7 points to 14.2% reflecting the leverage gained on higher volume and improving production efficiencies. \n\nThe segment’s operating profit in the third quarter of 2024 was impacted by $3.5 million in warranty expense related to the previously-mentioned field modification, $5.1 million in litigation-related legal expenses and reserve adjustments related to an ongoing patent dispute, $3.9 million in inventory reserves, $3.2 million in compensation expense related to the resumption of the Company’s incentive programs, and a non-cash reserve associated with a customer bankruptcy of $2.2 million. \n\nAerospace bookings were $173.6 million for a book-to-bill ratio of 0.98:1. Backlog for the Aerospace segment was $543.6 million at quarter end and excludes $9.3 million of backlog that was associated with the customer bankruptcy referred to previously. \n\nMr. Gundermann commented, “Our Aerospace business had a strong quarter, with sales up 24.9% over the comparator quarter and adjusted operating income1 achieving our targeted mid-teens level of 14.2%. We achieved this despite the Boeing strike, which hurt revenue in the quarter by about $2 million, with bookings impacted by approximately $7 million to $8 million. Given the measurably improved profitability, we are pleased with our Aerospace performance during the quarter.” \n\n**Test Systems Segment Review** _(refer to sales by market and segment data in accompanying tables)_\n\n_Test Systems Third Quarter 2024 Results (compared with the prior-year period, unless noted otherwise)_\n\nTest Systems segment sales were $26.1 million, up $5.3 million. The improvement was driven by the U.S. Marine Corps’ Handheld Radio Test Sets (“HHRTS”) and the U.S. Army’s TS-4549/T programs, which contributed $5.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively, in sales during the quarter. \n\nTest Systems segment operating loss was near break-even, compared with operating loss of $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. The improvement was the result of lower litigation-related legal expenses, partially offset by additional compensation expense from the resumption of the Company’s incentive programs. Test Systems continues to be negatively affected by mix and under absorption of fixed costs at current volume levels. \n\nAdditional restructuring initiatives were implemented in the 2024 fourth quarter. In October 2024, the Company offered a voluntary separation program which is currently expected to provide annualized savings of approximately $2 million, beginning in the first quarter of 2025. The Company expects to record severance expense of approximately $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 related to this initiative. \n\nBookings for the Test Systems segment in the quarter were $15.6 million. The book-to-bill ratio was 0.60:1 for the quarter. Backlog for the Test Systems segment was $68.2 million at quarter end. \n\nMr. Gundermann commented, “Our Test business had some success in the third quarter, with revenue up 25.6%. The business has initiated further restructuring to focus on the most critical initiatives going forward, including the radio test program for the U.S. Army, which is now expected to enter volume production in the second half of 2025.” \n\n**Liquidity and Financing**\n\nCash provided by operations in the third quarter of 2024 was $8.5 million, primarily the result of increased net income, after adjusted for non-cash expenses. \n\nCapital expenditures in the quarter were $1.9 million and $5.2 million year-to-date. Net debt was $174.6 million, up from $161.2 million at December 31, 2023. \n\nOn July 11, 2024, the Company announced it had amended and expanded its revolving line of credit and refinanced its term loan. The refinancing provided improved liquidity, lower cash costs, and greater financial flexibility for the Company. The refinancing was comprised of an expanded asset-based line of credit and a reduced, lower-cost term loan. Both mature in July 2027. \n\n**Legal Proceedings**\n\nSince 2010, the Company has been defending itself in a long-running series of patent infringement cases brought by a single plaintiff. Cases were filed in the United States, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (UK). \n\nThe United States case was resolved in 2017, when the court found that the patent was not novel and was therefore invalid. \n\nThe French case similarly found that the subject patent was invalid, though the plaintiff is seeking to appeal that decision. \n\nThe German court dismissed some claims of the patent but upheld others and found that Astronics had been infringing. The Company has paid $3.5 million in penalties and interest to date and has taken a reserve of $17.3 million to cover estimated damages and associated interest. Damages proceedings in this case are likely to conclude in 2026. \n\nUnlike in the US, French, and German proceedings, the UK court fully upheld the subject patent and found that the Company was infringing. A damages hearing was conducted in October 2024 and a ruling is expected later this year or early in 2025. Astronics reserved $7.4 million to cover anticipated damages, but the plaintiff is seeking damages of up to approximately $105 million, excluding interest. Based on UK legal practices, the Company expects that some amount of damages may be due in early 2025. The Company is engaged with its lenders to seek to arrange financing to cover the wide range of possible outcomes and satisfy any potential damages award as required. \n\nThe Company believes that permission will be granted to either or both of the parties to appeal the judgement to a higher court subsequently. \n\nAll patents related to the infringement cases have expired years ago and the lawsuits do not restrict the Company’s current business activities. \n\n**2024 Outlook**\n\nThe Company expects fourth quarter sales of $190 million to $210 million and is adjusting its 2024 revenue guidance to $777 million to $797 million. The midpoint of this range would be a 14.2% increase over 2023 sales. Astronics considered the broad range of factors affecting the business, including the work stoppage at Boeing, in issuing its guidance. \n\nBacklog at the end of the third quarter was $611.9 million. Planned capital expenditures in 2024 are expected to be in the range of $9 million to $11 million. \n\nMr. Gundermann commented, “We are closing in on another year of strong double-digit growth. Assuming we attain the mid-point of the range for 2024, we will have averaged 21% growth over each of the last three years. Our profitability has benefited from the growth and the many improvement initiatives we have implemented over the last several years, and we believe 2025 will see a continuation of these trends.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Webcast and Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a teleconference today at 4:45 p.m. ET. During the teleconference, management will review the financial and operating results for the period and discuss Astronics’ corporate strategy and outlook.

References to Adjusted Non-GAAP information are to non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not required by, in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Astronics management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of Astronics for budget planning purposes and for making operational and financial decisions. Management believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures to investors, as a supplement to GAAP financial measures, help investors evaluate Astronics core operating and financial performance and business trends consistent with how management evaluates such performance and trends. \n\n**ASTRONICS CORPORATION**  \n---  \n**RECONCILIATION OF NET LOSS TO ADJUSTED EBITDA**  \n_(Unaudited, $ in thousands)_  \n**Consolidated**  \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n**9/28/2024** |  **9/30/2023** |  **9/28/2024** |  **9/30/2023**  \nNet loss  |  $  |  (11,738  |  )  |  $  |  (16,983  |  )  |  $  |  (13,383  |  )  |  $  |  (33,397  |  )   \nAdd back (deduct):   \nInterest expense  |  6,217  |  5,991  |  17,832  |  17,381   \nIncome tax (benefit) expense  |  6,565  |  (3,835  |  )  |  4,940  |  5,552   \nDepreciation and amortization expense  |  6,041  |  6,385  |  18,572  |  19,758   \nEquity-based compensation expense  |  1,772  |  1,611  |  6,414  |  5,603   \nNon-cash annual stock bonus accrual  |  —  |  —  |  1,448  |  —   \nNon-cash 401K contribution and quarterly bonus accrual  |  —  |  1,237  |  3,454  |  3,773   \nRestructuring-related charges including severance  |  259  |  —  |  1,033  |  564   \nLegal reserve, settlements and recoveries  |  (332  |  )  |  (1,227  |  )  |  (332  |  )  |  (2,532  |  )   \nLitigation-related legal expenses  |  5,558  |  4,574  |  13,680  |  14,024   \nEquity investment accrued payable write-off  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (1,800  |  )   \nNet gain on sale of business  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (3,427  |  )   \nLoss on extinguishment of debt  |  6,987  |  —  |  6,987  |  —   \nNon-cash reserves for customer bankruptcy  |  2,203  |  11,074  |  2,203  |  11,074   \nWarranty reserve  |  3,527  |  —  |  3,527  |  —   \nDeferred liability recovery  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (5,824  |  )   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  **$** |  **27,059** |  **$** |  **8,827** |  **$** |  **66,375** |  **$** |  **30,749**  \nSales  |  $  |  203,698  |  $  |  162,922  |  $  |  586,886  |  $  |  493,914   \nAdjusted EBITDA margin %  |  _13.3_ |  _%_ |  _5.4_ |  _%_ |  _11.3_ |  _%_ |  _6.2_ |  _%_  \n  \nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and other adjustments.

The Company believes that presenting Adjusted Diluted EPS provides a better understanding of its earnings power inclusive of adjusting for the non-cash amortization of intangible assets, reflecting the Company’s strategy to grow through acquisitions as well as organically. \n\n1 Applies a normalized tax rate of 25% to GAAP pre-tax income and non-GAAP adjustments above, which are each pre-tax.   \n---  \n**ASTRONICS CORPORATION**  \n---  \n**SEGMENT SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT**  \n_(Unaudited, $ in thousands)_  \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n**9/28/2024** |  **9/30/2023** |  **9/28/2024** |  **9/30/2023**  \n**Sales**  \nAerospace  |  $  |  177,564  |  $  |  142,116  |  $  |  518,187  |  $  |  436,217   \nLess inter-segment  |  (10  |  )  |  (12  |  )  |  (52  |  )  |  (134  |  )   \nTotal Aerospace  |  177,554  |  142,104  |  518,135  |  436,083   \nTest Systems  |  26,183  |  20,818  |  68,790  |  57,831   \nLess inter-segment  |  (39  |  )  |  —  |  (39  |  )  |  —   \nTotal Test Systems  |  26,144  |  20,818  |  68,751  |  57,831   \n**Total consolidated sales** |  203,698  |  162,922  |  586,886  |  493,914   \n**Segment operating profit (loss) and margins**  \nAerospace  |  14,251  |  (7,464  |  )  |  45,628  |  10,342   \n_8.0_ |  _%_ |  _(5.3_ |  _)%_ |  _8.8_ |  _%_ |  _2.4_ |  _%_  \nTest Systems  |  (13  |  )  |  (1,781  |  )  |  (8,428  |  )  |  (8,521  |  )   \n_—_ |  _%_ |  _(8.6_ |  _)%_ |  _(12.3_ |  _)%_ |  _(14.7_ |  _)%_  \n**Total segment operating profit (loss)** |  14,238  |  (9,245  |  )  |  37,200  |  1,821   \nNet gain on sale of business  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (3,427  |  )   \nLoss on extinguishment of debt  |  6,987  |  —  |  6,987  |  —   \nInterest expense  |  6,217  |  5,991  |  17,832  |  17,381   \nCorporate expenses and other  |  6,207  |  5,582  |  20,824  |  15,712   \n**Loss before taxes** |  $  |  (5,173  |  )  |  $  |  (20,818  |  )  |  $  |  (8,443  |  )  |  $  |  (27,845  |  )   \n**ASTRONICS CORPORATION**  \n---  \n**RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT TO ADJUSTED SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT**  \n_(Unaudited, $ in thousands)_  \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n**9/28/2024** |  **9/30/2023** |  **9/28/2024** |  **9/30/2023**  \n**Aerospace operating profit (loss)** |  $  |  14,251  |  $  |  (7,464  |  )  |  $  |  45,628  |  $  |  10,342   \nRestructuring-related charges including severance  |  237  |  —  |  237  |  —   \nLegal reserve, settlements and recoveries  |  (332  |  )  |  (1,227  |  )  |  (332  |  )  |  (2,532  |  )   \nLitigation-related legal expenses  |  5,405  |  2,658  |  13,161  |  6,779   \nNon-cash reserves for customer bankruptcy  |  2,203  |  11,074  |  2,203  |  11,074   \nWarranty reserve  |  3,527  |  —  |  3,527  |  —   \nAdjusted Aerospace operating profit  |  **$** |  **25,291** |  **$** |  **5,041** |  **$** |  **64,424** |  **$** |  **25,663**  \nAerospace sales  |  $  |  177,554  |  $  |  142,104  |  $  |  518,135  |  $  |  436,083   \n**Aerospace margin** |  _8.0_ |  _%_ |  _(5.3_ |  _)%_ |  _8.8_ |  _%_ |  _2.4_ |  _%_  \n**Adjusted Aerospace margin** |  _14.2_ |  _%_ |  _3.5_ |  _%_ |  _12.4_ |  _%_ |  _5.9_ |  _%_  \n**Test Systems operating loss** |  $  |  (13  |  )  |  $  |  (1,781  |  )  |  $  |  (8,428  |  )  |  $  |  (8,521  |  )   \nRestructuring-related charges including severance  |  22  |  —  |  796  |  564   \nLitigation-related legal expenses  |  153  |  1,916  |  519  |  7,245   \nDeferred liability recovery  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (5,824  |  )   \nAdjusted Test Systems operating profit (loss)  |  **$** |  **162** |  **$** |  **135** |  **$** |  **(7,113** |  **)** |  **$** |  **(6,536** |  **)**  \nTest Systems sales  |  $  |  26,144  |  $  |  20,818  |  $  |  68,751  |  $  |  57,831   \n**Test Systems margin** |  _—_ |  _%_ |  _(8.6_ |  _)%_ |  _(12.3_ |  _)%_ |  _(14.7_ |  _)%_  \n**Adjusted Test Systems margin** |  _0.6_ |  _%_ |  _0.6_ |  _%_ |  _(10.3_ |  _)%_ |  _(11.3_ |  _)%_  \n  \nAdjusted Segment Operating Profit is defined as segment operating profit as reported, adjusted for certain items.

Aerospace and Total Backlog included $9.3 million related to that customer. In the table and bar chart presented above, Aerospace and Total Bookings was reduced by $9.3 million, in the periods in which the original bookings occurred. While the customer has not cancelled those orders and seeks to reorganize and continue operations, we have removed all outstanding backlog until additional information is available to confirm whether those orders are expected to be satisfied.

The Company’s management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance because it allows\nmanagement, investors and others to evaluate and compare the performance of its core operations from period to period by removing the impact of the capital structure (interest), tangible and intangible asset base (depreciation and\namortization), taxes, equity-based compensation expense, goodwill, intangible and long-lived asset impairment charges, equity investment income or loss, legal reserves, settlements and recoveries, restructuring charges, fair value\nadjustments to the valuation of contingent consideration liabilities, gains or losses associated with the sale of businesses and grant benefits recorded related to the AMJP program, which is not commensurate with the core activities of\nthe reporting period in which it is included. As such, the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of performance when evaluating its business and as a basis for planning and forecasting. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of\nfinancial performance under GAAP and is not calculated through the application of GAAP. As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of net income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation of, but in\nconjunction with, the GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.\nastronics.com 23\nReconciliation of Gross Profit to Adjusted Gross Profit\nQ3 2023 Q3 2024\nGross Profit $20,618 $42,743\nAdd back (deduct)\nWarranty reserve - 3,527\nNon-cash reserves for customer bankruptcy 3,601 909\nDeferred liability recovery - -\nAdjusted Gross Profit $24,219 $47,179\nSales $ 162,922 $ 203,698\nGross Margin 12.7% 21.0%\nAdjusted Gross Margin 14.9% 23.2%\nastronics.com 24\nReconciliation of Operating Income to Adjusted Operating Income\nQ3 2023 Q3 2024\nIncome (Loss) from Operations $(14,479) $8,374\nAdd back (deduct)\nRestructuring-related charges including severance - 259\nLegal reserve, settlements and recoveries (1,227) (332)\nLitigation-related legal expenses 4,574 5,558\nNon-cash reserves for customer bankruptcy 11,074 2,203\nWarranty reserve - 3,527\nDeferred liability recovery - -\nAdjusted Operating Income (Loss) $(58) $19,589\nSales $162,922 $203,698\nOperating Margin (8.9%) 4.1%\nAdjusted Operating Margin -% 9.6%\nastronics.com 25\nReconciliation of Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share to\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share\nQ3 2023 Q3 2024\nNet Loss $(16,983) $(11,738)\nAdd back (deduct)\nAmortization of intangibles 3,381 3,188\nRestructuring-related charges including severance - 259\nLegal reserve, settlements and recoveries (1,227) (332)\nLitigation-related legal expenses 4,574 5,558\nEquity investment accrued payable write-off - -\nNet gain on sales of business - -\nLoss on extinguishment of debt - 6,987\nNon-cash reserves for customer bankruptcy 11,074 2,203\nWarranty reserve - 3,527\nDeferred liability recovery - -\nNormalize tax rate1 (3,081) 2,511\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) $(2,262) $12,163\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding (in thousands) 33,000 35,011\nDiluted loss per share ($0.51) ($0.34)\nAdjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share ($0.07) $0.35\n1Applies a normalized tax rate of 25% to GAAP pre-tax income and non-GAAP adjustments above, which are each pre-tax. astronics.com 26\nExtensive List of Customers\nRepresentative List\n280+ Airlines Comlux Jet Aviation Safran\nAirbus Dassault Aviation Kawasaki Sikorsky\nAMAC Aerospace Delta Flight Products L3Harris Textron Aviation\nBell Helicopter Embraer Leonardo Thales\nBoeing General Dynamics Lockheed Martin Thompson Aero Seating\nBombardier Gulfstream NASA U.S. Army/Navy/Air Force/Marines\nCarson Helicopters Honda Aircraft Northrup Grumman Viasat\nCessna Honeywell Panasonic Avionics\nCirrus Aircraft Hughes Pilatus\nCollins Aerospace Intelsat Raytheon Technologies\nastronics.com 27\nCreated a Portfolio for Growth\nPECO Manufacturing PGA Avionics Armstrong Telefonix PDT Freedom\nAerospace Communication\n» July 2013 » December 2013 » December 2017\nTechnologies\n» Aerospace: Manufacturing » Aerospace: Power, » January 2015 » Aerospace: Connectivity\nServices Executive » Aerospace: Systems » July 2019\nCertification, Power » A&D Test\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\nAeroSat EADS N.A.

          "content": "2023 Annual Report\nAstronics serves the world’s aerospace, defense and\nother mission-critical industries with\ninnovative technology solutions.\nWe work side-by-side with customers, integrating our array of\npower, connectivity, lighting, structures, interiors and\ntest technologies to solve complex challenges.\nFor over 50 years, we have delivered creative,\ncustomer-focused solutions with exceptional responsiveness.\nToday, global airframe manufacturers, airlines, military branches,\ncompletion centers and Fortune 500 companies rely on our collaborative spirit\nand innovation to deliver leading technology and solutions.\nOur strategy is to grow value by developing technologies and capabilities that provide\ninnovative solutions to our targeted markets.\nDear Fellow Shareholders,\n2023 was a year of solid progress and we closed on a strong note. Revenue for the year was up\n29% to $689 million while our operating loss declined to just $6.7 million, with the fourth quarter\ndelivering 4% operating margin. The improvement was the result of continued strong demand, an\nimproved supply chain and a more stable and developed team of people.\nDemand for air travel has now largely recovered to levels Sales\nprior to the pandemic with the exception of international (in millions)\ntravel in and out of China. This recovery has led to\nincreases in production rates for major aircraft platforms\nand increased retrofit demand from airlines that desire to\nprovide quality inflight entertainment for their passengers.\nThe high demand drove bookings which resulted in record\naerospace backlog. Our strong backlog, combined with\nan improving supply chain and stabilized workforce\nenabled the growth in revenue.\nContinued Innovation and Major Wins Opening Backlog\n(in millions)\nInnovation is the lifeblood of our organization. We take\ncalculated risks investing in areas that will drive\nsustainable revenue opportunities for Astronics. We\ncontinued doing this through the pandemic and were\nhighly successful.\nOne of the new programs, announced in August of 2023,\nwas our selection by Bell, a Textron Company, to support\ndevelopment of the V-280 Valor for the U.S. Army Future\nLong Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) program, which is\nthe U.S. Army’s planned replacement for the UH-60 Blackhawk. A member of Team Valor, Astronics\nhas been working with Bell for several years supplying the electrical power and distribution system for\nthe demonstrator aircraft. The current agreement will further mature the system for qualification and\ncertification.\nUltimately, if we succeed and the development program turns into a full-blown production contract, this\nprogram will provide a significant revenue stream for our future.\nAnother example of a significant win during the pandemic was also with the U.S. Army, developing the\nRadio Test Set referred to as TS-4549/T that we announced in 2022. This program will replace the\naging GRM-122 radio test equipment for tactical radios in the U.S. Army. We are working with the\nArmy to define the terms of a production contract which we expect will be completed in the first half of\n2024. We believe once finalized and production begins that this could contribute $200 million to\n$300 million in revenue over four to five years.\nStrengthening Profitability, Driving Cash Generation and Improving Liquidity\nAs we work through 2024, we are going to have an increased emphasis on margins. The higher\nvolume will help, but there are many additional actions we are taking that will contribute to this\nimprovement. Since the beginning of the global pandemic, we have reduced our leased and owned\nsquare footage by 16% and have eliminated four operating locations with a fifth location currently in\nprocess. Simplifying the business in this manner helps take out costs and improve operating leverage.\nAnother example is our decision to opt out of customer contracts that do not deliver the margin profile\nwe expect.\nWhile investment in net working capital was elevated through the year, we made significant\nimprovement in the second half of 2023 managing our inventory, which had grown significantly in the\nfirst half of the year in an attempt to keep up with very strong bookings. We expect continuing\nimprovement in inventory turnover and are forecasting cash flow from operations to be strong as we\nadvance through 2024.\nThough we refinanced our debt in January of 2023 under terms that reflected the debt markets at that\ntime, liquidity was tight throughout the year. As a result, we initiated a $30 million “At-the-Market,” or\nATM, equity offering in August 2023. Subsequently, we sold 1,334,228 shares of common stock\nunder the ATM, generating aggregate net proceeds of $21.3 million. As of year-end, we had\nremaining capacity of up to approximately $8.2 million under the ATM.\nWe expect 2024 will be another solid year of progress for our Company. We have the business and\nthe backlog to deliver revenue in the expected range of $760 million to $795 million. This implies\n13% growth at the mid-point of that range. We expect the higher volume combined with other actions\nwe are taking will positively impact our margins. We look forward to a year that will finally see us\nrebounding to pre-pandemic revenue levels and laying the groundwork to grow profitably well beyond\nthat.\nSincerely,\nPeter J.

BUSINESS\nAstronics Corporation (“Astronics” or the “Company”) is a leading provider of advanced technologies to the global aerospace,\ndefense and electronics industries. Our products and services include advanced, high-performance electrical power generation,\ndistribution and motion systems, lighting and safety systems, avionics products, systems and certification, aircraft structures\nand automated test systems.\nWe have principal operations in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada, France and England, as well as engineering offices in\nUkraine and India. Our operation in Ukraine is a small engineering office and we have not experienced any significant\ndisruption in staffing or services as a result of the Ukrainian and Russian conflict.\nRefinancing\nOn January 19, 2023, the Company completed a financing transaction totaling $205 million, which refinanced its previous\nrevolving credit facility which was scheduled to mature in November 2023. The new financing consists of a $90 million asset-\nbased term loan (the “Term Loan Facility”) and a $115 million asset-based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Revolving Credit\nFacility”). The Term Loan Facility requires monthly amortization that began in April 2023 and bears interest at the Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 8.75%. The ABL Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at SOFR plus between\n2.25% and 2.75%. For additional information, see discussion in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations, and Note 8, Long-Term Debt, of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of\nthis report.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur business continues to face varying levels of supply chain pressures from the residual impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDomestic air travel has recovered from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and international travel utilizing primarily\nwidebody aircraft is close to pre-pandemic levels. As economic activity continues to recover, we will continue to monitor the\nsituation, assessing further possible implications on our operations, supply chain, liquidity, cash flow and customer orders.\nSee Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for an additional discussion of risk related to supply chain disruptions.\nIn September 2021, the Company was awarded a grant of up to $14.7 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation\n(“USDOT”) under the Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection Program (“AMJP”). The Company received $7.3 million and\n$7.4 million under the grant in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The grant benefit was recognized ratably over the six-month\nperformance period as a reduction to Cost of Products Sold in proportion to the compensation expense that the award was\nintended to defray. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized $6.0 million and $8.7\nmillion of the award, respectively.\nFor additional details regarding government subsidies and grants, and their impact on consolidated results of operations and\nfinancial position, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary\nData, of this report.\nDivestitures\nOn February 13, 2019, the Company completed a divestiture of its semiconductor test business within the Test Systems\nsegment. The total proceeds of the divestiture included two elements of contingent purchase consideration (“earnout”). In the\nfourth quarter of 2021, the Company agreed to an earnout payment of $10.7 million for the calendar 2020 earnout, which was\nrecorded in 2021 as a separate line item below operating loss and was received by the Company in early January 2022. In\nMarch 2022, the Company agreed with the earnout calculation for the calendar 2021 earnout in the amount of $11.3 million.\nThe Company recorded the gain and received the payment in the first quarter of 2022. In March 2023, the Company agreed\nwith the final earnout calculation for the calendar 2022 earnout in the amount of $3.4 million. The Company recorded the gain\nand received the payment in the first quarter of 2023. We are not eligible for any further earnout payments related to this\ndivestiture. For further information, see Note 21 in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report.\nOn October 6, 2021, the Company sold one of its Aerospace buildings for $9.2 million. Net cash proceeds were approximately\n$8.8 million and a gain on sale of approximately $5.0 million was recorded. The operation has been integrated into another\nfacility.\n5\nCustomer Bankruptcy\nIn November 2023, a non-core contract manufacturing customer reported within the Aerospace segment filed for bankruptcy\nunder Chapter 11. As a result, the Company recorded a full reserve of $7.5 million for outstanding accounts receivable and\n$3.6 million for dedicated inventory. The associated assets existed prior to 2023.\nProducts and Customers\nOur Aerospace segment designs and manufactures products for the global aerospace industry. Product lines include lighting and\nsafety systems, electrical power generation, distribution and seat motion systems, aircraft structures, avionics products, systems\ncertification, and other products. Our Aerospace customers are the airframe manufacturers (“OEM”) that build aircraft for the\ncommercial transport, military and general aviation markets, suppliers to those OEMs, aircraft operators such as airlines,\nsuppliers to the aircraft operators, and branches of the U.S. Department of Defense. During 2023, this segment’s sales were\ndivided 72% to the commercial transport market, 10% to the military aircraft market, 13% to the general aviation market and\n5% to other markets. Most of this segment’s sales are a result of contracts or purchase orders received from customers, placed\non a day-to-day basis or for single year procurements rather than long-term multi-year contract commitments. On occasion, the\nCompany does receive contractual commitments or blanket purchase orders from our customers covering multiple-year\ndeliveries of hardware to our customers.\nOur Test Systems segment designs, develops, manufactures and maintains automated test systems that support the aerospace\nand defense, communications and mass transit industries as well as training and simulation devices for both commercial and\nmilitary applications. In the Test Systems segment, Astronics’ products are sold to a global customer base including OEMs and\nprime government contractors for both electronics and military products. The nature of our Test Systems business is such that it\npursues large, often multi-year, projects.\nSales by segment, geographic region, major customer and foreign operations are provided in Note 20 in Item 8, Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data, of this report.\nWe have a significant concentration of business with one major customer, The Boeing Company (“Boeing”). Sales to Boeing\naccounted for 11.0% of sales in 2023, 11.0% of sales in 2022, and 10.0% of sales in 2021. Sales to Boeing are primarily in the\nAerospace segment.\nStrategy\nOur strategy is to increase our value by developing technologies and capabilities either internally or through acquisition, and\nuse those capabilities to provide innovative solutions to our targeted markets where our technology can be beneficial.\nPractices as to Maintaining Working Capital\nLiquidity is discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations, in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this report.\nCompetitive Conditions\nWe experience considerable competition in the market sectors we serve, principally with respect to product performance and\nprice, from various competitors, many of which are substantially larger and have greater resources than we do. Success in the\nmarkets we serve depends upon product innovation, customer support, responsiveness and cost management. We continue to\ninvest in developing the technologies and engineering support critical to competing in our markets.\nGovernment Contracts\nAll U.S. government contracts, including subcontracts where the U.S. government is the ultimate customer, may be subject to\ntermination at the election of the government. Our revenue stream relies on military spending. Approximately 12% of our 2023\nconsolidated sales were made to U.S. government-related markets.\nGovernment Regulation\nThe FAA regulates the manufacture, repair and operation of all aircraft and aircraft parts operated in the United States. Its\nregulations are designed to ensure that all aircraft and aviation equipment are continuously maintained in proper condition to\nensure safe operation of the aircraft. Similar rules apply in other countries. All aircraft must be maintained under a continuous\ncondition monitoring program and must periodically undergo thorough inspection and maintenance. The inspection,\nmaintenance and repair procedures for the various types of aircraft and equipment are prescribed by regulatory authorities and\ncan be performed only by certified repair facilities utilizing certified technicians. Certification and conformance is required\n6\nprior to installation of a part on an aircraft. Our operations may in the future be subject to new and more stringent regulatory\nrequirements. In that regard, we closely monitor the FAA and industry trade groups in an attempt to understand how possible\nfuture regulations might impact us. Our businesses which sell products directly to the U.S. Government or for use in systems\ndelivered to the U.S. Government can be subject to various laws and regulations governing pricing and other factors.\nThere has been no material adverse effect to our Consolidated Financial Statements nor competitive positions as a result of\nthese government regulations.\nRaw Materials\nMaterials, supplies and components are purchased from numerous sources. We believe that the loss of any one source, although\npotentially disruptive in the short-term, would not materially affect our operations in the long-term.\nSeasonality\nOur business is typically not seasonal.\nBacklog\nAt December 31, 2023, our consolidated backlog was $592.3 million. At December 31, 2022, our backlog was $571.4 million.\nThe increase in backlog is driven primarily by recovering demand from our commercial transport and general aviation\ncustomers, with increased OEM build rates and increased spending by commercial airlines on fleet improvements.\nBacklog in the Aerospace segment was $517.2 million at December 31, 2023, of which $474.5 million is expected to be\nrecognized as revenue in 2024. Backlog in the Test Systems segment was $75.0 million at December 31, 2023. The Test\nSystems segment expects to recognize $52.1 million of this backlog as revenue in 2024.\nPatents\nWe have a number of patents. While the aggregate protection of these patents is of value, our only material business that is\ndependent upon the protection afforded by these patents is our cabin power distribution products. Our patents and patent\napplications relate to electroluminescence, instrument panels, cord reels and handsets, and a broad patent covering the cabin\npower distribution technology. We regard our expertise and techniques as proprietary and rely upon trade secret laws and\ncontractual arrangements to protect our rights. We have trademark protection in our major markets.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries, benefits, consulting, material costs and\ndepreciation. Research and development expenses amounted to $53.5 million in 2023, $48.3 million in 2022 and $43.3 million\nin 2021. These costs are included in Cost of Products Sold.\nHuman Capital Resources\nHuman Capital Management and Corporate Culture\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employed approximately 2,500 employees, of whom approximately 2,000 were employed in the\nUnited States and approximately 500 were employed outside of the United States. We have approximately 140 non-exempt\nproduction employees at PECO who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We also leverage temporary workers to\nprovide flexibility for our business and manufacturing needs.\nWe greatly value our employees and recognize that, without them, the Company would not have achieved the success it has\naccomplished since inception. We strive to provide a positive, supportive work culture with a clear global vision and a\ncollaborative work style. We strongly believe that a focus on learning and supporting career development can lead to success.\nAstronics Corporation regularly earns “best employer” awards.\nAs it relates to customers, investors, suppliers and partners, our Company is dedicated to conducting business with integrity and\nresponsibility for the greater good. We promote honest and ethical conduct, compliance with applicable government regulations\nand accountability by all of its directors, officers and employees.\nWhen considering an acquisition or partnership, we embed questions specific to human capital management within our due\ndiligence approach. These questions are in the areas of culture, equal employment opportunity, compliance with governing\nbodies, ethics, as well as employee benefits. We ask these in an effort to ensure that the acquisition candidate is a positive\ncultural fit and to minimize any risk when assessing the acquisition candidate.\n7\nIn addition, our Corporate Governance Guidelines outline expectations that the Board establish and promote policies that\nencourage a positive, supportive work culture. The Board recognizes that culture is critical to the long-term success of\nAstronics and our strategy.\nCompensation Programs and Employee Benefits\nWe believe that future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We\nprovide employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that\nenable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their\nlives, including;\n• Health and dental insurance\n• Generous paid time off\n• 401K, profit sharing, and bonus programs\n• Flexible spending accounts\n• Employee stock purchase plan\n• Disability and life insurance\n• Commute reduction, fitness, and tuition programs\n• Community service opportunities\nEmployee Engagement\nThe lifeblood of any organization is its employee base. We rely on our individual subsidiaries to regularly gather employee\nfeedback, using the method each subsidiary believes is most appropriate. In some instances that feedback is obtained through\n“Town Hall” formats; in other instances, it is obtained through surveys. We also expect our managers to solicit and, where\napplicable, use employee feedback to improve its business practices and working environment. We are proud to have received\nnumerous awards, recognizing both product quality as well as the ability to provide an excellent work environment.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nThe Company believes that diversity and inclusion is critical for the attraction and retention of top talent, and employs policies\nand procedures to recruit women and minority talent as well as policies to ensure pay equality. Astronics has an Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Policy whereby the Company commits to providing equal employment opportunity and affirmative\naction plans for all qualified employees and applicants without regard to race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity,\nreligion, national origin, disability, veteran status, age, marital status, pregnancy, genetic information or other legally protected\nstatus.\nHealth and Safety\nAstronics is committed to the safety of our customers and our employees. Each Astronics operation maintains environmental,\nhealth and safety policies and practices that seek to promote the operation of its businesses in a manner that is protective of the\nhealth and safety of the public and its employees.\nOur operations offer several health and welfare programs to employees to promote fitness and wellness and to encourage\npreventative healthcare. In addition, our employees are offered a confidential employee assistance program that provides\nprofessional counseling to employees and their family members. Also, many of our operations offer green space for employees\nto use during their breaks.\nAvailable information\nWe file our financial information and other materials as electronically required with the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”).

RISK FACTORS\nOur business faces many risks, and you should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other\ninformation included in this report, including the financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8, Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data, of this report, when deciding to invest in us. Any of the risks discussed below, or\nelsewhere in this report or in our other SEC filings, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results\nof operations. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial also may materially adversely\naffect our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future.\nMarket Risks\nThe loss of Boeing as a major customer or a significant reduction in business with this customer would reduce our sales\nand earnings. In 2023, 2022, and 2021 we had a concentration of sales to Boeing representing approximately 11.0%, 11.0%,\nand 10.0% of our sales, respectively. Revenue earned from sales to Boeing may decline or fluctuate significantly in the future.\nWe may not be able to offset any decline in sales from Boeing with sales from new customers or other existing customers. The\nloss of this customer or a significant reduction in business with them would significantly reduce our sales and earnings.\nAccordingly, a portion of our potential for success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage our relationship\nwith Boeing.\nThe markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions, conflicts and events, which\nmay cause our operating results to fluctuate. The markets we serve are sensitive to fluctuations in general business cycles,\nglobal pandemics, domestic and foreign governmental tariffs, trade and monetary policies, national and international conflicts,\nand economic conditions and events, and are facing varying levels of supply chain pressures from the residual impacts of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Domestic air travel has recovered from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and international travel\nutilizing primarily widebody aircraft is close to pre-pandemic levels. If a global health crisis, similar to the COVID-19\npandemic, we to occur in the future, we may find it difficult to access our existing financing or obtain additional financing and/\nor fund our operations and meet our debt service obligations. Any new pandemic or other future public health crisis, or a\nresurgence of COVID-19 or variants could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn our Aerospace segment, demand by the general aviation markets for our products is dependent upon several factors,\nincluding capital investment, product innovations, economic growth and wealth creation and technology upgrades. In addition,\nthe commercial airline industry is highly cyclical with significant downturns in the past and sensitive to such things as fuel price\nincreases, labor disputes, global economic conditions, availability of capital to fund new aircraft purchase and upgrades of\nexisting aircraft and passenger demand. A change in any of these factors could result in a further reduction in the amount of air\ntravel and the ability of airlines to invest in new aircraft or to upgrade existing aircraft. Therefore, our business is directly\naffected by economic factors and other trends that affect our customers in the commercial aerospace industry. These factors\nwould reduce orders for new aircraft and would likely reduce airlines’ spending for cabin upgrades for which we supply\n9\nproducts, thus reducing our sales and profits. A reduction in air travel may also result in our commercial airline customers being\nunable to pay our invoices on a timely basis or at all.\nWe are a supplier on various new aircraft programs just entering or expected to begin production in the future. As with any new\nprogram, there is risk as to whether the aircraft or program will be successful and accepted by the market. As is customary for\nour business, we purchase inventory and invest in specific capital equipment to support our production requirements generally\nbased on delivery schedules provided by our customer. If a program or aircraft is not successful, we may have to write-off all or\na part of the inventory, accounts receivable and capital equipment related to the program. A write-off of these assets could\nresult in a significant reduction of earnings and cause covenant violations relating to our debt agreements. This could result in\nour being unable to borrow additional funds under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance or renegotiate the terms\nof our indebtedness.\nIn our Test Systems segment, the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers\naccounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. In any one reporting period, a single customer or several\ncustomers may contribute an even larger percentage of our consolidated sales. In addition, our ability to increase sales will\ndepend, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers. The opportunities to obtain orders\nfrom these customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow sales. We expect that sales of our Test Systems\nproducts will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future.\nAdditionally, demand for some of our test products is dependent upon government funding levels for our products, our ability\nto compete successfully for those contracts and our ability to develop products to satisfy the demands of our customers.\nOur products are sold in highly competitive markets. Some of our competitors are larger, more diversified corporations and\nhave greater financial, marketing, production and research and development resources than we do. As a result, they may be\nbetter able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns or other market changing events. Our operations and\nfinancial performance will be negatively impacted if our competitors:\n• develop products that are superior to our products;\n• develop products that are more competitively priced than our products;\n• develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services; or\n• adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.\nWe believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality, price, design and engineering\ncapabilities, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of support after the sale, timeliness of delivery\nand effectiveness of the distribution organization. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued\ninvestment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution\nnetworks. If we do not maintain, or are otherwise unable to maintain, sufficient resources to make these investments, or are not\nsuccessful in maintaining our competitive position, our business operations and financial performance will suffer.\nWe depend on government contracts and subcontracts with defense prime contractors and subcontractors that may not\nbe fully funded, may be terminated, or may be awarded to our competitors. The failure to be awarded these contracts,\nthe failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales. Sales to the\nU.S. government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business. The funding of\nthese programs is generally subject to annual congressional appropriations, and congressional priorities are subject to change.\nWe cannot be certain that current levels of congressional funding for programs involving our products or services will continue\nand that our business related to these products and services will not decline or increase at currently anticipated levels, or that we\nwill not be subject to delays in the negotiation of contracts or increased costs due to changes in the funding of U.S. government\nprograms or government shutdowns. In addition, government expenditures for defense programs may decline or these defense\nprograms may be terminated. A decline in governmental expenditures, a change in spending priorities (e.g., shifting funds to\nassist Ukraine in the Russia and Ukraine conflict), or the termination of existing contracts may result in a reduction in the\nvolume of contracts awarded to us. Furthermore, on contracts for which we are a subcontractor and not the prime contractor, the\nU.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, irrespective of our performance as a\nsubcontractor. Also, sales to the U.S. government and its contractors as well as foreign military and government customers,\neither directly or as a subcontractor to other contractors, often use a competitive bidding process and have unique purchasing\nand delivery requirements, which often makes the timing of sales to these customers unpredictable. We have resources applied\nto specific government contracts and if any of those contracts were terminated, we may incur substantial costs redeploying\nthose resources.\nContracting in the defense industry is subject to significant regulation, including rules related to bidding, billing and\naccounting kickbacks and false claims, and any non-compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or possible\ndebarment. Like all government contractors, we are subject to risks associated with this contracting. These risks include the\n10\npotential for substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow\nprocurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting\nstandards, receiving or paying kickbacks or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits\nand investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our\nbusiness reputation, which could significantly reduce our sales and earnings. It could also result in our suspension or debarment\nfrom future government contracts, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and\ncash flows.\nStrategic Risks\nIf we are unable to adapt to technological change, demand for our products may be reduced. The technologies related to\nour products have undergone, and in the future may undergo, significant changes. To succeed in the future, we will need to\ncontinue to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and\ncost-effective basis, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so successfully, if at all, or on a timely, cost effective,\nor repeatable basis. Our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we develop or\nthat render our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive. Furthermore, our products could become unmarketable if\nnew industry standards emerge. We may have to modify our products significantly in the future to remain competitive, and new\nproducts we introduce may not be accepted by our customers.\nOur new product development efforts may not be successful, which would result in a reduction in our sales and\nearnings. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development of new products or product\nenhancements, and new products or product enhancements may not be accepted by our customers. Because it is generally not\npossible to predict the amount of time required and the costs involved in achieving certain research, development, and\nengineering objectives, the development expenses we incur may exceed our cost estimates and estimated product development\nschedules may be extended. Furthermore, any new products we develop may not generate sales sufficient to offset our costs. If\nany of these events occur, our sales and profits could be adversely affected.\nWe may incur losses and liabilities as a result of our acquisition strategy. Growth by acquisition involves risks that could\nadversely affect our financial condition and operating results, including:\n• the potential exposure to unanticipated liabilities;\n• the potential that expected benefits or synergies are not realized and that operating costs increase;\n• the risks associated with incurring additional acquisition indebtedness, including that additional indebtedness could\nlimit our cash flow availability for operations and our flexibility;\n• difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies;\n• the potential loss of key employees, suppliers or customers of acquired businesses; and\n• diversion of management time and attention from our core business.\nIn addition, any acquisition, once successfully integrated, could negatively impact our financial performance if it does not\nperform as planned, does not increase earnings, or does not prove otherwise to be beneficial to us.\nOperational Risks\nOur business and operations could be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology\ninfrastructure or adversely impacted by a successful cyber-attack. We are dependent on various information technologies\nthroughout our Company to administer, store and support multiple business activities. We routinely experience various\ncybersecurity threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure, unauthorized attempts to gain access to our Company\nsensitive information, and denial-of-service attacks as do our customers, suppliers and subcontractors. We conduct regular\nperiodic training of our employees as to the protection of sensitive information which includes security awareness training\nintended to prevent the success of “phishing” attacks.\nThe threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries, such as ransomware attacks to disable critical infrastructure\nand extort companies for ransom payments, to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation\nstates, which target us and other defense contractors because we protect sensitive information. If we are unable to protect\nsensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and\ndetection processes and procedures, and depending on the severity of the incident, our customers’ data, our employees’ data,\nour intellectual property, and other third-party data (such as subcontractors, suppliers and vendors) could be compromised. As a\nconsequence of their persistence, sophistication and volume, we may not be successful in defending against all such attacks.\nDue to the evolving nature of these security threats, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.\n11\nAlthough we work cooperatively with our customers, suppliers, and subcontractors to seek to minimize the impact of cyber\nthreats, other security threats or business disruptions, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by these entities, which may\naffect the security of our information. These entities have varying levels of cybersecurity expertise and safeguards and their\nrelationships with U.S. government contractors, such as Astronics, may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the\nsame cyber threats we face.\nIf we experience a data security breach from an external source or from an insider threat, we may have a loss in sales or\nincreased costs arising from the restoration or implementation of additional security measures, either of which could adversely\naffect our business and financial results. Other potential costs could include damage to our reputation, loss of brand value,\nincident response costs, loss of stock market value, regulatory inquiries, litigation and management distraction. A security\nbreach that involves classified information could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, loss of a government contract, loss of\naccess to classified information, or debarment as a government contractor. Similarly, a breach that involves loss of customer-\nprovided data could subject us to loss of a customer, loss of a contract, litigation costs and legal damages and reputational harm.\nOur inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property or defend against assertions of infringement\ncould prevent or restrict our ability to compete. We rely on patents, trademarks and proprietary knowledge and technology,\nboth internally developed and acquired, in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Our inability to defend against the\nunauthorized use of these rights and assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We\ncannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the United States or abroad will be adequate, or that\nothers will not develop technologies similar or superior to our technology or design around our proprietary rights. Litigation\nmay be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement. This litigation could result\nin significant costs and divert our management’s focus away from operations. Refer to the risk factor related to pending patent\ninfringement litigation below and Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data, of this report for further discussion.\nIf critical components or raw materials used to manufacture our products or used in our development programs become\nscarce or unavailable, then we may incur delays in manufacturing and delivery of our products and in completing our\ndevelopment programs, which has damaged, and could continue to damage, our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition. Due to increased demand across a range of industries, the global supply chain for certain critical\ncomponents or raw materials used in the manufacture of our products and used in our development programs has experienced,\nand may in future periods experience, significant strain in recent periods. Residual impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have\ncontributed to and exacerbated this strain to varying degrees. This constrained supply environment has adversely affected, and\ncould further affect, availability, lead times and the cost of components, and could impact our ability to timely complete\ndevelopment programs, respond to accelerated or quick-turn delivery requests from customers, or meet customer demand and\nproduct delivery dates for our end customers in situations where we cannot timely secure adequate supply of these components.\nMoreover, if any of our suppliers become financially unstable, or otherwise unable or unwilling to provide us with raw\nmaterials or components, then we may have to find new suppliers. It may take several months to locate alternative suppliers, if\nrequired, or to redesign our products to accommodate components from different suppliers. We may experience significant\ndelays in manufacturing and shipping our products to customers and incur additional development, manufacturing and other\ncosts to establish alternative sources of supply if we lose any of these sources or are required to redesign our products. We\ncannot predict if we will be able to obtain replacement components within the time frames that we require at an acceptable cost,\nif at all.\nIn an effort to mitigate these risks, in some cases, we have incurred higher costs to secure available inventory, or have extended\nor placed non-cancellable purchase commitments with suppliers, which introduces inventory risk if our forecasts and\nassumptions prove inaccurate. While we may attempt to recover the increased costs through price increases to our customers,\nwe may be unable to mitigate the effect on our results of operations. We have also multi-sourced and pre-ordered components\nand raw materials inventory in some cases in an effort to reduce the impact of the adverse supply chain conditions we have\nexperienced. Despite our attempts to mitigate the impact on our business, these constrained supply conditions are expected to\nadversely impact our costs of goods sold, including our ability to continue to reduce the cost to produce our products in a\nmanner consistent with prior periods. In addition, some suppliers have indicated that, as a result of current shortages, they\nintend to cease manufacture of certain components used in our products. Limits on manufacturing availability or capacity or\ndelays in production or delivery of components or raw materials could further delay or inhibit our ability to obtain supply of\ncomponents and produce finished goods. These supply chain constraints and their related challenges could result in shortages,\nincreased material costs or use of cash, engineering design changes, and delays in new product introductions, each of which\ncould adversely impact our growth, gross margin and financial results. These types of negative financial impacts on our\nbusiness may become more acute if supply chain pressures increase.\nOur financial results could continue to be adversely impacted by the escalation of labor and benefit costs. Consistent with\nthe experience of other employers, our labor, medical and workers’ compensation costs have increased substantially in recent\n12\nyears and are expected to continue to rise. If this trend continues, the cost of labor and to provide healthcare and other benefits\nto our employees could continue to increase, adversely impacting our future profitability. Competition for employees has\nescalated in the labor market which has increased costs associated with attracting and retaining employees. We cannot be\ncertain that we will be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently or that our labor costs\nwill not increase as a result of a shortage in the availability of skilled employees. Changes to healthcare regulations involving\nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may also increase the cost of providing such benefits to our employees. We\ncannot predict the ultimate content, timing, or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation or\nrelated proposals and policies on our results. Any significant increases in the costs attributable to our self-insured health and\nworkers’ compensation plans could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nPrice inflation for labor and materials, further exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine or the Israel-Hamas\nwar, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have experienced considerable\nprice inflation in our costs for labor and materials in recent years, which has adversely affected our business, results of\noperations and financial condition. We may not be able to pass through inflationary cost increases under our existing fixed-\nprice contracts. Our ability to raise prices to reflect increased costs may be limited by competitive conditions in the market for\nour products and services. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, and prolonged conflict in either such\nsituation, may continue to result in increased inflation, escalating energy and commodity prices and increasing costs of\nmaterials. We continue to work to mitigate such pressures on our business operations as they develop. To the extent the war in\nUkraine or the Israel-Hamas war adversely affects our business as discussed above, it may also have the effect of heightening\nmany of the other risks described herein, such as those relating to cybersecurity, supply chain, volatility in prices and market\nconditions, any of which could negatively affect our business and financial condition.\nIf our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our prime contract performance and our ability to\nobtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted. Many of our contracts involve subcontracts with other\ncompanies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers. There is a risk that we\nmay have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the\nsubcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor. Failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide, on a timely\nbasis, the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform\nour obligations with our customer and could result in the assessment of late delivery penalties. Subcontractor performance\ndeficiencies could result in a customer terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability\nand substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders.\nSome of our contracts contain late delivery penalties. Failure to deliver in a timely manner due to supplier and supply chain\nproblems, labor availability, development schedule slides, manufacturing difficulties, or similar schedule-related events could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business. No significant penalties have been incurred to date.\nOur results of operations are affected by our fixed-price contracts, which could subject us to losses in the event that we\nhave cost overruns. For the year ended December 31, 2023, fixed-price contracts represented almost all of the Company’s\nsales. On fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the scope of work specified in the contract for a predetermined price.\nDepending on the fixed price negotiated, these contracts may provide us with an opportunity to achieve higher profits based on\nthe relationship between our costs and the contract’s fixed price. However, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs\nmay reduce our profit or cause us to incur a loss on the contract, which would reduce our net earnings. Because our ability to\nterminate contracts is generally limited, we may not be able to terminate our performance requirements under these contracts at\nall or without substantial liability and, therefore, in the event we are sustaining reduced profits or losses, we could continue to\nsustain these reduced profits or losses for the duration of the contract term.\nThe failure of our products may damage our reputation, necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that\nexceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages. Defects in the design and manufacture of\nour products may necessitate a product recall. We include complex system design and components in our products that could\ncontain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products. If any of our products are\ndefective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such an\nevent could result in significant expenses, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products. We are also exposed\nto product liability claims. We carry aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms.\nHowever, this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any potential claim. Additionally, should\ninsurance market conditions change, aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance coverage may not be available in the\nfuture at a cost acceptable to us. A product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations depend on our manufacturing facilities, which are subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt\nproduction. Our manufacturing facilities or our customers' facilities could be damaged or disrupted by a natural disaster, war,\n13\nor terrorist activity. We maintain property damage and business interruption insurance at the levels typical in our industry or for\nour customers and suppliers, however, a pandemic or other major catastrophe, such as an earthquake, hurricane, fire, flood,\ntornado or other natural disaster at any of our sites, or war or terrorist activities in any of the areas where we conduct operations\ncould result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant\ndelays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers, and we may not have insurance to adequately compensate\nus for any of these events. For leased facilities, timely renewal of leases and risk mitigation from the sale of our leased facilities\nis required to avoid any business interruption.\nWe may be subject to work stoppages at our facilities or those of our principal customers and suppliers, which could\nseriously impact the profitability of our business. Many aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and aerospace suppliers have\nunionized work forces. Any strikes, work stoppages, or slowdowns experienced by aircraft manufacturers, airlines, or aerospace\nsuppliers could reduce our customers’ demand for additional aircraft structures or prevent us from completing production of our\nproducts.\nA small percentage of our workforce is represented by unions. If we were unable to renew our labor agreements at expiration,\nor if our workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, we could experience a disruption of our\noperations, which could cause us to be unable to deliver products to certain of our customers on a timely basis and could result\nin a breach of such supply agreements. This could negatively impact our results. In addition, our non-unionized labor force may\nbecome subject to labor union organizing efforts, which could cause us to incur additional labor costs and increase the related\nrisks that we now face.\nThe construction of aircraft is heavily regulated, and failure to comply with applicable laws could reduce our sales or\nrequire us to incur additional costs to achieve compliance, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with new or\nmore stringent governmental regulation. The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the United States by the FAA and in\nother countries by similar agencies. We must be certified by the FAA and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to\nengineer and service parts, components and aerostructures used in specific aircraft models. If any of our material authorizations\nor approvals were revoked or suspended, our operations would be adversely affected. New or more stringent governmental\nregulations may be adopted, or industry oversight heightened in the future, and we may incur significant expenses to comply\nwith any new regulations or any heightened industry oversight. In addition, in January 2024, the FAA ordered the temporary\ngrounding of Boeing 737-9 MAX aircraft as a result of an incident where a Boeing 737-9 MAX lost a “door plug.” This\nincident and the subsequent investigation, and the potential for more issues to be identified during further investigations, could\nresult in a suspension or reduction of manufacturing of 737 MAX aircraft by Boeing. Air travelers may also respond negatively\nto the 737 MAX aircraft due to perceived safety concerns, which would negatively impact Boeing. Boeing is a major customer\nof ours and any financial or customer losses it suffers may result in a negative impact on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nFinancial Risks\nWe have incurred losses in prior fiscal years and our future profitability is not certain. For the year ended December 31,\n2023, we incurred net loss of $26.4 million. Our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and\nwe cannot be certain that we will be profitable or that we will not experience substantial net losses in the future. If we are not\nable to increase revenue or reduce our costs, we may not be able to achieve profitability in future periods and our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nOur ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility contain financial and restrictive covenants that we may be\nunable to satisfy, and that, if not satisfied, could result in the acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness thereunder\nand limit our ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the terms of our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term\nLoan Facility contain covenants that restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to take certain\nactions. Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility each subject us to various financial and other affirmative\nand negative covenants with which we must comply on an ongoing or periodic basis. These include financial covenants\npertaining to minimum trailing four quarter EBITDA requirements, minimum liquidity requirements, minimum fixed charge\ncoverage ratio requirements, maximum capital expenditure requirements, and excess cash flow repayment provisions. An\nunexpected decline in our revenues or operating income, including occurring as a result of events beyond our control, could\ncause us to violate our financial covenants. A covenant violation could result in a default under the ABL Revolving Credit\nFacility and Term Loan Facility. If any such default occurs, the lenders may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings,\ntogether with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. Further, as the amount\navailable to us under our credit facilities is subject to borrowing base calculations determined by the value of accounts\nreceivable and inventory (under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility) and real estate and fixed assets (under our Term Loan\nFacility), an unexpected decline in the value of these assets would require a mandatory prepayment. If any of these events were\nto occur, we may not be able to pay our debts and other monetary obligations as they come due, and our ability to continue to\n14\noperate as a going concern could be impaired, which could in turn cause a significant decline in our stock price and could result\nin a significant loss of value for our shareholders. Furthermore, the lenders also have the right in these circumstances to\nterminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings, which could leave us without access to sufficient liquidity\nto operate our business. In addition, following an event of default, the lenders under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and\nTerm Loan Facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes our\navailable accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, real estate and intellectual property. If the debt under the\nABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be\nsufficient to repay in full our debt.\nAdditionally, our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility also contain a number of restrictive covenants that\nimpose significant operating and financial restrictions on the Company and our subsidiaries and may limit our ability to engage\nin acts that we believe to be in our long-term best interests. The ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility include\ncovenants restricting, among other things, the ability of the Company and our subsidiaries to:\n• incur additional indebtedness;\n• pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock;\n• make certain acquisitions or investments;\n• sell assets; and\n• engage in certain business activities.\nThe amount of debt we have outstanding, as well as any debt we may incur in the future, could have an adverse effect on\nour operational and financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $172.5 million of debt outstanding.\nChanges to our level of debt subsequent to December 31, 2023 could have significant consequences to our business, including\nthe following:\n• Depending on interest rates and debt maturities, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be\ndedicated to paying principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for our acquisition strategy,\ncapital expenditures or other purposes;\n• A significant amount of additional debt could make us more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions or increases\nin prevailing interest rates;\n• Our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, capital expenditures or for other purposes could be impaired;\n• The increase in the amount of debt we have outstanding and the associated interest expense increases the risk of non-\ncompliance with some of the covenants in our debt agreements which require us to maintain specified financial ratios;\nand\n• We may be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may result in a competitive disadvantage.\nSubject to the limits contained in our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility, we may incur additional debt\nfrom time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do\nso, the risks described above related to our debt could intensify.\nWe are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks that could adversely affect our business, liquidity and\noperating results. Changes in the availability, terms and cost of capital, and increases in interest rates could cause our cost of\ndoing business to increase and place us at a competitive disadvantage. At December 31, 2023, all of our debt was subject to\nvariable interest rates.\nA write-off of all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our operating results and net\nworth. At December 31, 2023, goodwill and net intangible assets were approximately 9.2% and 10.3% of our total assets,\nrespectively. We had no goodwill impairment charges during 2023, 2022 or 2021. Our goodwill and other intangible assets may\nincrease in the future since our strategy includes growing through acquisitions. We may have to write-off all or part of our\ngoodwill or purchased intangible assets if their value becomes impaired. Although this write-off would not result in an outlay of\ncash and is not included in the financial covenant calculation, it could reduce our earnings and net worth significantly.\nOur future operating results could be impacted by estimates used to calculate impairment losses on goodwill and long-\nlived assets. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires\nmanagement to make significant and subjective estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of tangible and\nintangible long-lived assets, including goodwill, in the financial statements. These estimates are integral in the determination of\nwhether a potential non-cash impairment loss exists as well as the calculation of that loss. Actual future results could differ\nfrom those estimates. We had no such asset impairment charges in 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nChanges in discount rates and other estimates could affect our future earnings and equity. Our goodwill asset impairment\nevaluations are determined using valuations that involve several assumptions, including discount rates, cash flow estimates,\n15\ngrowth rates and terminal values. Certain of these assumptions, particularly the discount rate, are based on market conditions\nand are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity.\nAdditionally, pension obligations and the related costs are determined using actual results and actuarial valuations that involve\nseveral assumptions. The most critical assumption is the discount rate. Other assumptions include mortality, salary and bonus\nlevels and retirement age. The discount rate assumptions are based on current market conditions and are outside of our control.\nChanges in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those\nwith retroactive effect, could result in increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows. For example,\nbeginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures\nimmediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years for tax purposes. The\nmost significant impact of this provision is to the cash tax liability for 2023 (as the liability for 2022 is partially offset by certain\ntax credits and loss carryforwards); the impact will decline annually thereafter over the five-year amortization period to an\nimmaterial amount in year six.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nWe currently are involved in, and may become involved in the future in, legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated\nor settled, could materially and adversely impact our financial condition. As an aerospace company, we may become a\nparty to litigation, including, among others, matters alleging product liability, warranty claims, intellectual property\ninfringement, breach of commercial or government contract or other legal actions. In general, litigation claims can be expensive\nand time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly and adversely\nimpact our results of operations and financial condition.\nCurrently, our AES subsidiary is a defendant in actions filed in various jurisdictions by Lufthansa Technik AG relating\nto an allegation of patent infringement and based on rulings to date we have concluded that losses related to these\nproceedings are probable. If these actions are decided adversely against the Company, the associated damages could result in\na material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nRefer to Note 19 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this\nreport for discussion on this and other legal proceedings. Other than these proceedings, we are not party to any significant\npending legal proceedings that management believes will result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or\nfinancial condition.\nOur operations in foreign countries expose us to political and currency risks and adverse changes in local legal and\nregulatory environments. In 2023, approximately 10% of our sales were made by our subsidiaries in foreign countries,\npredominately in our subsidiaries in France and Canada. Net assets held by our foreign subsidiaries total $39.1 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. Approximately 25% of our consolidated sales in 2023 were made to customers outside of the United\nStates. Our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies and by the translation of the\nfinancial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currencies into U.S. dollars. We expect international operations and\nexport sales to continue to contribute to our earnings for the foreseeable future. Both the sales from international operations and\nexport sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside of the U.S. Such risks include the\npossibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations, changes in tariff and trade barriers and\nimport or export licensing requirements, and political or economic reprioritization, insurrection, civil disturbance or war.\nGovernment regulations could limit our ability to sell our products outside the U.S. and could otherwise adversely affect\nour business. Certain of our sales are subject to compliance with U.S. export regulations. Our failure to obtain, or fully adhere\nto the limitations contained in, the requisite licenses, meet registration standards or comply with other government export\nregulations would hinder our ability to generate sales of our products outside the U.S. Compliance with these government\nregulations may also subject us to additional fees and operating costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in\nother countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In order to sell our products in European Union countries, we\nmust satisfy certain technical requirements. If we are unable to comply with those requirements with respect to a significant\nquantity of our products, our sales in Europe would be restricted. Doing business internationally also subjects us to numerous\nU.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions,\nforeign corrupt practices and anti-boycott provisions. Our failure, or failure by an authorized agent or representative that is\nattributable to us, to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities and could,\nin the extreme case, result in monetary penalties, suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our\nexport privileges, which would have a material adverse effect on us.\n16\nTrade policies, treaties, and tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business is dependent on the\navailability of raw materials and components for our products, particularly electrical components common in the semiconductor\nindustry. There is continued uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and various other countries,\nmost significantly China, with respect to trade policies, treaties, tariffs, and taxes. Changes in U.S. administrative policy could\nlead to changes in existing trade agreements, greater restrictions on free trade generally, and significant increases in tariffs on\ngoods imported into the United States, particularly tariffs on products manufactures in China and Mexico, among other possible\nchanges. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, could have a material effect on global economic\nconditions and the stability of global financial markets, and could significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade\nbetween the impacted nations and the United States.\nThis uncertainty includes: (i) the possibility of altering the existing tariffs or penalties on products manufactured outside the\nUnited States, including the U.S. government’s 25% tariff on a range of products from China; (ii) the effects stemming from the\nremoval of such previously imposed tariffs; (iii) subsequent tariffs imposed by the United States on any other U.S. trading\npartners such as Russia; and (iv) potential tariffs imposed by trading partners on U.S. goods. The institution of trade tariffs on\nitems imported by us from other countries could increase our costs, which could have a negative impact on our business.\nWe cannot predict whether, and to what extent, there may be changes to international trade agreements or whether quotas,\nduties, tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions on our products will be changed or imposed. In addition, an open conflict\nor war across any region could affect our ability to obtain raw materials. For example, the current military conflict between\nRussia and Ukraine, and related sanctions, export controls or other actions that may be initiated by nations, including the United\nStates, the European Union or Russia (e.g., potential cyberattacks, disruption of energy flows, etc.) or potential sanctions or\nrelevant export controls related to China or Taiwan could adversely affect our business and/or our supply chain or our business\npartners or customers in other countries beyond Russia and Ukraine. Although we currently maintain alternative sources for raw\nmaterials, if we are unable to source our products from the countries where we wish to purchase them, either because of the\noccurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts, regulatory changes or for any other reason, or if the cost of doing so increases, it\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Disruptions in the supply of\nraw materials and components could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers or require us\nto pay higher prices to obtain these raw materials or components from other sources, which could have a material adverse effect\non our business and our results of operations.\nWe may face reputational, regulatory or financial risks from a perceived, or an actual, failure to achieve our\nsustainability goals. The increased focus on sustainability practices and disclosures is rapidly evolving, as is the criteria to\nmeasure our sustainability performance; both of which could result in greater expectations and may cause us to undertake costly\ninitiatives to satisfy the evolving criteria. As we advance our sustainable business model, we are pursuing programs that we\nbelieve will improve our environmental practices, social engagement and how we govern ourselves. We periodically publish\ninformation about our sustainability goals, standards and frameworks. Achievement of these objectives is subject to risks and\nuncertainties, many of which are outside of our direct control, and it is possible we may fail, or be perceived to have failed, in\nthe achievement of our sustainability goals. Also, certain customers, associates, shareholders, investors, suppliers, business\npartners, government agencies and non-governmental organizations may not be satisfied with our sustainability efforts. A\nfailure or perceived failure of our sustainability goals could negatively affect our reputation and our results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. The accuracy and appropriateness\nof certain costs and expenses used to substantiate our direct and indirect costs for the U.S. Government contracts are subject to\nextensive regulation and audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency, an arm of the U.S. Department of Defense (“USDOD”).\nSuch audits and reviews could result in adjustments to our contract costs and profitability. However, we cannot ensure the\noutcome of any future audits and adjustments may be required to reduce net sales or profits upon completion and final\nnegotiation of audits. If any audit or review were to uncover inaccurate costs or improper activities, we could be subject to\npenalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension\nor prohibition from conducting future business with the U.S. Government. Any such outcome could have a material adverse\neffect on our financial results.\nWe are subject to the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual for facility security\nclearance, which is a prerequisite for our ability to perform on classified contracts for the U.S. Government. USDOD\nfacility security clearance is required in order to be awarded and be able to perform on classified contracts for the USDOD and\ncertain other agencies of the U.S. Government, which is a significant part of our business. We have obtained clearance at\nappropriate levels that require stringent qualifications, and we may be required to seek higher level clearances in the future. We\ncannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our security clearance. If for some reason our security clearance is\ninvalidated or terminated, we may not be able to continue to perform our present classified contracts or be able to enter into new\nclassified contracts, which could affect our ability to compete for and capture new business.\n17\nOur business is subject to regulation in the United States and internationally. The manufacturing of our products is subject\nto numerous federal, state and foreign governmental regulations. The number of laws and regulations that are being enacted or\nproposed by various governmental bodies and authorities is increasing. Compliance with these regulations is difficult and\nexpensive. If we fail to adhere, or are alleged to have failed to adhere, to any applicable federal, state, or foreign laws or\nregulations, or if such laws or regulations negatively affect sales of our products, our business, prospects, results of operations,\nfinancial condition or cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, our future results could be adversely affected by\nchanges in applicable federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, including\nthose relating to manufacturing processes, product liability, government contracts, trade rules and customs regulations,\nintellectual property, consumer laws, privacy laws, environmental protection, climate change, as well as accounting standards\nand taxation requirements (including tax-rate changes, new tax laws or revised tax law interpretations).\nGeneral Risks\nOur future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team and\ntechnical personnel. The loss of members of our management team could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, competition for qualified technical personnel in our industry is intense, and we believe that our future growth and\nsuccess will depend on our ability to attract, train and retain such personnel.\nFuture terror attacks, war, or other civil disturbances could negatively impact our business. Continued terror attacks, war\nor other disturbances could lead to economic instability and decreases in demand for our products, which could negatively\nimpact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks world-wide have caused instability from\ntime to time in global financial markets and the aviation industry. The long-term effects of terrorist attacks on us are unknown.\nThese attacks and the U.S. government’s continued efforts against terrorist organizations may lead to additional armed\nhostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the U.S. or elsewhere, which may further contribute to\neconomic instability.\nIf we fail to meet expectations of securities analysts or investors due to fluctuations in our sales or operating results, our\nstock price could decline significantly. Our sales and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of\nfactors, including delays or cancellations of programs and supply chain challenges on revenues and costs. It is likely that in\nsome future quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. In this event, the\ntrading price of our stock could decline significantly.\nOur stock price is volatile. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our stock price ranged from a low of $10.14 to a high of\n$22.01. The price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a\nnumber of events and factors, such as:\n• our ability to comply with the financial and other affirmative and negative covenants included in our ABL Revolving\nCredit Facility and Term Loan Facility;\n• quarterly variations in operating results;\n• variances of our quarterly results of operations from securities analyst estimates;\n• changes in financial estimates;\n• announcements of technological innovations and new products;\n• news reports relating to trends in our markets or adverse happenings at our customers;\n• the cancellation of major contracts or programs with our customers; and\n• residual impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aerospace industry and our Company.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies in the aerospace and defense industry in particular,\nhave experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the\ncompanies affected by these fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our\ncommon stock, regardless of our operating performance. Global health crises, similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the\nbreadth of its impact worldwide, and particularly on the aerospace industry, could also cause significant volatility in the market\nprice.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\n18\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nWe recognize the critical importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity\nthreats. Our cybersecurity strategy prioritizes detection, analysis and response to known, anticipated or unexpected threats,\neffective management of security risks, and resiliency against incidents. This strategy is supported by both management and our\nBoard of Directors.\nWe continuously strive to surpass industry best practices by implementing robust risk-based controls aimed at safeguarding\nboth our partners’ and the Company’s information systems. In order to protect both commercial and defense-related businesses\nand support our production operations, the Company has adopted security principles in accordance with the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework, contractual requirements and other global standards. We conduct\ncomprehensive annual security assessments, including external and internal penetration tests, social engineering attacks, and\nvulnerability assessments. These assessments provide critical insights into our security posture and help us identify and address\npotential weaknesses proactively. Leveraging the expertise of multiple vendors, we ensure a thorough evaluation from diverse\nperspectives, enhancing the effectiveness of our security measures. Furthermore, as we implement solutions, we engage with\nindustry-leading partners to receive guidance on best practices for solution use and overall security. This collaboration ensures\nthat our cybersecurity strategies align with the latest industry standards and best practices. We also maintain regular\ncommunication with external partners to stay abreast of current cybersecurity trends and emerging threats. This proactive\napproach enables us to continuously enhance our security posture and adapt our defenses to evolving cyber risks.\nThe Company’s Director of Information Technology (“IT”), who reports to our CFO, has over 20 years of experience leading\ncyber security oversight and is responsible for management of cybersecurity risk and the protection and defense of our networks\nand systems. Our IT security team, lead by the Director of IT, consists of professionals with broad cybersecurity experiences,\nincluding a number of cybersecurity certifications and degrees. Our cybersecurity initiatives benefit from a wealth of practical\nknowledge and strategic insight. The IT security teams’ comprehensive understanding of industry best practices, combined with\nhands-on experience in implementing cybersecurity solutions, ensures that our networks and systems are effectively protected\nagainst emerging threats. As a result, cybersecurity remains a top priority across the organization, with resources allocated\nefficiently to mitigate risks and enhance our overall security posture.\nThe Board of Directors oversees an enterprise-wide approach to risk management, designed to support the achievement of\norganizational objectives, including strategic objectives, to improve long-term organizational performance and enhance\nshareholder value. The Director of IT provides a report to the Board of Directors on an annual basis, or more frequently as\nneeded, with respect to information security activity, security assessments, controls and investments.\nWe have a set of Company-wide policies and procedures concerning cybersecurity matters. The Company’s Incident\nManagement Policy provides a framework for reporting and managing security incidents affecting the Company’s information\nand business computing devices and systems, losses of information, and information security concerns. All users, including\nemployees, contractors, consultants, suppliers, customers, government, and all personnel affiliated with third parties that\nperform work for the Company, are obligated to report information security incidents in order to mitigate the consequences and\nreduce the risk of future breaches of security. Our incident response process consists of several principal steps, including 1)\npreparation for a cybersecurity incident, 2) detection of a security incident and assignment to the appropriate IT personnel, 3)\nidentification and preservation of evidence, and 4) risk assessment. Depending on the nature and severity of an incident,\nnotifications are escalated to our CEO and the Board of Directors and, if determined to be material, externally. The incident\nmanagement process is overseen by the Director of IT. The Company maintains additional policies that directly or indirectly\nrelate to cybersecurity, such as policies related to encryption standards, mobile devices and data destruction. These policies go\nthrough an internal review process and are approved by appropriate members of management.\nOur IT security team reviews enterprise risk management-level cybersecurity risks annually. The following key risk elements\nare evaluated:\n• Insiders – Whether intentional or unintentional, individuals within our Company may cause damage to our systems.\nWe have processes in place to seek to mitigate these threats, including but not limited to controls over access to our\nsystems and access to network resources.\n• External threats – We recognize the risk that hackers, vandals, and saboteurs may seek to gain access to information\ncontained in our systems. We employ multi-layered defense and continuous monitoring to seek to mitigate the risk\nassociated with these threats. The Company also conducts regular periodic training of its employees as to the\nprotection of sensitive information which includes security awareness training intended to prevent the success of\n“phishing” attacks.\n19\n• Third-party risks – We also consider and evaluate cybersecurity risks associated with use of third-party service\nproviders. User access to third-party systems is reviewed annually, and we obtain and review a System and\nOrganization Controls (SOC) 1 or SOC 2 report from key third-party service providers.\nKey cybersecurity risks and mitigating responses are addressed within our Company-wide policies.\nWhile we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past, to date none have materially affected the Company or our\nfinancial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. However, the risks from cybersecurity threats and incidents continue\nto increase, and the preventative actions we have taken and continue to take to reduce the risk of cybersecurity threats and\nincidents may not successfully protect against all such threats and incidents. We continue to invest in the cybersecurity and\nresiliency of our networks and to enhance our internal controls and processes, which are designed to help protect our systems\nand infrastructure, and the information they contain. For more information regarding the risks we face from cybersecurity\nthreats, please see Item 1A, Risk Factors, under the heading “Our business and operations could be adversely impacted in the\nevent of a failure of our information technology infrastructure or adversely impacted by a successful cyber-attack.”\nITEM 2.

[Reserved]\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nAstronics Corporation, through its subsidiaries, is a leading supplier of advanced technologies and products to the global\naerospace and defense industries. Our products and services include advanced, high-performance electrical power generation\nand distribution systems, seat motion solutions, lighting and safety systems, avionics products, aircraft structures, systems\ncertification, and automated test systems.\nWe have two reportable segments, Aerospace and Test Systems. Our Aerospace segment has principal operating facilities in the\nUnited States, Canada and France. Our Test Systems segment has principal operating facilities in the United States and the\nUnited Kingdom. We have engineering offices in Ukraine and India.\nOur Aerospace segment designs and manufactures products for the global aerospace industry. Product lines include lighting and\nsafety systems, electrical power generation, distribution and seat motion systems, aircraft structures, avionics products, systems\ncertification, and other products. Our primary Aerospace customers are the airframe manufacturers (“OEM”) that build aircraft\nfor the commercial transport, military and general aviation markets, suppliers to those OEMs, aircraft operators such as airlines,\nsuppliers to the aircraft operators, and branches of the U.S. Department of Defense (“USDOD”). Our Test Systems segment\ndesigns, develops, manufactures and maintains automated test systems that support the aerospace and defense and mass transit\nindustries as well as training and simulation devices for both commercial and military applications. In the Test Systems\nsegment, Astronics’ products are sold to a global customer base including OEMs and prime government contractors for both\nelectronics and military products.\nOur strategy is to increase our value by developing technologies and capabilities, either internally or through acquisition, and\nusing those capabilities to provide innovative solutions to our targeted markets where our technology can be beneficial.\nImportant factors affecting our growth and profitability are the rate at which new aircraft are produced, government funding and\ntiming of awards of military programs, our ability to have our products designed into new aircraft, the rates at which aircraft\nowners, including commercial airlines, refurbish or install upgrades to their aircraft and supply chain and labor market\npressures. New aircraft build rates and aircraft owners spending on upgrades and refurbishments is cyclical and dependent on\nthe strength of the global economy. Once one of our products is designed into a new aircraft, the spare parts business\nassociated thereto is also frequently retained by the Company. Future growth and profitability of the Test Systems business is\ndependent on developing and procuring new and follow-on business. The nature of our Test Systems business is such that it\npursues large, often multi-year, projects. There can be significant periods of time between orders in this business, which may\nresult in large fluctuations of sales and profit levels and backlog from period to period. Test Systems segment customers include\nthe USDOD, prime contractors to the USDOD, mass transit operators and prime contractors to mass transit operators.\nEach of the markets that we serve presents opportunities that we expect will provide growth for the Company over the long-\nterm. We continue to look for opportunities in all of our markets to capitalize on our core competencies to expand our existing\nbusiness and to grow through strategic acquisitions.\nThe main challenges that we continue to face include varying levels of supply chain pressures from the residual impacts of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, material availability and cost increases, labor availability and cost, and improving shareholder value\nthrough increasing profitability. Increasing profitability is dependent on many things, primarily sales growth, both acquired and\norganic, and the Company’s ability to pass cost increases along to customers and control operating expenses, and to identify\nmeans of creating improved productivity. Sales are driven by increased build rates for existing aircraft, market acceptance and\neconomic success of new aircraft and our products, continued government funding of defense programs, the Company’s ability\nto obtain production contracts for parts we currently supply or have been selected to design and develop for new aircraft\nplatforms and continually identifying and winning new business for our Test Systems segment.\nReduced aircraft build rates driven by a weak economy, aircraft groundings, tight credit markets, reduced air passenger travel,\nand an increasing supply of used aircraft on the market would likely result in reduced demand for our products, which will\nresult in lower profits. Reduction of defense spending may result in fewer opportunities for us to compete, which could result in\nlower profits in the future. Many of our newer development programs are based on new and unproven technology and at the\nsame time we are challenged to develop the technology on a schedule that is consistent with specific programs. Delays in\ndelivery schedules and incremental costs resulting from supply chain and labor rate pressures have in the past resulted, and\ncould in the future also result in, lower profits. We will continue to address these challenges by working to improve operating\nefficiencies and focusing on executing on the growth opportunities currently in front of us.\n23\nOur ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility each subject us to various financial and other affirmative and\nnegative covenants with which we must comply on an ongoing or periodic basis. These include financial covenants pertaining\nto minimum trailing four-quarter EBITDA requirements, minimum liquidity requirements, minimum fixed charge coverage\nratio requirements, and excess cash flow repayment provisions. An unexpected decline in our revenues or operating income,\nincluding occurring as a result of events beyond our control, could cause us to violate our financial covenants. Our ability to\nsatisfy the tight financial covenants in our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility is expected to be challenging\nin 2024 and is an item that our management team continues to closely monitor. While the Company expects to remain in\ncompliance with the required financial covenants for the duration of the agreements, any unexpected negative impacts to our\nbusiness, including as a result of additional supply chain pressures, the timing of customer orders, and our ability to meet\ncustomer delivery schedules, or labor availability and cost pressures, could result in lower revenues and reduced financial\nprofits, and, as a result thereof, our inability to satisfy the financial covenants in our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term\nLoan Facility.\nSee Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for an additional discussion of risks associated with our potential inability to satisfy the\nfinancial and restrictive covenants set forth in the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility.\nIn September 2021, the Company was awarded a grant of up to $14.7 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation\n(“USDOT”) under the Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection Program (“AMJP”). The Company received $7.3 million and\n$7.4 million under the grant in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The grant benefit was recognized ratably over the six-month\nperformance period as a reduction to Cost of Products Sold in proportion to the compensation expense that the award is\nintended to defray. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized $6.0 million and $8.7\nmillion of the award, respectively.\nWe are monitoring the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related export controls and financial and economic\nsanctions imposed on certain industry sectors, including the aviation sector, and parties in Russia by the U.S., the U.K., the\nEuropean Union and others. Although the conflict has not resulted in a direct material adverse impact on our business to date,\nthe implications of the Russia and Ukraine conflict in the short-term and long-term are difficult to predict at this time. Factors\nsuch as increased energy costs, the availability of certain raw materials for aircraft manufacturers, embargoes on flights from\nRussian airlines, sanctions on Russian companies, and the stability of Ukrainian customers could impact the global economy\nand aviation sector.\nIn November 2023, a non-core contract manufacturing customer reported within the Aerospace segment filed for bankruptcy\nunder Chapter 11. As a result, the Company recorded a full reserve of $7.5 million for outstanding accounts receivable and a\n$3.6 million reserve against dedicated inventory. The associated assets existed prior to 2023.\nDIVESTITURES\nOn February 13, 2019, the Company completed a divestiture of its semiconductor test business within the Test Systems\nsegment. The transaction included two elements of contingent earnouts. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company agreed to\nan earnout payment of $10.7 million for the calendar 2020 earnout, which was recorded in 2021 as a separate line item below\noperating loss and was received by the Company in early January 2022. In March 2022, the Company agreed with the earnout\ncalculation for the calendar 2021 earnout for $11.3 million. The Company recorded the gain and received the payment in the\nfirst quarter of 2022. In March 2023, the Company agreed with the final earnout calculation for the calendar 2022 earnout for\n$3.4 million. The Company recorded the gain and received the payment in the first quarter of 2023. See further information in\nNote 21 in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report.\nOn October 6, 2021, the Company sold one of its Aerospace buildings for $9.2 million. Net cash proceeds were approximately\n$8.8 million and a gain on sale of approximately $5.0 million was recorded. The operation has been integrated into another\nfacility.\nMARKETS\nCommercial Transport Market\nThe commercial transport market is our largest end market with sales driven by new aircraft production and aftermarket airline\nretrofit programs. In the commercial transport market, while many of our key long-term fundamentals remain intact, we\ncontinue to see residual, though improving, near-term market pressure due to effects of certain supply chain challenges. We\nhave experienced improvement throughout 2023 driven by the increased production rate of the 737 MAX and improved activity\nwith our airline customers. Aircraft build rates are expected to continue to improve during 2024 and 2025 from current levels as\nproduction of the 737 MAX and A-320 is expected to increase, and the aftermarket is expected to strengthen over the course of\n24\nthe year as aircraft utilization and load factors increase. International travel utilizing primarily widebody aircraft is close to pre-\npandemic levels and we believe widebody aircraft production rates will continue to directionally match air traffic volumes.\nSales to the commercial transport market include sales of lighting and safety systems, electrical power and seat motion systems,\naircraft structures, avionics products and systems certification. Sales to this market totaled approximately $432.2 million or\n62.8% of our consolidated sales in 2023.\nMaintaining and growing sales to the commercial transport market will depend not only on continued market recovery post-\npandemic, but also on airlines’ capital spending budgets for cabin upgrades as well as the purchase of new aircraft by global\nairlines. This spending by the airlines is impacted by their profits, cash flow and available financing as well as competitive\npressures between the airlines to improve the travel experience for their passengers. We expect that new aircraft will be\nequipped with more passenger and aircraft connectivity and in-seat power than previous generation aircraft which drives\ndemand for our avionics and power products. This market has historically experienced strong growth from airlines installing in-\nseat passenger power systems on their existing and newly delivered aircraft. Our ability to maintain and grow sales to this\nmarket depends on our ability to maintain our technological advantages over our competitors and maintain our relationships\nwith major in-flight entertainment suppliers and global airlines.\nMilitary Aerospace Market\nSales to the military aerospace market include sales of lighting and safety products, avionics products, electrical power and seat\nmotion products and structures products. Sales to this market totaled approximately 8.9% of our consolidated sales and\namounted to $61.6 million in 2023.\nThe military market is dependent on governmental funding which can change from year to year. Risks are that overall spending\nmay be reduced in the future, specific programs may be eliminated or that we fail to win new business through the competitive\nbid process. Astronics does not have significant reliance on any one program such that cancellation of a particular program will\ncause material financial loss. We believe that we will continue to have opportunities similar to past years with respect to this\nmarket.\nGeneral Aviation Market\nSales to the general aviation market consist mostly of line-fit products driven by aircraft build rates although there are some\naftermarket sales as well. We have seen notable improvement in the current year and expect that to continue into 2024 as build\nrates are expected to increase post-pandemic.\nSales to the general aviation market include sales of lighting and safety products, avionics products, and electrical power and\nseat motion products. Sales to this market totaled approximately 11.7% of our consolidated sales in 2023 and amounted to\n$80.8 million.\nSales to the general aviation market are driven by our ship set content on new aircraft and build rates of new aircraft. General\naviation OEM build rates are impacted by global wealth creation and corporate profitability. We continue to see opportunities\non new aircraft currently in the design phase to employ our lighting and safety, electrical power and avionics technologies in\nthis market. There is risk involved in the development of products for any new aircraft including the risk that the aircraft will\nnot ultimately be produced or that it will be produced in lower quantities than originally expected and thus impacting our return\non our engineering and development efforts.\nTest Systems Products\nSales by our Test Systems segment accounted for approximately 12.2% of our consolidated sales in 2023 and amounted to\n$84.4 million. This segment designs, develops, manufactures and maintains automated test systems that support the aerospace\nand defense, communications and mass transit industries as well as training and simulation devices for both commercial and\nmilitary applications. Sales to the aerospace and defense market were $48.2 million in 2023. Sales to the mass transit market\nwere $18.9 million and sales to other markets were $17.3 million in 2023.\nSales to the military and mass transit markets are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in governmental spending,\nelimination of certain programs, or failure to win new business through the competitive bid process. Consistent with the\nAerospace segment, the Test Systems segment does not significantly rely on any one program such that cancellation of a\nparticular program will cause material financial loss, and we believe that we will continue to have opportunities similar to past\nyears regarding this market.\n25\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. The preparation of the Company’s financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and\njudgments that affect the amounts reported. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are affected by management’s\napplication of accounting policies, which are discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 in Item 8,\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report. The critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the\nAudit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nRevenue Recognition\nAstronics recognizes revenue when it transfers control of a promised good or service to a customer in an amount that reflects\nthe consideration it expects to receive in exchange for the good or service. Our performance obligations are satisfied and control\nis transferred either at a point-in-time or over-time. The majority of our revenue is recognized at a point-in-time when control is\ntransferred, which is generally evidenced by the shipment or delivery of the product to the customer, a transfer of title, a\ntransfer of the significant risks and rewards of ownership, and customer acceptance. For certain contracts under which we\nproduce products with no alternative use and for which we have an enforceable right to recover costs incurred plus a reasonable\nprofit margin for work completed to date and for certain other contracts under which we create or enhance a customer-owned\nasset while performing repair and overhaul services, control is transferred to the customer over time. The Company recognizes\nrevenue using an over time recognition model for these types of contracts.\nWe utilize the cost-to-cost method as a measure of progress for performance obligations that are satisfied over time as we\nbelieve this input method best represents the transfer of control to the customer. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of\nprogress toward completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at\ncompletion of the performance obligation. These projections require management to make numerous assumptions and estimates\nrelating to items such as the complexity of design and related development costs, performance of subcontractors, availability\nand cost of materials, labor productivity and cost, overhead, capital costs, and manufacturing efficiency. We review our cost\nestimates on a periodic basis, or when circumstances change and warrant a modification to a previous estimate. Cost estimates\nare largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic\nprojections.\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report for\na further description of revenue recognition under ASC 606.\nReviews for Impairment of Goodwill\nOur goodwill is the result of the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired from acquisitions. We had approximately\n$58.2 million of goodwill as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nWe identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which\ndiscrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those\ncomponents. The Test Systems operating segment is its own reporting unit while the other reporting units are one level below\nour Aerospace operating segment.\nThe Company tests goodwill at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or\ncircumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.\nWe use the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units. The discounted cash flow\nmethod incorporates various assumptions, the most significant being projected sales growth rates, operating profit margins and\ncash flows, the terminal growth rate and the discount rate. Management projects sales growth rates, operating margins and cash\nflows based on each reporting unit’s current business, expected developments and operational strategies. If the carrying value of\nthe reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and the impairment loss is recorded for the amount by\nwhich a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill.\nThe Company’s four reporting units remaining with goodwill as of the first day of our fourth quarter were subject to the annual\ngoodwill impairment test. Based on our quantitative assessments of our reporting units, we concluded that goodwill was not\nimpaired in 2023, 2022 or 2021.\n26\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PERFORMANCE\n(In thousands, except percentages, employees and per share data) 2023 2022\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS:\nSales $ 689,206 $ 534,894\nGross Margin 17.5 % 13.4 %\nSG&A Expenses as a Percentage of Sales 18.5 % 19.0 %\nLoss from Operations $ (6,671) $ (30,044)\nOperating Margin (1.0) % (5.6) %\nNet Gain on Sale of Businesses $ 3,427 $ 11,284\nOther (Income) Expense, Net $ (261) $ 1,611\nInterest Expense, Net $ 23,328 $ 9,422\nEffective Tax Rate (0.4) % (20.0) %\nNet Loss $ (26,421) $ (35,747)\nNet Loss Margin (3.8) % (6.7) %\nDiluted Loss Per Share $ (0.80) $ (1.11)\nWeighted Average Shares Outstanding – Diluted 33,104 32,164\nOTHER YEAR-END DATA:\nNumber of Employees 2,500 2,400\nA discussion by segment can be found at “Segment Results of Operations” in this MD&A.\nCONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW OF OPERATIONS\n2023 Compared With 2022\nConsolidated sales were up $154.3 million, or 28.8%, to $689.2 million compared to the prior year. Aerospace sales increased\n$143.6 million, or 31.1%, driven by increased demand across our range of aerospace product lines. Test System sales increased\n$10.7 million, due primarily to the reversal of a $5.8 million deferred revenue liability assumed with an acquisition and\nassociated with a customer program which is no longer expected to occur, and higher radio test product revenue.\nConsolidated Cost of Products Sold in 2023 was $568.4 million, compared with $463.4 million in the prior year. The increase\nwas primarily due to higher volume as well a $3.6 million inventory reserve charge associated with the bankruptcy of a\ncustomer and $1.4 million in non-cash stock bonuses reinstated in the current year. The prior-year period benefited from the\nAMJP Program grant which provided a $6.0 million offset to Cost of Products Sold. Research and development expenses\nincreased $5.2 million due to higher innovation spend. Margins remained under pressure in the year because of inflation and\nsupply chain workarounds. We are passing on increased costs where we can although it will take time to be reflected in sales.\nWe are expecting continued improvement in pricing as well as stabilization in certain input costs as we advance into 2024.\nSelling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $127.5 million in 2023 compared with $101.6 million in the\nprior-year period primarily due to increased wages and benefits, an accounts receivable reserve charge of $7.5 million\nassociated with the bankruptcy of a customer, a net increase of $7.9 million in litigation-related legal expenses and reserve\nadjustments, and a $2.8 million increase of incentive compensation expenses recorded in SG&A. The prior-year period reflects\n$2.6 million in expense related to a customer accommodation dispute and a lease termination settlement.\nIn 2023, the Company recognized a final earnout of $3.4 million for the 2019 sale of its semiconductor test business, compared\nwith $11.3 million recognized in the prior year. Other Income in 2023 included $1.8 million associated with the reversal of a\nliability related to an equity investment.\nInterest expense was $23.3 million in the current year, compared with $9.4 million in the prior year, primarily driven by higher\ninterest rates on credit facilities entered into in January 2023.\nConsolidated net loss was $26.4 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, compared with net loss of $35.7 million, or $1.11 per\ndiluted share, in the prior year.\n27\nAt December 31, 2023, our consolidated backlog was $592.3 million. At December 31, 2022, our backlog was $571.4 million.\nBacklog in the Aerospace segment was $517.2 million at December 31, 2023. Backlog in the Test Systems segment was\n$75.0 million at December 31, 2023.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rates for 2023 and 2022 were (0.4)% and (20.0)%, respectively. In the past, research and development costs\nwere deducted as incurred. However, beginning with the 2022 tax year, these costs are required to be capitalized for tax\npurposes and amortized over 5 years. While this would typically result in the creation of an associated deferred tax asset, due to\nour cumulative three-year pre-tax loss, a valuation allowance was applied against the deferred tax asset. In addition to state\nincome taxes, the following items had the most significant impact on the difference between our statutory U.S. federal income\ntax rate (21% in 2023 and 2022) and our effective tax rate:\n2023:\n• Recognition of approximately $6.8 million of valuation allowance against federal deferred tax assets. See Note 11 of\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report for\nadditional information.\n• Recognition of approximately $3.4 million of 2023 U.S. R&D tax credits.\n2022:\n• Recognition of approximately $13.2 million of valuation allowance against federal deferred tax assets. See Note 11 of\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report for\nadditional information.\n• Recognition of approximately $2.6 million of 2022 U.S. R&D tax credits.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur business continues to face varying levels of supply chain pressures from the residual impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDomestic air travel has recovered from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and international travel utilizing primarily\nwidebody aircraft is close to pre-pandemic levels. As economic activity continues to recover, we will continue to monitor the\nsituation, assessing further possible implications on our operations, supply chain, liquidity, cash flow and customer orders.\nSee Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for an additional discussion of risk related to supply chain disruptions.\n2022 Compared With 2021\nFor a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, see Item 7, Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on March 10, 2023.\nSEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOperating profit (loss), as presented below, is sales less cost of products sold and other operating expenses, excluding interest\nexpense, other corporate expenses and other non-operating sales and expenses. Cost of products sold and other operating\nexpenses are directly identifiable to the respective segment. Operating profit (loss) is reconciled to loss before income taxes in\nNote 20 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report.\nWe do not have material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on\nour results of operations or financial condition.\nAEROSPACE SEGMENT\n(In thousands, except percentages) 2023 2022\nSales $ 604,830 $ 461,196\nOperating Profit (Loss) $ 24,629 $ (1,883)\nOperating Margin 4.1 % (0.4) %\n2023 2022\nTotal Assets $ 493,660 $ 481,416\nBacklog $ 517,240 $ 477,660\n28\nSales by Market 2023 2022\nCommercial Transport $ 432,199 $ 314,564\nMilitary 61,617 54,534\nGeneral Aviation 80,842 63,395\nOther 30,172 28,703\nTotal $ 604,830 $ 461,196\nSales by Product Line 2023 2022\nElectrical Power & Motion $ 268,049 $ 187,446\nLighting & Safety 157,434 124,347\nAvionics 113,117 97,234\nSystems Certification 26,255 17,222\nStructures 9,803 6,244\nOther 30,172 28,703\nTotal $ 604,830 $ 461,196\n2023 Compared With 2022\nAerospace segment sales increased $143.6 million, or 31.1%, to $604.8 million. The improvement was driven by a 37.4%, or\n$117.6 million, increase in commercial transport sales. Sales to this market were $432.2 million, or 62.8% of consolidated sales\nin 2023, compared with $314.6 million, or 58.8% of consolidated sales in 2022. Higher airline spending and increasing OEM\nbuild rates drove the increased demand.\nGeneral Aviation sales increased $17.4 million, or 27.5%, to $80.8 million due in part to higher demand in the business jet\nmarket for electrical power and motion and avionics products. The Company expects strong demand in the business jet industry\nto drive higher OEM production rates in the near future, resulting in further increases in demand for its products.\nMilitary Aircraft sales increased $7.1 million, or 13.0%, to $61.6 million from increased production of higher sales of lighting\nand safety and avionics products.\nAerospace segment operating profit improved to $24.6 million compared with an operating loss of $1.9 million last year, which\nincluded an Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection (“AMJP”) Program grant offset to Cost of Products Sold of $6.0 million.\nOperating margin expansion reflects the leverage gained on higher volume, partially offset by the $11.1 million in charges\nrelated to the customer bankruptcy, an increase in litigation-related legal expenses and reserve adjustments of $2.9 million, and\nan increase in incentive compensation expense of $2.8 million.\nAerospace bookings in 2023 were $664.3 million, for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.10:1. The book-to-bill ratio is calculated as total\norders received during the period compared with total revenue recognized during the period. The Aerospace segment’s backlog\nat December 31, 2023 was $517.2 million, compared to $477.7 million at December 31, 2022. Approximately $474.5 million of\nthe December 31, 2023 backlog is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next twelve months.\n2022 Compared With 2021\nFor a comparison of Aerospace segment results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, see Item 7, Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on March 10, 2023.\n29\nTEST SYSTEMS SEGMENT\n(In thousands, except percentages) 2023 2022\nSales $ 84,376 $ 73,698\nOperating Loss $ (8,745) $ (8,118)\nOperating Margin (10.4) % (11.0) %\n2023 2022\nTotal Assets $ 122,681 $ 111,513\nBacklog $ 75,036 $ 93,696\n2023 Compared With 2022\nTest Systems segment sales were $84.4 million, up $10.7 million compared with the prior year as a result of the reversal of a\n$5.8 million deferred revenue liability recorded with a previous acquisition and higher radio test revenue.\nTest Systems operating loss was $8.7 million compared with operating loss of $8.1 million in 2022. Absent the non-operating\nsales adjustment resulting from the reversal of the deferred revenue liability, Test Systems operating loss for the current period\nwas $14.5 million and continued to be negatively affected by mix and under absorption of fixed costs due to volume, a\n$5.0 million increase in litigation-related legal expenses, and $0.7 million of non-cash bonuses. The Test Systems segment has\nbeen investing in significant new development programs which are expected to result in more profitable business in the near\nfuture.\nBookings for the Test Systems segment in 2023 were $59.9 million, for a book-to-bill ratio of 0.76:1 for the year. Backlog in\nthe Test Systems segment was $75.0 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $93.7 million at December 31, 2022. The Test\nSystems segment expects to recognize $52.1 million of backlog as revenue in 2024.\n2022 Compared With 2021\nFor a comparison of Test Systems segment results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, see Item 7 “Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on March 10, 2023.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS\nFor further information on our contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2023 and estimated timing\nthereof, see the notes referenced below, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report.\nLong-term Debt and Interest Payments — Refer to Note 8, Long-Term Debt, in this report. The Company completed a\nfinancing transaction totaling $205 million on January 19, 2023, which refinanced its previous revolving credit facility that was\nscheduled to mature in November 2023. The new financing consists of a $90 million asset-based Term Loan Facility and a\n$115 million asset-based revolving credit facility, which was later amended to temporarily increase the limit to $120 million\nuntil January 31, 2024 and then returning to the original $115 million. The maturity date of the Term Loan Facility is the earlier\nof the stated maturity date of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility or January 19, 2027, provided the ABL Revolving Credit\nFacility is extended beyond that date. The Term Loan Facility has an interest rate of SOFR plus 8.75% and is collateralized\nprimarily by real estate, fixed assets and intellectual property. Amortization of the term loan principal has a monthly\namortization rate of 0.833% until maturity, at which time the remaining outstanding balance is due. Scheduled principal\npayments of $9.0 million are due under the Term Loan Facility during 2024. The Term Loan Facility required a commitment\nfee of $4.5 million, $0.9 million of which is due in the second quarter of 2024. The ABL Revolving Credit Facility has a\nscheduled maturity of January 19, 2026, an interest rate of SOFR plus 2.25% to 2.75% and is collateralized primarily by\ninventory and accounts receivable. The ABL Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of a quarterly commitment fee of\n0.25% or 0.375% based on the Company’s average excess availability. Future interest payments under the two credit facilities\nof approximately $35.5 million have been estimated using the applicable interest rate of each debt facility based on expected\nfuture borrowings and scheduled term loan repayments. Actual future ABL borrowings and rates may differ from those used to\nestimate the amounts discussed above.\nPurchase Obligations — Purchase obligations are comprised of the Company’s commitments for goods and services in the\nnormal course of business and amount to approximately $191.1 million payable over the next twelve months.\n30\nSupplemental Retirement Plan and Post Retirement Obligations — Anticipated payments related with the Company’s defined\nbenefit plans are detailed in Note 13, Retirement Plans and Related Post Retirement Benefits in Item 8, Financial Statements\nand Supplementary Data, of this report.\nLease Obligations — Refer to Note 10, Leases in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report for\ndetails on obligations and timing of expected future lease payments, including a five-year maturity schedule.\nLegal Reserves — Refer to Note 19, Legal Proceeding in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report\nfor management’s estimate of damages to be paid related to our ongoing litigation with Lufthansa Technik and timing thereof.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nCash Flow Data\nNet Cash Flows from:\nOperating Activities $ (23,950) $ (28,312)\nInvesting Activities $ (4,106) $ 14,386\nFinancing Activities $ 25,435 $ (1,412)\nYear-end Financial Position\nWorking Capital (1) $ 246,448 $ 213,682\nIndebtedness $ 172,499 $ 164,000\nOther Year-end Data\nCapital Expenditures $ 7,643 $ 7,675\n(1) Working capital is calculated as the difference between Current Assets and Current Liabilities.\nOur cash flow from operations, available borrowing capacity, and proceeds under our ATM Program (as defined below) are\nexpected to provide us with the financial resources needed to run our operations and reinvest in our business for at least the next\n12 months.\nOur ability to maintain sufficient liquidity is highly dependent upon achieving expected operating results. Failure to achieve\nexpected operating results could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, our ability to obtain financing or access our\nexisting financing, and our operations in the future.\nOperating Activities\nCash used for operating activities totaled $24.0 million in 2023, as compared with $28.3 million cash used for operating\nactivities in 2022. Cash flow from operating activities improved compared with 2022 primarily related to improvement in our\nfinancial results, coupled with accounts receivable and inventory using less cash as supply chain challenges have improved,\npartially offset by increased outflows related to accounts payable. The $3.4 million and $11.3 million earnouts in 2023 and\n2022, respectively, from the sale of the semiconductor business are treated as investing activities and thus are shown as non-\ncash gains removed from the calculation of cash flow from operations. Additional non-cash items in 2023 include $12.6 million\nincremental provisions for inventory and receivables, primarily the result of the customer bankruptcy previously discussed, and\na $5.8 million deferred liability recovery. Operating cash flows in 2022 benefited from the receipt of income tax refunds and\nAMJP grant proceeds.\nOur cash flows from operations are primarily dependent on our net loss adjusted for non-cash expenses and income and the\ntiming of collections of receivables, inventory levels and payments to suppliers and employees. Sales and operating results of\nour Aerospace segment are influenced by build rates of new aircraft, which are subject to general economic conditions, airline\npassenger travel and spending for government and military programs. Our Test Systems segment sales depends in part on\ncapital expenditures of the aerospace and defense industry which, in turn, depend on current and future demand for those\nproducts. A reduction in demand for our customers’ products would adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used for investing activities in 2023 was $4.1 million compared to $14.4 million cash provided by investing activities in\n2022. Investing cash flows in 2023 were positively impacted by the receipt of $3.4 million related to the calendar 2022 earnout\nfrom the sales of the semiconductor business compared to the receipt of $10.7 million and $11.3 million related to the calendar\n2020 and 2021 earnouts, respectively, in 2022.\n31\nFuture requirements for PP&E depend on numerous factors, including expansion of existing product lines and introduction of\nnew products. Management believes that our cash flow from operations and current borrowing arrangements will provide for\nthese capital expenditures. We expect to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the future.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities totaled $25.4 million for 2023, as compared with cash used for financing activities of\n$1.4 million for 2022. The Company received proceeds from our at-the-market equity offering program (the “ATM Program”)\nof $21.3 million in 2023. Additionally, the Company made net borrowings under our credit facilities of $8.5 million in 2023\ncompared with net repayments of $1.0 million in 2022, partially offset by an increase in costs associated with amending and\nrefinancing our credit facilities.\nThe Company amended the existing revolving credit facility on January 19, 2023 by entering into the Sixth Amended and\nRestated Credit Agreement (the “ABL Revolving Credit Facility”). The ABL Revolving Credit Facility set the maximum\naggregate amount that the Company can borrow under the revolving credit line at $115 million, with borrowings subject to a\nborrowing base determined primarily by certain domestic inventory and accounts receivable. The maturity date of borrowings\nunder the ABL Revolving Credit Facility is January 19, 2026. Under the terms of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, the\nCompany pays interest on the unpaid principal amount of the facility at a rate equal to SOFR (which is required to be at least\n1.00%) plus 2.25% to 2.75%. The Company must pay a quarterly commitment fee under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility in\nan amount equal to 0.25% or 0.375% based on the Company’s average excess availability.\nOn June 28, 2023, the Company amended the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, temporarily increasing the maximum aggregate\namount that the Company can borrow under the revolving credit line by $5 million from $115 million to $120 million until\nOctober 31, 2023, at which time the limit was to return to $115 million. On October 31, 2023, the Company executed a second\namendment to extend the temporary limit of $120 million until January 31, 2024 at which time the limit returned to\n$115 million. Under the provisions of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, the Company has a cash dominion arrangement with\nthe lead banking institution whereby eligible daily cash receipts are contractually utilized to pay down outstanding borrowings\nand any ending cash balances subject to the dominion arrangement collateralize the outstanding borrowings under the ABL\nRevolving Credit Facility. Eligible cash receipts that have not yet been applied to outstanding debt balances are classified as\nrestricted cash in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company is also required to maintain minimum liquidity\nof $20 million through the date of delivery of the compliance certificate for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and $10 million\nthereafter. On December 31, 2023, there was $87.0 million outstanding on the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and there\nremained $32.7 million available, net of outstanding letters of credit (though subject to the minimum liquidity requirement).\nThe Company also entered into a $90 million asset-based Term Loan Facility on January 19, 2023. The Term Loan Facility is\nsecured primarily by fixed assets, real estate and intellectual property. The maturity date of the Term Loan Facility is the earlier\nof the stated maturity date of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility or January 19, 2027, if the ABL Revolving Credit Facility is\nextended beyond that date. The Company pays interest under the Term Loan Facility at a rate equal to SOFR (which is required\nto be at least 2.50%) plus 8.75%. The Company must pay a commitment fee under the Term Loan Facility of 5% of the total\naggregate commitment, or $4.5 million, $1.8 million of which was paid on the closing date, $1.8 million of which was paid on\nJune 19, 2023 and $0.9 million of which is due in the second quarter of 2024.\nAmortization of the principal under the Term Loan Facility began in April with a monthly amortization rate of 0.292% of the\noutstanding term loan principal balance for the period April 1, 2023 through June 1, 2023, increasing to 0.542% per month for\nthe period July 1, 2023 through September 1, 2023 and 0.833% monthly thereafter. Total scheduled principal payments of\n$9.0 million are payable in 2024 and as such, have been classified as current in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets\nas of December 31, 2023. The interest rate on current maturities of long-term debt is variable at SOFR plus 8.75%, and was\n14.2% at December 31, 2023. The remaining balance of $76.5 million as of December 31, 2023, is recorded as long-term in the\naccompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPursuant to the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility, the Company was required to comply with a\nminimum trailing four quarter Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility\nAgreements, of $51.7 million in the Company’s fourth quarter of 2023, increasing to $57.6 million in the first quarter of 2024,\n$65.2 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $70 million thereafter. The non-cash accounts receivable reserve associated\nwith the customer bankruptcy recorded in 2023 was not required to be included in the calculation of EBITDA pursuant to our\nABL Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility. Mandatory prepayment of a portion of excess cash flow, as defined\nby the Term Loan Facility, is payable towards the principal amount outstanding on an annual basis. No such amounts are\npayable for the year ended December 31, 2023. Any voluntary prepayments made are subject to a prepayment fee, as defined\nby the Term Loan Facility. Beginning with the first quarter of 2024, the Company is subject to a minimum fixed charge\ncoverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.00. Further, the Company is subject to excess cash flow repayment provisions, restrictions on\n32\nadditional indebtedness, share repurchases and dividend payments, and a limitation on capital expenditures. The Company was\nin compliance with debt covenants under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility as of and for the year\nended December 31, 2023. The Company was in compliance with debt covenants under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and\nTerm Loan Facility as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe Company incurred $8.8 million in incremental debt issuance costs related to the new facilities, allocated between the ABL\nRevolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility. All costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective\nagreement. Unamortized deferred debt issuance costs associated with the ABL Revolving Credit Facility ($2.0 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023) are recorded within Other Assets and those associated with the Term Loan Facility ($4.3 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023) are recorded as a reduction of the carrying value of the debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCertain of the Company’s subsidiaries are borrowers or guarantors under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan\nFacility.\nIn the event of voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy of the Company or any subsidiary, all unpaid principal and other amounts\nowing under the credit facilities automatically become due and payable. Other events of default, such as failure to make\npayments as they become due and breach of financial and other covenants, change of control, cross default under other material\ndebt agreements, and a going concern qualification for any reason other than loan maturity date give the agent the option to\ndeclare all such amounts immediately due and payable.\nOn June 5, 2023, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which allows us to issue shares of\ncommon stock, preferred stock, warrants, subscription rights, purchase contracts and debt securities in one or more offerings up\nto an aggregate offering price of $150 million and on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. On August 8, 2023, the\nCompany initiated an at-the-market equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) for the sale from time to time of shares of\nthe Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share having an aggregate offering price of up to $30 million. Shares of\nCommon Stock under the ATM Program are offered using Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., as\nsales agents (the “Sales Agents” and each a “Sales Agent”), pursuant to the equity distribution agreement, dated August 8,\n2023, by and among the Company and the Sales Agents.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company sold 1,334,228 shares of our common stock under the ATM Program,\ngenerating aggregate net proceeds of $21.3 million after deducting related expenses. The Company currently is obligated to use\nthe net proceeds from any sale of shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Program to pay down the outstanding principal\namount of, and any unpaid interest on, the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. However, any principal amount paid down on our\nABL Revolving Credit Facility using the proceeds of the ATM Program will be, subject to compliance with the requirements\nand conditions set forth in the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, available to be reborrowed by the Company and used for, among\nother items, working capital and general corporate purposes. If the outstanding principal amount balance of the ABL Revolving\nCredit Facility has been reduced to zero, then the Company intends to use the net proceeds of the ATM Program for general\ncorporate purposes. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had remaining capacity under the ATM Program to sell shares of\ncommon stock having an aggregate offering price up to approximately $8.2 million.\nCash on hand at the end of the year was $11.3 million. Net debt was $161.2 million, compared with $150.2 million at the end of\n2022.\nThe Company expects its cash flow from operations will provide sufficient cash flows to fund operations. However, the\nCompany may also evaluate various actions and alternatives to enhance its profitability and cash generation from operating\nactivities, which could include manufacturing efficiency initiatives, cost-reduction measures, working with vendors and\nsuppliers to reduce lead times and expedite shipment of critical components, and working with customers to expedite receivable\ncollections. The Company may also utilize available capacity under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and sales proceeds from\nthe ATM Program.\nOur ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and comply with financial debt covenants is highly dependent upon achieving\nexpected operating results. Failure to achieve expected operating results could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity,\nour ability to obtain financing or access our existing financing, and our operations in the future and could allow our debt holders\nto demand payment of all outstanding amounts. Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, for further discussion.\nRefer to Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statement and Supplementary Data, of this report\nfor additional information regarding our credit facility.\n33\nDIVIDENDS\nManagement believes that it should retain the capital generated from operating activities for investment in advancing\ntechnologies, acquisitions and debt retirement. Accordingly, there are no plans to institute a cash dividend program. Further, we\nare precluded from payment of dividends under our credit facilities.\nRELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nInformation regarding certain relationships and related transactions is incorporated herein by reference to the information\nincluded in the Company’s 2024 Proxy Statement which will be filed with the SEC within 120 days after the end of the\nCompany’s 2023 fiscal year.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company has limited exposure to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates to U.S. dollar, primarily in Canadian\ndollars and Euros currency. Approximately 90% of the Company’s consolidated sales are transacted in U.S. dollars. Net assets\nheld in or measured in Canadian dollars amounted to $11.1 million at December 31, 2023. A 10% change in the value of the\nU.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar would have had an immaterial impact to 2023 net loss. Net assets held in or measured in\nEuros amounted to $24.8 million at December 31, 2023. A 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the Euros would\nhave had an immaterial impact to 2023 net loss.\nRisk due to fluctuation in interest rates is a function of the Company’s floating rate debt obligations, which total approximately\n$172.5 million as of December 31, 2023. A change of 1% in interest rates of all variable rate debt would impact annual net loss\nby approximately $1.7 million, before income taxes.\nAs disclosed elsewhere in this report, the future impacts of the Russia and Ukraine conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic and\ntheir residual effects, including economic uncertainty, inflationary environment and disruption within the global supply chain,\nlabor markets and aerospace industry, on our business remain uncertain. As we cannot anticipate the ultimate duration or scope\nof the Russia-Ukraine war and the residual effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ultimate financial impact to our results\ncannot be reasonably estimated, but could be material.\n34\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Astronics Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Astronics Corporation (the Company) as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for\neach of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in\nthe Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated\nfinancial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and\n2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in\nconformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(2013 framework), and our report dated March 4, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that\nwere communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that\nare material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as\na whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit\nmatters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nValuation of Goodwill\nDescription of As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s goodwill balance was $58.2 million. As discussed in Notes 1\nthe Matter and 7 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company tests goodwill for impairment at the\nreporting unit level on an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that\nwould more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. For each\nreporting unit, the Company performed a quantitative test using the discounted cash flow method to\nestimate fair value. The discounted cash flow method incorporates various assumptions, the most\nsignificant being projected sales growth rates, operating margins and cash flows, the terminal growth rate\nand the weighted-average cost of capital. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value,\ngoodwill impairment is measured as the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its\nfair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill.\nAuditing management’s assumptions was especially challenging due to the estimation required in\ndetermining the fair value of certain of the Company’s reporting units with goodwill. The fair value\nestimates for certain reporting units were sensitive to the significant assumptions of the sales growth rates\nand operating margins. These assumptions are affected by expectations about future market and economic\nconditions, particularly those in the aerospace industry.\n35\nHow We We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls\nAddressed the over the Company’s goodwill impairment testing process. This included the determination of the\nMatter in Our underlying significant assumptions described above, and the completeness and accuracy of the\nAudit impairment analysis.\nTo test the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units, we performed audit procedures with the\nassistance of our valuation professionals that included, among others, assessing the methodology used,\ntesting the significant assumptions discussed above and testing the underlying data used in the impairment\nanalysis. We performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair\nvalue of the reporting units that would result from changes in the assumptions. We compared the\nsignificant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, historical trends of\nthe Company, and other relevant factors and assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates.\nWe also involved our valuation professionals to assist in our evaluation of the weighted-average cost of\ncapital used in the fair value estimates. In addition, we tested the reconciliation of the fair value of the\nCompany’s reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company as of the annual impairment\ntesting date.\nRevenue Recognition\nDescription of For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company’s sales totaled $689.2 million. As discussed in\nthe Matter Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, some of the Company’s contracts with customers contain\nmultiple performance obligations. The majority of the Company’s revenue from contracts with customers\nis recognized at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the product, which is generally upon\ndelivery and acceptance by the customer. For contracts with customers in which the Company satisfies its\npromise to the customer to provide a service or a product that has no alternative use to the Company and\nthe Company has enforceable rights to payment for progress completed to date inclusive of profit, the\nCompany recognizes revenue over time as it satisfies the performance obligation.\nAuditing management’s evaluation of contracts with customers was especially challenging due to the\njudgment required to analyze the terms and conditions of the Company’s various customer contracts\ngiven that such terms and conditions are nonstandard. This included the identification and determination\nof the performance obligations and assessment of whether a product has alternative use.\nHow We We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls\nAddressed the over the Company’s revenue recognition process. We tested controls over management’s review of the\nMatter in Our terms and conditions of contracts with customers which included an analysis of the distinct performance\nAudit obligations and a review of the conclusion as to whether revenue from such performance obligations\nshould be recognized over time or at a point in time.\nWe performed procedures to test the identification and determination of the performance obligations and\nthe timing of revenue recognition which included, among others, reading a sample of executed contracts\nand purchase orders to understand the contract and performing an independent assessment of the\nidentification of distinct performance obligations and whether a product has alternative use. We tested the\ncompleteness and accuracy of the Company’s contract summary documentation, specifically related to the\nidentification and determination of distinct performance obligations and the timing of revenue\nrecognition.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1992.\nBuffalo, New York\nMarch 4, 2024\n36\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term\nis defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our\nmanagement, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based upon the framework in Internal\nControl – Integrated Framework originally issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is\neffective as of December 31, 2023.\nErnst & Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued their report, included herein, on the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nBy: /s/ Peter J. Gundermann March 4, 2024\nPeter J. Gundermann\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\n(Principal Executive Officer)\n/s/ David C. Burney March 4, 2024\nDavid C. Burney\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial\nOfficer\n(Principal Financial Officer)\n37\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Astronics Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Astronics Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Astronics Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated\nstatements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period\nended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) and our\nreport dated March 4, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report\non Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and\nperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nBuffalo, New York\nMarch 4, 2024\n38\nASTRONICS CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December

Business\nAstronics Corporation (“Astronics” or the “Company”) is a leading provider of advanced technologies to the global aerospace,\ndefense, and electronics industries. Our products and services include advanced, high-performance electrical power generation,\ndistribution and seat motion systems, lighting and safety systems, avionics products, systems and certification, aircraft\nstructures and automated test systems.\nWe have principal operations in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada, France, and England, as well as engineering offices in\nUkraine and India.\nThe Company has two reportable segments, Aerospace and Test Systems. The Aerospace segment designs and manufactures\nproducts for the global aerospace and defense industry. Our Test Systems segment designs, develops, manufactures and\nmaintains automated test systems that support the aerospace and defense, communications and mass transit industries as well as\ntraining and simulation devices for both commercial and military applications.\nSee Note 21 for details of our divestiture related activities in 2023, 2022 and 2021. There was no acquisition activity in 2023,\n2022 or 2021.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur business continues to face varying levels of supply chain pressures from the residual impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDomestic air travel has recovered from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and international travel utilizing primarily\nwidebody aircraft is close to pre-pandemic levels. As economic activity continues to recover, we will continue to monitor the\nsituation, assessing further possible implications on our operations, supply chain, liquidity, cash flow and customer orders.\nIn September 2021, the Company was awarded a grant of up to $14.7 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation\n(“USDOT”) under the Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection Program (“AMJP”). The Company received $7.3 million and\n$7.4 million under the grant in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The grant benefit was recognized ratably over the six-month\nperformance period as a reduction to Cost of Products Sold in proportion to the compensation expense that the award is\nintended to defray. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized $6.0 million and $8.7\nmillion of the award, respectively.\nAdditionally, the Company qualified for government subsidies from the Canadian and French governments as a result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our foreign operations. The Canadian and French subsidies are income-based grants intended\nto reimburse the Company for certain employee wages. The grants are recognized as income over the periods in which the\nCompany recognizes as expenses the costs the grants are intended to defray, primarily during 2021 with an immaterial amount\nrecognized during 2022.\nThe following table presents the COVID-19 related government assistance, including AMJP, recorded during the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nReduction in Cost of Products Sold $ — $ 6,062 $ 10,682\nReduction in Selling, General and Administrative Expenses — 11 228\nTotal $ — $ 6,073 $ 10,910\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All\nintercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nThe Company accounts for its acquisitions under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations and Reorganizations (“ASC Topic\n805”). ASC Topic 805 provides guidance on how the acquirer recognizes and measures the consideration transferred,\nidentifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, non-controlling interests, and goodwill acquired in a business combination.\nASC Topic 805 also expands required disclosures surrounding the nature and financial effects of business combinations. There\nwere no acquisitions in 2023, 2022 or 2021.\n46\nCost of Products Sold, Research and Development and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\nCost of Products Sold includes the costs to manufacture products such as direct materials and labor and manufacturing overhead\nas well as all engineering and developmental costs. The Company is engaged in a variety of research and development activities\ndirected to the substantial improvement or new application of the Company’s existing technologies. Research and development\ncosts are expensed as incurred and include salaries, benefits, consulting, material costs and depreciation. Research and\ndevelopment expenses amounted to $53.5 million in 2023, $48.3 million in 2022 and $43.3 million in 2021. These costs are\nincluded in Cost of Products Sold. SG&A expenses include costs primarily related to our sales, marketing and administrative\ndepartments. Interest expense is shown net of interest income. Interest income was insignificant for the years ended December\n31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nShipping and Handling\nShipping and handling costs are included in Cost of Products Sold.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for its stock options following Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 718, Compensation –\nStock Compensation (“ASC Topic 718”). ASC Topic 718 requires all equity-based payments to employees, including grants of\nemployee stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”), to be recognized in the statement of earnings based on the grant\ndate fair value of the award. For awards with graded vesting, the Company uses a straight-line method of attributing the value\nof stock-based compensation expense, subject to minimum levels of expense, based on vesting. The Company accounts for\nforfeitures as they occur.\nUnder ASC Topic 718, stock compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share-\nbased payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. Equity-based compensation expense is included in\nSG&A Expenses.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAll highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase are considered cash equivalents.\nRestricted Cash\nUnder the provisions of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility (as defined and discussed below in Note 8), the Company has a cash\ndominion arrangement with the banking institution for its accounts within the United States whereby daily cash receipts are\ncontractually utilized to pay down outstanding balances on the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. Account balances that have not\nyet been applied to the ABL Revolving Credit Facility are classified as restricted cash in the accompanying Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash and restricted cash included in Consolidated Balance\nSheets to the amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nCash and Cash Equivalents $ 4,756 $ 13,778\nRestricted Cash 6,557 —\nTotal Cash and Restricted Cash Shown in Statements of Cash Flows $ 11,313 $ 13,778\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Estimated Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable are composed of trade and contract receivables recorded at either the invoiced amount or costs in excess of\nbillings, are expected to be collected within one year, and do not bear interest. The Company records a valuation allowance to\naccount for estimated credit losses. The estimate for credit losses is based on the Company’s assessment of the collectability of\ncustomer accounts. The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as the age of the receivable\nbalances, historical experience, credit quality, current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future\neconomic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. Balances are written off when determined to be uncollectible.\nAlthough the Company has historically not experienced significant credit losses, the Company’s exposure to credit losses may\nincrease if its customers are adversely affected by global economic recessions, industry conditions, or other customer-specific\nfactors.\n47\nInventories\nWe record our inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We determine the cost basis of our inventory on a first-in,\nfirst-out or weighted average basis using a standard cost methodology that approximates actual cost. The Company records\nreserves to provide for excess, slow moving or obsolete inventory. In determining the appropriate reserve, the Company\nconsiders the age of inventory on hand, the overall inventory levels in relation to forecasted demands as well as reserving for\nspecifically identified inventory that the Company believes is no longer salable or whose value has diminished.\nCloud Computing Arrangements\nThe Company incurs costs to implement cloud computing arrangements that are hosted by third party vendors. Implementation\ncosts associated with cloud computing arrangements are capitalized when incurred during the application development phase.\nAmortization is calculated on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the cloud computing arrangement. Capitalized\namounts related to such arrangements are recorded within Other Current Assets and other non-current assets in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets and were insignificant as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property, plant and\nequipment (“PP&E”) is computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes and using accelerated methods\nfor income tax purposes. Estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows: buildings, 25-40 years; and machinery and\nequipment, 4-10 years. Leased buildings and associated leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the terms of\nthe lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets, with the amortization of such assets included within depreciation expense.\nThe cost of properties sold or otherwise disposed of and the accumulated depreciation thereon are eliminated from the accounts\nand the resulting gain or loss, as well as maintenance and repair expenses, is reflected within operating income. Replacements\nand improvements are capitalized.\nDepreciation expense was approximately $12.2 million, $12.0 million and $12.7 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nThe Company incurs debt issuance costs in connection with amending or entering into new credit facilities. These costs are\namortized as an adjustment to interest expense over term of the credit facility on a straight-line basis, which approximates the\neffective interest method. Debt issuance amortization expense was approximately $3.0 million, $0.8 million and $0.4 million in\n2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOn January 19, 2023, the Company completed a financing transaction, which refinanced its previous revolving credit facility\nwhich was scheduled to mature in November 2023. The new financing consists of a $90 million asset-based term loan (the\n“Term Loan Facility”) and a $115 million asset-based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Revolving Credit Facility”). The\nCompany incurred $8.8 million in debt issuance costs related to the new facilities, allocated between the ABL Revolving Credit\nFacility and the Term Loan Facility. Unamortized deferred debt issuance costs associated with the ABL Revolving Credit\nFacility ($2.0 million as of December 31, 2023) are recorded within Other Assets and those associated with the Term Loan\nFacility ($4.3 million as of December 31, 2023) are recorded as a reduction of the carrying value of the debt on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. The unamortized balance of deferred financing costs on our previous credit facility of\n$3.2 million is recorded within Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2022.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets to be held and used are initially recorded at cost. The carrying value of these assets is evaluated for\nrecoverability whenever adverse effects or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nImpairments are recognized if future undiscounted cash flows from operations are not expected to be sufficient to recover long-\nlived assets. The carrying amounts are then reduced to fair value, which is typically determined by using a discounted cash flow\nmodel.\nAssets held for sale are to be reported at lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Judgment is required in\nestimating the sales price of assets held for sale and the time required to sell the assets. These estimates are based upon\navailable market data and operating cash flows of the assets held for sale. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we sold a facility\nresulting in a gain of $5.0 million. Refer to Note 21.\n48\nGoodwill\nThe Company tests goodwill at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or\ncircumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.\nWe may elect to perform a qualitative assessment that considers economic, industry and company-specific factors for all or\nselected reporting units. If, after completing the assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a quantitative test. We may also elect to perform a quantitative test\ninstead of a qualitative test for any or all of our reporting units.\nQuantitative testing requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. We use the discounted\ncash flow method to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. The discounted cash flow method incorporates various\nassumptions, the most significant being projected sales growth rates, operating margins and cash flows, the terminal growth rate\nand the weighted average cost of capital. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill impairment\nis measured as the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying value\nof goodwill.\nThe 2023, 2022 and 2021 assessments indicated no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill in any of the Company’s\nreporting units and no impairment charges were recognized.\nIntangible Assets\nThe estimated fair values of acquired intangibles are generally determined based upon future economic benefits such as\nearnings and cash flows. Acquired identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are amortized over their estimated\nuseful lives. Acquired intangible assets with an indefinite life are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least\nannually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets are\nbelow their estimated fair values. Impairment is tested under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, as amended by\nAccounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2012-2.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable,\naccounts payable and long-term debt. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition\nand generally does not require collateral. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Due\nto their short-term nature, the carrying values of cash and equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable\napproximate fair value. The carrying value of the Company’s variable rate long-term debt instruments also approximates fair\nvalue due to the variable rate feature of these instruments.\nFrom time to time, the Company makes long-term, strategic equity investments in companies to promote business and strategic\nobjectives. These investments as classified within other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For investments requiring\nequity method accounting, we recognize our share of the investee’s earnings or losses within Other Expense, Net of Other\nIncome in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For investments not requiring equity method accounting, if the\ninvestment has no readily determinable fair value, we have elected the practicability exception of ASU 2016-01, under which\nthe investment is measured at cost, less impairment, plus or minus observable price changes from orderly transactions of an\nidentical or similar investment of the same issuer.\nWe recognized income of $1.8 million associated with the reversal of a liability related to an equity investment, as we will no\nlonger be required to make an associated payment. This amount is included in Other Expense, Net of Other Income in the\nConsolidated Statement of Operations as of December 31, 2023. Our ownership percentage in this company was diluted during\n2023, thus our equity investment was converted to the cost method.\nDeferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance\nThe Company records a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets if and to the extent it is more likely than not that the\nCompany will not recover the deferred tax assets. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, the Company weighs all\nrelevant positive and negative evidence, and considers among other factors, historical financial performance, projected future\ntaxable income, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, and tax planning strategies.\nAfter considering the losses in recent periods and cumulative pre-tax losses in the three-year period ending with the current\nyear, the Company determined that projections of future taxable income could not be relied upon as a source of income to\nrealize its deferred tax assets. However, the Company is relying on a significant portion of its existing deferred tax liabilities for\nthe realizability of deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company has valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets of\n49\napproximately $65.6 million, $57.4 million, and $43.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, for the portion of deferred tax asset not realizable by the Company’s existing deferred tax liabilities.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”)\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure\nof contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting periods in the financial statements\nand accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe Company accounts for its foreign currency translation in accordance with ASC Topic 830, Foreign Currency Translation.\nThe aggregate transaction gains and losses included in operations were insignificant in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nDividends\nThe Company has not paid any cash dividends in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023.\nLoss Contingencies\nLoss contingencies may from time to time arise from situations such as claims and other legal actions. Loss contingencies are\nrecorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. In\nall other instances, legal fees are expensed as incurred. Disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the\nultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision. Contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods. In recording\nliabilities for probable losses, management is required to make estimates and judgments regarding the amount or range of the\nprobable loss. Management continually assesses the adequacy of estimated loss contingencies and, if necessary, adjusts the\namounts recorded as better information becomes known.\n50\nNewly Adopted and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nFinancial Statement Effect or Other\nStandard Description Significant Matters\nASU No. 2023-06 This ASU amends the disclosure or presentation The Company will monitor the\nDisclosure Improvements: requirements related to various subtopics in the removal of various requirements from\nCodification Amendments in FASB Accounting Standards Codification.

The update also includes\nenhanced disclosure requirements for income\ntaxes paid. The new standard is effective for\nannual periods beginning after December 15,\n2024; early adoption is permitted.\nWe consider the applicability and impact of all ASUs. ASUs not listed above were assessed and determined to be either not\napplicable or had or are expected to have minimal impact on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nNOTE 2 — REVENUE\nRevenue is recognized when, or as, the Company transfers control of promised products or services to a customer in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring those products or services. Sales\nshown on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations are from contracts with customers.\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within a range from\n30 to 90 days after the performance obligation has been satisfied; or in certain cases, up-front deposits. In circumstances where\nthe timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of receipt of consideration, the Company has determined that the\nCompany’s contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. Taxes collected from customers, which are\nsubsequently remitted to governmental authorities, are excluded from sales.\nThe Company recognizes an asset for the incremental, material costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if the Company\nexpects the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year and the costs are expected to be recovered. These incremental costs\ninclude, but are not limited to, sales commissions incurred to obtain a contract with a customer. The Company has elected the\npractical expedient available under ASC 340-40-25-4 to immediately expense the incremental cost of obtaining a contract when\nthe expected benefit of those costs is less than one year. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not have\nmaterial incremental costs on any open contracts with an original expected duration of greater than one year.\nThe Company recognizes an asset for certain, material costs to fulfill a contract if it is determined that the costs relate directly to\na contract or an anticipated contract that can be specifically identified, generate or enhance resources that will be used in\nsatisfying performance obligations in the future, and are expected to be recovered. Such costs are amortized on a systematic\nbasis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods to which the asset relates. Start-up costs are expensed as\nincurred. Capitalized fulfillment costs are included in Inventories in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Should\n51\nfuture orders not materialize or it is determined the costs are no longer probable of recovery, the capitalized costs are written\noff. The Company has capitalized $4.7 million and $2.5 million of costs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of\naccount. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual goods or\nservices is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts which are, therefore, not distinct. Thus, the contract’s\ntransaction price is the revenue recognized when or as that performance obligation is satisfied. Promised goods or services that\nare immaterial in the context of the contract are not separately assessed as performance obligations.\nSome of our contracts have multiple performance obligations, most commonly due to the contract covering multiple phases of\nthe product lifecycle (development, production, maintenance and support). For contracts with multiple performance obligations,\nthe contract’s transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling\nprice of each distinct good or service in the contract. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the\nexpected cost plus margin approach, under which expected costs are forecast to satisfy a performance obligation and then an\nappropriate margin is added for that distinct good or service. Shipping and handling activities that occur after the customer has\nobtained control of the good are considered fulfillment activities, not performance obligations.\nSome of our contracts offer price discounts or free units after a specified volume has been purchased. The Company evaluates\nthese options to determine whether they provide a material right to the customer, representing a separate performance\nobligation. If the option provides a material right to the customer, revenue is allocated to these rights and recognized when\nthose future goods or services are transferred, or when the option expires.\nContract modifications are routine in the performance of our contracts. Contracts are often modified to account for changes in\ncontract specifications or requirements. In most instances, contract modifications are for goods or services that are distinct, and,\ntherefore, are accounted for as new contracts. The effect of modifications has been reflected when identifying the satisfied and\nunsatisfied performance obligations, determining the transaction price and allocating the transaction price.\nThe majority of the Company’s revenue from contracts with customers is recognized at a point in time, when the customer\nobtains control of the promised product. In general, the customer has obtained control when they have legal title, significant\nrisks and rewards of ownership of the asset, and the Company has a present right to payment for the product. These contracts\nmay provide credits or incentives, which may be accounted for as variable consideration. Variable consideration is estimated at\nthe most likely amount to predict the consideration to which the Company will be entitled, and only to the extent it is probable\nthat a subsequent change in estimate will not result in a significant revenue reversal when estimating the amount of revenue to\nrecognize. Variable consideration is treated as a change to the sales transaction price and based on an assessment of all\ninformation (i.e., historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company, and estimated at contract\ninception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. Most of our contracts do\nnot contain rights to return product; where this right does exist, it is evaluated as possible variable consideration.\nFor contracts that are subject to the requirement to accrue anticipated losses, the Company recognizes the entire anticipated loss\nin the period that the loss becomes probable.\nFor contracts with customers in which the Company promises to provide a product to the customer that has no alternative use to\nthe Company and the Company has enforceable rights to payment for progress completed to date inclusive of profit, the\nCompany satisfies the performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time, using costs incurred to date relative to total\nestimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work\nperformed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include\nlabor, material and overhead.\nThe Company also recognizes revenue from service contracts (including service-type warranties) over time. The Company\nrecognizes revenue over time during the term of the agreement as the customer is simultaneously receiving and consuming the\nbenefits provided throughout the Company’s performance. The Company typically recognizes revenue over time using a cost-\nto-cost method, where revenues are recognized proportionally as costs are incurred, or on a straight-line basis throughout the\ncontract period.\nOn December 31, 2023, we had $592.3 million of remaining performance obligations, which we refer to as total backlog. We\nexpect to recognize approximately $526.5 million of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in 2024.\nCosts in excess of billings includes unbilled amounts resulting from revenues under contracts with customers that are satisfied\nover time and when the cost-to-cost measurement method of revenue recognition is utilized and revenue recognized exceeds the\namount billed to the customer, and right to payment is not just subject to the passage of time. Amounts may not exceed their net\n52\nrealizable value. Costs in excess of billings are classified as current assets, within Accounts Receivable, Net of Allowance for\nEstimated Credit Losses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nBillings in excess of cost includes billings in excess of revenue recognized as well as other elements of deferred revenue, which\nincludes advanced payments, up-front payments, and progress billing payments. Billings in excess of cost are reported in our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets classified as current liabilities, within Customer Advance Payments and Deferred Revenue, and\nnon-current liabilities, within Other Liabilities. To determine the revenue recognized in the period from the beginning balance\nof billings in excess of cost, the contract liability as of the beginning of the period is recognized as revenue on a contract-by-\ncontract basis when the Company satisfies the performance obligation related to the individual contract. Once the beginning\ncontract liability balance for an individual contract has been fully recognized as revenue, any additional payments received in\nthe period are recognized as revenue once the related costs have been incurred.\nWe recognized $27.6 million and $14.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in revenues\nthat were included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period.\nThe Company’s contract assets and contract liabilities consist of costs and profits in excess of billings and billings in excess of\ncost and profits, respectively.

Based on our quantitative assessments of our reporting units performed during\nour annual goodwill impairment tests, the Company concluded that no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill in any of\nthe Company’s reporting units was indicated and no impairment charges were recognized in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nNOTE 8 — LONG-TERM DEBT\nThe Company amended the existing revolving credit facility on January 19, 2023 by entering into the Sixth Amended and\nRestated Credit Agreement (the “ABL Revolving Credit Facility”). The ABL Revolving Credit Facility set the maximum\naggregate amount that the Company can borrow under the revolving credit line at $115 million, with borrowings subject to a\nborrowing base determined primarily by certain domestic inventory and accounts receivable. The maturity date of borrowings\nunder the ABL Revolving Credit Facility is January 19, 2026. Under the terms of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, the\nCompany pays interest on the unpaid principal amount of the facility at a rate equal to SOFR (which is required to be at least\n1.00%) plus 2.25% to 2.75%. The Company must pay a quarterly commitment fee under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility in\nan amount equal to 0.25% or 0.375% based on the Company’s average excess availability.\nOn June 28, 2023, the Company amended the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, temporarily increasing the maximum aggregate\namount that the Company can borrow under the revolving credit line by $5 million from $115 million to $120 million until\nOctober 31, 2023, at which time the limit was to return to $115 million. On October 31, 2023, the Company executed a second\namendment to extend the temporary limit of $120 million until January 31, 2024, at which time the limit returned to\n$115 million. Under the provisions of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, the Company has a cash dominion arrangement with\nthe lead banking institution whereby eligible daily cash receipts are contractually utilized to pay down outstanding borrowings\nand any cash balances subject to the dominion arrangement collateralize the outstanding borrowings under the ABL Revolving\nCredit Facility. Eligible cash balances that have not yet been applied to outstanding debt balances are classified as restricted\ncash in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company is also required to maintain minimum liquidity of\n$20 million through the date of delivery of the compliance certificate for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and $10 million\nthereafter. On December 31, 2023, there was $87.0 million outstanding on the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and there\nremained $32.7 million available, net of outstanding letters of credit (though subject to the minimum liquidity requirement).\nThe Company also entered into a $90 million asset-based Term Loan Facility on January 19, 2023. The Term Loan Facility is\nsecured primarily by fixed assets, real estate and intellectual property. The maturity date of the Term Loan Facility is the earlier\nof the stated maturity date of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility or January 19, 2027, if the ABL Revolving Credit Facility is\nextended beyond that date. The Company pays interest under the Term Loan Facility at a rate equal to SOFR (which is required\nto be at least 2.50%) plus 8.75%. The Company must pay a commitment fee under the Term Loan Facility of 5% of the total\naggregate commitment, or $4.5 million, $1.8 million of which was paid on the closing date, $1.8 million of which was paid on\nJune 19, 2023 and $0.9 million of which is due in the second quarter of 2024.\nAmortization of the principal under the Term Loan Facility began in April with a monthly amortization rate of 0.292% of the\noutstanding term loan principal balance for the period April 1, 2023 through June 1, 2023, 0.542% per month for the period\nJuly 1, 2023 through September 1, 2023 and 0.833% monthly thereafter. Total scheduled principal payments of $9.0 million are\npayable in 2024 and as such, have been classified as current in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December\n31, 2023. The interest rate on current maturities of long-term debt is variable at SOFR plus 8.75%, and was 14.2% at December\n31, 2023. The remaining balance of $76.5 million as of December 31, 2023, is recorded as long-term in the accompanying\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\n56\nPursuant to the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility, the Company was required to comply with a\nminimum trailing four quarter Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility\nAgreements, of $51.7 million in the Company’s fourth quarter of 2023, increasing to $57.6 million in the first quarter of 2024,\n$65.2 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $70 million thereafter. The non-cash accounts receivable reserve associated\nwith the customer bankruptcy recorded in 2023 was not required to be included in the calculation of EBITDA pursuant to our\nABL Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility. Mandatory prepayment of a portion of excess cash flow, as defined\nby the Term Loan Facility, is payable towards the principal amount outstanding on an annual basis. No such amounts are\npayable for the year ended December 31, 2023. Any voluntary prepayments made are subject to a prepayment fee, as defined\nby the Term Loan Facility. Beginning with the first quarter of 2024, the Company is subject to a minimum fixed charge\ncoverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.00. Further, the Company is subject to excess cash flow repayment provisions, restrictions on\nadditional indebtedness, share repurchases and dividend payments, and a limitation on capital expenditures. The Company was\nin compliance with debt covenants under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility as of and for the year\nended December 31, 2023.\nThe Company incurred $8.8 million in incremental debt issuance costs related to the new facilities, allocated between the ABL\nRevolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility. All costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective\nagreement. Unamortized deferred debt issuance costs associated with the ABL Revolving Credit Facility ($2.0 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023) are recorded within Other Assets and those associated with the Term Loan Facility ($4.3 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023) are recorded as a reduction of the carrying value of the debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCertain of the Company’s subsidiaries are borrowers or guarantors under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan\nFacility.\nIn the event of voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy of the Company or any subsidiary, all unpaid principal and other amounts\nowing under the credit facilities automatically become due and payable. Other events of default, such as failure to make\npayments as they become due and breach of financial and other covenants, change of control, cross default under other material\ndebt agreements, and a going concern qualification for any reason other than loan maturity date give the agent the option to\ndeclare all such amounts immediately due and payable.\nThe Company expects its sales growth and reductions in working capital will provide sufficient cash flows to fund operations.\nHowever, the Company may also evaluate various actions and alternatives to enhance its profitability and cash generation from\noperating activities, which could include manufacturing efficiency initiatives, cost-reduction measures, working with vendors\nand suppliers to reduce lead times and expedite shipment of critical components, and working with customers to expedite\nreceivable collections.\nOur ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and comply with financial debt covenants is highly dependent upon achieving\nexpected operating results. Failure to achieve expected operating results could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity,\nour ability to obtain financing or access our existing financing, and our operations in the future and could allow our debt holders\nto demand payment of all outstanding amounts. Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, for further discussion.\nNOTE 9 — WARRANTY\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company warrants its products against defects in design, materials and workmanship\ntypically over periods ranging from twelve to sixty months. The Company determines warranty reserves needed by product line\nbased on experience and current facts and circumstances. Activity in the warranty accrual, which is included in Other Accrued\nExpenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is summarized as follows:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nBalance at Beginning of the Year $ 8,009 $ 8,183 $ 7,018\nWarranties Issued 6,260 3,407 6,083\nReassessed Warranty Exposure (397) (65) (1,474)\nWarranties Settled (4,121) (3,516) (3,444)\nBalance at End of the Year $ 9,751 $ 8,009 $ 8,183\nNOTE 10 — LEASES\nThe Company has operating and finance leases for leased office and manufacturing facilities and equipment leases. We have\nconcluded that when an agreement grants us the right to substantially all of the economic benefits associated with an identified\nasset, and we are able to direct the use of that asset throughout the term of the agreement, we have a lease. We lease certain\n57\noffice equipment under finance leases, and we lease certain production facilities, office equipment and vehicles under operating\nleases. Some of our leases include options to extend or terminate the leases and these options have been included in the relevant\nlease term to the extent that they are reasonably certain to be exercised.\nIf the lease arrangement also contains non-lease components, the Company elected the practical expedient not to separate any\ncombined lease and non-lease components for all lease contracts. For our real estate leases, the payments used in the calculation\nof a new lease liability include fixed payments and variable payments (if the variable payments are based on an index) over the\nremaining lease term. Variable lease payments based on indices have been included in the related right-of-use assets and lease\nliabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, while variable lease payments based on usage of the underlying asset have been\nexcluded and are expensed in the period they are incurred, as they do not represent present rights or obligations. Variable lease\ncomponents for leases relate primarily to common area maintenance charges and other separately billed lessor services, sales\nand real estate taxes.\nAny new additional operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) assets are based on the\npresent value of the remaining minimum rental payments. The Company’s operating lease liability increased approximately\n$19.9 million as a result of acquiring ROU assets from new leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2023. In\ndetermining the incremental borrowing rate, we have considered borrowing data for secured debt obtained from our lending\ninstitution.\nThe following is a summary of the Company’s ROU assets and lease liabilities at December 31:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nOperating Leases:\nOperating Right-of-Use Assets, Gross $ 43,528 $ 29,466\nLess Accumulated Right-of-Use Asset Impairment 53 1,710\nLess Accumulated Amortization 15,566 14,728\nOperating Right-of-Use Assets, Net $ 27,909 $ 13,028\nShort-term Operating Lease Liabilities $ 5,069 $ 4,441\nLong-term Operating Lease Liabilities 24,376 9,942\nOperating Lease Liabilities $ 29,445 $ 14,383\nFinance Leases:\nFinance Right-of-Use Assets, Gross $ 274 $ 231\nLess Accumulated Amortization 80 138\nFinance Right-of-Use Assets, Net — Included in Other Assets $ 194 $ 93\nShort-term Finance Lease Liabilities — Included in Other Accrued Expenses $ 97 $ 29\nLong-term Finance Lease Liabilities — Included in Other Liabilities 104 67\nFinance Lease Liabilities $ 201 $ 96\nThe following is a summary of the Company’s total lease costs as of December 31:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nFinance Lease Cost:\nAmortization of ROU Assets $ 54 $ 94\nInterest on Lease Liabilities 9 4\nTotal Finance Lease Cost 63 98\nOperating Lease Cost 6,352 6,627\nImpairment Charge of Operating Lease ROU Asset 53 —\nVariable Lease Cost 2,240 1,757\nShort-term Lease Cost (excluding month-to-month) 251 602\nLess Sublease and Rental Income (548) (1,329)\nTotal Operating Lease Cost 8,348 7,657\nTotal Net Lease Cost $ 8,411 $ 7,755\n58\nThe following is a summary of cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities as of December 31:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nOperating Cash Flow for Finance Leases $ 9 $ 4\nOperating Cash Flow for Operating Leases $ 6,180 $ 7,873\nFinancing Cash Flow for Finance Leases $ 47 $ 93\nAs permitted by ASC 842, leases with expected durations of less than 12 months from inception (i.e. short-term leases) were\nexcluded from the Company’s calculation of its lease liability and ROU asset.\nThe weighted-average remaining term for the Company’s operating and financing leases are approximately 8 years and 2 years,\nrespectively.

In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, the Company weighs all\nrelevant positive and negative evidence, and considers among other factors, historical financial performance, projected future\ntaxable income, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, and tax planning strategies.\nAfter considering the losses in recent periods and cumulative pre-tax losses in the three-year period ending with the current\nyear, the Company determined that projections of future taxable income could not be relied upon as a source of income to\nrealize its deferred tax assets. However, the Company is relying on a significant portion of its existing deferred tax liabilities for\nthe realizability of deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company has valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets of\napproximately $65.6 million, $57.4 million, and $43.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, for the portion of deferred tax asset not realizable by the Company’s existing deferred tax liabilities.\nBeginning January 1, 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and\ndevelopment expenditures in the current year and now requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize research and development\ncosts pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 174. The capitalized expenses are amortized over a 5-year period for\ndomestic expenses and a 15-year period for foreign expenses. As a result of this provision of the TCJA, deferred tax assets\nrelated to capitalized research expenses increased by approximately $5.8 million and $19.9 million during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company maintains a full valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset.\nAt December 31, 2023, gross federal net operating losses amounted to approximately $1.9 million, which are subject to annual\nlimitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382. Of these net operating losses, $1.5 million expire in 2038 and the\nremaining $0.4 million will carryforward indefinitely. The Company maintains a full valuation allowance against this deferred\ntax asset.\nAt December 31, 2023, gross state net operating loss carryforwards amounted to approximately $138.6 million. These state net\noperating loss carryforwards begin to expire at various dates from 2023 through 2043. The Company maintains a full valuation\nallowance against this deferred tax asset.\nAt December 31, 2023, state income tax credit carryforwards amounted to approximately $0.9 million and begin to expire at\nvarious dates from 2023 to 2040. Additionally, the Company has approximately $0.2 million of foreign tax credits that it can\ncarry forward through 2027 and approximately $0.5 million of research and development tax credits that it can carry forward\nthrough 2043. The Company maintains a full valuation allowance against these credits.\nThe Company has analyzed its filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax\nreturns, as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions. Should the Company need to accrue a liability for uncertain tax\nbenefits, any interest and penalties associated with that liability would be recorded as income tax expense. A reconciliation of\nthe total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows:\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nBalance at Beginning of the Year $ 443 $ 1,412 $ 1,890\nDecreases as a Result of Tax Positions Taken in Prior Years (343) (969) (478)\nBalance at End of the Year $ 100 $ 443 $ 1,412\nThere are no material penalties or interest liabilities accrued as of December 31, 2023, 2022, or 2021, nor are any material\npenalties or interest costs included in expense for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. The years under\nwhich we conducted our evaluation coincided with the tax years currently still subject to examination by major federal and state\ntax jurisdictions, those being 2019 through 2023 for federal purposes and 2017 through 2023 for state purposes.\nPretax income (loss) from the Company’s foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $6.5 million, $0.1 million and\n$(3.3) million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The balance of pretax earnings or loss for each of those years were\ndomestic.\nHistorically, we have asserted that the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were indefinitely reinvested. However,\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we determined that we can no longer assert indefinite reinvestment on\n61\napproximately $1.9 million and $3.4 million of the unremitted earnings of Luminescent Systems Canada Inc, respectively. As a\nresult, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $0.1 million and $0.2 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, related to local country withholding taxes that are expected to be incurred upon ultimate repatriation of such\nearnings. All other foreign unremitted earnings, which total approximately $13.6 million, continue to be indefinitely reinvested.\nWe continue to be permanently reinvested in outside basis differences other than unremitted earnings as we have no plans to\nliquidate or sell any foreign subsidiaries. In addition, we have not provided deferred taxes on any outside basis differences of\nour domestic subsidiaries as we have the ability and intent to recover these basis differences in a tax-free manner. It is not\npracticable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax related to these basis differences.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was enacted in response to the\neconomic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act includes many measures to assist companies,\nincluding temporary changes to income and non-income based laws, some of which were enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and\nJobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”). Some of the key changes include eliminating the 80% of taxable income limitation by allowing\ncorporate entities to fully utilize NOLs to offset taxable income in 2018, 2019 and 2020, allowing NOLs originating in 2018,\n2019 and 2020 to be carried back five years, enhanced interest deductibility, and retroactively clarifying the immediate recovery\nof qualified improvement property costs rather than over a 39-year recovery period. During the year ended December 31, 2021,\nthe Company recorded a tax benefit relating to the NOL carryback provisions and the technical correction for qualified\nimprovement property provided for in the CARES Act of approximately $0.3 million. No tax benefit was recorded for the years\nending December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was signed into law on August 16, 2022. Key provisions under the IRA include a\n15% corporate alternative minimum tax imposed on certain large corporations and the extension and expansion of clean energy\ntax incentives. There were no impacts related to the IRA recorded for the years ending December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nUnder an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Inclusive Framework, countries that agreed to enact a\ntwo-pillar solution aim to address the challenges arising from the digitalization of the world economy (Pillar Two). Pillar Two\nsets out global minimum Effective Tax Rate (ETR) rules to ensure that large multinational businesses with consolidated\nrevenue over €750 million are subject to a minimum ETR of 15% on income arising in low-tax jurisdictions. Rules under Pillar\nTwo are expected to be enacted beginning January 1, 2024. The Company will continue to monitor the impact of Pillar Two;\nhowever, the Pillar Two is currently not applicable as the Company does not meet the threshold of having consolidated revenue\nover €750 million.\nNOTE 12 — PROFIT SHARING/401K PLAN\nThe Company offers eligible domestic full-time employees participation in a safe harbor 401K plan. The plan provides for an\nannual company contribution. In addition, employees may contribute a portion of their salary to the plan. In response to the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Company contributions were temporarily suspended beginning in the second quarter of\n2020. The Company contributions were reinstated in the fourth quarter of 2021. The plan may be amended or terminated at any\ntime.\nTotal charges to income before income taxes for this plan was approximately $5.3 million, $4.7 million and $4.3 million in\n2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company has funded the 2022 and 2023 contributions to date with treasury stock in\nlieu of cash and will fund the remaining 2023 contribution with treasury stock in the first quarter of 2024.\nNOTE 13 — RETIREMENT PLANS AND RELATED POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS\nThe Company has two non-qualified supplemental retirement defined benefit plans (“SERP” and “SERP II”) for certain current\nand retired executive officers. The accumulated benefit obligation of the plans as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 amounts to\n$22.0 million and $20.5 million, respectively.\nThe plans provide for benefits based upon average annual compensation and years of service and, in the case of SERP, there are\noffsets for social security and profit sharing benefits. It is the Company’s intent to fund the plans as plan benefits become\npayable, since no assets exist at December 31, 2023 or 2022 for either of the plans.\nThe Company accounts for the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit\nobligations) of its pension plans in accordance with the recognition and disclosure provisions of ASC Topic 715,\nCompensation, Retirement Benefits, which requires the Company to recognize the funded status in its balance sheet, with a\ncorresponding adjustment to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), net of tax. These amounts will be\nsubsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost pursuant to the Company’s historical policy for amortizing such amounts.\nFurther, actuarial gains and losses that arise in subsequent periods and are not recognized as net periodic pension cost in the\n62\nsame periods will be recognized as a component of AOCI. Those amounts will be subsequently recognized as a component of\nnet periodic pension cost on the same basis as the amounts recognized in AOCI.\nUnrecognized prior service costs of $0.6 million ($1.2 million net of $0.6 million in taxes) and unrecognized actuarial losses of\n$2.0 million ($3.6 million net of $1.6 million in taxes) are included in AOCI at December 31, 2023 and have not yet been\nrecognized in net periodic pension cost.\nThe reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the projected benefit obligation of the plans for the years ended\nDecember 31 is as follows:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nFunded Status\nProjected Benefit Obligation\nBeginning of the Year — January 1 $ 26,210 $ 30,503\nService Cost 105 138\nInterest Cost 1,302 834\nActuarial Loss (Gain) 1,529 (4,917)\nBenefits Paid (348) (348)\nEnd of the Year — December 31 $ 28,798 $ 26,210\nIn 2023, the net actuarial loss of $1.5 million is due to the change in the salary scale and the decrease of 21 basis points in the\ndiscount rate used to measure the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. The assumptions used\nto calculate the projected benefit obligation as of December 31 are as follows:\n2023 2022\nDiscount Rate 4.79% 5.00%\nFuture Average Compensation Increases 3.00% 2.00% - 3.00%\nThe plans are unfunded at December 31, 2023 and are recognized in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as a\ncurrent accrued pension liability of $0.3 million and a long-term accrued pension liability of $28.4 million.\nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is included in SG&A expenses, and all other net periodic benefit costs\ncomponents (such as interest cost, prior service cost amortization and actuarial gain/loss amortization) are reported outside of\noperating income, within Other (Income) Expense, Net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table summarizes the components of the net periodic cost for the years ended December 31:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nNet Periodic Cost\nService Cost — Benefits Earned During Period $ 105 $ 138 $ 195\nInterest Cost 1,302 834 764\nAmortization of Prior Service Cost 386 386 386\nAmortization of Losses 358 949 1,292\nNet Periodic Cost $ 2,151 $ 2,307 $ 2,637\nThe assumptions used to determine the net periodic cost are as follows:\n2023 2022 2021\nDiscount Rate 5.00% 2.75% 2.42%\nFuture Average Compensation Increases 2.00% - 3.00% 2.00% - 3.00% 2.00% - 3.00%\nBenefit payments expected in each of the next five years are as follows: 2024 - $0.7 million, 2025 - $0.6 million, 2026 -\n$0.6 million, 2027 - $0.9 million, and 2028 - $1.9 million. Benefits expected to be paid in the aggregate between 2029 and 2033\nare $11.1 million. Given that the plans are unfunded, these amounts are what the Company expects to contribute to the plans in\neach respective year.\n63\nParticipants in the SERP are entitled to paid medical, dental and long-term care insurance benefits upon retirement under the\nplan. The measurement date for determining the plan obligation and cost is December 31. The accumulated postretirement\nbenefit obligation is $0.8 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The plan is recognized in the accompanying Consolidated\nBalance Sheets as a current accrued pension liability of less than $0.1 million and a long-term accrued pension liability of\n$0.8 million. The net periodic cost for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was not material.\nThe Company is a participating employer in a trustee-managed multiemployer defined benefit pension plan for employees who\nparticipate in collective bargaining agreements. The plan generally provides retirement benefits to employees based on years of\nservice to the Company. Contributions are based on the hours worked and are expensed on a current basis. The plan is 99.2%\nfunded as of January 1, 2023. The Company’s contributions to the plan were $0.7 million in 2023, $0.5 million in 2022 and\n$0.4 million in 2021. These contributions represent less than 1% of total contributions to the plan.\nNOTE 14 — SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nShare Buyback Program\nThe Company’s Board of Directors from time to time authorizes the repurchase of common stock, which allows the Company\nto purchase shares of its common stock in accordance with applicable securities laws on the open market or through privately\nnegotiated transactions. The Company has the capacity under the currently authorized program to repurchase additional shares\nof its common stock with a maximum dollar value of $41.5 million. Under its current credit agreement, and as described further\nin Note 8, the Company is currently restricted from further stock repurchases under this program.\nAt-the-Market Equity Offering\nOn August 8, 2023, the Company initiated an at-the-market equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) for the sale from\ntime to time of shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Common Stock”) having an aggregate\noffering price of up to $30.0 million. Shares of Common Stock under the ATM Program are offered using Wells Fargo\nSecurities, LLC and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., as sales agents (the “Sales Agents” and each a “Sales Agent”), pursuant to\nthe equity distribution agreement, dated August 8, 2023, by and among the Company and the Sales Agents (the “Equity\nDistribution Agreement”).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company sold 1,334,228 shares of our Common Stock under the ATM\nProgram. The Company generated $21.8 million in aggregate gross proceeds from sales under the ATM Program at an average\nsale price of $16.31 per share of Common Stock. Aggregate net proceeds from the ATM Program were $21.3 million after\ndeducting related expenses, including commissions to the Sales Agents and issuance costs. As of December 31, 2023, the\nCompany had remaining capacity under the ATM Program to sell shares of Common Stock having an aggregate offering price\nup to approximately $8.2 million.\nReserved Common Stock\nAt December 31, 2023, approximately 9.7 million shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of the\nClass B stock, exercise of stock options, issuance of restricted stock and purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nClass B Stock is identical to Common Stock, except Class B Stock has ten votes per share, is automatically converted to\nCommon Stock on a one-for-one basis when sold or transferred other than via gift, devise or bequest and cannot receive\ndividends unless an equal or greater amount of dividends is declared on Common Stock.\nComprehensive Loss and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nComprehensive income or loss consists of net income or loss and the after-tax impact of retirement liability adjustments. No\nincome tax effect is recorded for currency translation adjustments.\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are as follows:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nForeign Currency Translation Adjustments $ (6,351) $ (7,335)\nRetirement Liability Adjustment – Before Tax (5,357) (4,473)\nTax Benefit 2,282 2,282\nRetirement Liability Adjustment – After Tax (3,075) (2,191)\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss $ (9,426) $ (9,526)\n64\nIn 2023, 2022 and 2021, no tax benefit was recognized as the Company had recorded a full valuation allowance on the deferred\ntax asset associated with the retirement liability.\nThe components of other comprehensive income are as follows:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nForeign Currency Translation Adjustments $ 984 $ (1,928) $ (939)\nRetirement Liability Adjustment (884) 6,897 2,894\nOther Comprehensive Income $ 100 $ 4,969 $ 1,955\nNOTE 15 — LOSS PER SHARE\nLoss per share computations are based upon the following table:\n(In thousands, except per share data) 2023 2022 2021\nNet Loss $ (26,421) $ (35,747) $ (25,578)\nBasic Earnings Weighted Average Shares 33,104 32,164 31,061\nNet Effect of Dilutive Stock Options — — —\nDiluted Earnings Weighted Average Shares 33,104 32,164 31,061\nBasic Loss Per Share $ (0.80) $ (1.11) $ (0.82)\nDiluted Loss Per Share $ (0.80) $ (1.11) $ (0.82)\nStock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of the underlying common shares are excluded from\nthe computation of diluted earnings per share because they are out-of-the-money and the effect of their inclusion would be anti-\ndilutive. The Company incurred a net loss for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, therefore all outstanding\nstock options and unvested restricted stock units are excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share because the effect\nof their inclusion would be antidilutive. The number of common shares excluded from the computation was approximately\n0.8 million shares for the year ended December 31, 2023, 1.4 million shares for the year ended December 31, 2022, and\n1.4 million shares for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe Company has funded substantially all of its 2022 and 2023 401K contributions, and will fund the remaining 2023 401K\ncontributions outstanding with treasury stock in lieu of cash. The earnings per share computations for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022 are each inclusive of approximately 0.1 million in shares outstanding for the equivalent shares\nneeded to fulfill the respective period’s 401K obligation using the closing share price as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nActual shares issued may differ based on the share price on the settlement date.\nNOTE 16 — EQUITY COMPENSATION\nThe Company has equity compensation plans that authorize the issuance of restricted stock units or options for shares of\nCommon Stock to directors, officers and key employees. Equity-based compensation is designed to reward long-term\ncontributions to the Company and provide incentives for recipients to join and to remain with the Company. The exercise price\nof stock options, determined by a committee of the Board of Directors, is equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock\non the grant date. Options become exercisable over periods not exceeding ten years, and must be exercised within ten years\nfrom the grant date. The Company’s practice has been to issue new shares upon the exercise of the options.\nThe Company established its Incentive Stock Option Plans for the purpose of attracting and retaining executive officers and key\nemployees, and to align management’s interest with those of the shareholders. At December 31, 2023, the Company had\noptions outstanding for 587,482 shares under the plans.\nThe Company established the Directors Stock Option Plans for the purpose of attracting and retaining the services of\nexperienced and knowledgeable outside directors, and to align their interest with those of the shareholders. At December 31,\n2023, the Company had options outstanding for 31,906 shares under the plans.\nDuring 2017, the Company established the Long Term Incentive Plan for the purpose of attracting and retaining directors,\nexecutive officers and key employees, and to align management’s interest with those of the shareholders. The Long Term\nIncentive Plan contemplates the use of a mix of equity award types. For stock options, the exercise price is equal to the share\nprice on the date of grant. Upon inception, the remaining options available for future grant under the 2011 Incentive Stock\nOption Plan and the Directors Stock Option Plans were rolled in the Long Term Incentive Plan, and no further grants may be\n65\nmade out of those plans. At December 31, 2023, the Company had stock options and RSUs outstanding that covered 1,445,256\nshares under the Long Term Incentive Plan, and there were 835,076 shares available for future grant under this plan.\nStock compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share-based payment awards\nthat is ultimately expected to vest during the period. Vesting requirements vary for directors, officers and key employees. In\ngeneral, options or RSUs granted to outside directors vest six months from the date of grant and options granted to officers and\nkey employees straight line vest over a three- to five-year period from the date of grant. RSUs granted to officers and key\nemployees generally cliff vest three years from the date of grant.\nThe following table provides compensation expense information based on the fair value of stock options and RSUs for the years\nended December 31 as follows:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nEquity-based Compensation Expense $ 7,198 $ 6,497 $ 6,460\nTax Benefit (1,259) (1,068) (924)\nEquity-based Compensation Expense, Net of Tax $ 5,939 $ 5,429 $ 5,536\nTax benefit excludes the impact of valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets.\nStock Options\n2023 2022 2021\nWeighted Average Fair Value of the Options Granted $ 8.39 $ 5.97 $ 7.05\nThe weighted average fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model\nwith the following assumptions:\n2023 2022 2021\nRisk-free Interest Rate 4.20% - 4.33% 3.48% - 3.62% 0.45% - 1.52%\nDividend Yield —% —% —%\nVolatility Factor 0.58 0.61 0.58\nExpected Life in Years 3 - 7 years 5 - 9 years 5 - 10 years\nTo determine expected volatility, the Company uses historical volatility based on weekly closing prices of its Common Stock\nand considers currently available information to determine if future volatility is expected to differ over the expected terms of the\noptions granted. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time of grant for the appropriate term of the\noptions granted. Expected dividends are based on the Company’s history and expectation of dividend payouts. The expected\nterm of stock options is based on vesting schedules, expected exercise patterns and contractual terms.\nA summary of the Company’s stock option activity and related information for the year ended December 31 is as follows:\n2023\nWeighted\nAverage Aggregate\nExercise Intrinsic\n(Aggregate intrinsic value in thousands) Options Price Value\nOutstanding at January 1 1,376,718 $ 20.37 $ —\nOptions Granted 125,400 $ 15.15 $ —\nOptions Exercised (6,570) $ 12.64 $ —\nOptions Forfeited / Expired (84,564) $ 28.23 $ —\nOutstanding at December 31 1,410,984 $ 19.47 $ —\nExercisable at December 31 860,637 $ 23.42 $ —\nThe aggregate intrinsic value in the preceding table represents the total pretax option holder’s intrinsic value, based on the\nclosing stock price of the Company’s Common Stock which would have been received by the option holders had all option\nholders exercised their options as of that date. The closing stock price of the Company’s Common Stock was $17.42, $10.30\nand $12.00 as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As the stock price of $17.42 was below the weighted\naverage exercise price, intrinsic value is zero.\n66\nThe weighted average fair value of options vested during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $11.53, $12.89 and $14.58, respectively.\nThe total fair value of options that vested during the year amounted to $3.0 million, $2.4 million and $1.2 million for the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2023, total compensation costs related to non-vested\noption awards not yet recognized amounts to $3.6 million and will be recognized over a weighted average period of\napproximately 2 years.\nThe following is a summary of weighted average exercise prices and contractual lives for outstanding and exercisable stock\noptions as of December 31, 2023:\nOutstanding Exercisable\nWeighted Average Weighted Weighted Average Weighted\nRemaining Life Average Remaining Life Average\nExercise Price Range Shares in Years Exercise Price Shares in Years Exercise Price\n$9.74 – $15.15 870,050 8.3 $ 12.08 347,364 8.0 $ 11.58\n$22.93 – $35.82 536,370 3.9 $ 31.23 508,709 3.8 $ 31.30\n$45.89 – $45.89 4,564 1.2 $ 45.89 4,564 1.2 $ 45.89\n1,410,984 6.6 $ 19.47 860,637 5.5 $ 23.42\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant.

The plan provides employees the opportunity to invest up to the IRS annual\nmaximum of approximately $25,000 in the Company’s common stock at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value of the\nCompany’s common stock, determined each October 1. Employees are allowed to enroll annually. Employees indicate the\nnumber of shares they wish to obtain through the program and their intention to pay for the shares through payroll deductions\nover the annual cycle of October 1 through September 30. Employees can withdraw anytime during the annual cycle, and all\nmoney withheld from the employees’ pay is returned. If an employee remains enrolled in the program, enough money will have\nbeen withheld from the employees’ pay during the year to pay for all the shares that the employee opted for under the program.\nAt December 31, 2023, employees had subscribed to purchase 235,140 shares at $13.50 per share. The weighted average fair\nvalue of the options was approximately $4.94, $2.39 and $5.00 for options granted during the year ended December 31, 2023,\n2022 and 2021, respectively.\n67\nThe fair value for the options granted under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-\nScholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:\n2023 2022 2021\nRisk-free Interest Rate 5.49 % 4.01 % 0.09 %\nDividend Yield — % — % — %\nVolatility Factor 0.56 0.50 0.71\nExpected Life in Years 1.0 1.0 1.0\nNOTE 17 — FAIR VALUE\nASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, (“ASC Topic 820”) defines fair value, establishes a framework for\nmeasuring fair value and expands the related disclosure requirements. This statement applies under other accounting\npronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. The statement indicates, among other things, that a fair value\nmeasurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or\nliability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. ASC Topic 820 defines\nfair value based upon an exit price model. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety requires judgment, and involves consideration of factors specific to the asset or liability.\nASC Topic 820 establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value. This\nhierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows:\nLevel 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the\nasset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the\nfinancial instrument.\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair\nvalue.\nOn a Recurring Basis:\nA financial asset or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant\nto the fair value measurement.\nOn October 4, 2019, the Company acquired the stock of the primary operating subsidiaries as well as certain other assets from\nmass transit and defense market test solution provider, Diagnosys Test Systems Limited. The purchase consideration included\nan earnout estimated at a fair value of $2.5 million at the time of acquisition. The terms of the Diagnosys acquisition allow for a\npotential earnout of up to an additional $13.0 million over the three years post-acquisition based on achievement of new order\nlevels of over $72.0 million during that period. The fair value assigned to the earnout was determined using the real options\nmethod, which requires Level 3 inputs such as new order forecasts, discount rate, volatility factors, and other market variables\nto assess the probability of Diagnosys achieving certain order levels over the period. Based on actual and forecasted new orders,\nthe fair value was zero as of December 31, 2021, with the contingent consideration liability fair value adjustment of\n$2.2 million recorded within SG&A expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the year ended December 31,\n2021. The earnout period has expired and no amounts were paid or are payable related to this earnout.\nThere were no other financial assets or liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis at December 31, 2023 or\n2022.\nOn a Non-recurring Basis:\nLong-lived assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever adverse effects or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying value may not be recoverable. The recoverability test consists of comparing the undiscounted projected cash flows of\nthe asset or asset group (which are Level 3 inputs) with the asset of asset group’s carrying amount. Should the carrying amount\nexceed undiscounted projected cash flows, an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount exceeds\nfair value. There were no impairment charges related to long-lived assets in 2023, 2022 or 2021 and no long-lived assets are\nrequired to be measured at fair value for purposes of the long-lived asset recoverability test.\n68\nDue to their short-term nature, the carrying value of cash and equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts\npayable approximate fair value. The carrying value of the Company’s variable rate long-term debt instruments also\napproximates fair value due to the variable rate feature of these instruments.\nNOTE 18 — SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe following table summarizes selected quarterly financial information for 2023 and 2022:\nQuarter Ended\n(Unaudited) December 31, December 31,\n(In thousands, except for per share data) 2023 2022\nSales $ 195,292 $ 158,153\nGross Profit (Sales Less Cost of Products Sold) $ 39,973 $ 21,510\nIncome (Loss) Before Income Taxes $ 1,534 $ (7,208)\nNet Income (Loss) $ 6,976 $ (6,779)\nBasic Earnings (Loss) Per Share $ 0.20 $ (0.21)\nDiluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share $ 0.20 $ (0.21)\nNon-cash stock bonus expense increased $4.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to zero in the prior year,\n$1.5 million was recorded to Cost of Products Sold and $2.8 million was recorded as SG&A expense. In 2019, a former\ncustomer filed a lawsuit alleging damages associated with defective product. Mediation of the matter was held in November\n2022 and the Company was indemnified by other parties for approximately $1.5 million and recorded a gain as an offset to\nSG&A expense in the fourth quarter of 2022. These increases in SG&A were more than offset by increased gross profit\ncompared to the prior year fourth quarter resulting from the higher sales volume.\nNOTE 19 — LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nLufthansa\nOn December 29, 2010, Lufthansa Technik AG (“Lufthansa”) filed a Statement of Claim in the Regional State Court of\nMannheim, Germany. Lufthansa’s claim asserted that a subsidiary of the Company, AES, sold, marketed, and brought into use\nin Germany a power supply system that infringes upon a German patent held by Lufthansa. Lufthansa sought an order requiring\nAES to stop selling and marketing the allegedly infringing power supply system, a recall of allegedly infringing products sold\nto commercial customers in Germany since November 26, 2003, and compensation for damages related to direct sales of the\nallegedly infringing power supply system in Germany (referred to as “direct sales”).\nAES modified the outlet units at the end of 2014 and the overwhelming majority of the modified outlet units sold from 2015 do\nnot infringe the patent of Lufthansa.\nIn February 2015, the Regional State Court of Mannheim, Germany held that the patent was infringed. The judgment did not\nrequire AES to recall products that are already installed in aircraft or had been sold to other end users.\nThe Company appealed to the Higher Regional Court of Karlsruhe. On November 15, 2016, the Higher Regional Court of\nKarlsruhe upheld the lower court’s decision. The Company sought permission to appeal to the German Federal Supreme Court.\nBy judgment of March 26, 2019, the German Federal Supreme Court dismissed AES's appeal. With this decision, the above-\nmentioned proceedings are complete.\nIn July 2017, Lufthansa filed an action in the Regional State Court of Mannheim for payment of damages caused by AES’s\ndirect sales of the product into Germany. A first instance decision in this matter was handed down on December 6, 2019.\nAccording to this ruling, Lufthansa was awarded damages in the amount of approximately $3.2 million plus interest. In 2020,\nAES made payment of $4.7 million, inclusive of interest, in satisfaction of the first instance judgment. On July 12, 2023, the\nHigher Regional Court of Karlsruhe in Germany reduced the Company’s liability for direct damages on appeal from\napproximately $3.2 million plus interest to approximately $2.8 million plus interest. Additionally, in its judgment, the Court\nreduced the interest rate on damages from 5% (as held by the Regional Court of Mannheim) to 4%. Accordingly, the Company\nreclaimed overpaid damages and interest from LHT in the amount of approximately $1.2 million. This was recorded as an\noffset to Selling, General and Administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2023, upon receipt of the refund.\nBoth Lufthansa and AES have filed requests with the German Federal Supreme Court to be granted leave to file appeals against\nthis decision.\n69\nOn December 29, 2017, Lufthansa filed another infringement action against AES in the Regional State Court of Mannheim\nclaiming that sales by AES to its international customers have infringed Lufthansa's patent if AES's customers later shipped the\nproducts to Germany (referred to as “indirect sales”). This action, therefore, addresses sales other than those covered by the\naction filed on December 29, 2010, discussed above. No amount of claimed damages has been specified by Lufthansa.\nA first instance decision in this matter was issued on December 6, 2019. The Court found that indirect sales (as defined above)\nby AES to international customers infringe the patent under the conditions specified in the judgment and that the sale of\ncomponents of the EmPower system to Germany constitutes an indirect patent infringement. The Court rejected Lufthansa's\nclaim that AES is also liable for damages for the sale of modified products. This means that AES is not liable for damages\nbased on the sale of modified outlet units that removed the infringing feature. AES and Lufthansa both appealed this decision.\nOn July 12, 2023, the Higher Regional Court of Karlsruhe essentially upheld the first instance ruling.\nAccording to the Higher Regional Court of Karlsruhe ruling, AES is responsible for payment of damages for indirect sales of\npatent-infringing EmPower in-seat power supply systems in the period from December 29, 2007 to May 22, 2018. However,\nbecause the outlet units were modified at the end of 2014, the period for which AES is liable for damages in connection with\nindirect sales into Germany substantially finished at the end of 2014.\nBoth Lufthansa and AES have filed requests with the German Federal Supreme Court to be granted leave to file appeals against\nthis decision.\nAfter the accounting, Lufthansa is expected to enforce its claim for damages in separate court proceedings. These proceedings\nwould most likely be tried before the Mannheim Court again, which makes it probable that the Mannheim Court will determine\nthe damages for the indirect sales based on the same principles as in the direct sales proceedings (unless the latter ruling of the\nMannheim Court is reversed on appeal). Based on the information available and the determination of the damages in the direct\nsales claim discussed above, we estimated that the Company’s total exposure related to these matters that was probable and that\ncould be reasonably estimated at December 31, 2019, was approximately $11.6 million plus accrued interest. Accrued interest\non the indirect damages reserve was estimated using the same interest rate as the direct damages. Given the reduction in the\ndirect damages interest rate as discussed above, we recorded a reduction to the indirect damages reserve of $1.3 million in the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, as an offset to Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Approximately $0.7 million,\n$0.6 million and $0.6 million was recorded within Selling, General and Administrative Expenses in the Company’s\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for each of 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for additional interest accrued during\nsuch periods.\nIn connection with the indirect sales claims, we currently believe it is unlikely that the appeals process will be completed and\nany damages and related interest will be paid before December 31, 2024. Therefore, the liability related to this matter (inclusive\nof accrued interest), totaling $17.1 million and $17.8 million, is classified within other liabilities (non-current) in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This amount may be adjusted depending on the\ndecision of the Court on the direct sales damages appeal referred to previously.\nIn December 2017, Lufthansa filed patent infringement cases in the United Kingdom (“UK”) and in France. The Lufthansa\npatent expired in May 2018. In those cases, Lufthansa accuses AES and certain of its customers of having manufactured, used,\nsold and offered for sale a power supply system, and offered and supplied parts for a power supply system that infringed upon a\nLufthansa patent in those respective countries. In the normal course of its supply arrangements, AES has indemnified its\ncustomers from liability arising from such matters, and as such will bear responsibility for any monetary damages arising from\nsuch claims.\nOn December 4, 2020, the Court held the French patent invalid for all asserted claims. There can consequently be no finding of\ninfringement on first instance. Lufthansa has appealed this judgment. The appeal hearing took place on December 8, 2022, and\non February 24, 2023, the Court upheld the first instance judgment in favor of AES. Lufthansa lodged an appeal before the\nFrench Supreme Court; the French Supreme Court will review the Court of Appeal of Paris reasoning around the nullification\nof one of the claims of the patent. AES filed a brief with the French Supreme Court on January 22, 2024 in response to\nLufthansa’s appeal and awaits guidance on further briefing or a decision from the Court. As loss exposure is not probable and\nestimable at this time, the Company has not recorded any liability with respect to the French matter as of December 31, 2023 or\n2022.\nIn the UK matter, the Court held the UK patent valid and 3 out of 4 asserted claims infringed in June 2020. In contrast to the\ndecisions in Germany, the UK Court found that the modified components infringed a valid claim of the patent, and accordingly,\nthe period for which AES or its customers would be liable for damages in connection with direct sales into the UK extends until\nthe expiration of the patent in May 2018. While AES appealed the ruling, the Court dismissed the appeal on all grounds. The\ndamages trial is scheduled for October 2024. The case for monetary compensation will require extensive data gathering and\nanalysis which is ongoing. This analysis includes evaluating whether any units sold into the UK were subsequently shipped into\n70\nGermany, where they would be subject to the indirect sales claim discussed above. If this is the case, compensation may be\nassessed in either the UK, or in the indirect sales matter in Germany, but not in both matters.\nLufthansa has elected to pursue a claim in relation to the defendants’ profits from their infringing activities. We have estimated\ncompensation of approximately $6.2 million, plus accrued interest, for AES and its indemnified customers. Interest will accrue\nuntil final payment to Lufthansa. A reserve of $7.3 million was recorded within Selling, General & Administrative expenses in\nthe accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. This amount is subject to\nchange as additional data is received and evaluated, and as additional information regarding the damages methodology is\nclaimed by Lufthansa in advance of the damages trial. The damages trial is scheduled to be heard starting in October 2024, with\npayment likely due in early 2025. Therefore, the liability related to this matter, totaling $7.4 million and $7.0 million, is\nclassified within other liabilities (non-current) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The variance is due to currency fluctuation.\nSeparate from any such damages Lufthansa may seek in connection with the UK infringement decision discussed above, as a\nresult of the first instance judgement in their favor, Lufthansa was entitled to reimbursement from AES of a proportion of its\nlegal expenditures in the UK case. An interim reimbursement was paid to Lufthansa in August 2020. As a result of the appeal\ndecision, Lufthansa will be entitled to reimbursement from AES of a larger proportion of its first instance legal expenditures, as\nwell as a portion of its legal expenditures associated with the appeal. We recorded an estimated liability of approximately\n$1.0 million in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2021. The associated expense is recorded within Selling,\nGeneral & Administrative Expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year then ended. A payment of\n$0.3 million was made in 2022. It is likely the remaining amount will be payable within the next twelve months, and as such,\nthe liability of $0.7 million has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets within\nother accrued expenses at December 31, 2023.\nEach of the German, France and UK claims are separate and distinct. Validity and infringement of the Lufthansa patent in each\ncountry is a matter for the courts in each of these countries, whose laws differ from each other. In addition, the principles of\ncalculating damages in each jurisdiction differ substantially. Therefore, the Company has assessed each matter separately and\ncannot apply the same calculation methodology as in the German direct and indirect matters. However, it is reasonably possible\nthat additional damages and interest could be incurred if the appellate court in France was to rule in favor of Lufthansa, or if\ndamages in the UK matter are calculated on a different basis than our estimate or using information not currently available.\nOther\nOn March 23, 2020, Teradyne, Inc. filed a complaint against the Company and its subsidiary, Astronics Test Systems (“ATS”)\n(together, “the Defendants”) in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging patent and\ncopyright infringement, and certain other related claims. The Defendants moved to dismiss certain claims from the case. On\nNovember 6, 2020, the Court dismissed the Company from the case, and also dismissed a number of claims, though the patent\nand copyright infringement claims remained. The case proceeded to discovery. In addition, on December 21, 2020, ATS filed a\npetition for inter partes review (“IPR”) with the US Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”), seeking to invalidate the subject\npatent, and on July 21, 2021, the PTAB instituted IPR. The PTAB issued its decision on July 20, 2022, in which it invalidated\nall of Teradyne’s patent claims. Teradyne did not appeal the decision. On June 5, 2023, the parties attended a court-ordered\nmediation but did not reach a settlement. After the mediation, Teradyne agreed to drop its remaining state law claims in\nexchange for ATS dropping one of its defenses, leaving only its copyright claim. On December 7, 2023, the District Court\ngranted ATS’s motion for summary judgment on its affirmative defense of fair use. The Court subsequently entered final\njudgment in favor of ATS on December 14, 2023. Teradyne filed a Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on\nJanuary 12, 2024. Teradyne’s opening brief on its appeal is currently scheduled to be due on April 9, 2024 with ATS’s\nanswering brief due on May 9, 2024, though those dates may be extended. No amounts have been accrued for this matter in the\nDecember 31, 2023 or 2022 financial statements, as loss exposure was neither probable nor estimable at such times.\nOther than these proceedings, we are not party to any significant pending legal proceedings that management believes will\nresult in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accrued legal fees were $7.9 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and were insignificant as of December 31, 2022.\n71\nNOTE 20 — SEGMENTS\nSegment information and reconciliations to consolidated amounts for the years ended December 31 are as follows:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nSales:\nAerospace $ 605,001 $ 461,206 $ 365,261\nLess Inter-segment Sales (171) (10) (23)\nTotal Aerospace Sales 604,830 461,196 365,238\nTest Systems 84,376 73,717 80,027\nLess Inter-segment Sales — (19) (357)\nTest Systems 84,376 73,698 79,670\nTotal Consolidated Sales $ 689,206 $ 534,894 $ 444,908\nOperating Income (Loss) and Margins:\nAerospace $ 24,629 $ (1,883) $ (8,614)\n4.1 % (0.4) % (2.4) %\nTest Systems (8,745) (8,118) (3,765)\n(10.4) % (11.0) % (4.7) %\nTotal Operating Income (Loss) $ 15,884 $ (10,001) $ (12,379)\n2.3 % (1.9) % (2.8) %\nAdditions to (Deductions from) Operating Profit:\nNet Gain on Sale of Businesses $ 3,427 $ 11,284 $ 10,677\nInterest Expense, Net of Interest Income (23,328) (9,422) (6,804)\nCorporate and Other Expenses, Net (22,294) (21,654) (18,454)\nLoss before Income Taxes $ (26,311) $ (29,793) $ (26,960)\nDepreciation and Amortization:\nAerospace $ 20,801 $ 22,384 $ 23,349\nTest Systems 5,068 4,341 5,022\nCorporate 235 1,052 634\nTotal Depreciation and Amortization $ 26,104 $ 27,777 $ 29,005\nAssets:\nAerospace $ 493,660 $ 481,416\nTest Systems 122,681 111,513\nCorporate 17,451 22,102\nTotal Assets $ 633,792 $ 615,031\nCapital Expenditures:\nAerospace $ 5,003 $ 4,289 $ 4,932\nTest Systems 2,640 3,299 1,082\nCorporate — 87 20\nTotal Capital Expenditures $ 7,643 $ 7,675 $ 6,034\nOperating income (loss) is sales less cost of products sold and other operating expenses, excluding interest expense and other\ncorporate expenses.

The “First Earnout” is calculated based on a\nmultiple of all future sales of existing and certain future derivative products to existing and future customers in each annual\nperiod from 2019 through 2022. The First Earnout may not exceed $35.0 million in total. The “Second Earnout” is calculated\nbased on a multiple of future sales related to an existing product and program with an existing customer exceeding an annual\nthreshold for each annual period from 2019 through 2022. The Second Earnout is not capped. For the Second Earnout, if the\napplicable sales in an annual period do not exceed the annual threshold, no amounts will be paid relative to such annual period;\nthe sales in such annual period do not carry over to the next annual period. Due to the degree of uncertainty associated with\nestimating the future sales levels of the divested business and its underlying programs, and the lack of reliable predictive market\ninformation, the Company has elected an accounting policy to recognize such earnout proceeds, if received, as additional gain\non sale when such proceeds are realized or realizable. We consider the proceeds realizable when we have received\n73\ncommunication from the purchaser of its calculation of the earnout and the parties reach agreement on the calculation. No\namounts were payable to the Company under either earnout for the calendar 2019 earnout. The Company agreed to an earnout\npayment of $10.7 million for the calendar 2020 earnout, which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021 as Other Income and\nwas paid to the Company in early January 2022. In March 2022, the Company agreed with the earnout calculation for the\ncalendar 2021 earnout in the amount of $11.3 million. The Company recorded the gain and received the payment in the first\nquarter of 2022. In March 2023, the Company agreed with the final earnout calculation for the calendar 2022 earnout for\n$3.4 million. The Company recorded the gain and received the payment in the first quarter of 2023.\nOther Disposal Activity\nOn October 6, 2021, as part of a planned consolidation effort, the Company sold one of its Aerospace buildings for\n$9.2 million. Net cash proceeds were approximately $8.8 million. A gain on sale of approximately $5.0 million was recorded in\nthe Consolidated Statements of Operations as a Net Gain on Sale of Facility in the year ended December 31, 2021.
