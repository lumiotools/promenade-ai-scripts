(NASDAQ:MLAB), a global leader in the design and manufacture of life science tools and critical quality control solutions, today announced results for its first fiscal quarter (“1Q25”) ended June 30, 2024 (amounts in thousands).\n\n_First quarter FY 2025 compared to first quarter FY 2024:_\n\n  * _Revenues increased 14.9%_\n  * _Non-GAAP core organic revenues_ 1 _growth was 3.0%_\n  * _Operating income increased 940%_\n  * _Non-GAAP adjusted operating income excluding unusual items_ 2 _increased 47.0% and was 26.4% as a percentage of revenues_\n\n\n\nWe operate our business in four divisions: Sterilization and Disinfection Control (“SDC”), Clinical Genomics (“CG”), Biopharmaceutical Development (“BPD”), and Calibration Solutions (“CS”).\n\nEffective 4Q24 we changed our definition of non-GAAP adjusted operating income3 (“AOI”) and non-GAAP adjusted operating income excluding unusual items to also exclude depreciation expense. Please see the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP operating (loss) income below. All prior periods have been restated to exclude depreciation expense from these non-GAAP measures.\n\n**Executive Commentary** (amounts in thousands)\n\n“We had a successful start our first quarter of the fiscal year by delivering positive momentum for revenues, orders, profitability, and debt levels while also demonstrating continued strategic traction. Sales and marketing improvements resulted in 3.0% core organic growth in the quarter, with orders also improved as we built backlog in the quarter. Our process improvement and productivity initiatives bore fruit with strong increases in both gross profit percentage and AOI margin percentage when excluding unusual items. From a balance sheet perspective, we repaid $9.4 million in debt during the quarter which reduced our total Net Leverage Ratio* to 3.41. We remain committed to drive this ratio down below 3.0x” said Gary Owens, Chief Executive Officer of Mesa.\n\n“Revenues of $58,170 for the quarter increased 14.9% versus prior year, with core organic growth of 3.0% and 12.4% growth from our latest acquisition, GKE. That acquisition continues to trend higher than expectations announced at acquisition close. Sequentially, overall revenues declined by 120 bps which is a solid result given normal seasonality. Biopharmaceutical capital spending in BPD was strong for the second consecutive quarter while both life sciences and healthcare orders in our SDC business were robust. CG incurred continued headwinds in China from their economic slowdown and the impacts of the corruption campaign in the healthcare sector along with elongated sales cycles in the US driven by uncertainty in the LDT regulatory environment. Despite the headwinds in CG, the Asia Pacific team delivered on their one Mesa strategy to drive positive overall organic growth in the region” added Mr. Owens.\n\n“Profitability as measured by our primary metric of AOI excluding unusual items grew by 47% year over year to $15,341or 26.4% of quarterly revenues. Gross profit percentage expanded by 250 bps versus prior year, or 150 bps when excluding the impact of non-cash charges. Strong margin expansion was a direct result of productivity gains and increased volumes more than offsetting increased labor costs” added Mr. Owens.\n\n“Looking forward, we are hopeful that our biopharmaceutical related end markets will continue the strength exhibited in 4Q24 and 1Q25. In any market scenario we will work diligently so that our differentiated products, strategic initiatives and the _Mesa Way_ operating model enable us to outperform,” concluded Mr. Owens.\n\n* Total Net Leverage Ratio under our Credit Facility is defined as the ratio of total debt minus unrestricted cash in excess of $10 million as compared to 12 months trailing EBITDA. EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, for purposes of this calculation, is defined as net income plus the sum of interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, amortization, unusual or non-recurring non-cash charges and stock compensation expense. In addition, EBITDA gives effect to trailing 12 months pro-forma ownership of GKE and adds back certain GKE acquisition expenses.\n\n**Financial Results**(unaudited, amounts in thousands, except per share data)\n\nTotal revenues were $58,170, an increase of 14.9% compared to 1Q24. Operating income increased 940% to $5,580. Net income was $3,388, an increase of 717% or $0.62 per diluted share of common stock. On a non-GAAP basis, core organic revenues increased 3.0% and AOI increased 33.9% to $13,973 or $2.58 per diluted share of common stock compared to 1Q24. As detailed in the Unusual Items table below, AOI for 1Q25 was negatively impacted by unusual items totaling $1,368. Excluding the unusual items for 1Q25, AOI would have increased 47% to $15,341. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is provided in the tables below.\n\nDivision Performance\n\n**Revenues**| **Organic Revenues Growth****4**| **Core Organic Revenues Growth**  \n---|---|---  \n(Amounts in thousands)| **Three Months EndedJune 30, 2024**| **Three Months Ended****June 30, 2024**| **Three Months Ended****June 30, 2024**  \nSDC| $| 22,957| 4.9| %| 5.2| %  \nCS| 11,801| 3.0| %| 2.6| %  \nBPD| 12,008| 21.4| %| 23.5| %  \nCG| 11,404| (14.7| )%| (14.3| )%  \nTotal| $| 58,170| 2.5| %| 3.0| %  \n  \n**Sterilization and Disinfection Control** (39% of revenues in 1Q25) revenues were $22,957 for the quarter which resulted in core organic revenues growth of 5.2% versus prior year. The acquisition of GKE drove overall quarterly growth to 44.1%. Quarterly core organic growth benefited from strong orders in our life sciences vertical which also drove an increase in our backlog in the legacy SDC business. Gross profit percentage for the quarter contracted by 500 bps versus the prior year primarily due to the impact of non-cash inventory step-up purchase accounting charges from GKE. Absent the impact of these non-cash charges, gross profit percentage would have contracted by 150 bps, driven primarily by increased costs in the legacy business and the continued strength of the USD. Amortization of the non-cash inventory step-up purchase accounting charges is expected to be completed by the end of 2Q25.\n\n**Calibration Solutions** (20% of revenues in 1Q25) revenues were $11,801 which resulted in core organic revenues growth of 2.6% for the quarter. Year over year growth was driven primarily by the reduction of past due backlog stemming from prior year easing of supply chain constraints. Gross profit percentage expanded by 530 bps primarily due to operating process improvements, increased revenues on a partially fixed cost base, and mix, which more than offset increased labor costs.\n\n**Biopharmaceutical Development** (21% of revenues in 1Q25) revenues were $12,008 which resulted in core organic revenues growth of 23.5% for the quarter. The increase in revenues was driven by increased biopharmaceutical spending on capital equipment in North America and Europe and strong overall growth in APAC which when combined, resulted in an 80% increase in revenues from hardware and software versus the prior year. Gross profit percentage expanded by 120 bps primarily due to increased revenues as well as favorable product mix.\n\n**Clinical Genomics**(20% of revenues in 1Q25) revenues were $11,404 for the quarter, which resulted in a core organic revenues decline of 14.3% for the quarter but an increase of 1.8% sequentially compared to 4Q24. The decrease in revenues was driven primarily headwinds in China and North America as described earlier. Gross profit percentage expanded by 660 bps due to decreased amortization as a result of impairment charges taken during 4Q24.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nAdjusted operating income, adjusted operating income excluding unusual items, organic revenues growth and core organic revenues growth are non-GAAP measures that exclude or adjust for certain items, as detailed within the tables in “Supplemental Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” As noted below, we now include depreciation expense as a non-cash addback in the definition of adjusted operating income as it better aligns with presentations of other companies within our industry. All prior period amounts have been restated to conform with the current presentation.\n\n1 Core organic revenues growth, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as reported revenues growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency translation.\n\n2 The non-GAAP measures of adjusted operating income excluding unusual items and adjusted operating income excluding unusual items per diluted share are defined to exclude the non-cash impact of amortization of intangible assets acquired in a business combination, stock-based compensation, depreciation, impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets and unusual items. Unusual items are disclosed to highlight costs that are not ongoing and are incurred as a direct result of a specific transaction, such as the consummation of an acquisition, and are identified to allow investors to understand the Company’s expectation on an ongoing basis, following the completion of acquisition and integration activities. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their GAAP counterparts is set forth below, along with additional information regarding their use.\n\n3 The non-GAAP measures of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per diluted share are defined to exclude the non-cash impact of amortization of intangible assets acquired in a business combination, stock-based compensation, depreciation and impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their GAAP counterparts is set forth below, along with additional information regarding their use.\n\n4 Organic revenues growth, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as reported revenues growth excluding the impact of acquisitions.\n\n**About Mesa Laboratories, Inc.**\n\nMesa is a global leader in the design and manufacture of life science tools and critical quality control solutions for regulated applications in the pharmaceutical, healthcare and medical device industries.

We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our operating results, consistent with how management measures and forecasts its operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors can benefit by evaluating both GAAP and non-GAAP results.\n\nThe non-GAAP measures of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share presented in the reconciliation above are defined to exclude the non-cash impact of amortization of intangible assets acquired in a business combination, stock-based compensation, depreciation and impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets. To calculate adjusted operating income, we exclude, as applicable:\n\n  * Impairments of long-lived assets as such charges are outside of our normal operations and in most cases are difficult to accurately forecast.\n  * Stock-based compensation expense as it is a non-cash charge and costs calculated for this expense vary in accordance with the stock price on the date of grant.\n  * Depreciation expense as it is a non-cash charge.\n  * The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets as a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years. Exclusion of amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies.\n\n\n\nThe non-GAAP measures of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share presented in the reconciliation above are defined as Adjusted Operating Income less unusual items that are not on-going and are related to a specific transaction. We exclude these unusual items as they are outside of normal operations and are not on-going.\n\nOur management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation expense and impairment losses on goodwill and long-lived assets can have a material impact on our operating and net income. To gain a complete picture of all effects on our profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely on the GAAP consolidated statements of operations. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead on our core operating business.\n\nReaders are reminded that non-GAAP measures are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, or superior to, financial measures prepared according to GAAP. They should be evaluated in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. Our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTE5ODcwMCM2NDA2MzU4IzIwMjc5NTE=) ![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/MDdiYTBlZDUtYTQwNS00MTQ3LWEyNmItNzQ2YTM0ODYyN2FhLTEwMzkwOTE=/tiny/Mesa-Laboratories-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ff66b401-9246-47b9-accc-2f553d346c5c/small/mesalogo-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/ff66b401-9246-47b9-accc-2f553d346c5c)\n\nSource: Mesa Laboratories, Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://investors.mesalabs.com/news/default.aspx)\n\n[![Mesa Laboratories, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MLAB), a global leader in the design and manufacture of life science tools and critical quality control solutions, today announced results for its second fiscal quarter (“2Q25”) ended September 30, 2024 (amounts in thousands).\n\n_Second quarter FY 2025 compared to second quarter FY 2024:_\n\n  * _Revenues increased 8.8%_\n  * _Non-GAAP core organic revenues¹_  _decline was 2.8%_\n  * _Operating income increased 5,947% to $3,508_\n  *  _Non-GAAP adjusted operating income excluding unusual items²_ _increased 18.9% and was 24.8% as a percentage of revenues_\n\n\n\nWe operate our business in four divisions: Sterilization and Disinfection Control (“SDC”), Clinical Genomics (“CG”), Biopharmaceutical Development (“BPD”), and Calibration Solutions (“CS”).\n\nEffective 4Q24 we changed our definition of non-GAAP adjusted operating income³ (“AOI”) and non-GAAP adjusted operating income excluding unusual items to also exclude depreciation expense. Please see the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP operating income (loss) below. All prior periods have been restated to exclude depreciation expense from these non-GAAP measures.\n\n**Executive Commentary** (amounts in thousands)\n\n“The business continued its positive momentum in 2Q25 with sequential growth in orders and reductions in inventory and debt levels. Despite solid sequential order growth, sequential total revenues growth contracted by 0.6% primarily due to an increase in past due backlog in SDC which we expect to reduce over the next two quarters. Year over year core organic growth contracted by 2.8% due to shipment timing in SDC as well as year over year headwinds in China which started to impact our CG division in 3Q24. Profitability in our preferred metric of AOI margin percentage excluding unusual items of 24.8% reflected our ongoing leverage of the _Mesa Way_ , our Lean approach to process improvement and productivity growth. From a balance sheet perspective, solid profitability and another step up in inventory turns enabled us to repay $7,438 in debt during the second quarter which reduced our total Net Leverage Ratio* to 3.26. We remain committed to drive this ratio down below 3.0x” said Gary Owens, Chief Executive Officer of Mesa.\n\n“Overall revenues of $57,833 increased 8.8% compared to 2Q24 primarily due to 11% growth from the acquisition of GKE, partially offset by an organic decline of 2.2% and currency exchange impacts of 0.6%. The acquisition of GKE closed partially on October 16th of 2023 and completely on December 31st of 2023 and continues to deliver revenues higher than initial expectations at acquisition close. Biopharmaceutical capital spending in BPD continued to be strong for the third consecutive quarter and sales funnels remain solid. CG again delivered sequential growth as the core business has stabilized despite ongoing headwinds from China’s economic slowdown and the impact of its healthcare corruption campaign, coupled with the disruption to the U.S. Laboratory Developed Test (“LDT”) market highlighted in previous quarters. Both SDC and CS showed strong sequential orders growth that will benefit 3Q25 sequential growth” added Mr. Owens.\n\n“Profitability as measured by our primary metric of AOI excluding unusual items grew by 18.9% versus the prior year to $14,352, a 210 bps expansion when expressed as a percentage of revenue. Versus prior year, gross profit percentage expanded by 90 bps but shrank by 40 bps when excluding the impact of non-cash charges primarily due to mix.” added Mr. Owens.\n\n“Looking forward, we are optimistic that solid sales funnels will drive strong year over year growth in 3Q25 for BPD. In addition, we expect continued sequential growth in 3Q25 for CG, CS and SDC which when combined with BPD will result in strong organic revenue growth in 3Q25 for the Company as a whole. Looking out further, we will remain highly attuned to market shifts while continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives driving long term growth” concluded Mr. Owens.\n\n* Total Net Leverage Ratio under our Credit Facility is defined as the ratio of total debt minus unrestricted cash in excess of $10 million as compared to 12 months trailing EBITDA. EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, for purposes of this calculation, is defined as net income plus the sum of interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, amortization, unusual or non-recurring non-cash charges and stock compensation expense. In addition, EBITDA gives effect to trailing 12 months pro-forma ownership of GKE and adds back certain GKE acquisition expenses.\n\n**Financial Results**(unaudited, amounts in thousands, except per share data)\n\nTotal revenues were $57,833, an increase of 8.8% compared to 2Q24. Operating income increased 5,947% to $3,508. Net income was $3,428, an increase of 379% or $0.63 per diluted share of common stock. On a non-GAAP basis, core organic revenues decline was 2.8% and AOI increased 19.6% to $13,413 or $2.45 per diluted share of common stock compared to 2Q24. As detailed in the Unusual Items table below, AOI for 2Q25 and 2Q24 was negatively impacted by unusual items totaling $939 and $855, respectively. Excluding the unusual items for 2Q25 and 2Q24, AOI would have increased 18.9% to $14,352. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is provided in the tables below.\n\nDivision Performance\n\n**Revenues**| **Organic Revenues Growth⁴**| **Core Organic Revenues Growth**  \n---|---|---  \n(Amounts in thousands)| **Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**| **Six Months Ended September 30, 2024**| **Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**| **Six Months Ended September 30, 2024**| **Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**| **Six Months Ended September 30, 2024**  \nSDC| $| 22,205| $| 45,162| (4.3)%| 0.1%| (5.2)%| (0.2)%  \nCS| 12,262| 24,063| 8.2%| 5.6%| 8.2%| 5.4%  \nBPD| 11,867| 23,875| 28.9%| 25.0%| 27.9%| 25.6%  \nCG| 11,499| 22,903| (26.0)%| (20.8)%| (26.5)%| (20.8)%  \nTotal reportable segments| $| 57,833| $| 116,003| (2.2)%| 0.1%| (2.8)%| 0%  \n  \n**Sterilization and Disinfection Control** (38% of revenues in 2Q25) revenues were $22,205 for the quarter which resulted in core organic revenues decline of 5.2% versus prior year. The acquisition of GKE drove overall quarterly growth to 30.0%. Orders, excluding GKE, increased 6% for the first six months of the fiscal year with delivery timing negatively impacting revenues for 2Q25 and, we anticipate, positively impacting 3Q25. Gross profit percentage for the quarter contracted by 470 bps versus the prior year primarily due to the impact of non-cash inventory step-up purchase accounting charges from GKE and the amortization of GKE’s intangible assets. Absent the impact of these non-cash purchase accounting charges, gross profit percentage would have contracted by 210 bps, driven primarily by volume declines and increased costs in the legacy business. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, the inventory step up will unwind and we expect GKE's gross profit percentage to be in the low 70s, in line with the rest of the division. \n\n**Calibration Solutions** (21% of revenues in 2Q25) revenues were $12,262 which resulted in core organic revenues growth of 8.2% for the quarter. Year over year growth was driven primarily by commercial momentum, particularly in our renal care product lines which we expect to continue in the near term. Gross profit percentage expanded by 220 bps primarily due to increased revenues, pricing, and favorable product mix.\n\n**Biopharmaceutical Development** (21% of revenues in 2Q25) revenues were $11,867 which resulted in core organic revenues growth of 27.9% for the quarter. The increase in revenues was driven by increased biopharmaceutical spending on capital equipment in North America and Europe which when combined, resulted in an 109% increase in revenues from hardware and software versus the same quarter prior year. Gross profit percentage expanded by 60 bps primarily due to increased revenues as well as favorable product mix.\n\n**Clinical Genomics**(20% of revenues in 2Q25) revenues were $11,499 for the quarter, which resulted in a core organic revenues decline of 26.5% for the quarter but an increase of 0.8% sequentially compared to 1Q25. The year over year decrease in revenues was driven primarily by headwinds in China and North America as described above. Sequential growth for the second consecutive quarter and improving sales funnels have us optimistic that the turnaround plan is gaining traction. Gross profit percentage expanded by 170 bps due to decreased amortization as a result of impairment charges taken during 4Q24.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nAdjusted operating income, adjusted operating income excluding unusual items, organic revenues growth and core organic revenues growth are non-GAAP measures that exclude or adjust for certain items, as detailed within the tables in “Supplemental Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” As noted below, we now include depreciation expense as a non-cash addback in the definition of adjusted operating income as it better aligns with presentations of other companies within our industry. All prior period amounts have been restated to conform with the current presentation.\n\n¹ Core organic revenues growth, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as reported revenues growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency translation.\n\n² The non-GAAP measures of adjusted operating income excluding unusual items and adjusted operating income excluding unusual items per diluted share are defined to exclude the non-cash impact of amortization of intangible assets acquired in a business combination, stock-based compensation, depreciation, impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets and unusual items. Unusual items are disclosed to highlight costs that are not ongoing and are incurred as a direct result of a specific transaction, such as the consummation of an acquisition, and are identified to allow investors to understand the Company’s expectation on an ongoing basis, following the completion of acquisition and integration activities. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their GAAP counterparts is set forth below, along with additional information regarding their use.\n\n³ The non-GAAP measures of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per diluted share are defined to exclude the non-cash impact of amortization of intangible assets acquired in a business combination, stock-based compensation, depreciation and impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their GAAP counterparts is set forth below, along with additional information regarding their use.\n\n⁴ Organic revenues growth, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as reported revenues growth excluding the impact of acquisitions.\n\n**About Mesa Laboratories, Inc.**\n\nMesa is a global leader in the design and manufacture of life science tools and critical quality control solutions for regulated applications in the pharmaceutical, healthcare and medical device industries.

We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our operating results, consistent with how management measures and forecasts its operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors can benefit by evaluating both GAAP and non-GAAP results.\n\nThe non-GAAP measures of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share presented in the reconciliation above are defined to exclude the non-cash impact of amortization of intangible assets acquired in a business combination, stock-based compensation, depreciation and impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets. To calculate adjusted operating income, we exclude, as applicable:\n\n  * Impairments of long-lived assets as such charges are outside of our normal operations and in most cases are difficult to accurately forecast.\n  * Stock-based compensation expense as it is a non-cash charge and costs calculated for this expense vary in accordance with the stock price on the date of grant.\n  * Depreciation expense as it is a non-cash charge.\n  * The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets as a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years. Exclusion of amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies.\n\n\n\nThe non-GAAP measures of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share presented in the reconciliation above are defined as Adjusted Operating Income less unusual items that are not on-going and are related to a specific transaction. We exclude these unusual items as they are outside of normal operations and are not on-going.\n\nOur management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation expense and impairment losses on goodwill and long-lived assets can have a material impact on our operating and net income. To gain a complete picture of all effects on our profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely on the GAAP consolidated statements of operations. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead on our core operating business.\n\nReaders are reminded that non-GAAP measures are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, or superior to, financial measures prepared according to GAAP. They should be evaluated in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. Our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI2OTI0NyM2NTY2MzQ3IzIwMjc5NTE=) ![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/MzM3NmJhMTAtYmIwYy00NThlLWExMDktZjYzYmEyNDgwNmUwLTEwMzkwOTE=/tiny/Mesa-Laboratories-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ff66b401-9246-47b9-accc-2f553d346c5c/small/mesalogo-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/ff66b401-9246-47b9-accc-2f553d346c5c)\n\nSource: Mesa Laboratories, Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://investors.mesalabs.com/news/default.aspx)\n\n[![Mesa Laboratories, Inc.

Any statements\ncontained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements, including statements relating to: projections of\nrevenues, growth, operating results, profit margins, expenses, earnings, margins, tax rates, tax provisions, cash flows, liquidity, demand, competition, the\neffects of additional actions taken to become more efficient or lower costs; restructuring activities; acquisitions or divestitures and the integration of and\nfuture performance of acquired businesses; our ability to integrate the acquired business and personnel and to achieve expected synergies; our ability to\nmaintain or expand the historical sales of the acquired business; our ability to accurately forecast the acquisition, related restructuring costs and allocation\nof the purchase price, goodwill and other acquired intangibles and other asset adjustments; the risk of any litigation relating to the transaction; changes in\nlegal and regulatory matters; outstanding claims, legal proceedings, tax audits and assessments and other contingent liabilities; ability of the Company to\nachieve its financial and strategic objectives and continue to increase its revenues; foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates; general\neconomic, industry, and capital markets conditions; supply chain challenges; cost pressures and the overall effects of the current high inflation environment\non customers; the timing of any of the foregoing; assumptions underlying any of the foregoing; and any other statements that address events or\ndevelopments that Mesa intends or believes will or may occur in the future. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “expect,” “anticipate,” “seek,”\n“intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “may,” “target,” “project,” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. However, the\nabsence of these words or similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. These forward-looking statements are made based on\nexpectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting us and are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to our operations and business\nenvironments, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from\nthose matters expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, and those described from time to time in our subsequent reports filed with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation and except to the extent required by applicable law,\nthe Company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events and\ndevelopments or otherwise.\nIn this presentation, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted operating income (AOI) which is defined to exclude the non-cash impact of\namortization of intangible assets acquired in a business combination, stock-based compensation, depreciation and impairment of goodwill and long-lived\nassets. See reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial statements in this presentation. We are\nunable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking AOI or adjusted gross profit because components of the calculations are inherently unpredictable and\ncurrently unknown.\n2\nLife Science Tools for Quality Control\n$216M\n• Diversified Life Sciences Tools company in highly regulated\nmarkets.\nFY24 Revenues\n+16%\n• Continuing a long track record of high growth driven\norganically and via M&A. 3-year Revenues CAGR = 17%\n5-year Revenues CAGR*\n62% / 23%\n• Strong operating leverage and bottom-line profitability. 3-year\nAOI excluding unusual items CAGR = 9%\nGP % and AOI excluding unusual items Margin %**\n~1% to 4%\n• Increasing core organic revenues** growth via strong\ncommercial execution and portfolio evolution\n∆ Core Organic Revenues CAGR FY17 vs FY22-FY24 Average\n45% to 67%\n• While transforming our strategic options and long-term growth\npotential\n∆ High Growth Vertical exposure last 5 years *,***\n40\n• And continuously improving execution the Mesa Way!\nLean Events last year\n* Reportable segments\n** See reconciliation table at the back of this presentation for definitions and items adjusted for AOI and AOI excluding unusual items\n*** High Growth Verticals include Biopharmaceutical, Medical Device, and Genomics\nNote: Any reference to the term “year” in this presentation refers to our fiscal year ending March, 31\n3\n$300 $60\n$250 $50\n$200 $40\n$150 $30\n$100 $20\n$50 $10\n$0 $0\n4\n41YF 51YF 61YF 71YF 81YF 91YF 02YF 12YF 22YF 32YF 42YF\nRevenues AOI AOI excluding unusual items\n)M$(\nseuneveR\n)M$(\nsmeti\nlausunu\ngnidulcxe\nIOA\n&\nIOA\nLong Term Financial Performance\nLong history of compounding financial returns: 2014-24 CAGR = 15% Revenues; 11% AOI\nand 11% AOI excluding unusual items\nFYE: March 31\nDivisions & Solutions\nClinical Genomics $53M / MSD* Biopharmaceutical Development - $41M / LDD*\nGenomics Proteins\nPhysical & Chemical\nMicroorganisms\nCalibration Solutions - $48M / LSD* Sterilization & Disinfection Control $75M / MSD+*\n* FY24 revenues / long term core revenue CAGR potential\nQuality control tools vital to patient health\n5\nBiopharma Driven Application Examples\nBiopharmaceutical Sterilization &\nKey: Clinical Genomics Calibration Solutions\nDevelopment Disinfection Control\nDevelopment Bioprocessing / Manufacturing Healthcare Services\nPK/PD/Tox PGx PGx*\nPatients Immunogenicity DPYD*\nAffinity Mutations*\nBiomarkers\nTiter Contract Studies Titer Sterility Control IQOQ Sterility Control IQOQ\nImpurity Sterility Control Impurity IQOQ Monitoring Monitoring\nProduct\nAffinity Affinity\nMission critical quality control applications across regulated Biopharma, Medical Device, Genomics, and\nother regulated verticals\n* Research use only\n6\nPreclinical Development to Personalized Medicine\nPHARMACOKINETICS (PK) IMMUNOGENICITY\nWhat does the body do to the How does the immune system\ndrug?
