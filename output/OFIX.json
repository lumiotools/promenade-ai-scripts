(NASDAQ:OFIX), a leading global medical technology company, today reported its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, reiterated its full-year 2024 financial guidance, and introduced new three-year financial targets. \n\n**Recent Highlights**\n\n  * **Third quarter 2024 net sales of $196.6 million, an increase of 7% on a reported and constant currency basis compared to third quarter 2023**\n  * **U.S. Spine Fixation 1 net sales growth of 18% compared to third quarter 2023, driven by distribution expansion and further penetration in existing accounts **\n  * **Bone Growth Therapies (BGT) net sales growth of 9% and BGT Fracture net sales growth of 13% compared to third quarter 2023**\n  * **U.S. Orthopedics delivered a record net sales quarter with net sales growth of 15% compared to third quarter of 2023**\n  * **Company entered into record number of 7D FLASH™ Navigation System earnout agreements and matched record for highest number of 7D placements in any quarter to date**\n  * **Third quarter 2024 net loss of $(27.4) million; Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $19.2 million, an increase of $5.7 million, with adjusted EBITDA margin expanding approximately 250 basis points compared to third quarter 2023**\n  * **Achieves free cash flow of $5.9 million in third quarter 2024, a significant improvement in cash usage compared to previous quarters**\n  * **Announces new $275 million credit facility that replaces existing financing and further optimizes the Company's capital structure to support long-term profitable growth**\n  * **Maintains full-year 2024 net sales guidance of $795 million to $800 million and full-year 2024 non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA guidance of $64 million to $69 million; continue to expect positive free cash flow for the second half of 2024**\n  * **Introduces new 2027 financial targets to increase transparency and maximize value creation**\n\n\n\nThird quarter net sales were $196.6 million, an increase of 7% on a reported and constant currency basis. Net loss was $(27.4) million and earnings per share (\"EPS\") was $(0.71) on a reported basis, representing an improvement of 8% when compared to the prior year period. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $19.2 million for the third quarter, an increase of $5.7 million, representing adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately 250 basis points over the prior year period. \n\n“Our third quarter net sales results were driven by focused execution of our key growth priorities, and we also delivered strong adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and positive free cash flow, all of which we believe keeps us on a clear course to achieve our 2024 and long-term financial targets,” said Massimo Calafiore, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Highlights in the quarter included year-over-year revenue growth across each of our business segments where our performance once again was led by strength in our U.S. markets, including U.S. Spine Fixation, which grew 18%, and Bone Growth Therapies, which grew 9% overall and 13% in Fracture, further highlighting the benefit of cross-selling in our integrated spine channel. Notably, our U.S. Orthopedics business delivered a record net sales quarter and grew 15% year-over-year, benefiting from strong commercial execution. In addition to reiterating our full-year 2024 financial guidance, we are also introducing our new 2027 financial targets, which reflect our confidence in sustainable growth trends, the strength of our differentiated and expanding product portfolio, which continues to win share, and our commercial strategy and execution. We are well-positioned to accelerate our positive momentum and deliver on our commitment to drive disciplined, profitable growth and innovation while increasing long-term shareholder value.” \n\n**Financial Results Overview**\n\n_Third Quarter 2024 Net Sales and Financial Results_\n\nThe following table provides net sales by major product category by reporting segment: \n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**(Unaudited, U.S. Dollars, in millions)** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **Change** |  **Constant Currency Change**  \nBone Growth Therapies  |  $  |  57.9  |  $  |  53.4  |  8.6  |  %  |  8.6  |  %   \nSpinal Implants, Biologics and Enabling Technologies  |  108.2  |  101.0  |  7.1  |  %  |  7.1  |  %   \nGlobal Spine  |  166.1  |  154.4  |  7.6  |  %  |  7.6  |  %   \nGlobal Orthopedics  |  30.5  |  29.7  |  2.9  |  %  |  2.5  |  %   \nNet sales  |  $  |  196.6  |  $  |  184.0  |  6.8  |  %  |  6.8  |  %   \n  \nGross margins were 68.7% for the quarter and were 71.3% on a non-GAAP adjusted basis. \n\nNet loss was $(27.4) million, or $(0.71) per share, compared to net loss of $(28.9) million, or $(0.77) per share in the prior year period.

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “projects,” “intends,” “predicts,” “potential,” or “continue” or other comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements in this communication include the Company's expectations regarding net sales, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2024, and its three-year financial targets for 2025 through 2027. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of our future performance, are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions, and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict, including the risks described in Part I, Item 1A under the heading _Risk Factors_ in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”), and in Part II, Item 1A under the heading _Risk Factors_ in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Factors that could cause future results to differ from those expressed by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, (i) our ability to maintain operations to support our customers and patients in the near-term and to capitalize on future growth opportunities, (ii) risks associated with acceptance of surgical products and procedures by surgeons and hospitals, (iii) development and acceptance of new products or product enhancements, (iv) clinical and statistical verification of the benefits achieved via the use of our products, (v) our ability to adequately manage inventory, (vi) our ability to recruit and retain management and key personnel, (vii) our success in defending legal proceedings brought against us, and (viii) the other risks and uncertainties more fully described in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). As a result of these various risks, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. \n\nFurther, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date hereof, unless it is specifically otherwise stated to be made as of a different date. We undertake no obligation to update, and expressly disclaim any duty to update, our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of circumstances or events that arise after the date hereof, new information, or otherwise, except as required by law. \n\nThe Company is unable to provide expectations of GAAP income (loss) before income taxes, the closest comparable GAAP measures to adjusted EBITDA (which is a non-GAAP measure), on a forward-looking basis because the Company is unable to predict, without unreasonable efforts, the ultimate outcome of matters (including acquisition-related expenses, accounting fair value adjustments, and other such items) that will determine the quantitative amount of the items excluded in calculating adjusted EBITDA, which items are further described in the reconciliation tables and related descriptions below. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to the Company’s results computed in accordance with GAAP. \n\n**ORTHOFIX MEDICAL INC.**  \n---  \n**Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations**  \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n**September 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n**(Unaudited, U.S. Dollars, in thousands, except share and per share data)** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNet sales  |  $  |  196,606  |  $  |  184,006  |  $  |  583,834  |  $  |  546,226   \nCost of sales  |  61,553  |  64,243  |  186,790  |  196,583   \nGross profit  |  135,053  |  119,763  |  397,044  |  349,643   \nSales and marketing  |  96,576  |  94,947  |  296,843  |  287,987   \nGeneral and administrative  |  33,561  |  27,136  |  99,203  |  110,124   \nResearch and development  |  17,294  |  18,559  |  54,835  |  61,290   \nAcquisition-related amortization and remeasurement  |  6,521  |  3,570  |  19,305  |  11,037   \nOperating loss  |  (18,899  |  )  |  (24,449  |  )  |  (73,142  |  )  |  (120,795  |  )   \nInterest expense, net  |  (5,210  |  )  |  (1,576  |  )  |  (14,711  |  )  |  (4,131  |  )   \nOther expense, net  |  (2,528  |  )  |  (2,360  |  )  |  (6,312  |  )  |  (1,704  |  )   \nLoss before income taxes  |  (26,637  |  )  |  (28,385  |  )  |  (94,165  |  )  |  (126,630  |  )   \nIncome tax expense  |  (751  |  )  |  (472  |  )  |  (2,686  |  )  |  (2,591  |  )   \n**Net loss** |  **$** |  **(27,388** |  **)** |  **$** |  **(28,857** |  **)** |  **$** |  **(96,851** |  **)** |  **$** |  **(129,221** |  **)**  \nNet loss per common share:   \nBasic  |  $  |  (0.71  |  )  |  $  |  (0.77  |  )  |  $  |  (2.55  |  )  |  $  |  (3.53  |  )   \nDiluted  |  (0.71  |  )  |  (0.77  |  )  |  (2.55  |  )  |  (3.53  |  )   \nWeighted average number of common shares (in millions):   \nBasic  |  38.5  |  37.2  |  37.9  |  36.6   \nDiluted  |  38.5  |  37.2  |  37.9  |  36.6   \n**ORTHOFIX MEDICAL INC.**  \n---  \n**Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets**  \n**(U.S. Dollars, in thousands, except par value data)** |  **September 30, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n(Unaudited)   \n**Assets**  \nCurrent assets   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  $  |  30,054  |  $  |  33,107   \nRestricted Cash  |  2,500  |  4,650   \nAccounts receivable, net of allowances of $7,878 and $7,130, respectively  |  124,845  |  128,098   \nInventories  |  205,812  |  222,166   \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets  |  23,003  |  32,422   \nTotal current assets  |  386,214  |  420,443   \nProperty, plant, and equipment, net  |  146,685  |  159,060   \nIntangible assets, net  |  104,546  |  117,490   \nGoodwill  |  194,934  |  194,934   \nOther long-term assets  |  35,493  |  33,388   \n**Total assets** |  **$** |  **867,872** |  **$** |  **925,315**  \n**Liabilities and shareholders’ equity**  \nCurrent liabilities   \nAccounts payable  |  $  |  47,060  |  $  |  58,357   \nCurrent portion of long-term debt  |  6,250  |  1,250   \nCurrent portion of finance lease liability  |  743  |  708   \nOther current liabilities  |  107,845  |  104,908   \nTotal current liabilities  |  161,898  |  165,223   \nLong-term debt  |  112,215  |  93,107   \nLong-term portion of finance lease liability  |  18,027  |  18,532   \nOther long-term liabilities  |  49,808  |  49,723   \nTotal liabilities  |  341,948  |  326,585   \nContingencies   \nShareholders’ equity   \nCommon shares $0.10 par value; 100,000 shares authorized; 38,209 and 37,165 issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively  |  3,821  |  3,717   \nAdditional paid-in capital  |  770,000  |  746,450   \nAccumulated deficit  |  (246,995  |  )  |  (150,144  |  )   \nAccumulated other comprehensive loss  |  (902  |  )  |  (1,293  |  )   \nTotal shareholders’ equity  |  525,924  |  598,730   \n**Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity** |  **$** |  **867,872** |  **$** |  **925,315**  \n  \n**ORTHOFIX MEDICAL INC.**\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe following tables present reconciliations of various financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), to various non-GAAP financial measures that exclude (or in the case of free cash flow, include) items specified in the tables.

Factors that could cause future results to differ from those expressed by forward-\nlooking statements include, but are not limited to, (i) our ability to maintain operations to support our customers and patients in the\nnear-term and to capitalize on future growth opportunities, (ii) risks associated with acceptance of surgical products and procedures\nby surgeons and hospitals, (iii) development and acceptance of new products or product enhancements, (iv) clinical and statistical\nverification of the benefits achieved via the use of our products, (v) our ability to adequately manage inventory, (vi) our ability to\nrecruit and retain management and key personnel, (vii) our success in defending legal proceedings brought against us, and (viii) the\nother risks and uncertainties more fully described in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). As\na result of these various risks, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking\nstatements.\nFurther, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date hereof, unless it is specifically otherwise stated to be made as of a\ndifferent date. We undertake no obligation to update, and expressly disclaim any duty to update, our forward-looking statements,\nwhether as a result of circumstances or events that arise after the date hereof, new information, or otherwise, except as required by\nlaw.\nThe Company is unable to provide expectations of GAAP income (loss) before income taxes, the closest comparable GAAP measures\nto adjusted EBITDA (which is a non-GAAP measure), on a forward-looking basis because the Company is unable to predict, without\nunreasonable efforts, the ultimate outcome of matters (including acquisition-related expenses, accounting fair value adjustments,\nand other such items) that will determine the quantitative amount of the items excluded in calculating adjusted EBITDA, which items\nare further described in the reconciliation tables and related descriptions below. These items are uncertain, depend on various\nfactors, and could be material to the Company’s results computed in accordance with GAAP.\n3\nCompany Contacts\nInvestor Relations\nJulie Dewey, Chief Investor Relations and Communications Officer\nJulieDewey@Orthofix.com\n(209) 613-6945\nMedia Relations\nDenise Landry, Vice President, Global Corporate Communications\nDeniseLandry@Orthofix.com\n(214) 937-2529\n4\nORTHOFIX MEDICAL INC.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(Unaudited, U.S. Dollars, in thousands, except share and per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet sales $ 196,606 $ 184,006 $ 583,834 $ 546,226\nCost of sales 61,553 64,243 186,790 196,583\nGross profit 135,053 119,763 397,044 349,643\nSales and marketing 96,576 94,947 296,843 287,987\nGeneral and administrative 33,561 27,136 99,203 110,124\nResearch and development 17,294 18,559 54,835 61,290\nAcquisition-related amortization and remeasurement 6,521 3,570 19,305 11,037\nOperating loss (18,899 ) (24,449) (73,142 ) (120,795 )\nInterest expense, net (5,210 ) (1,576) (14,711 ) (4,131 )\nOther expense, net (2,528 ) (2,360) (6,312 ) (1,704 )\nLoss before income taxes (26,637 ) (28,385) (94,165 ) (126,630 )\nIncome tax expense (751 ) (472) (2,686 ) (2,591 )\nNet loss $ (27,388 ) $ (28,857) $ (96,851 ) $ (129,221 )\nNet loss per common share:\nBasic $ (0.71 ) $ (0.77) $ (2.55 ) $ (3.53 )\nDiluted (0.71 ) (0.77) (2.55 ) (3.53 )\nWeighted average number of common shares (in millions):\nBasic 38.5 37.2 37.9 36.6\nDiluted 38.5 37.2 37.9 36.6\n5\nORTHOFIX MEDICAL INC.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands, except par value data) 2024 2023\n(Unaudited)\nAssets\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 30,054 $ 33,107\nRestricted Cash 2,500 4,650\nAccounts receivable, net of allowances of $7,878 and $7,130, respectively 124,845 128,098\nInventories 205,812 222,166\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 23,003 32,422\nTotal current assets 386,214 420,443\nProperty, plant, and equipment, net 146,685 159,060\nIntangible assets, net 104,546 117,490\nGoodwill 194,934 194,934\nOther long-term assets 35,493 33,388\nTotal assets $ 867,872 $ 925,315\nLiabilities and shareholders’ equity\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable $ 47,060 $ 58,357\nCurrent portion of long-term debt 6,250 1,250\nCurrent portion of finance lease liability 743 708\nOther current liabilities 107,845 104,908\nTotal current liabilities 161,898 165,223\nLong-term debt 112,215 93,107\nLong-term portion of finance lease liability 18,027 18,532\nOther long-term liabilities 49,808 49,723\nTotal liabilities 341,948 326,585\nContingencies\nShareholders’ equity\nCommon shares $0.10 par value; 100,000 shares authorized;\n38,209 and 37,165 issued and outstanding as of September 30,\n2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively 3,821 3,717\nAdditional paid-in capital 770,000 746,450\nAccumulated deficit (246,995) (150,144 )\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (902) (1,293 )\nTotal shareholders’ equity 525,924 598,730\nTotal liabilities and shareholders’ equity $ 867,872 $ 925,315\n6\nORTHOFIX MEDICAL INC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following tables present reconciliations of various financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (“GAAP”), to various non-GAAP financial measures that exclude (or in the case of free cash flow, include) items\nspecified in the tables.

          "content": "Clear Course for\nProfitable Growth\nInvestor Presentation\nNovember 7, 2024\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, relating to our business and financial outlook, which are based on our current beliefs, assumptions, intentions, plans, expectations,\nestimates, forecasts and projections. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,”\n“anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “projects,” “intends,” “predicts,” “potential,” or “continue” or other comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements in this\npresentation include the Company's expectations regarding net sales, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2024, and its three-year\nfinancial targets for 2025 through 2027. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of our future performance, are based on our current expectations and\nassumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions, and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that are difficult to\npredict, including the risks described in Part I, Item 1A under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023\nForm 10-K”), and in Part II, Item 1A under the heading Risk Factors in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Factors that could\ncause future results to differ from those expressed by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, (i) our ability to maintain operations to support our\ncustomers and patients in the near-term and to capitalize on future growth opportunities, (ii) risks associated with acceptance of surgical products and procedures by\nsurgeons and hospitals, (iii) development and acceptance of new products or product enhancements, (iv) clinical and statistical verification of the benefits achieved via the\nuse of our products, (v) our ability to adequately manage inventory, (vi) our ability to recruit and retain management and key personnel, (vii) our success in defending legal\nproceedings brought against us, and (viii) the other risks and uncertainties more fully described in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n“SEC”). As a result of these various risks, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.\nFurther, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date hereof, unless it is specifically otherwise stated to be made as of a different date. We undertake no\nobligation to update, and expressly disclaim any duty to update, our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of circumstances or events that arise after the date\nhereof, new information, or otherwise, except as required by law.\nThe Company is unable to provide expectations of GAAP income (loss) before income taxes, the closest comparable GAAP measures to adjusted EBITDA (which is a non-\nGAAP measure), on a forward-looking basis because the Company is unable to predict, without unreasonable efforts, the ultimate outcome of matters (including\nacquisition-related expenses, accounting fair value adjustments, and other such items) that will determine the quantitative amount of the items excluded in calculating\nadjusted EBITDA, which items are further described in the reconciliation tables and related descriptions below. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and\ncould be material to the Company’s results computed in accordance with GAAP.\n2\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nManagement uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in this presentation, most specifically Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Net Income and Free\nCash Flow, as a supplement to GAAP financial measures to further evaluate the company’s operating performance period over period, analyze the underlying business\ntrends, assess performance relative to competitors and establish operational objectives.\nManagement believes it is important to provide investors with the same non-GAAP metrics it uses to evaluate the performance and underlying trends of the company’s\nbusiness operations to facilitate comparisons to its historical operating results and evaluate the effectiveness of its operating strategies. Disclosure of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures also facilitates comparisons of the company’s underlying operating performance with other companies in the industry that also supplement their GAAP\nresults with non-GAAP financial measures.\nFull-year guidance is based on the current foreign currency exchange rates and does not take into account any additional potential exchange rate changes that may occur\nthis year or contemplate any potential impact to elective procedures as a result of IV fluid shortages or other hurricane-related effects.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as replacements for, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as these\nmeasures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations between GAAP and non‐GAAP results are included at the end of this presentation and represent\nthe most comparable GAAP measure(s) to the applicable non-GAAP measure(s) shown in the table. For further information regarding the nature of these exclusions, why\nthe Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors, the specific manner in which management uses these measures,\nand some of the limitations associated with the use of these measures, please refer to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K regarding this press release filed today\nwith the SEC available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and on the “Investors” page of the Company’s website at www.orthofix.com.\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\n3\nKey Themes\nDisciplined, Profitable Growth to Maximize Value Creation\nBuilding on a strong foundation as a leading global med tech company with a\n01\ncomprehensive portfolio of innovative spinal hardware, bone growth therapies, biologics,\nspecialized orthopedic solutions, and an advanced surgical navigation system (7D FLASH)\n02 Driving meaningful and sustainable, above-market growth with broad, differentiated\ntechnologies, extensive commercial reach, and improving financial strength\n03 Delivering significant value to our shareholders, surgeons, and employees\nand setting new standards of innovation through our products and extensive solutions\n04 Executing a clear strategy for profitable growth led by a world-class\nmanagement team\n05 Unveiling new 2027 financial targets to build on positive momentum,\nincrease transparency, and maximize value creation\n4\nQ3 2024 Financial Highlights\n$196.6M $19.2M $5.9M 18% 9% 15% 71.3%\nNet Sales Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow2 U.S. Spine Bone Growth U.S. Orthopedics Non-GAAP\n7% Growth YoY Adjusted EBITDA2 Significant Fixation3 YoY Net Therapies YoY YoY Net Sales Adjusted\nas reported $5.7M YoY improvement in Sales Growth Net Sales Growth Growth Gross Margin2\nand constant increase and cash usage Driven by 13% Growth in U.S. Orthopedics Compared to\ncurrency1 ~250 bps compared to distribution BGT Fracture delivered a record 71.0% for Q3 2023\nexpansion previous quarters expansion and quarter, benefiting\npenetration in from strong\nexisting accounts execution\n“\nOur third quarter net sales results were driven by focused execution of our\nkey growth priorities, and we also delivered strong adjusted EBITDA margin\nexpansion and positive free cash flow, all of which we believe keeps us on a\nclear course to achieve our 2024 and long-term financial targets.

INC.\nNotes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n1. Business and basis of presenta\u0000on\nDescrip\u0000on of the Business\nOrthofix Medical Inc. (the “Company” or \"Orthofix\") is a global medical technology company headquartered in Lewisville, Texas. By providing medical\ntechnologies that heal musculoskeletal pathologies, the Company delivers excep\u0000onal experiences and life-changing solu\u0000ons to pa\u0000ents around the world.\nOrthofix offers a comprehensive por\u0000olio of spinal hardware, bone growth therapies, specialized orthopedic solu\u0000ons, biologics, and enabling technologies,\nincluding the 7D FLASH naviga\u0000on system.\nBasis of Presenta\u0000on\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accoun\u0000ng principles in\nthe United States (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial informa\u0000on and with the instruc\u0000ons to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regula\u0000on S-X. Pursuant to these\nrules and regula\u0000ons, certain informa\u0000on and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been\ncondensed or omi\u0000ed. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consis\u0000ng of normal recurring items) considered necessary for a fair statement have\nbeen included. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunc\u0000on with the consolidated financial statements and related notes\ncontained in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Opera\u0000ng results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nare not necessarily indica\u0000ve of the results that may be expected for other interim periods or the year ending December 31, 2024.\nThe prepara\u0000on of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make es\u0000mates and assump\u0000ons that affect the amounts\nreported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its es\u0000mates, including those related to revenue\nrecogni\u0000on; contractual allowances; allowances for expected credit losses; inventories; valua\u0000on of intangible assets; goodwill; fair value measurements,\nincluding con\u0000ngent considera\u0000on; li\u0000ga\u0000on and con\u0000ngent liabili\u0000es; tax ma\u0000ers; and share-based compensa\u0000on. Actual results could differ from these\nes\u0000mates.\nChanges in Presenta\u0000on of Consolidated Financial Statements\nCertain prior year balances have been reclassified in the condensed consolidated financial statements to conform to current period presenta\u0000on.\n2. Recently adopted accoun\u0000ng standards, recently issued accoun\u0000ng pronouncements\nAdop\u0000on of Accoun\u0000ng Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2022-03 - Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securi\u0000es Subject to Contractual Sale Restric\u0000ons\nIn June 2022, the Financial Accoun\u0000ng Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU 2022-03, which clarifies the guidance in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, when\nmeasuring the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual restric\u0000ons that prohibit the sale and to introduce new disclosure requirements. The\nCompany adopted this standard effec\u0000ve January 1, 2024, on a prospec\u0000ve basis. Adop\u0000on of this standard did not have a material impact to the Company's\nconsolidated balance sheet, statements of opera\u0000ons, or cash flows, but did modify the Company's disclosures related to certain investments. Refer to Note 7\nfor the Company's updated disclosures on investments in equity securi\u0000es subject to capital sale restric\u0000ons.\nAdop\u0000on of ASU 2023-07 - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, which enhances and improves disclosures about opera\u0000ng segment revenues, measures of profit/loss, and\nexpenses to enable investors to be\u0000er understand an en\u0000ty's overall performance and assess poten\u0000al future cash flows. The amendment requires that an\nen\u0000ty disclose (i) significant expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Opera\u0000ng Decision Maker (\"CODM\"), (ii) other segment items by reportable\nsegment including a descrip\u0000on of its composi\u0000on, (iii) all annual disclosures required by Topic 280 in interim periods, (iv) addi\u0000onal measures of a segment's\nprofit or loss used by the CODM in assessing segment performance and alloca\u0000on of resources, and (v) the \u0000tle and posi\u0000on of the CODM and an explana\u0000on\nof how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss. The Company adopted this standard effec\u0000ve January 1, 2024, on a prospec\u0000ve\nbasis. Refer to Note 11 for the Company's updated business segment disclosures.\n8\nRecently Issued Accoun\u0000ng Pronouncements\nTopic Descrip\u0000on of Guidance Effec\u0000ve Date Status of Company's Evalua\u0000on\nDisclosure Improvements - Adds interim and annual disclosure requirements to a Various The Company is currently evalua\u0000ng the impact this\nCodifica\u0000on Amendments in variety of subtopics in the Accoun\u0000ng Standards ASU may have on its consolidated financial\nResponse to the SEC's Codifica\u0000on, including those focusing on accoun\u0000ng statements.\nDisclosure Update and changes, earnings per share, debt, and repurchase\nSimplifica\u0000on Ini\u0000a\u0000ve (ASU agreements.

Mergers and acquisi\u0000ons\nMerger with SeaSpine\nOn January 5, 2023, the Company and SeaSpine completed an all-stock merger of equals (the \"Merger\") to create a global medical technology company that\nprovides medical technologies that heal musculoskeletal pathologies, and delivers excep\u0000onal experiences and life-changing solu\u0000ons to pa\u0000ents around the\nworld. The Company offers a comprehensive por\u0000olio of spinal hardware, bone growth therapies, specialized orthopedic solu\u0000ons, biologics, and enabling\ntechnologies, including the 7D FLASH naviga\u0000on system. As a result of the Merger, each share of SeaSpine common stock issued and outstanding immediately\nprior to the closing of the Merger was converted into the right to receive 0.4163 shares of Orthofix common stock.\n9\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company finalized its valua\u0000on of assets acquired and liabili\u0000es assumed. The following table summarizes the fair value\nof assets acquired and liabili\u0000es assumed at the acquisi\u0000on date:\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) Final Acquisi\u0000on Date Fair Value Assigned Useful Life\nAssets acquired:\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 29,419\nAccounts receivable, net 35,313\nInventories 132,636\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 4,590\nTotal current assets 201,958\nProperty, plant, and equipment, net 68,863\nCustomer rela\u0000onships 33,100 13 years\nDeveloped technology 47,200 6 - 8 years\nIn-process research and development (\"IPR&D\") 5,750 Indefinite\nOther long-term assets 20,501\nTotal iden\u0000fiable assets acquired $ 377,372\nLiabili\u0000es assumed:\nCurrent liabili\u0000es\nAccounts payable $ 21,602\nOther current liabili\u0000es 43,521\nTotal current liabili\u0000es 65,123\nLong-term borrowings under SeaSpine credit facility 26,298\nOther long-term liabili\u0000es 32,823\nTotal liabili\u0000es assumed 124,244\nNet iden\u0000fiable assets acquired $ 253,128\nTotal fair value of considera\u0000on transferred 376,745\nResidual goodwill $ 123,617\nThe Company recognized $0.1 million in direct acquisi\u0000on-related costs, which excluded integra\u0000on-related ac\u0000vi\u0000es that were expensed during both the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $0.1 million and $9.9 million expensed during the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023, respec\u0000vely. These costs are included in the condensed consolidated statements of opera\u0000ons and comprehensive loss, primarily within general and\nadministra\u0000ve expenses. The Company's results of opera\u0000ons included net sales from SeaSpine of $72.1 million and $214.1 million for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, respec\u0000vely, and net losses of $18.4 million and $53.1 million from SeaSpine for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respec\u0000vely. This compares to $62.9 million and $188.2 million of net sales from SeaSpine for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, respec\u0000vely, and net losses of $19.2 million and $72.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respec\u0000vely.\nDue to the consumma\u0000on of the Merger occurring on January 5, 2023, all SeaSpine financial results for fiscal year 2023, except for the first four days of\nJanuary, were included in the Company's condensed consolidated statement of opera\u0000ons and comprehensive loss. Therefore, the Company did not prepare\nunaudited pro forma financial informa\u0000on for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 or 2024, on the basis that the Merger was completed on\nJanuary 1, 2023.\n10\n4.

The maturity date remains November 6, 2027, for each of the Ini\u0000al Term Loan, Delayed\nDraw Term Loan, and Revolving Credit Facility.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had no borrowings on its available lines of credit in Italy, which provide up to an aggregate amount of €5.5 million\n($6.1 million).\n7. Fair value measurements and investments\nThe fair value measurements of the Company’s financial assets and liabili\u0000es measured on a recurring basis were as follows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Total\n(Unaudited)\nAssets\nNeo Medical conver\u0000ble loan agreement $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 6,760\nNeo Medical preferred equity securi\u0000es — 7,803 — 7,803 4,951\nOther investments — — — — 1,309\nTotal $ — $ 7,803 $ — $ 7,803 $ 13,020\nLiabili\u0000es\nLa\u0000us con\u0000ngent considera\u0000on $ — $ — $ (14,710) $ (14,710) $ (8,500)\nDeferred compensa\u0000on plan — (1,709) — (1,709) (1,674)\nTotal $ — $ (1,709) $ (14,710) $ (16,419) $ (10,174)\n12\nNeo Medical Conver\u0000ble Loan Agreement and Equity Investment\nSince October 2020, the Company has held preferred equity securi\u0000es of Neo Medical SA, a privately held Swiss-based company developing a new genera\u0000on\nof products for spinal surgery (\"Neo Medical\") and a Conver\u0000ble Loan Agreement, pursuant to which the Company loaned Neo Medical CHF 4.6 million, or $5.0\nmillion, at the date of issuance (the “Conver\u0000ble Loan”).\nIn April 2024, the Company converted the Conver\u0000ble Loan into shares of Neo Medical preferred equity securi\u0000es. The preferred equity securi\u0000es are recorded\nin other long-term assets and are considered an investment that does not have a readily determinable fair value. As such, the Company measures this\ninvestment at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resul\u0000ng from observable price changes in orderly transac\u0000ons for iden\u0000cal or similar\ninvestments of the same issuer.\nThe Company's equity investment with Neo Medical is subject to certain sales restric\u0000ons, such as right of first refusal, tag-along provisions, and drag-along\nprovisions. Permi\u0000ed transfers include (i) sales of shares to an affiliate of such shareholder, (ii) transfer of shares as part of a compensa\u0000on package offered to\nemployees, or (iii) Neo Medical may repurchase shares at a price no greater than that originally paid by the shareholder.\nThe table below presents a reconcilia\u0000on of the beginning and ending balances of the Company’s investment in Neo Medical preferred equity securi\u0000es:\n(Unaudited, U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2024 2023\nFair value of Neo Medical preferred equity securi\u0000es at January 1 $ 4,951 $ 6,084\nConversion of loan into preferred equity securi\u0000es 8,224 —\nForeign currency remeasurement recognized in other income (expense), net — —\nUnrealized loss recognized in other expense, net (5,372) —\nFair value of Neo Medical preferred equity securi\u0000es at September 30 $ 7,803 $ 6,084\nCumula\u0000ve unrealized gain (loss) on Neo Medical preferred equity securi\u0000es $ (6,092) $ 413\nThe following table provides a reconcilia\u0000on of the beginning and ending balances of the Conver\u0000ble Loan, which was measured at fair value using significant\nunobservable inputs:\n(Unaudited, U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2024 2023\nFair value of Neo Medical Conver\u0000ble Loan at January 1 $ 6,760 $ 7,140\nGains (losses) recorded for the period\nRecognized in other comprehensive income 1,671 109\nInterest recognized in interest income, net 162 367\nForeign currency remeasurement recognized in other income (expense), net (602) 54\nReversal of expected credit loss recognized in other income (expense), net 260 —\nConversion into preferred equity securi\u0000es (8,224) —\nRealized foreign currency loss recognized in other income (expense), net (27) —\nFair value of Neo Medical Conver\u0000ble Loan at September 30 $ — $ 7,670\nContractual value of Neo Medical Conver\u0000ble Loan at September 30 $ — $ 6,328\nAllowance for credit loss recognized in other income (expense), net — —\nAmor\u0000zed cost basis of Neo Medical Conver\u0000ble Loan at September 30 $ — $ 6,328\nOther Investments\nOther investments represent assets and investments recorded at fair value that are not deemed to be material for disclosure on an individual basis. The fair\nvalue of these assets is based upon significant unobservable inputs, such as probability-weighted discounted cash flow models, requiring the Company to\ndevelop its own assump\u0000ons. Therefore, the Company has categorized these assets as Level 3 financial assets.\nLa\u0000us Con\u0000ngent Considera\u0000on\nIn December 2022, prior to the consumma\u0000on of the Merger, SeaSpine entered into a purchase agreement with La\u0000us Spine LLC (\"La\u0000us\") pursuant to which a\ncon\u0000ngent considera\u0000on obliga\u0000on exists. Under the terms of the agreement, SeaSpine may be required to make installment payments at certain dates based\non future net sales of certain products (the \"Lateral Products\").\n13\nThe Company es\u0000mates the fair value of the La\u0000us con\u0000ngent considera\u0000on using a Monte Carlo simula\u0000on and a discounted cash flow model requiring\nsignificant inputs which are not observable in the market. The significant inputs include assump\u0000ons related to the es\u0000mated future sales of the products,\nrevenue risk-adjusted discount rates, revenue vola\u0000lity, and discount rates matched to the \u0000ming of payments. The following table provides a reconcilia\u0000on of\nthe beginning and ending balances for the La\u0000us con\u0000ngent considera\u0000on measured at es\u0000mated fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):\n(Unaudited, U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2024 2023\nLa\u0000us con\u0000ngent considera\u0000on es\u0000mated fair value at January 1 $ 8,500 $ —\nCon\u0000ngent considera\u0000on assumed in the Merger — 11,200\nIncrease (decrease) in fair value recognized in acquisi\u0000on-related amor\u0000za\u0000on and remeasurement 6,210 (2,100)\nLa\u0000us con\u0000ngent considera\u0000on es\u0000mated fair value at September 30 $ 14,710 $ 9,100\nThe following table provides quan\u0000ta\u0000ve informa\u0000on related to certain key assump\u0000ons u\u0000lized within the valua\u0000on as of September 30, 2024:\nFair Value as of\n(Unaudited, U.S. Dollars, in thousands) September 30, 2024 Unobservable inputs Es\u0000mate\nLa\u0000us Con\u0000ngent Considera\u0000on $ 14,710 Counterparty discount rates 8.6% - 9.1%\nRevenue risk-adjusted discount rates 6.7% - 7.7%\n8. Commitments and Con\u0000ngencies\nIn addi\u0000on to the ma\u0000ers described in the paragraphs below, in the normal course of its business, the Company is involved in various lawsuits from \u0000me to\n\u0000me and may be subject to certain other con\u0000ngencies. The Company believes any losses related to these ma\u0000ers are individually and collec\u0000vely immaterial\nas to a possible loss and range of loss.\nArbitra\u0000on claims with former execu\u0000ves\nIn September 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors (the \"Board\") terminated the employment of Keith Valen\u0000ne, John Bostjancic, and Patrick Keran, who\nhad served respec\u0000vely as the Company’s President and Chief Execu\u0000ve Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Legal Officer. The Board’s decision followed an\ninves\u0000ga\u0000on conducted by independent outside legal counsel and directed and overseen by the Company’s independent directors. As a result of the\ninves\u0000ga\u0000on, the Board determined that each of these execu\u0000ves engaged in repeated inappropriate and offensive conduct that violated mul\u0000ple code of\nconduct requirements and was inconsistent with the Company’s values and culture. The Company no\u0000fied each of Messrs. Valen\u0000ne, Bostjancic, and Keran\nthat their respec\u0000ve termina\u0000ons were being made for “Cause,” as defined in applicable employment-related agreements (including each execu\u0000ve’s\nrespec\u0000ve Change in Control and Severance Agreement, dated June 19, 2023). The Company also no\u0000fied each of Messrs. Valen\u0000ne, Bostjancic, and Keran that\nit did not believe it was required to make any further payments to them, other than payment of salary through September 12, 2023. The Board also requested\nthat Mr. Valen\u0000ne resign as a director, which he did in October 2023.\nIn January 2024, the Company received wri\u0000en no\u0000ces of arbitra\u0000on claims from counsel to Messrs. Valen\u0000ne, Bostjancic, and Keran. Each of the arbitra\u0000on\nclaims asserts that the respec\u0000ve former execu\u0000ve was wrongfully terminated for “Cause” because the former execu\u0000ve’s conduct did not meet the\ncontractually applicable defini\u0000on of “Cause.” The claims seek relief for, among other things, alleged breach of contract, defama\u0000on, false light invasion of\nprivacy, deceit, as well as indemnifica\u0000on and advancement for a\u0000orneys’ fees. The three former execu\u0000ves seek severance payments, as well as the value of\nforfeited equity grants under applicable change in control and severance agreements and further damages as a result of purported defamatory statements.\nThe Company disagrees with many of the asser\u0000ons contained in the wri\u0000en no\u0000ces of arbitra\u0000on claims and intends to vigorously defend the asserted claims.\nDue in part to the preliminary nature of this ma\u0000er, the Company currently cannot reasonably es\u0000mate a possible loss, or range of loss, that may arise from\nthe arbitra\u0000on claims.\nSecuri\u0000es class ac\u0000on complaints\nOn August 21, 2024, a securi\u0000es class ac\u0000on complaint cap\u0000oned Bernal v. Orthofix Medical Inc., et al., Case No. 24-cv-00690, was filed in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Texas (the “Bernal Complaint”). The plain\u0000ff, a purported Company shareholder, alleges through the complaint viola\u0000ons of\nSec\u0000ons 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securi\u0000es Exchange Act of 1934, and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and names as defendants the Company and the\nfollowing former Company directors and officers: Jon Serbousek (former director and former President and Chief Execu\u0000ve Officer), Keith Valen\u0000ne (former\ndirector and former President and Chief Execu\u0000ve Officer), John Bostjancic (former Chief Financial Officer), and Patrick Keran (former Chief Legal\n14\nOfficer). The complaint alleges that the Company made, and the named former directors and officers caused the Company to make, materially false and\nmisleading statements between October 11, 2022 and September 12, 2023 that, according to the complaint, falsely assured the market regarding Messrs.\nValen\u0000ne, Bostjancic and Keran’s respec\u0000ve commitments to, among other things, ethical and legal standards and corporate responsibility.\nOn September 6, 2024, a securi\u0000es class ac\u0000on complaint cap\u0000oned O’Hara v. Orthofix Medical Inc., et al., Case No. 24-cv-01593, was filed in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of California. The plain\u0000ff, a purported former shareholder of SeaSpine at the \u0000me of the Merger, alleges through the\ncomplaint viola\u0000ons of Sec\u0000ons 11, 12 and 15 of the Securi\u0000es Act of 1933, and names most of the same defendants as the Bernal Complaint, as well as\ncertain addi\u0000onal current and/or former Company directors and officers. The complaint makes similar asser\u0000ons to the Bernal complaint, and alleges that the\nCompany’s registra\u0000on statement on Form S-4 filed in 2022 in connec\u0000on with the Merger, as well as related wri\u0000en and oral offering materials, contained\nuntrue statements of material fact and material omissions, including, among other things, with respect to the effec\u0000veness of the Company’s internal controls.\nOn October 28, 2024, a deriva\u0000ve shareholder complaint was filed against certain of the Company's current and former officers and directors alleging\nderiva\u0000ve liability for the allega\u0000ons made in the two complaints noted above.\nThe Company disagrees with the legal claims asserted in each complaint and intends to defend all complaints vigorously. Due in part to the preliminary nature\nof these three ma\u0000ers, the Company currently cannot reasonably es\u0000mate a possible loss, or range of loss, that may arise from the respec\u0000ve complaints.\nCommitments\nAs a result of the Merger, the Company became party to agreements with certain distributor partners that provide the Company with an op\u0000on to purchase,\nand an op\u0000on for those partners to require the Company to purchase, the distribu\u0000on business of those partners at specified future dates. At such \u0000me, the\nCompany or distributor may (in certain cases, subject to sa\u0000sfying certain condi\u0000ons) submit wri\u0000en no\u0000ce to the other of its inten\u0000on to exercise its rights\nand ini\u0000ate or require the purchase. Upon receipt of the wri\u0000en no\u0000ce, the Company and the distributor will work in good faith to consummate the purchase.\nUnder certain of these agreements, the purchase price would be paid in shares of the Company's common stock, whereas for others, the purchase price can be\npaid in cash or shares, at the Company's op\u0000on. Based on the closing price of the Company's common stock as of September 30, 2024, assuming the op\u0000ons\nunder all the relevant agreements were exercised, the es\u0000mated total number of shares the Company would issue under these agreements was approximately\n0.3 million shares for agreements that must be se\u0000led in shares of the Company's stock. The Company has received no\u0000fica\u0000on from one such distributor, who\nhas no\u0000fied the Company of its decision to exercise its buyout op\u0000on. The Company is currently in nego\u0000a\u0000ons with this distributor in regards to the\nconsumma\u0000on of the poten\u0000al acquisi\u0000on.\nItalian Medical Device Payback (“IMDP”)\nIn 2015, the Italian Parliament introduced rules for en\u0000\u0000es that supply goods and services to the Italian Na\u0000onal Healthcare System. A key provision of the law\nis a ‘payback’ measure, requiring medical device companies in Italy to make payments to the Italian government if medical device expenditures exceed regional\nmaximum ceilings. Companies are required to make payments equal to a percentage of expenditures exceeding maximum regional caps.\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the Italian Ministry of Health provided guidelines to the Italian regions and provinces on seeking payback of expenditure overruns\nrela\u0000ng to the 2015 through 2018 calendar years. Since receiving the guidelines, several regions and provinces have requested payment from affected medical\ndevice companies, including the Company. The Company has taken legal ac\u0000on to dispute the legality of such measures. In July 2024, the Italian Cons\u0000tu\u0000onal\nCourt issued two judgments following public hearings on the ma\u0000er held in May 2024. These judgments (i) declared the payback system itself as\ncons\u0000tu\u0000onally legi\u0000mate and (ii) extended previously communicated reduc\u0000ons in the payback liability for certain fiscal years to all medical device\ncompanies, regardless of whether or not they had waived their legal claims on the ma\u0000er.\nThe Company accounts for the es\u0000mated cost of the IMDP as sales and marke\u0000ng expense and periodically reassesses the liability based upon current facts\nand circumstances. As a result, the Company recorded an expense of $0.3 million and $0.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespec\u0000vely, and an expense of $0.2 million and $0.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respec\u0000vely. As of September 30,\n2024, the Company has accrued $8.6 million related to the IMDP, which it has classified within other long-term liabili\u0000es; however, the actual liability could be\nhigher or lower than the amount accrued once all legal proceedings are resolved and upon further clarifica\u0000on of the IMDP by the Italian authori\u0000es for more\nrecent fiscal years.\n15\n9.

Business segment informa\u0000on\nThe Company's opera\u0000ons are managed through two repor\u0000ng segments: Global Spine and Global Orthopedics. These repor\u0000ng segments represent the\nopera\u0000ng segments for which the President and Chief Execu\u0000ve Officer, who is also the CODM, reviews financial informa\u0000on and makes resource alloca\u0000on\ndecisions among businesses. The primary metric used by the CODM in managing the Company is adjusted earnings before interest, tax, deprecia\u0000on, and\namor\u0000za\u0000on (“adjusted EBITDA”, a non-GAAP financial measure). Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest income (expense), income taxes,\ndeprecia\u0000on, and amor\u0000za\u0000on, and excludes the impact of share-based compensa\u0000on, gains and losses related to changes in foreign exchange rates, charges\nrelated to the SeaSpine merger and other strategic investments, acquisi\u0000on-related fair value adjustments, gains and/or losses on investments, li\u0000ga\u0000on and\ninves\u0000ga\u0000on charges, charges related to ini\u0000al compliance with regula\u0000ons set forth by the European Union Medical Device Regula\u0000on, and succession\ncharges.\nCorporate ac\u0000vi\u0000es are comprised of opera\u0000ng expenses not directly iden\u0000fiable within the two repor\u0000ng segments, such as human resources, finance, legal,\nand informa\u0000on technology func\u0000ons. The Company neither discretely allocates assets, other than goodwill, to its opera\u0000ng segments nor evaluates the\nopera\u0000ng segments using discrete asset informa\u0000on.\nGlobal Spine\nThe Global Spine repor\u0000ng segment offers two primary product categories: (i) Bone Growth Therapies and (ii) Spinal Implants, Biologics, and Enabling\nTechnologies.\nThe Bone Growth Therapies product category manufactures, distributes, sells, and provides support services for market-leading devices used adjunc\u0000vely in\nhigh-risk spinal fusion procedures and to treat both nonunion and acute fractures in the orthopedic space. These Class III medical devices are indicated as an\nadjunc\u0000ve, noninvasive treatment to improve fusion success rates in the cervical and lumbar spine as well as a therapeu\u0000c treatment for non-spine acute and\nnonunion fractures. This product category uses distributors and a direct sales channel to sell its devices to hospitals, healthcare providers, and pa\u0000ents, in the\nU.S.\nSpinal Implants, Biologics, and Enabling Technologies is comprised of (i) a broad por\u0000olio of spine fixa\u0000on and mo\u0000on preserva\u0000on implant products used in\nsurgical procedures of the spine, (ii) one of the most comprehensive biologics por\u0000olios in both the demineralized bone matrix and cellular allogra\u0000 market\nsegments, and (iii) image-guided surgical solu\u0000ons to facilitate degenera\u0000ve, minimally invasive, and complex surgical procedures.

The Company issued op\u0000ons to purchase 1.9\nmillion shares of Orthofix common stock and 0.5 million shares of \u0000me-based ves\u0000ng restricted stock units in connec\u0000on with the conversion of such awards.\nThe es\u0000mated fair value of the por\u0000on of the SeaSpine equity awards for which the required service period had been completed at the \u0000me of the closing of\nthe Merger was treated as purchase considera\u0000on. The remaining es\u0000mated fair value is recorded as compensa\u0000on expense over the remainder of the service\nperiod associated with the awards.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company issued 0.2 million and less than 0.1 million shares, respec\u0000vely, of common stock\nrelated to stock purchase plan issuances, stock op\u0000on exercises, and the ves\u0000ng of restricted stock awards and units. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company issued 1.0 million and 0.5 million shares, respec\u0000vely, of common stock related to stock purchase plan issuances,\nstock op\u0000on exercises, and the ves\u0000ng of restricted stock awards and units.\nInducement plans\nDuring 2024, the Company has appointed several new execu\u0000ves, including a new President and Chief Execu\u0000ve Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief People &\nBusiness Opera\u0000ons Officer, Chief Legal Officer, President of Global Spine, Chief Investor Rela\u0000ons and Communica\u0000ons Officer, President of Global Opera\u0000ons\nand Quality, Chief Human Resources Officer, and President of Global Orthopedics. As inducements to accept employment with the Company, the individuals\nwere awarded grants including, dependent on the individual, (i) market-based and/or \u0000me-based stock op\u0000ons, (ii) \u0000me-based restricted stock units, (iii) \u0000me-\nbased cliff ves\u0000ng restricted stock units, and (iv) market-based restricted stock units, with an aggregate value across all award types of approximately $22.6\nmillion.\n14. Income taxes\nGenerally, income tax provisions for interim periods are based on an es\u0000mated annual income tax rate, adjusted for discrete tax items, with any changes\naffec\u0000ng the es\u0000mated annual effec\u0000ve tax rate recorded in the interim period in which the change occurs. Due to the impact of losses not benefited by the\nCompany’s U.S. and Italian opera\u0000ons, the Company determined the es\u0000mated annual effec\u0000ve tax rate method would not provide a reliable es\u0000mate of the\nCompany’s overall annual effec\u0000ve tax rate. As such, the Company has calculated the tax provision using the actual effec\u0000ve rate for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024. Due to the impact of temporary differences on the U.S. current tax liability without any deferred tax benefit, the actual effec\u0000ve\nrate may vary in future quarters.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the effec\u0000ve tax rate was (2.8%) and (1.7%), respec\u0000vely. For the nine months ended September\n30, 2024, and 2023, the effec\u0000ve tax rate was (2.9%) and (2.0%), respec\u0000vely. The primary factors affec\u0000ng the Company’s effec\u0000ve tax rate for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, were certain losses not benefited and tax amor\u0000za\u0000on on certain acquired intangibles.\nWe were no\u0000fied in October 2024 that the Italian Tax Agency would begin an audit of the Company's subsidiary in Italy for the 2020 tax year. The Company\ncannot reasonably determine if this examina\u0000on will have a material impact on its financial statements and cannot predict the \u0000ming regarding resolu\u0000on of\nthe tax examina\u0000on.\n20\n15. Earnings per share (“EPS”)\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, no adjustments were made to net income for purposes of calcula\u0000ng basic and diluted EPS. The\nfollowing is a reconcilia\u0000on of the weighted average shares used in diluted EPS computa\u0000ons.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(Unaudited, In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nWeighted average common shares-basic 38,488 37,249 37,941 36,588\nEffect of dilu\u0000ve securi\u0000es\nUnexercised stock op\u0000ons and stock purchase plan — — — —\nUnvested restricted stock units — — — —\nWeighted average common shares-diluted 38,488 37,249 37,941 36,588\nThere were 7.2 million and 6.3 million weighted average outstanding stock op\u0000ons and restricted stock units not included in the diluted EPS computa\u0000on for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respec\u0000vely, and 7.0 million and 6.8 million weighted average outstanding stock op\u0000ons and\nrestricted stock units not included in the diluted EPS computa\u0000on for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respec\u0000vely, because inclusion of\nthese awards was an\u0000-dilu\u0000ve.\n16. Subsequent Events\nOn November 7, 2024, the Company, as borrower, and its U.S. subsidiaries entered into a $275 million secured credit agreement (the “New Credit Agreement”)\nwith Oxford Finance LLC, as administra\u0000ve agent and as collateral agent (“Oxford”) and certain lenders party thereto, including Oxford and K2 Healthventures\nLLC. Certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are expected to join the New Credit Agreement as guarantors shortly a\u0000er the signing date. The New Credit\nAgreement provides for a $160 million senior secured term loan (the “Ini\u0000al Term Loan”), and a $65 million senior secured delayed draw term loan facility (the\n“Term B Loan”). Draws under the Term B Loan are at the Company’s op\u0000on from January 1, 2025 through June 30, 2026, subject to, among other condi\u0000ons,\nthe Company’s con\u0000nuing compliance with a pro-forma total debt-to-EBITDA leverage ra\u0000o of less than 4.0x. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which\nrepresents earnings before interest income (expense), income taxes, deprecia\u0000on, amor\u0000za\u0000on, and other nego\u0000ated addbacks and adjustments. In addi\u0000on,\nat Oxford's discre\u0000on, an addi\u0000onal $50 million of draw capacity is available to the Company, through January 1, 2029 (the “Term C Loan” and, together with\nthe Term B Loan, the “Delayed Draw Term Loans” and collec\u0000vely with the Ini\u0000al Term Loan, the “Credit Facili\u0000es”). The Ini\u0000al Term Loan and Delayed Draw\nTerm Loans, to the extent ul\u0000mately drawn, will each mature in November 2029, following an interest-only payment period ending December 2028, and\nmonthly amor\u0000za\u0000on of principal and accrued interest between January 2029 and November 2029.\nThe Credit Facili\u0000es will be secured by a perfected first priority lien, or the equivalent security interest in each applicable jurisdic\u0000on, on substan\u0000ally all of the\nassets of the Company and the applicable guarantors (subject to customary carveouts), including their respec\u0000ve U.S. intellectual property assets.\nThe Company expects to promptly fund the Ini\u0000al Term Loan under the New Credit Agreement to repay all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit\nFacility with Blue Torch Finance LLC and terminate the Financing Agreement with Blue Torch. In addi\u0000on to the repayment of exis\u0000ng debt, borrowings under\nthe New Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facili\u0000es bear interest at a percentage rate equal to the greater of 8.75% or 5.75% plus the one-month term SOFR rate. A facility\nfee equal to 1.5% of each applicable funded loan tranche is due at the \u0000me of funding of such respec\u0000ve tranche, and a 0.5% unused line fee is payable\nannually on the Term B Loan.\nThe New Credit Agreement contains customary affirma\u0000ve and nega\u0000ve covenants, including limita\u0000ons on the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to incur\naddi\u0000onal debt, grant or permit addi\u0000onal liens, make certain investments and acquisi\u0000ons, merge or consolidate with others, dispose of certain assets, pay\ndividends and distribu\u0000ons, pay subordinated indebtedness, and enter into affiliate transac\u0000ons, as well as financial covenants that the Company (i) possess at\nleast $45 million of unrestricted cash at the \u0000me the Ini\u0000al Term Loan is funded and therea\u0000er maintain $15 million of unrestricted cash in U.S.-based\naccounts, and (ii) maintain a maximum total debt-to-EBITDA leverage ra\u0000o no greater than 4.0x during the term of the facility.\n21\nItem 2.

In addi\u0000on to the repayment of exis\u0000ng debt, borrowings under\nthe New Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes.\n29\nBorrowings under the Credit Facili\u0000es bear interest at a percentage rate equal to the greater of 8.75% or 5.75% plus the one-month term SOFR rate. A facility\nfee equal to 1.5% of each applicable funded loan tranche is due at the \u0000me of funding of such respec\u0000ve tranche, and a 0.5% unused line fee is payable\nannually on the Term B Loan.\nThe New Credit Agreement contains customary affirma\u0000ve and nega\u0000ve covenants, including limita\u0000ons on the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to incur\naddi\u0000onal debt, grant or permit addi\u0000onal liens, make certain investments and acquisi\u0000ons, merge or consolidate with others, dispose of certain assets, pay\ndividends and distribu\u0000ons, pay subordinated indebtedness, and enter into affiliate transac\u0000ons, as well as financial covenants that the Company (i) possess at\nleast $45 million of unrestricted cash at the \u0000me the Ini\u0000al Term Loan is funded and therea\u0000er maintain $15 million of unrestricted cash in U.S.-based\naccounts, and (ii) maintain a maximum total debt-to-EBITDA leverage ra\u0000o no greater than 4.0x during the term of the facility.\nThe Company believes it will be in compliance with the covenants in future fiscal quarters. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be in\nsuch compliance, and if it is not, the failure to do so could result in an event of default, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial\nposi\u0000on in the event that it con\u0000nues to have significant amounts drawn under the Credit Facili\u0000es at such \u0000me.\nOther\nFor informa\u0000on regarding con\u0000ngencies, see Note 8 to the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein.\nLa\u0000us Spine LLC (\"La\u0000us\") Con\u0000ngent Considera\u0000on\nUnder the terms of a con\u0000ngent considera\u0000on obliga\u0000on in a purchase agreement assumed in the Merger, we may be required to make installment payments\nat certain dates based on future net sales of certain products (the \"Lateral Products\"). The es\u0000mated fair value of the con\u0000ngent considera\u0000on arrangement as\nof September 30, 2024, was $14.7 million; however, the actual amount ul\u0000mately paid could be higher or lower than the es\u0000mated fair value of the con\u0000ngent\nconsidera\u0000on. As of September 30, 2024, we classified the remaining con\u0000ngent considera\u0000on liability of $6.6 million and $8.1 million within other current\nliabili\u0000es and other long-term liabili\u0000es, respec\u0000vely. For addi\u0000onal discussion of this ma\u0000er, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nLegion Innova\u0000ons, LLC Asset Acquisi\u0000on\nOn December 29, 2022, we entered into a technology assignment and royalty agreement with Legion Innova\u0000ons, LLC, a U.S.-based medical device technology\ncompany, whereby we acquired intellectual property rights to certain assets. As considera\u0000on, we paid $0.2 million in January 2023, with addi\u0000onal payments\ncon\u0000ngent upon reaching future commercializa\u0000on and revenue-based milestones.\nIGEA S.p.A Exclusive License and Distribu\u0000on Agreement\nIn April 2021, we entered into an Exclusive License and Distribu\u0000on Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with IGEA S.p.A (“IGEA”), an Italian manufacturer\nand distributor of bone and car\u0000lage s\u0000mula\u0000on systems. As considera\u0000on for the License Agreement, we agreed to pay up to $4.0 million, of which $0.5\nmillion was paid in 2021, with certain payments con\u0000ngent upon achieving an FDA milestone.\nIn May 2022, we received FDA approval for the acquired technology, which triggered a con\u0000ngent considera\u0000on milestone obliga\u0000on of $3.5 million. Of this\namount, $1.5 million was paid in 2022, $1.0 million was paid in May 2023, and the remaining $1.0 million was paid in July 2024.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our\nfinancial condi\u0000on, changes in financial condi\u0000on, revenues or expenses, results of opera\u0000ons, cash flows, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources\nthat are material to investors.\nContractual Obliga\u0000ons\nThere have been no material changes in any of our material contractual obliga\u0000ons as disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n30\nCri\u0000cal Accoun\u0000ng Es\u0000mates\nOur discussion of opera\u0000ng results is based upon the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The prepara\u0000on of these\nstatements requires us to make es\u0000mates and assump\u0000ons that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabili\u0000es and disclosure of con\u0000ngent assets and\nliabili\u0000es at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the repor\u0000ng period. Our cri\u0000cal accoun\u0000ng\nes\u0000mates are described in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes to our\ncri\u0000cal accoun\u0000ng es\u0000mates during the quarter covered by this report.\nRecently Issued Accoun\u0000ng Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed informa\u0000on regarding the status of recently issued or\nadopted accoun\u0000ng pronouncements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items provides investors with greater transparency to the informa\u0000on used by\nsenior management in its financial and opera\u0000onal decision-making. We believe it is important to provide investors with the same non-GAAP financial\nmeasures used to supplement informa\u0000on regarding the performance and underlying trends of our business opera\u0000ons to facilitate comparisons to historical\nopera\u0000ng results and internally evaluate the effec\u0000veness of our opera\u0000ng strategies. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates\ncomparisons of our underlying opera\u0000ng performance with other companies in the industry that also supplement their U.S. GAAP results with non-GAAP\nfinancial measures.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures used in this filing may have limita\u0000ons as analy\u0000cal tools and should not be considered in isola\u0000on or as a replacement for\nU.S. GAAP financial measures. Some limita\u0000ons associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures are that they exclude items that reflect an\neconomic cost that can have a material effect on cash flows.\nConstant Currency\nConstant currency is calculated by using foreign currency rates from the comparable, prior year period to present net sales at comparable rates. Constant\ncurrency can be presented for numerous U.S. GAAP measures but is most commonly used by management to analyze net sales without the impact of changes\nin foreign currency rates.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is calculated by subtrac\u0000ng capital expenditures from net cash from opera\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es. Management uses free cash flow as an important\nindicator of how much cash is generated or used by our normal business opera\u0000ons, including capital expenditures. Management uses free cash flow as a\nmeasure of progress on its capital efficiency and cash flow ini\u0000a\u0000ves.\nItem 3. Quan\u0000ta\u0000ve and Qualita\u0000ve Disclosures About Market Risk\nThere have been no material changes to our market risks as disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvalua\u0000on of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAt the end of the period covered by this report, under the supervision and with the par\u0000cipa\u0000on of our management, including our President and Chief\nExecu\u0000ve Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we performed an evalua\u0000on of the effec\u0000veness of the design and opera\u0000on of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures. As described below, as of December 31, 2023, management iden\u0000fied a material weakness in our internal control over financial repor\u0000ng, which is\nan integral component of our disclosure controls and procedures. Our remedia\u0000on efforts with respect to this material weakness are con\u0000nuing, and we have\ndetermined that this material weakness is con\u0000nuing as of September 30, 2024, as there have been no further control instances as of this date to conclude\nthat the applicable controls have been remediated. As a result, our President and Chief Execu\u0000ve Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were not effec\u0000ve as of September 30, 2024.\nMaterial Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Repor\u0000ng\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial repor\u0000ng (as such term is defined in the\nExchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company’s internal control over financial repor\u0000ng includes those\n31\npolicies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transac\u0000ons and disposi\u0000ons\nof the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transac\u0000ons are recorded as necessary to permit prepara\u0000on of financial statements in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authoriza\u0000ons of management and\ndirectors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding the preven\u0000on or \u0000mely detec\u0000on of unauthorized acquisi\u0000on, use or disposi\u0000on of\nthe Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nInternal control over financial repor\u0000ng is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the\nprepara\u0000on of reliable financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of the inherent limita\u0000ons in any internal control, no\nma\u0000er how well designed, misstatements may occur and not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, even effec\u0000ve internal control over financial repor\u0000ng can\nprovide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement prepara\u0000on. Further, the evalua\u0000on of the effec\u0000veness of internal control over financial\nrepor\u0000ng was made as of a specific date, and con\u0000nued effec\u0000veness in future periods is subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in condi\u0000ons or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may decline.\nIn connec\u0000on with the prepara\u0000on and filing of the Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Report”), the Company’s\nmanagement, including our President and Chief Execu\u0000ve Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evalua\u0000on of the effec\u0000veness of our internal\ncontrol over financial repor\u0000ng as of December 31, 2023, based on the framework set forth in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the\nCommi\u0000ee of Sponsoring Organiza\u0000ons of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Based on its evalua\u0000on, the Company’s management concluded that\nour internal control over financial repor\u0000ng was not effec\u0000ve as of December 31, 2023, due to a material weakness in the design and opera\u0000on of certain\nmanagement review controls pertaining to business combina\u0000ons and assessing recoverability of goodwill, resul\u0000ng from insufficient evidence suppor\u0000ng the\nprecision over the determina\u0000on of certain es\u0000mates and insufficient evidence suppor\u0000ng the opera\u0000ng effec\u0000veness of the associated review controls. This\nmaterial weakness did not result in any misstatements to the consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nNotwithstanding the material weakness, management has concluded that the financial statements included elsewhere in the 2023 Annual Report presented\nfairly, in all material respects, our financial posi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows in conformity with U.S. GAAP.\nRemedia\u0000on of the Material Weakness\nOur management has worked, and con\u0000nues to work, to strengthen our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial repor\u0000ng in\nconnec\u0000on with the material weakness described above. Subsequent to the iden\u0000fica\u0000on of the material weakness, the Company has be\u0000er aligned its current\nfinance department staff to enhance the review and oversight of the accoun\u0000ng and finance func\u0000ons. The Company has also added several key posi\u0000ons in its\nfinance department, including a new Chief Financial Officer, a Senior Vice President of Finance and Strategy, and other suppor\u0000ng roles with backgrounds in\nfinancial repor\u0000ng, technical accoun\u0000ng, and financial planning and analysis. The Company con\u0000nues to implement the remedia\u0000on efforts described herein.\nThese remedia\u0000on efforts are being undertaken under the supervision of the Audit and Finance Commi\u0000ee of our Board of Directors.\nWe are in the process of implemen\u0000ng and con\u0000nuing to refine the plan for remedia\u0000on of the ineffec\u0000ve internal control over financial repor\u0000ng described\nabove. In addi\u0000on, we have designed and are implemen\u0000ng the specific remedia\u0000on ini\u0000a\u0000ves described below:\n• Evalua\u0000ng skill set gaps and hiring addi\u0000onal accoun\u0000ng, finance, and/or financial repor\u0000ng personnel, as needed, with relevant public company\naccoun\u0000ng and financial repor\u0000ng experience to develop and implement addi\u0000onal policies, procedures, and controls as it pertains to business\ncombina\u0000ons, asset acquisi\u0000ons, and/or other processes heavily dependent on the usage of prospec\u0000ve financial informa\u0000on;\n• Providing ongoing training for key personnel responsible for internal control over financial repor\u0000ng; and\n• Enhancing and/or implemen\u0000ng new controls over the completeness and accuracy of informa\u0000on used in financial repor\u0000ng and forecasted\nfinancial results, par\u0000cularly as it relates to the accoun\u0000ng for business combina\u0000ons and goodwill impairment assessments.\nWe believe the remedia\u0000on steps outlined above have improved and will con\u0000nue to improve the effec\u0000veness of our internal control over financial repor\u0000ng.\nWe are commi\u0000ed to remedia\u0000ng the material weakness and we are making progress in that effort. The ac\u0000ons we are taking are subject to ongoing senior\nmanagement review, as well as oversight from the Audit and Finance Commi\u0000ee. When fully implemented and opera\u0000onal, we believe the measures\ndescribed above will remediate the underlying\n32\ncauses of the control deficiencies that gave rise to the material weakness and will strengthen our internal control over financial repor\u0000ng. However,\nremedia\u0000on efforts are expected to con\u0000nue beyond the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Further, we will not be able to fully remediate this material\nweakness un\u0000l these steps have been completed and have been opera\u0000ng effec\u0000vely for a sufficient period of \u0000me. We may also iden\u0000fy addi\u0000onal measures\nthat may be required to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial repor\u0000ng, necessita\u0000ng further ac\u0000on.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Repor\u0000ng\nOther than the remedia\u0000on ac\u0000vi\u0000es described above, there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial repor\u0000ng during the quarterly\nperiod covered by this report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial repor\u0000ng.\n33\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFor informa\u0000on regarding legal proceedings, see Note 8 to the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein, which\nis incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 1.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThere have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in \"Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023,\nexcept as follows:\nOngoing li\u0000ga\u0000on and arbitra\u0000on ma\u0000ers could nega\u0000vely affect our business opera\u0000ons.\nIn September 2023, following an inves\u0000ga\u0000on conducted by independent outside legal counsel, our Board of Directors terminated the employment of Keith\nValen\u0000ne, John Bostjancic, and Patrick Keran, who had served respec\u0000vely as the Company’s President and Chief Execu\u0000ve Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and\nChief Legal Officer. The Company no\u0000fied each of Messrs. Valen\u0000ne, Bostjancic, and Keran that their respec\u0000ve termina\u0000ons were being made for “Cause,” as\ndefined in applicable employment-related agreements (including each execu\u0000ve’s respec\u0000ve Change in Control and Severance Agreement, dated June 19,\n2023).\nSeveral li\u0000ga\u0000on and arbitra\u0000on ma\u0000ers against the Company (and in certain cases, current and former directors and officers) are pending in connec\u0000on with\nthese termina\u0000ons. These ma\u0000ers include (i) arbitra\u0000on claims by the three former execu\u0000ves against the Company for alleged breach of contract, defama\u0000on,\nfalse light invasion of privacy and deceit in connec\u0000on with such termina\u0000ons of employment, including payment of severance amounts and the value of\nforfeited equity grants, (ii) securi\u0000es class ac\u0000on complaints alleging viola\u0000ons of the Securi\u0000es Act of 1933 and the Securi\u0000es Exchange Act of 1934 in\nconnec\u0000on with the Company’s public disclosures during the periods preceding such termina\u0000ons, and (iii) a deriva\u0000ve complaint alleging claims against\ncertain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors based on the same allega\u0000ons made in the securi\u0000es class ac\u0000on complaints. Addi\u0000onal\nlawsuits or proceedings against the Company and/or its current or former directors and officers in connec\u0000on with these ma\u0000ers may be filed in the future.\nIn the event that any of these claims, or other future related or unrelated claims, are successful, they could result in costs to us that could nega\u0000vely affect our\nnear-term liquidity and financial condi\u0000on. In addi\u0000on, these ma\u0000ers may also divert management’s a\u0000en\u0000on and resources, which could adversely affect the\nopera\u0000on of our business while such claims proceed.\nWe maintain a $275 million secured credit facility secured by a pledge of substan\u0000ally all of our property.\nOn November 7, 2024, the Company, as borrower, and its U.S. subsidiaries entered into a $275 million secured credit agreement (the “New Credit Agreement”)\nwith Oxford Finance LLC, as administra\u0000ve agent and as collateral agent (“Oxford”) and certain lenders party thereto, including Oxford and K2 Healthventures\nLLC. Certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are expected to join the New Credit Agreement as guarantors shortly a\u0000er the signing date. The New Credit\nAgreement provides for a $160 million senior secured term loan (the “Ini\u0000al Term Loan”), and a $65 million senior secured delayed draw term loan facility (the\n“Term B Loan”). Draws under the Term B Loan are at the Company’s op\u0000on from January 1, 2025 through June 30, 2026, subject to, among other condi\u0000ons,\nthe Company’s con\u0000nuing compliance with a pro-forma total debt-to-EBITDA leverage ra\u0000o of less than 4.0x. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which\nrepresents earnings before interest income (expense), income taxes, deprecia\u0000on, amor\u0000za\u0000on, and other nego\u0000ated addbacks and adjustments. In addi\u0000on,\nat Oxford's discre\u0000on, an addi\u0000onal $50 million of draw capacity is available to the Company, through January 1, 2029 (the “Term C Loan” and, together with\nthe Term B Loan, the “Delayed Draw Term Loans” and collec\u0000vely with the Ini\u0000al Term Loan, the “Credit Facili\u0000es”). The Ini\u0000al Term Loan and Delayed Draw\nTerm Loans, to the extent ul\u0000mately drawn, will each mature in November 2029, following an interest-only payment period ending December 2028, and\nmonthly amor\u0000za\u0000on of principal and accrued interest between January 2029 and November 2029.\nThe Credit Facili\u0000es will be secured by a perfected first priority lien, or the equivalent security interest in each applicable jurisdic\u0000on, on substan\u0000ally all of the\nassets of the Company and the applicable guarantors (subject to customary carveouts), including their respec\u0000ve U.S. intellectual property assets.\nThe Company expects to promptly fund the Ini\u0000al Term Loan under the New Credit Agreement to repay all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit\nFacility with Blue Torch Finance LLC and terminate the Financing Agreement with Blue Torch. In addi\u0000on to the repayment of exis\u0000ng debt, borrowings under\nthe New Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facili\u0000es bear interest at a percentage rate equal to the greater of 8.75% or 5.75% plus the one-month term SOFR rate. A facility\nfee equal to 1.5% of each applicable funded loan tranche is due at the \u0000me of funding of such respec\u0000ve tranche, and a 0.5% unused line fee is payable\nannually on the Term B Loan.\n34\nThe New Credit Agreement contains customary affirma\u0000ve and nega\u0000ve covenants, including limita\u0000ons on the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to incur\naddi\u0000onal debt, grant or permit addi\u0000onal liens, make certain investments and acquisi\u0000ons, merge or consolidate with others, dispose of certain assets, pay\ndividends and distribu\u0000ons, pay subordinated indebtedness, and enter into affiliate transac\u0000ons, as well as financial covenants that the Company (i) possess at\nleast $45 million of unrestricted cash at the \u0000me the Ini\u0000al Term Loan is funded and therea\u0000er maintain $15 million of unrestricted cash in U.S.-based\naccounts, and (ii) maintain a maximum total debt-to-EBITDA leverage ra\u0000o no greater than 4.0x during the term of the facility.\nWe believe that we will be in compliance with the covenants in future fiscal quarters. However, there can be no assurance that we will be in such compliance,\nand if we are not, the failure to do so could result in an event of default, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial posi\u0000on in the event that\nwe con\u0000nue to have significant amounts drawn under the facility at such \u0000me.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securi\u0000es and Use of Proceeds\nWe have not made any repurchases of our common stock during the third quarter of 2024.\nItem 3.

Certain Terminations of Employment During a Non-CiC Period. If, during a Non-CiC Period, the Executive’s employment with the\nCompany terminates as a result of death, the Executive terminates his or her employment as a result of Disability or for Good Reason, or the\nCompany terminates the Executive’s employment without Cause, the Company shall pay or provide to the Executive (i) the Executive’s\noutstanding base salary due through the Executive’s date of termination, (ii) any amounts or benefits owing to the Executive as of the Executive’s\ndate of termination under the then applicable benefit plans of the Company, at the time such amounts or benefits are due (including any accrued\nvacation payable), (iii) any amounts owing to the Executive for reimbursement of expenses properly incurred by the Executive prior to the\nExecutive’s date of termination, which shall be subject to and paid in accordance with the Company’s expense reimbursement policy, (iv) if, for\nthe calendar year prior to the Executive’s termination, the Company and/or the Executive has achieved performance goals (whether or not such\nachievement has been determined formally) such that the Executive has earned (or would have earned, had the Executive been employed in good\nstanding by the Company on the date on which a bonus otherwise would have been paid) a bonus under any annual cash incentive program of the\nCompany (an “Annual Cash Incentive Program”) and such Annual Cash Incentive Program bonus with respect to such prior calendar\nPage 6\nyear has not yet been paid, the amount of such bonus, payable at the same time as payments are made to other participants under such Annual\nCash Incentive Program, and (v) a pro rata amount of any Annual Cash Incentive Program bonus with respect to the year of termination (based on\nthe number of days the Executive was employed by the Company during such year of termination) assuming achievement at 100% of Executive’s\ncurrent annual target cash bonus amount under the Annual Cash Incentive Program, payable at the same time as payments are made to Executive\nas set forth in this Section 3, other than with respect to the bonus paid under the Annual Cash Incentive Program as contemplated by Section 3(iv)\n(collectively, the “Accrued Amounts”).

If, during a CiC Period, the Executive’s employment with the Company\nterminates as a result of death, the Executive terminates his or her employment as a result of Disability or for Good Reason, or the Company\nterminates the Executive’s\nPage 7\nemployment without Cause, the Company shall: (A) pay or provide to the Executive the Accrued Amounts, and (B) subject to the Executive’s\ncompliance with the covenants in Section 9 (including but not limited to the CIAA Covenants) and the Executive’s execution and non-revocation\nof the release described in Section 5 hereof, (i) pay to the Executive, in a cash lump sum within ten (10) days following the Release Effective Date\n(subject to the additional payment delays that may be required pursuant to Sections 8(b) and 8(c) below), an amount equal to 1.5 times the\nSeverance Base Amount (the amount provided for by such product, the “CiC Severance Amount”); provided, however, that if the CiC Severance\nAmount could be paid to the Executive during the subsequent taxable year of the Executive rather than the Executive’s taxable year in which the\nExecutive’s date of termination occurs based on when the Executive executes and delivers the release described in Section 5 hereof to the\nCompany, then, to the extent that the CiC Severance Amount constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code,\nthe CiC Severance Amount shall not be paid earlier than the first business day of the later of such taxable years; and (ii) reimburse the Executive\non a monthly basis for the Executive’s monthly premium payments for health care coverage under COBRA for the Executive and the Executive’s\neligible dependents for a period of 12 months, provided that the Executive and, if applicable, the Executive’s eligible dependents are currently\nenrolled in the applicable plan(s) of the Company at the time of the Executive’s termination and that the Executive timely elects to continue the\nExecutive’s coverage under COBRA; provided, however, that the Company’s obligation to reimburse the Executive for such premiums shall cease\non the date the Executive is no longer eligible to receive COBRA coverage and (ii) if the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that the\npayment of the COBRA reimbursements (in whole or in part) would result in a violation of the nondiscrimination rules of Section 105(h) of the\nCode or any statute or regulation of similar effect, then in lieu of providing the COBRA reimbursements (in whole or in part), the Company may\nelect instead to pay the Executive on the first day of each month of such coverage period, a fully taxable cash payment equal, on an after-tax basis,\nto the applicable COBRA premiums (in whole or in part) for the prior month. The Executive must advise the Company as soon as the Executive\nbecomes eligible for health care coverage from a third party (e.g., spouse’s employer, the Executive’s subsequent employer, or any other party\nwith a relationship with the Executive).\n5. Payments Contingent Upon Release Agreement, Compliance with Covenants. As a condition to receiving the Non-CiC Severance\nAmount or the CiC Severance Amount, as applicable, and the reimbursement or payment of COBRA premiums pursuant to Sections 3 or 4 hereof,\nthe Executive will execute a general release of claims, which will also confirm any post-termination obligations and/or restrictions applicable to\nthe Executive, in form and substance consistent with then-current practices for companies similarly situated to Parent (the “Release”). Within ten\n(10) days of the Executive’s date of termination, the Company shall deliver to the Executive the Release for the Executive to execute. The\nExecutive will forfeit all rights to receive the Non-CiC Severance Amount or the CiC Severance Amount, as applicable, and the reimbursement or\npayment of COBRA premiums pursuant to Sections 3 or 4 hereof unless, within fifty-two (52) days of delivery of the Release by the Company to\nthe Executive, the Executive executes and delivers the Release to the Company and such Release has become irrevocable by virtue of the\nexpiration of the revocation period specified therein without the Release having been revoked (the first such date, the “Release Effective Date”).\nThe Company’s obligation to pay the Non-CiC Severance Amount or the CiC Severance Amount, as applicable, or to reimburse or pay COBRA\npremiums pursuant to Sections 3 or 4 hereof, is subject to the occurrence of the Release Effective Date, and if the Release Effective Date does not\noccur, then the Company shall have no obligation to make such payments or reimbursements. Any reimbursements or payments of COBRA\npremiums pursuant to Sections 3 or 4 hereof that would otherwise have become due prior to the Release Effective Date shall be paid in a cash\nlump sum within ten (10) days following the Release Effective Date; provided, that if any reimbursements or\nPage 8\npayments of COBRA premiums pursuant to Sections 3 or 4 hereof could be paid to the Executive during a different taxable year of the Executive\nthan the Executive’s taxable year in which the Executive’s date of termination occurs based on when the Executive executes and delivers the\nRelease to the Company, then, to the extent that the reimbursements constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the\nCode, the reimbursement amounts shall not be paid earlier than the first business day of the later of such taxable years. In the event the Company\nreasonably believes that the Executive has breached one or more of the covenants in Section 9 (including but not limited to the CIAA Covenants),\nthe Company shall notify the Executive and provide reasonably detailed information supporting its belief and the Company and the Executive\nshall discuss in good faith the resolution thereof. Subject to Section 10(d), if it is determined that the Executive has breached one or more\ncovenants in Section 9 (including but not limited to the CIAA Covenants), the Executive shall forfeit the Executive’s right to receive the Non-CiC\nSeverance Amount or the CiC Severance Amount, as applicable, and the reimbursement or payment of COBRA premiums pursuant to Sections 3\nor 4 hereof, and, to the extent such amounts have been paid to the Executive, shall repay to the Company the after-tax amount of any such\npreviously paid amounts.\n6. Time-Based Stock Options, Time-Based Restricted Stock and Time-Based Restricted Stock Unit Vesting and Exercisability. The\nprovisions set forth in Sections 6(a), (b), (c) and (d) below shall apply with respect to (a) the time-based vesting portion of all stock options of the\nCompany (“Time-Based Stock Options” or “Options”) granted to the Executive, (b) all time-based vesting shares of restricted stock of the\nCompany (“Time-Based Restricted Stock” or “TBRS”) granted to the Executive, and (c) all time-based vesting restricted stock units of the\nCompany (“Time-Based RSU” or “TBRSU”) granted to the Executive, in each case, whether the applicable Options, TBRS and/or TRBSU are\nissued under (i) the 2012 LTIP, (ii) the SeaSpine 2015 Plan, or (iii) any other future or successor Company plan or standalone award agreements.\nSuch provisions shall supersede and override any conflicting provisions set forth in applicable award agreements of the Company governing\napplicable grants, and shall be incorporated by reference into the terms of such award agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions\nin Section 6(a), (b), (c) and (d) below shall not apply with respect to the equity-based compensation grants made to the Executive pursuant to\nNasdaq Rule 5635(c)(4) in connection with his inducement to become employed by the Company.\n(a) Termination of Service in Non-Acceleration Circumstances. If, prior to vesting, the Executive’s Service is terminated\nfor any reason other than a circumstance providing for accelerated vesting pursuant to any of Sections 6(b)-(f) below, the unvested portion of the\napplicable Option, TBRS, or TBRSU shall be cancelled and revert back to the Company as of the date of such termination of Service, and the\nExecutive shall have no further right or interest therein unless the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion shall determine otherwise. In\nsuch event, the Executive shall have the right, subject to the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the applicable plan, to\nexercise such Option, to the extent it has vested as of the date of such termination of Service, at any time within three (3) months after the date of\nsuch termination of Service, subject to the earlier expiration of the Option on the ten (10)-year anniversary of grant or such other term as is\nprovided in the applicable equity award agreement otherwise governing such grant (the “Expiration Date”). To the extent the vested portion of the\nOption is not exercised within such three (3)-month period, such Option shall be cancelled and revert back to the Company, and the Executive or\nany permitted transferee pursuant to the terms of the applicable award agreement, as applicable, shall have no further right or interest therein.\n(b) Termination of Service for Death or Disability. If the Executive’s Service terminates by reason of death or the\nExecutive terminates his or her employment as a result of Disability, as of the date of such termination of Service (i) the unvested portion of any\nOption shall automatically vest\nPage 9\nand become immediately exercisable in full and (ii) any TBRS and any TBRSU shall automatically vest in full. The full portion of any\nunexercised Option shall remain exercisable by the Executive (or any person entitled to do so) at any time within eighteen (18) months after the\ndate of such termination of Service, subject to the earlier expiration of such Option on the Expiration Date. To the extent such Option is not\nexercised within such period, such Option shall be cancelled and revert back to the Company, and the Executive or any permitted transferee\npursuant to the terms of the applicable award agreement, as applicable, shall have no further right or interest therein. The shares subject to any\nsuch TBRSU shall be delivered no later than sixty (60) days following such termination of Service.\n(c) Intentionally Omitted.\n(d) Termination of Service by Company without Cause or by Executive with Good Reason. If the Executive’s Service\nterminates by reason of the Executive terminating his or her employment for Good Reason or the Company terminating the Executive’s\nemployment without Cause, the Partially Accelerating Portion of any Option shall automatically vest and become immediately exercisable, and\nthe Partially Accelerating Portion of any TBRS and any TBRSU shall automatically vest, in each case, as of the date of such termination of\nService. The non-vested portion of the Option shall be cancelled and revert back to the Company. The vested portion of the applicable Option\n(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include the Partially Accelerating Portion) shall remain exercisable by the Executive (or any person\nentitled to do so) at any time within eighteen (18) months after the date of such termination of Service, subject to the earlier expiration of the\nOption on the Expiration Date, and to the extent such vested portion of the Option is not exercised within such eighteen (18)-month period, such\nportion of the Option shall be cancelled and revert back to the Company, and the Executive or any permitted transferee pursuant to the terms of\nthe applicable award agreement, as applicable, shall have no further right or interest therein. The shares subject to any such TBRSU shall be\ndelivered no later than sixty (60) days following such termination of Service.\n(e) Intentionally Omitted.\n(f) Certain Additional Change in Control Circumstances. In the event that the employment of the Executive with the\nCompany is terminated by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for CiC Period Good Reason, in each case during a CiC Period\n(including, for the avoidance of doubt, following a Potential CiC Date but before the applicable Change in Control has been consummated), (i) the\nExecutive’s then-outstanding Options shall be fully vested and may be exercised in full, to the extent applicable, beginning on the date of such\ntermination and for the thirty six (36)-month period immediately following such termination (subject to the earlier expiration of the Option on the\nExpiration Date) or for such longer period as the Compensation Committee shall determine, and (ii) the unvested portion of the Executive’s then\noutstanding TBRS and TBRSU shall be fully vested (and the shares subject to any such TBRSU shall be delivered no later than sixty (60) days\nfollowing such termination of Service). Such outstanding Options, TBRS, and TBRSU shall otherwise be treated in accordance with the default\nrules applicable under Section 17 of the 2012 LTIP as in effect on the Effective Date (or if made pursuant to a successor long-term incentive plan\nor inducement plan, the default rules contained in such plan).\n(g) Survival. All of the provisions in this Section 6 shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement for any\nreason (unless such termination is as a result of a future novation of such provisions entered into by each of the parties).\nPage 10\n7. Section 280G. In the event that any of the severance payments and other benefits provided by this Agreement or otherwise payable\nto the Executive (a) constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and (b) but for this Section 7, would be\nsubject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (“Excise Tax”), then the Executive’s severance payments and benefits under this\nAgreement or otherwise shall be payable either in full or in such lesser amount which would result in no portion of such severance payments or\nbenefits being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income\nand employment taxes and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by the Executive, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of severance\npayments and benefits under this Agreement or otherwise, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such severance payments or benefits may be\ntaxable under Section 4999 of the Code. Any reduction in the severance payments and benefits required by this Section 7 shall be made in the\nfollowing order: (i) reduction of cash payments; (ii) reduction of accelerated vesting of equity awards other than stock options; (iii) reduction of\naccelerated vesting of stock options; and (iv) reduction of other benefits paid or provided to the Executive. The calculations and establishment of\nassumptions in this Section 7 will be performed by a professional tax firm engaged by the Company as of the day prior to the applicable CiC\nDate. If the tax firm so engaged by the Company is serving as accountant or auditor for the acquiring company, the Company shall appoint a\nnationally recognized tax firm to make the determinations required by this Section 7. The Company shall bear all expenses with respect to the\ndeterminations by such firm required to be made by this Section 7. The Company and the Executive shall furnish such tax firm such information\nand documents as the tax firm may reasonably request in order to make its required determination. The tax firm will provide its calculations,\ntogether with detailed supporting documentation, to the Company and the Executive as soon as practicable following its engagement. Any good\nfaith determinations of the tax firm made hereunder shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Company and the Executive. However, the\nExecutive shall have the final authority to make any good faith determination(s) associated with the assumptions used by the tax firm in providing\nits calculations, and such good faith determination by the Executive shall be binding on the Company. As a result of the uncertainty in the\napplication of Sections 409A, 280G or 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the professional tax firm described in this\nSection 7, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or other agency will claim that an Excise Tax greater than that amount, if\nany, determined by such professional firm for the purposes of this Section 7 is due (the “Additional Excise Tax”). The Executive shall notify the\nCompany in writing of any claim by the IRS or other agency that, if successful, would require payment of Additional Excise Tax. The Executive\nand the Company shall each reasonably cooperate with the other in connection with any administrative or judicial proceedings concerning the\nexistence or amount of liability for Excise Tax with respect to payments made or due to the Executive. The Company shall pay all reasonable\nfees, expenses and penalties of the Executive relating to a claim by the IRS or other agency. In the event it is finally determined that a further\nreduction would have been required under this Section 7 to place the Executive in a better after-tax position, the Executive shall repay the\nCompany such amount within 30 days thereof in order to effect such result.\n8. Section 409A.\n(a) For purposes of Section 409A of the Code (“Section 409A”) (i) each “payment” (as defined by Section 409A) made\nunder this Agreement shall be considered a “separate payment,” and (ii) payments shall be deemed exempt from the definition of deferred\ncompensation under Section 409A to the fullest extent possible under (x) the “short-term deferral” exemption of Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-\n1(b)(4), and (y) with respect to amounts paid as separation pay (as defined under Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(m)) no later than the second\ncalendar year following the calendar year containing the Executive’s\nPage 11\n“separation from service” (as defined for purposes of Section 409A), the “two years/two-times” separation pay exemption of Treasury Regulation\n§ 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), which exemptions are hereby incorporated by reference.\n(b) Any payments otherwise payable under this Agreement shall not commence until the Executive has a “separation from\nservice” (as defined in Section 409A). Furthermore, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the case of a payment or benefit that is\ncharacterized as deferred compensation under Section 409A, and pursuant to which payment or settlement is triggered based on a Change in\nControl, in no event will a Change in Control be deemed to have occurred for purposes of such payment or settlement if the transaction is not also\na “change in the ownership or effective control of” the Company or “a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of” the\nCompany as determined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5) (without regard to any alternative definition thereunder).\n(c) If the Executive is a “specified employee” as defined in Section 409A (and as applied according to procedures of the\nCompany and its affiliates) as of the Executive’s separation from service, to the extent any payment under this Agreement constitutes deferred\ncompensation (after taking into account any applicable exemptions from Section 409A) that is payable upon a separation from service, and to the\nextent required in order to avoid the imposition of an excise tax or penalties under Section 409A, no payments due under this Agreement may be\nmade until the earlier of: (1) the date of the Executive’s death and (2) the first day of the seventh month following the Executive’s separation\nfrom service, provided, however, that any payments delayed during this six-month period shall be paid in the aggregate in a lump sum on the first\nday of the seventh month following the Executive’s separation from service (or upon the date of the Executive’s death, if earlier).\n(d) Any expense reimbursements or in kind benefits under this Agreement that constitute deferred compensation within the\nmeaning of Section 409A shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A, including, without limitation, that: (i)\nthe expenses eligible for reimbursement or the amount of in-kind benefits provided in one taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for\nreimbursement or the amount of in-kind benefits provided in any other taxable year; (ii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense shall be made\nno later than the end of the year after the year in which such expense was incurred; and (iii) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall\nnot be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.\n9.

The Executive agrees that, for 18 months after the Executive’s date of termination, the Executive shall\nmake himself of herself available at reasonable times, intervals and places for interviews, consultations, internal investigations and/or testimony\nduring which the Executive shall provide to the Company, or its designated attorneys or agents, any and all information known to the Executive\nregarding or relating to the Company or the Executive’s activities on behalf of the Company pertaining to the subject matter on which the\nExecutive’s cooperation is sought.\n10.Miscellaneous.\n(a) Employment At-Will.

The Executive understands that nothing contained in this Agreement restricts or limits the\nExecutive’s right to discuss the Executive’s employment or report possible violations of law or regulation with the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission, United States Department of Labor, the National Labor Relations Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or\nother federal government agency or similar state or local agency or to discuss the terms and conditions of the Executive’s employment with others\nto the extent permitted by Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act or to the extent that such disclosure is protected under the applicable\nprovisions of law or regulation, including but not limited to “whistleblower” statutes or other similar provisions that protect such disclosure.\nAdditionally, the Executive understands that, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1833(b), the Executive shall not be held criminally or civilly liable\nunder any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made: (1) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government\nofficial, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, and solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (2)\nin a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. If the Executive files a lawsuit for\nretaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, the Executive may disclose such trade secret to the Executive’s attorney and\nuse the trade secret information in related court proceedings, provided that Employee files any document containing the trade secret information\nunder seal and does not further disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.\nPage 13\n(c) Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by, construed, interpreted, and its validity determined under the laws\nof the state in which the Executive resides (the “Governing Law State”), as applied to agreements entered into and to be fully performed by\nresidents of such Governing Law State.

The parties hereby incorporate by reference the Dispute Resolution Agreement into this Agreement\nand agree that any and all disputes arising under this Agreement are subject to and governed by the Dispute Resolution Agreement; provided,\nhowever, that the parties reserve the right to seek temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in court, in which case the parties agree that such\ninjunctive relief shall be granted in court to preserve the status quo pending a resolution on the merits in arbitration. The Executive agrees that in\nconnection with any application for injunctive relief, discovery shall be conducted on an expedited basis. The Executive further agrees that, in\nany proceeding alleging breach of this Agreement, the Company shall have the right to conduct forensic examinations of any computers and/or\nelectronic devices in the Executive’s possession or control, if the Company reasonably believes such devices contain Confidential Information (as\ndefined in the Dispute Resolution Agreement).\n(e) Remedies. The Executive acknowledges that any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement will cause immediate\nand irreparable injury and unquantifiable damage to the Company. If the Executive breaches, or the Company reasonably believes the Executive\nis about to breach, this Agreement, the Executive agrees that the Company is entitled to immediate injunctive relief enforcing the terms of this\nAgreement without the necessity of posting a bond, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity. The Executive and the Company agree\nthat in any legal proceeding to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement of its actual costs and expenses,\nincluding without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.\n(f) Assignment.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive may not assign this Agreement or any part hereof. Any purported\nassignment by the Executive shall be null and void from the initial date of purported assignment.\n(g) Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, then the\nAgreement will be deemed amended to the extent necessary to render the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision, and the rest of the\nAgreement, valid and enforceable. If a court or other adjudicator declines to amend the Agreement, the invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of\nany provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions, which shall be enforced as if the invalid, illegal, or\nunenforceable provision had not been included in this Agreement.\n(h) Waiver. A waiver by the Company of a breach of any provisions of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any\nsubsequent breach, nor shall recourse to any remedy hereunder be a\nPage 14\nwaiver of any other or further relief or remedy.

The shares subject to any\nsuch TBRSU shall be delivered no later than sixty (60) days following such termination of Service.\n(c) Intentionally Omitted.\n(d) Termination of Service by Company without Cause or by Executive with Good Reason. If the Executive’s Service\nterminates by reason of the Executive terminating his or her employment for Good Reason or the Company terminating the Executive’s\nemployment without Cause, the Partially Accelerating Portion of any Option shall automatically vest and become immediately exercisable, and\nthe Partially Accelerating Portion of any TBRS and any TBRSU shall automatically vest, in each case, as of the date of such termination of\nService. The non-vested portion of the Option shall be cancelled and revert back to the Company. The vested portion of the applicable Option\n(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include the Partially Accelerating Portion) shall remain exercisable by the Executive (or any person\nentitled to do so) at any time within eighteen (18) months after the date of such termination of Service, subject to the earlier expiration of the\nOption on the Expiration Date, and to the extent such vested portion of the Option is not exercised within such eighteen (18)-month period, such\nportion of the Option shall be cancelled and revert back to the Company, and the Executive or any permitted transferee pursuant to the terms of\nthe applicable award agreement, as applicable, shall have no further right or interest therein. The shares subject to any such TBRSU shall be\ndelivered no later than sixty (60) days following such termination of Service.\n(e) Intentionally Omitted.\n(f) Certain Additional Change in Control Circumstances. In the event that the employment of the Executive with the\nCompany is terminated by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for CiC Period Good Reason, in each case during a CiC Period\n(including, for the avoidance of doubt, following a Potential CiC Date but before the applicable Change in Control has been consummated), (i) the\nExecutive’s then-outstanding Options shall be fully vested and may be exercised in full, to the extent applicable, beginning on the date of such\ntermination and for the thirty six (36)-month period immediately following such termination (subject to the earlier expiration of the Option on the\nExpiration Date) or for such longer period as the Compensation Committee shall determine, and (ii) the unvested portion of the Executive’s then\noutstanding TBRS and TBRSU shall be fully vested (and the shares subject to any such TBRSU shall be delivered no later than sixty (60) days\nfollowing such termination of Service). Such outstanding Options, TBRS, and TBRSU shall otherwise be treated in accordance with the default\nrules applicable under Section 17 of the 2012 LTIP as in effect on the Effective Date (or if made pursuant to a successor long-term incentive plan\nor inducement plan, the default rules contained in such plan).\n(g) Survival. All of the provisions in this Section 6 shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement for any\nreason (unless such termination is as a result of a future novation of such provisions entered into by each of the parties).\nPage 10\n7. Section 280G. In the event that any of the severance payments and other benefits provided by this Agreement or otherwise payable\nto the Executive (a) constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and (b) but for this Section 7, would be\nsubject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (“Excise Tax”), then the Executive’s severance payments and benefits under this\nAgreement or otherwise shall be payable either in full or in such lesser amount which would result in no portion of such severance payments or\nbenefits being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income\nand employment taxes and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by the Executive, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of severance\npayments and benefits under this Agreement or otherwise, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such severance payments or benefits may be\ntaxable under Section 4999 of the Code. Any reduction in the severance payments and benefits required by this Section 7 shall be made in the\nfollowing order: (i) reduction of cash payments; (ii) reduction of accelerated vesting of equity awards other than stock options; (iii) reduction of\naccelerated vesting of stock options; and (iv) reduction of other benefits paid or provided to the Executive. The calculations and establishment of\nassumptions in this Section 7 will be performed by a professional tax firm engaged by the Company as of the day prior to the applicable CiC\nDate. If the tax firm so engaged by the Company is serving as accountant or auditor for the acquiring company, the Company shall appoint a\nnationally recognized tax firm to make the determinations required by this Section 7. The Company shall bear all expenses with respect to the\ndeterminations by such firm required to be made by this Section 7. The Company and the Executive shall furnish such tax firm such information\nand documents as the tax firm may reasonably request in order to make its required determination. The tax firm will provide its calculations,\ntogether with detailed supporting documentation, to the Company and the Executive as soon as practicable following its engagement. Any good\nfaith determinations of the tax firm made hereunder shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Company and the Executive. However, the\nExecutive shall have the final authority to make any good faith determination(s) associated with the assumptions used by the tax firm in providing\nits calculations, and such good faith determination by the Executive shall be binding on the Company. As a result of the uncertainty in the\napplication of Sections 409A, 280G or 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the professional tax firm described in this\nSection 7, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or other agency will claim that an Excise Tax greater than that amount, if\nany, determined by such professional firm for the purposes of this Section 7 is due (the “Additional Excise Tax”). The Executive shall notify the\nCompany in writing of any claim by the IRS or other agency that, if successful, would require payment of Additional Excise Tax. The Executive\nand the Company shall each reasonably cooperate with the other in connection with any administrative or judicial proceedings concerning the\nexistence or amount of liability for Excise Tax with respect to payments made or due to the Executive. The Company shall pay all reasonable\nfees, expenses and penalties of the Executive relating to a claim by the IRS or other agency. In the event it is finally determined that a further\nreduction would have been required under this Section 7 to place the Executive in a better after-tax position, the Executive shall repay the\nCompany such amount within 30 days thereof in order to effect such result.\n8. Section 409A.\n(a) For purposes of Section 409A of the Code (“Section 409A”) (i) each “payment” (as defined by Section 409A) made\nunder this Agreement shall be considered a “separate payment,” and (ii) payments shall be deemed exempt from the definition of deferred\ncompensation under Section 409A to the fullest extent possible under (x) the “short-term deferral” exemption of Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-\n1(b)(4), and (y) with respect to amounts paid as separation pay (as defined under Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(m)) no later than the second\ncalendar year following the calendar year containing the Executive’s\nPage 11\n“separation from service” (as defined for purposes of Section 409A), the “two years/two-times” separation pay exemption of Treasury Regulation\n§ 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), which exemptions are hereby incorporated by reference.\n(b) Any payments otherwise payable under this Agreement shall not commence until the Executive has a “separation from\nservice” (as defined in Section 409A). Furthermore, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the case of a payment or benefit that is\ncharacterized as deferred compensation under Section 409A, and pursuant to which payment or settlement is triggered based on a Change in\nControl, in no event will a Change in Control be deemed to have occurred for purposes of such payment or settlement if the transaction is not also\na “change in the ownership or effective control of” the Company or “a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of” the\nCompany as determined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5) (without regard to any alternative definition thereunder).\n(c) If the Executive is a “specified employee” as defined in Section 409A (and as applied according to procedures of the\nCompany and its affiliates) as of the Executive’s separation from service, to the extent any payment under this Agreement constitutes deferred\ncompensation (after taking into account any applicable exemptions from Section 409A) that is payable upon a separation from service, and to the\nextent required in order to avoid the imposition of an excise tax or penalties under Section 409A, no payments due under this Agreement may be\nmade until the earlier of: (1) the date of the Executive’s death and (2) the first day of the seventh month following the Executive’s separation\nfrom service, provided, however, that any payments delayed during this six-month period shall be paid in the aggregate in a lump sum on the first\nday of the seventh month following the Executive’s separation from service (or upon the date of the Executive’s death, if earlier).\n(d) Any expense reimbursements or in kind benefits under this Agreement that constitute deferred compensation within the\nmeaning of Section 409A shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A, including, without limitation, that: (i)\nthe expenses eligible for reimbursement or the amount of in-kind benefits provided in one taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for\nreimbursement or the amount of in-kind benefits provided in any other taxable year; (ii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense shall be made\nno later than the end of the year after the year in which such expense was incurred; and (iii) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall\nnot be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.\n9. Additional Covenants.\n(a) Confidentiality, Inventions Assignment and Other Matters. The parties hereby incorporate by reference the CIAA into\nthis Agreement. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the CIAA Covenants are material provisions of this Agreement and that a material\nbreach of the CIAA Covenants shall be a material breach of this Agreement, and that the payment rights set forth in Sections 3 and 4 of this\nAgreement are subject to compliance with the CIAA Covenants, as further described in such respective sections.\n(b) Non-Disparagement. The Executive agrees that the Company’s reputation and goodwill in the marketplace is of utmost\nimportance and value to the Company. The Executive further agrees that during, and for 18 months after, the term of the Executive’s employment\nwith the Company, the Executive will not purposefully make or publish, directly or indirectly, any public statement disparaging the Company or\nany of its directors or officers who held such offices at the time of Executive’s termination. A disparaging statement is any written\ncommunication (including via an online, digital, or social media\nPage 12\nplatform) that attacks the Company’s products, services, or business policies and/or is intended to undermine the Company’s reputation. The\nExecutive further understands and agrees that this Section 9(b) is a material provision of this Agreement and that any material breach of this\nSection 9(b) shall be a material breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing\nin this Agreement shall prevent the Executive from (i) discussing or disclosing information about unlawful, unethical or improper acts in the\nworkplace, such as harassment or discrimination or any other conduct that the Executive has reason to believe is unlawful, unethical or improper,\n(ii) cooperating in any investigation or providing testimony in legal proceedings (whether administrative or judicial), or (iii) making truthful\nstatements in connection with the Executive’s enforcement of his rights against the Company, whether under contract, statutory, or common law.\nFurther, and consistent with Section 10(b), this Section 9(b) is not intended to prevent Executive from exercising any other rights protected by\nlaw, including the right to communicate with former coworkers and/or third parties about terms and conditions of employment or labor disputes,\nunrelated to the amount of severance pay under this Agreement, when the communication is not so disloyal, reckless, or maliciously untrue as to\nlose the protection of the law.\n(c) Cooperation. The Executive agrees that, for 18 months after the Executive’s date of termination, the Executive shall\nmake himself of herself available at reasonable times, intervals and places for interviews, consultations, internal investigations and/or testimony\nduring which the Executive shall provide to the Company, or its designated attorneys or agents, any and all information known to the Executive\nregarding or relating to the Company or the Executive’s activities on behalf of the Company pertaining to the subject matter on which the\nExecutive’s cooperation is sought.\n10.Miscellaneous.\n(a) Employment At-Will. The Executive agrees and understands that nothing in this Agreement shall change the\nExecutive’s “at-will” employment status or confer any right with respect to continuation of employment with the Company, nor shall it interfere in\nany way with the Executive’s right or the Company’s right to terminate the Executive’s employment at any time, with or without cause, either at\nthe Executive’s or the Company’s option, with or without notice.\n(b) Permitted Disclosures. The Executive understands that nothing contained in this Agreement restricts or limits the\nExecutive’s right to discuss the Executive’s employment or report possible violations of law or regulation with the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission, United States Department of Labor, the National Labor Relations Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or\nother federal government agency or similar state or local agency or to discuss the terms and conditions of the Executive’s employment with others\nto the extent permitted by Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act or to the extent that such disclosure is protected under the applicable\nprovisions of law or regulation, including but not limited to “whistleblower” statutes or other similar provisions that protect such disclosure.\nAdditionally, the Executive understands that, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1833(b), the Executive shall not be held criminally or civilly liable\nunder any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made: (1) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government\nofficial, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, and solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (2)\nin a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. If the Executive files a lawsuit for\nretaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, the Executive may disclose such trade secret to the Executive’s attorney and\nuse the trade secret information in related court proceedings, provided that Employee files any document containing the trade secret information\nunder seal and does not further disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.\nPage 13\n(c) Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by, construed, interpreted, and its validity determined under the laws\nof the state in which the Executive resides (the “Governing Law State”), as applied to agreements entered into and to be fully performed by\nresidents of such Governing Law State. Such law of the Governing Law State shall govern regardless of the forum in which a dispute may be\nadjudicated. Subject to Section 10(d) hereof, all actions or proceedings for injunctive relief arising out of this Agreement shall exclusively be\nheard and determined in state or federal courts in the Governing Law State having appropriate jurisdiction. The parties expressly consent to the\nexclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such action or proceeding and waive any objection to venue therein and any defense of forum non\nconveniens.\n(d) Dispute Resolution. The parties hereby incorporate by reference the Dispute Resolution Agreement into this Agreement\nand agree that any and all disputes arising under this Agreement are subject to and governed by the Dispute Resolution Agreement; provided,\nhowever, that the parties reserve the right to seek temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in court, in which case the parties agree that such\ninjunctive relief shall be granted in court to preserve the status quo pending a resolution on the merits in arbitration. The Executive agrees that in\nconnection with any application for injunctive relief, discovery shall be conducted on an expedited basis. The Executive further agrees that, in\nany proceeding alleging breach of this Agreement, the Company shall have the right to conduct forensic examinations of any computers and/or\nelectronic devices in the Executive’s possession or control, if the Company reasonably believes such devices contain Confidential Information (as\ndefined in the Dispute Resolution Agreement).\n(e) Remedies. The Executive acknowledges that any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement will cause immediate\nand irreparable injury and unquantifiable damage to the Company. If the Executive breaches, or the Company reasonably believes the Executive\nis about to breach, this Agreement, the Executive agrees that the Company is entitled to immediate injunctive relief enforcing the terms of this\nAgreement without the necessity of posting a bond, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity. The Executive and the Company agree\nthat in any legal proceeding to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement of its actual costs and expenses,\nincluding without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.\n(f) Assignment. The Executive agrees that, should the Company be acquired by, merge with, or otherwise combine with\nanother corporation or business entity, the surviving entity will have all rights to enforce the terms of this Agreement as if it were the Company\nitself enforcing the Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive may not assign this Agreement or any part hereof. Any purported\nassignment by the Executive shall be null and void from the initial date of purported assignment.\n(g) Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, then the\nAgreement will be deemed amended to the extent necessary to render the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision, and the rest of the\nAgreement, valid and enforceable. If a court or other adjudicator declines to amend the Agreement, the invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of\nany provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions, which shall be enforced as if the invalid, illegal, or\nunenforceable provision had not been included in this Agreement.\n(h) Waiver. A waiver by the Company of a breach of any provisions of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any\nsubsequent breach, nor shall recourse to any remedy hereunder be a\nPage 14\nwaiver of any other or further relief or remedy. No waiver will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an officer of the Company.\n(i) Entire Agreement. Except as otherwise stated herein, this Agreement, together with the CIAA, the Dispute Resolution\nAgreement and, if applicable, the Offer Letter, set forth the entire agreement and understanding between the Company and the Executive with\nrespect to the subject matter of this Agreement (including but not limited to severance payments and benefits), and supersedes and replaces all\nprior understandings and agreements regarding the same, whether written or oral. This Agreement can only be amended or modified in a writing\nsigned by both parties. Any subsequent change(s) in the Executive’s duties, salary, compensation, or benefits will not affect the validity or scope\nof this Agreement, including the at-will nature of employment as described in Section 10(a). The Company’s and the Executive’s obligations\nunder this Agreement shall survive the termination of Employee’s employment regardless of the manner of such termination. This Agreement\nshall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, personal representatives, successors, assigns,\naffiliated entities, and any party-in-interest.\n(j) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which, when executed by a\nparty to this Agreement shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which counterparts together shall constitute one and the same instrument.\n(k) Notices. Notices and all other communications contemplated by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed\nto have been duly given (i) when personally delivered or (ii) when mailed by U.S. registered or certified mail, return receipt requested and postage\nprepaid, on the third business day after such mailing, or (iii) when sent by express U.S. mail or overnight delivery through a national delivery\nservice (or an international delivery service in the case of an address outside the U.S.) with signature required, on the next business day after such\nsending.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. I'll\nspend some time providing business updates, and outlining our long-term strategic initiative before I turn it over to\nour CFO, Julie Andrews, to cover the specifics of our Q3 results, guidance and our new three-year financial goals.\nThe third quarter represents an important inflection point in this new chapter for Orthofix, including record\nperformances in our U.S. Orthopedics business and in the number of 7D earnouts agreements. We also matched\nour record for the highest number of 7D unit placements in any quarter to date, and keep seeing strong demand\nfor our Spine Fixation products.\nAs shown on slide 5, we continue to deliver above market growth led by strength in our USA markets. The entire\ncompany is focusing on innovation and responsible growth. We had another quarter of strong adjusted EBITDA\nmargin expansion with positive free cash flow of $5.9 million, reaching the significant milestone earlier than we\nexpected. All of this keeps us on a clear course to achieve our 2024 financial targets. Our operating and financial\ndiscipline allows our team to execute on our key growth initiatives, and reinvest in our innovation priorities. I can\nconfidently say that the business fundamentals are excellent and we have positive momentum to continue\nleveraging our strategic advantages in 2025 and beyond.\nOur third quarter net sales results of $196.6 million represents year-over-year growth of 7% on a constant\ncurrencies basis. Growth was led primarily by strength in our U.S. Spine Fixation and Bone Growth Therapies or\nBGT businesses, as well as continued market penetration in U.S. Orthopedics. U.S. Spine Fixation had an\noutstanding quarter and grew 18%, more than triple the market rate with healthy double-digit growth across all\nthree of our franchises, cervical fusion, interbody, and thoracolumbar fixation. Revenue growth was driven by\ncontinued strong market demand of the recently launched Reef and WaveForm interbody products, along with the\nonboarding of new experienced distribution partner.\nMore specifically, our ALIF, Lateral and MIS portfolios all grew in excess of 35%, and significantly outperformed\nthe market due to increased focus on procedural selling. New product introductions are a driving force and\ncontinue to open doors to new surgeons. The combination of our access instrumentation, 7D, our biologic\nportfolio, and the new interbody designs that features Orthofix proprietary advanced surface technologies is\nsupporting our differentiation in the marketplace. We are committed to our surgeon and patients that look to our\ntechnology to increase speed, improve accuracy, and advance outcomes. BGT grew 9% overall, and 13% in\nfracture, further highlighting the benefit of cross-selling in our integrated spine and orthopedics channels.\nWe already hold the number one market share position in BGT spine market, and continue to take share with\nmore than 50% of the growth coming from new customer acquisitions. In addition, investment in the fracture\nmarket sales channel drove 15% growth in BGT fracture with the AccelStim bone growth therapy device\ncontinuing to outperform the market. As a reminder, the fracture market represents an opportunity for more than\n$200 million, and we're still in the very early innings of building our position in the market with a clear goal to\nbecome the number one player. U.S. Orthopedics benefited from strong execution and grew 15%.\n3\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nOrthofix Medical, Inc.\n(OFIX) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 07-Nov-2024\nGrowth was led by the combination of our TrueLok and Fitbone products, as well as growth in the OSCAR\nproduct family, which facilitates the removal of bone cement during joint revision. As a result, I'm happy to report\nthat our U.S. Orthopedics business delivered a record revenue quarter. In Enabling Technologies, we entered into\na record number of 7D FLASH Navigation system earnouts agreements and matched the record for the highest\nnumber of 7D unit placements in any quarter to date. We are leveraging our differentiable platform to create long\nstanding relationships with our surgeon partners. In addition to reiterating our full year 2024 financial guidance,\nwe are also introducing our new 2027 financial targets which reflect our confidence in sustainable growth trends,\nthe strength of our differentiated and expanded product portfolio, which continues to win share, and our\ncommercial strategy and focused execution.\nJulie Andrews will discuss these in detail later in the call. I believe, we are very well positioned to accelerate our\npositive momentum and delivering on our commitment to drive disciplined, profitable growth and innovation, while\nincreasing long-term shareholder value. In summary, I'm pleased with our third quarter performance and remain\noptimistic about the opportunities ahead. It's clear that Orthofix's focus on executing the clear strategy for\nprofitable growth is delivering compelling results, through our focus on bringing to market a comprehensive\nportfolio of transformative solutions and delivering unmatched customer service, which collectively are helping us\ndrive more profitable sales. We have significantly improved our operating and financial position and paved the\nway for sustainable growth.\nAs we look to 2025 and beyond, we plan to build on our progress by; one, further sharpening our commercial\nfocus and discipline for margin expansion; two, continue to innovate our Enabling Technologies platform to\nsupport our renewed focus on spine deformity; and three, ensuring we are well-positioned to create value for our\nshareholders over the long-term. As outlined on slide eight in the presentation, we have continued to successfully\nexecute this transformative agenda, and are now at an inflection point in our journey that is focused on strategic\ninnovation and operational and financial discipline. With our world-class executive leadership team in place and\nreinvigorated by our new vision and mission, it's time to introduce our long-term strategy and financial goals,\nwhich build on our strong foundation and set us on a clear course for profitable growth.\nI would like to provide more detail on the multiple levers and vital few initiatives in our long range plan that we\nbelieve will fuel profitable growth and propel our business forward. These include an innovation focus and\ncontinued development of differentiated products to meet diverse surgeon preferences, commercial strategy\nenhancement to drive deeper market penetration through comprehensive portfolio offerings, technology\nleadership that harness advanced systems for improved surgical outcome efficiencies, emphasis on high quality\nrevenue streams, and operational excellence for growth, sustainability, and disciplined cash flow management\nand strategic financial planning to sustain positive free cash flow.\nAt high level our strategy will capitalize on our clear competitive advantages in addressable markets of\napproximately $15 billion that are outlined on slide 11 and 12, and includes three key components; one, going\ndeeper into existing accounts; two, taking advantage of multiple commercial access points across our product\nportfolio; and three, leveraging our 7D FLASH Navigation system to drive surgeon engagement and build brand\nloyalty. We are poised to unlock the company's full potential in each of these respective markets, with a highly\ncapable team that is ready to execute and deliver on our commitment to disciplined, profitable growth by providing\nlife changing solution and maximizing value creation.\nFirst, referring to spinal implants on slide 13, we believe we are well-positioned to serve over 90% of the spine\nsurgeon's needs with a comprehensive product portfolio, which includes spinal hardware, biologics, and enabling\ntechnology. We also believe that our comprehensive portfolio and steady cadence of innovation will enable us to\nattract top sales talent, increase [indiscernible] (14:18) distributor relationships, and drive stickier relationships\n4\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nOrthofix Medical, Inc.\n(OFIX) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 07-Nov-2024\nwith surgeons and hospital accounts, which we expect to result in incremental product pull-through as well as\nASP lift from mix benefits.\nMoving to slide 14, our BGT business is focused on maximizing our number one market position with the most\ncomprehensive portfolio and most indication of bone growth stimulation devices in the market. We will continue to\nfocus on cross-selling with orthopedics and spine, add new market channels with established sales\nrepresentatives and drive penetration in the fracture market with AccelStim. Our biologics portfolio featured on\nslide 15 is growing from a position of strength. We are a market leader with the number two shares position in\nbiologics, with solutions to enhance the fusion process and promote bone repair, and growth in each of the major\nbone grafting categories. Supported by a strong foundation of long-term clinical research, we will continue to\nleverage opportunities for growth by capturing share with our current biologic offerings in spine and orthopedics.\nNow turning to orthopedics on slide 16. We are redefining the category of limb reconstruction with our unique\nportfolio of solutions that address the most challenging orthopedic conditions in patients of all ages. We are just\nbeginning to expand into the US orthopedics market, which presents incredible growth opportunities given our\nunique and innovative product lines. Our focus is on areas where we can win, particularly in deformity correction,\nlimb restoration and limb lengthening. We have received recent 510(k) clearances for a number of products that\nare now in limited market launch, and are expected to capture additional market share, including the Fitbone\ntransport lengthening nail, the only bone transport nail available in United States.\nFinally, as shown on slide 17, we believe that our 7D FLASH Navigation system represents a unique opportunity\nto drive surgeon and hospital account interest, and growth across our broader Orthofix portfolio. The\nreorganization of our 7D commercial structure under the leadership of our Spine team is already paying\ndividends, as evidenced by the record number of 7D earnouts agreements, a unique placement in 3Q. As the\nworld's first radiation-free machine vision image-guided surgical system, 7D continues to revolutionize spinal\nnavigation, making it faster and more efficient. With the capability for registration mere seconds versus 30\nminutes or more for competitive system and requiring no intraoperative radiation, 7D technology is proving\ncompelling to surgeon.\nWhile we offer both MIS and open surgery solutions, keep in mind that open surgery still represent approximately\n80% of the total current spine interventions, positioning 7D as a key driver of incremental navigator procedure\npenetration. With the evolution of our 7D strategy, we are more confident than ever in its increasingly significant\nrole in our portfolio. This shift will allow our Enabling Technologies team to drive software innovation and enhance\nproduct integration alongside the R&D pipeline as we launch impactful products across all our franchises. We are\nhighly motivated by the opportunity to differentiate ourselves through the combination of our hardware portfolio\nwith our enabling technology platform system.\nSurgeons and their patients remain our primary focus, and we will continue to provide a differentiated, unique\napproach to navigation in the OR. Underpinning our business strategies are significant cross-portfolio commercial\nopportunities that are highlighted on slide 18. The breadth and depth of Orthofix spine and orthopedics offerings\nprovide multiple path to grow the business as sustained above market rates. For example, we are already taking\nadvantage of opportunities to cross-sell our BGT products into spine accounts, as well as introducing spinal\nhardware, biologic and navigation to our spine BGT surgeons. We also have additional opportunities with our\nbiologics and fracture stimulation products through our orthopedics channel.\nOverall, Orthofix is in a great position to capitalize on our recent product launch successes and deliver meaningful\ninnovation to improve outcomes and efficiencies for our surgeon customers and their patients. We remain the\nmarket leaders in Bone Growth Therapies, have a comprehensive market leading biologics portfolio and\n5\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nOrthofix Medical, Inc.\n(OFIX) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 07-Nov-2024\ndifferentiated products in several specialized orthopedic markets, such as complex trauma reconstruction and\nlimb deformity correction. Additionally, our broadened spine portfolio is world-class and is fully supported by the\nhighly differentiated and compelling Enabling Technologies. Looking forward, I believe, we are uniquely\npositioned to accelerate our profitable growth engine, which is reflected in our goals for consistent above-market\ngrowth, improved profitability and positive free cash flow.\nAs shown on slide 21, we intend to invest in differentiated technologies in areas where we can lead and win with\ninnovation. We will take a systematic approach to driving innovation with rigorous allocation of resources to higher\nreturn opportunities. Over the course of our plan, we anticipate investing approximately 8% to 9% of sales each\nyear in R&D which we expect to fuel our regular cadence of meaningful high impact new product launches and\nsupport sustained share capture in our U.S. Spine, U.S. Orthopedic businesses. Turning to slide 23, we believe\nwe can continue to capitalize on a number of axis points that we already have with surgeons to grow the\nbusiness. For example, we see plenty of opportunity to introduce additional products from our portfolio, such as\nBGT, Biologics and 7D, to accounts that already use our spine or orthopedics product.\nThis not only provides us with new entry points and cross-selling opportunities, but also enable us to develop\nstickier surgeon relationships, solidify our presence in the account, and widen our competitive moat. In summary,\nwe have successfully executed and improved our financial and organizational matrix over the last three quarters,\nand we expect the positive momentum to continue. Our new leadership team and the entire company is well-\npositioned to implement our strategic plan and achieve sustainable, profitable growth across the portfolio. We are\non a strong positive trajectory, and I continue to be optimistic as I look forward. Our new financial targets reflect\nour confidence in sustainable growth trends, in our commercial strategy and execution. I believe we are set up\nwell for above market net sales growth, significant EBITDA margin expansion, and improving levels of free cash\nflow generation in 2025 and beyond.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Julie to review our third quarter financial results and outline our new\nfinancial targets.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJulie B. Andrews\nChief Financial Officer, Orthofix Medical, Inc.\nThank you, Massimo, and good morning, everyone. Orthofix had a strong third quarter delivering total company\nnet sales of $196.6 million or 7% constant currency top line growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $19.2 million with\nadjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately $6 million or approximately 250 basis points. I'll now review\nfinancial results for the quarter for each of our business units and then discuss our full year 2024 guidance and\nnew 2027 targets. Bone Growth Therapies revenue grew 9% to $57.9 million in Q3, and 13% in the BGT fracture\nmarket driven by investments in the fracture market sales channel. This growth was driven by above market\nperformance in both the spine and fracture channels. We do expect our BGT growth to remain above market\ngrowth rates, but should moderate somewhat as we move forward in the fourth quarter and beyond.\nKeep in mind, that we hold the number one market position with more than 50% market share in our BGT spine\nbusiness. This unrivaled leadership position coupled with the impact as we anniversary gains from surgeons\nacquired in Q3 and Q4 of last year impacts our ability to maintain the pace of growth that we have been enjoying\nover the past several quarters. We will continue to focus on adding new surgeons and competitive surgeon\nconversions in BGT spine. At the same time, we will also continue our commercial focus in the BGT fracture\nmarket where we are significantly less penetrated and see a substantial opportunity to drive new business with\northopedic surgeons. Global Spinal Implants, Biologics and Enabling Technologies third quarter revenue was\n$108.2 million, with year-over-year growth of 7%. U.S. Spine Fixation revenue grew 18%, over 3 times the market\ngrowth rate, driven by deeper penetration of existing accounts and expansion of our customer base.\n6\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nOrthofix Medical, Inc.\n(OFIX) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 07-Nov-2024\nAs Massimo said earlier, we entered into a record number of 7D FLASH Navigation system earnout agreements\nand match the record for the highest number of 7D unit placements in any quarter to date. Our US biologics\nbusiness grew below the overall market in the third quarter as we accelerated our distributor transformation,\nwhich had a disproportionate impact on our Biologics business. We expect this performance to get back to an\nabove market pace as we continue to focus on new distributor partnerships, cross-selling initiatives, and the\nlaunch of new products such as Osteostrand Plus C and OsteoCove, which were featured at the recent NASS\nmeeting. The global orthopedics business grew 3% in the quarter, led by 15% growth in the US as a result of\nstrong performance across our portfolio, as well as distributor expansion and sales channel investments.\nThe international business declined 2% versus prior year. As we've previously said, due to the nature of this\nbusiness, particularly around the timing and volume of stocking distributor and tender orders, we expect to see\nvariability from quarter-to-quarter in the growth rate. Adjusting for non-recurring tender orders, international sales\nwere in line with market growth. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $19.2 million was driven by the capture of\nmerger-related synergies and driving leverage on sales growth, and represented a 45% drop through on\nincremental revenue dollars. We remain encouraged by these results as we are seeing the impact of merger-\nrelated synergies and our ability to drive leverage on sales growth materialize. From a cash standpoint, our total\ncash balance, including restricted cash at the end of Q3 increased to approximately $32.6 million.\nAs shown on slide 27, our free cash flow generation was $5.9 million in the quarter, a significant improvement\nover the first half of this year. This was a result of higher EBITDA as well as improvements in working capital\nusage. We also announced today that we successfully completed a new $275 million financing to replace our\nexisting credit facility, which will further optimize the company's capital structure to support long-term profitable\ngrowth. Summarized on slide 28, the completion of this refinancing initiative is an important step in Orthofix's\ntrajectory, and provides us with more favorable terms and a lower cost of capital under which we can continue to\ninvest in the growth and evolution of the company. Overall, we are pleased with our third quarter results and our\nperformance to date, which has been characterized by steady improvements throughout the year, including\nsignificant progress in adjusted EBITDA and becoming free cash flow positive, both of which underpin our\nconfidence in our ability to drive long-term profitable growth.\nMoving on to 2024 full year guidance on slide 29. We are maintaining our guidance for full year net sales of $795\nmillion to $800 million, representing implied growth of 6.6% to 7.2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis.\nPlease note, our expectations are based on current foreign exchange rates and do not account for rate changes\nthat may occur through 2024, or contemplate any potential impacts to elective procedures as a result of IV fluid\nshortages or other hurricane-related effects. We are also maintaining our full year 2024 non-GAAP adjusted\nEBITDA of $64 million to $69 million, and expect to be free cash flow positive for the remainder of 2024. For the\nremainder of the year, we expect gross margin, operating expenses, depreciation expense, stock-based\ncompensation expense, interest and other expense, and adjusted EBITDA margin improvement to remain in line\nwith the directional remarks we provided on our second quarter call in August.\nNow, I would like to discuss our new three-year financial targets for 2025 through 2027. These are outlined on\nslide 30. We are still early in our journey focusing on the vital few initiatives Massimo outlined earlier and that we\nbelieve will enhance operational excellence and drive business performance. We also have a strong infrastructure\nin place with plenty of available runway to drive higher margins and profitability across the company. Importantly,\nwe believe these targets build on the positive momentum we've generated, and put us on an accelerated path to\nprofitability with a stronger financial profile to maximize value creation. First, we expect to deliver 6% to 7% net\nsales CAGR from 2025 through 2027. This assumes sustained market demand with weighted average market\n7\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nOrthofix Medical, Inc.\n(OFIX) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 07-Nov-2024\ngrowth of 4% to 5% that includes a negative pricing impact of 1% to 2% and no material change in the\nreimbursement or regulatory environment.\nWe expect mid-teens non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA as a percent of net sales for the full year 2027. This assumes\napproximately 300 basis points of gross margin expansion over the period, capture of about $10 million in\nremaining merger synergies, fixed cost leverage and moderating expense growth. We anticipate positive free\ncash flow generation from 2025 through 2027. This assumes continued adjusted EBITDA improvement, reduction\nin inventory days on hand and improved instrument utilization. With a compelling combination of profitable above\nmarket growth and a stronger financial profile, we believe our focused commercial strategy and broad\ndifferentiated technologies, combined with a robust innovation pipeline and our pace-setting enabling\ntechnologies position us well to achieve these targets and deliver increased value to our shareholders.\nNow, before we open up the call for questions, let me turn it back to Massimo for concluding comments.\nMassimo?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMassimo Calafiore\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Orthofix Medical, Inc.\nThanks, Julie. In closing, I want to express my appreciation to our entire Orthofix team, and our committed\ncommercial partners for their effort in Q3. Their contribution have been instrumental in driving our performance.\nWe have made great progress year-to-date with more than triple the market growth rate in spinal fixation, healthy\ndouble-digit growth across all three of our spine franchises, orthopedics back on track, strong demand for our\nEnabling Technologies, commercial transformation that is very well underway and already paying dividends,\nstrengthening our profitability profile, and reinforcing our commitment to expanding gross margin, growing\nadjusted EBITDA, sustaining positive free cash flow and increasing our liquidity at a better cost.\nI'm confident the building blocks for sustainable, profitable growth and life-changing innovation are in place. We\nare moving forward as one team, and are not letting up on the operational efficiencies, a strategic execution it will\ntake to deliver sustainable, profitable growth across our portfolio, and drive long-term value for surgeons, patients\nand shareholders. I'm confident we have the people, the technology and the strategies to unlock the company's\nfull potential in each of our respective markets, and realize our vision to be the rival partner in med-tech delivering\nexceptional experiences and life-changing solutions.\nOperator, let's now open the line for questions.\n8\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nOrthofix Medical, Inc.\n(OFIX) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 07-Nov-2024\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes Mathew Blackman with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMathew Blackman Q\nAnalyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nGood morning, everybody. Can you hear me okay?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMassimo Calafiore A\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Orthofix Medical, Inc.\nYes.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJulie B. Andrews A\nChief Financial Officer, Orthofix Medical, Inc.\nWe can, Mat.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMathew Blackman Q\nAnalyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nGreat. Thanks for taking the questions. I've got three for you, Julie. Maybe just to start, if we think about the key\nmetrics in the [indiscernible] (35:35), what's going to keep you up most at night between now and 2027, or maybe\nsaid another way, where's the biggest list to get to those targets? And then I got a couple of follow-ups.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJulie B. Andrews A\nChief Financial Officer, Orthofix Medical, Inc.\nWell, Mat, we are confident in our ability to hit these targets. Of course, we've always got to work with in the\nmarket we're working within. So market growth and what the market is doing will be a key thing that we'll keep our\neye on. But we're confident in our ability to deliver our mid-teens adjusted EBITDA and positive free cash flow.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMathew Blackman Q\nAnalyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nOkay. Good. That's a good segway on that mid-teens EBITDA by 2027. Should we think about that as a milepost\nor a final goalpost? I think standalone Orthofix got the roughly 20% EBITDA back in the day. Is that still\nstructurally feasible over time? Is that still a structurally feasible target over time?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJulie B. Andrews A\nChief Financial Officer, Orthofix Medical, Inc.\nYeah. I would view this as a milestone, not a goalpost. Of course, we're not going beyond 2027 in our guidance,\nand the construct of Orthofix is different than what it was historically when it was at 20%. But we don't believe that\nthe mid-teens number is a stopping point.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMathew Blackman Q\nAnalyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nGreat. And then my final question, just how are you thinking about the magnitude of outyear cash generation? Are\nyou targeting any sort of cash conversion metric? Are you comping yourself against any of your peers that we\n9\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nOrthofix Medical, Inc.\n(OFIX) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 07-Nov-2024\nshould use as a proxy? Just any sense of how you're thinking about the magnitude of cash generation over the\nnext several years.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJulie B. Andrews A\nChief Financial Officer, Orthofix Medical, Inc.\nYeah. I think that, I mean, we're looking at it internally in terms of cash conversion. We didn't go out with that as a\nmetric and a target because we do want to maintain optionality to make strategic investments if we need to or feel\nlike it's going to move the needle for us. Things like, potentially in-sourcing manufacturing and those types of\nthings that may come with a little bit higher cash burn. But that is something we are focused on. And at the right\ntime, we'll provide that as we dial in a little bit more.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMathew Blackman Q\nAnalyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nAll right. Thank you so much.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJulie B. Andrews A\nChief Financial Officer, Orthofix Medical, Inc.\nSure. Thank you, Mat.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJulie Dewey A\nChief Investor Relations and Communications Officer, Orthofix Medical, Inc.\nOperator, we're ready for the next question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Ryan Zimmerman from BTIG. Please go ahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nQ\nHi, everyone. Good morning. This is [ph] Izzy (38:00) on for Ryan. So thank you for taking the questions. I was\njust hoping to stay on the long range plan if we can. So just to start out, I was wondering if you guys can talk a\nlittle bit about what's going to allow you to sustain above market growth rates in each of the segments as we go\nthrough the long range plan.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJulie B. Andrews A\nChief Financial Officer, Orthofix Medical, Inc.\nSure. Thank you [ph] Izzy (38:20) for the question. So I think, if you think about where we stand, I'm going to start\nwith spine from a market share perspective in the US, we are a 3% market share player. With the strength of our\nportfolio and our Enabling Technologies, we believe that we have an opportunity to outgrow, outpace market\ngrowth at an accelerated rate. So that's one key. Then as we move to the orthopedics business, we're in a similar\nposition in the US where the split of the business between international and US is approximately 70% of our\nbusiness is outside the US. And again, we see an opportunity to focus on limb reconstruction, really creating a\nsegment, and take outsized share and create a market within that, within the U.S. Orthopedics business. So I\nwould point to those as two of our key drivers in terms of our growth going to market in our long range plan.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMassimo Calafiore A\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Orthofix Medical, Inc.\n10\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nOrthofix Medical, Inc.\n(OFIX) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 07-Nov-2024\nYeah. And [ph] Izzy (39:16), if you see, we are creating a lot of strength on our P&L, and this will allow us to keep\ninvesting in innovation. I think that the platform that we have is becoming pretty wide, and having 7D as an anchor\ncan make us one of the leading company on enabling tech. So I think that we have all the building blocks to keep\ngrowing above market rates.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nQ\nVery helpful. Thank you both. And then, Julie, I heard your commentary around the assumptions that are going\ninto the adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. But I was just wondering what the actual drivers will be, or if you\ncould provide any more color on that, especially when we consider where the Street is currently modeling top line\ngrowth through 2027. What margin levers can you guys pull on to help get to that mid-teens?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJulie B. Andrews A\nChief Financial Officer, Orthofix Medical, Inc.\nYes. So one of the key drivers is gross margin expansion. So we have opportunity there as the companies came\ntogether, there's some friction that we're working through and some opportunities that we have in terms of\nsourcing our product and distribution that will improve our gross margins over time. We have additional merger-\nrelated synergies to capture. And then finally, in terms that we have scale on, our G&A costs that will not grow at\nthe same pace of revenue, and then leverage overall from our higher revenue number that will be able to drop\nthrough a higher, a good amount of that incremental revenue to EBITDA.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nQ\nOkay. Thanks for taking the questions.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: And your next question comes from Jason Wittes from Roth. Please go ahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJason Wittes Q\nAnalyst, Roth Capital Partners, LLC\nHi. Thanks for taking the questions and I appreciate the long-term guidance here. In terms of 7D, could you kind\nof give us a sense of who the main customers are for that, and how they're using it right now, and how you expect\nthey'll be using it in the future?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMassimo Calafiore A\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Orthofix Medical, Inc.\nYeah. So our main customer, so 7D can be used as both in brain and spine. But I think that our major customers\nare focusing on utilization into spine. 7D has been created at the beginning to be used on open surgery. And\nremember, open surgery represents right now still 80% of the market, but we're doing a lot of progress also in\ndeveloping our MIS solution, which is giving us the opportunity to create a footprint on the ASC. So from the\nmarket penetration perspective, you see the demand keep increasing because the way our 7D can be utilized, it's\nkeep increasing. In the future, and as said, we're going to be focused on keep developing our synergistic\napproach between implant and 7D to be used in deformity.\nAnd deformity is going to be one of the key drivers for our expansion into spine. And we can do proprietary things\nthat we're going to talk about in the future, that are going to create the uniqueness around the opportunity of 7D.\nBut overall, we are very pleased about the demand that we're seeing today, mostly driven by the fact that there's\n11\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nOrthofix Medical, Inc.\n(OFIX) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 07-Nov-2024\nan actual utilization of the device in the OR. So we will save time, the ability to have a registration done in less\nthan a minute is very important, especially in a moment where time in the OR, OR utilization is pivotal for many\nsurgeons. So again, very pleased about where we are with the platform. And this is just the beginning for us.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJason Wittes Q\nAnalyst, Roth Capital Partners, LLC\nSounds great. Okay. Thank you. And the question for Julie, if I heard correctly, you mentioned guidance is\nexclusive of hurricane and Ivy shortage impact. Did I hear that correctly or, and related to that, do we expect any\nimpact from those items?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJulie B. Andrews A\nChief Financial Officer, Orthofix Medical, Inc.\nYes. You did hear that correctly. And at this point, we're not seeing any impact from those items.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJason Wittes Q\nAnalyst, Roth Capital Partners, LLC\nOkay. Thanks for the clarification. And then maybe another clarification, I guess, I have no doubt you guys can\ngrow above market growth, especially in spinal implants. Did you specify kind of where you think your growth\nmight land? I mean, clearly above market, I think, that's almost a given your portfolio and your position, et cetera.\nBut did you specify kind of where you think it might land relative to that sort of 3% to 4% market growth, which is\nkind of the normalized growth?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJulie B. Andrews A\nChief Financial Officer, Orthofix Medical, Inc.\nYes, Jason, we said 6% to 7% CAGR over three-year time period. Yes.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJason Wittes Q\nAnalyst, Roth Capital Partners, LLC\nOkay. Thank you again for that clarification. Okay. Thank you all. Again, I appreciate the guidance or the outlook\nfor 2027. I'll jump back in queue.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJulie B. Andrews A\nChief Financial Officer, Orthofix Medical, Inc.\nThanks, Jason.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJulie Dewey A\nChief Investor Relations and Communications Officer, Orthofix Medical, Inc.\nOperator, we're ready for the next question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time.

Business\nIn this Annual Report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “Orthofix,” and “the Company” refer to the combined operations of Orthofix\nMedical Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates, unless the context requires otherwise.\nCompany Overview\nOrthofix is a leading global spine and orthopedics company with a comprehensive portfolio of biologics, innovative spinal hardware,\nbone growth therapies, specialized orthopedic solutions, and a leading surgical navigation system. Its products are distributed in\nmore than 60 countries worldwide.\nThe Company is headquartered in Lewisville, Texas and has primary offices in Carlsbad, CA, with a focus on spine and biologics\nproduct innovation and surgeon education, and Verona, Italy, with an emphasis on product innovation, production, and medical\neducation for orthopedics. The combined company’s global research and development, commercial and manufacturing footprint\nalso includes facilities and offices in Irvine, CA, Toronto, Canada, Sunnyvale, CA, Wayne, PA, Olive Branch, MS, Maidenhead, UK,\nMunich, Germany, Paris, France, and São Paulo, Brazil.\nThe Company was founded in Verona, Italy in 1980 and formally incorporated in 1987 in Curaçao as “Orthofix International N.V.” In\n2018, we completed a change in our jurisdiction of organization from Curaçao to the State of Delaware (the “Domestication”) and\nchanged our name to “Orthofix Medical Inc.” As a result, we are a corporation existing under the laws of the State of Delaware.\nThe merger with SeaSpine was completed on January 5, 2023, via an all-stock merger of equals with SeaSpine continuing as a wholly-\nowned subsidiary of Orthofix following the transaction (the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, each share of SeaSpine common\nstock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger was converted into the right to receive 0.4163 shares of\nOrthofix common stock. The shares of common stock of Orthofix, as the corporate parent entity in the combined company\nstructure, continue to trade on NASDAQ under the symbol \"OFIX\".\nAvailable Information and Orthofix Website\nOur filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on\nForm 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements for Meetings of Shareholders, any registration statements, and\namendments to those reports, are available free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with,\nor furnished to, the SEC. Information contained in our website or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this\nAnnual Report. Our website is located at www.orthofix.com. Our SEC filings are also available on the SEC website at www.sec.gov.\nBusiness Segments\nOrthofix manages the business by two reporting segments, Global Spine and Global Orthopedics, which account for 85% and 15% of\nour total net sales in 2023, respectively. The chart below presents reported net sales, which includes product sales and marketing\nservice fees, by reporting segment for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\n4\nFinancial information regarding our reportable business segments and certain geographic information is included in Part II, Item 7 of\nthis Annual Report under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and\nNote 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nGlobal Spine\nWithin the Global Spine segment, we provide implantable medical devices, biologics, enabling technologies, and other regenerative\nsolutions which aim to restore the quality of life of patients suffering from diseases and traumas of the spine. We offer a variety of\ntreatment solutions that uniquely incorporate multiple treatment modalities, such as mechanical, biological, and electromagnetic\nmodes, to achieve desired clinical outcomes.\nGlobal Spine Strategy\nOur strategy for the Global Spine segment is to drive business growth through organic and inorganic innovation, physician\ncollaboration, and partnerships with dedicated and high-performing commercial sales channels. Growth initiatives include:\n• A regular cadence of new and differentiated product launches supporting our spine implant and enabling technologies,\nbiologics, and bone growth therapies portfolios\n• Ongoing, global sales channel optimization and expansion\n• Reinforcement of our bone growth stimulation business through the collection and dissemination of clinical evidence, and\nthe delivery of new and novel value-added services\n• Conducting clinical research to support and broaden our spine implant, biologics, and bone growth stimulation portfolios\n• Acquiring or licensing products, technologies, and companies to further expand and enhance our spine portfolio\n• Invest in the further development of our pre-clinical and clinical programs designed to generate peer-reviewed scientific\nevidence in support of our products\n• Attracting, developing, and retaining key talent\nGlobal Spine Principal Products\nThe Global Spine reporting segment is largely represented by two principal product categories, (i) Bone Growth Therapies and (ii)\nSpinal Implants, Biologics, and Enabling Technologies. Each of these product categories, and their significant components, are\nfurther described below:\nBone Growth Therapies\nWithin the Bone Growth Therapies product category, we manufacture, distribute, and provide support services for market-leading\nbone growth stimulation devices that enhance bone fusion. These class III medical devices are indicated as an adjunctive,\nnoninvasive treatment to improve fusion success rates in the cervical and lumbar spine as well as a therapeutic treatment for non-\nspinal, appendicular fractures that have not healed (\"nonunions\"). Several devices in our portfolio utilize our patented pulsed\nelectromagnetic field (“PEMF”) technology, the safety and efficacy of which is supported by basic mechanism of action data in the\nscientific literature, as well as published data from level one randomized controlled clinical trials. A new addition to our stimulation\nportfolio utilizes our low intensity pulsed ultrasound (\"LIPUS\"), a technology also supported by strong basic science and published\nclinical literature. Orthofix is the only manufacturer which offers both PEMF and LIPUS technologies. We sell these products almost\nexclusively in the U.S., using distributors and direct sales representatives to provide our devices to healthcare providers and their\npatients.\nSpinal Implants\nWithin Spinal Implants, we design, develop, and market a portfolio of motion preservation and fixation implant products for broad\nspectrum use throughout the entire spinal column. Such products are typically used to facilitate fusion in degenerative, minimally\ninvasive, and complex spinal deformity procedures throughout the lumbar, thoracic, sacral, and cervical regions of the spine. We\ndistribute these products globally through a network of distributors and sales representatives to sell spine products to facilities that\nconduct spine care, including hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers (\"ASC\"), and out-patient hospitals.\n5\nEnabling Technologies\nWithin Enabling Technologies, we design, develop, and market a portfolio of navigation technologies including tracked surgical tools,\nintelligent software and imaging equipment based on Machine-Vision and optical innovations. Specifically, our 7D FLASH Navigation\nSystem with 7D Technology has redefined image guided surgery, delivering a navigation platform with meaningful benefits in spine\nand cranial procedures. The speed, accuracy, workflow efficiency, and intraoperative radiation-free safety profile of the 7D FLASH\nNavigation System delivers significant economic value, while eliminating the long-standing frustrations and challenges of traditional\nimage guided navigation systems. We distribute these products globally through a network of direct sales representatives and\ndistributors to facilitate pediatric, adolescent, and adult procedures in hospitals, ASCs, and out-patient facilities.\nBiologics\nWithin the Biologics product category, we offer a portfolio of bone graft substitutes intended to address the key elements of bone\nregeneration that allow physicians to successfully treat a variety of spinal, orthopedic, and dental conditions. Our Biologics portfolio\nincludes fiber-based and particulate demineralized bone matrices (\"DBMs\"), cellular bone allografts, collagen ceramic matrices, and\nsynthetic bone void fillers in various forms with supporting graft delivery solutions to address a wide range of clinical applications.\nDistributed globally through a network of distributors and sales representatives, our portfolio is a mix of internally manufactured\ntissues and products as well as marketed tissue forms provided by MTF Biologics. The breadth of the product offering and data-\nsupported product lines position us with greater access to facilities, including group purchasing organizations (\"GPOs\")/integrated\ndelivery networks (\"IDNs\"), hospitals, and ASCs.\nThe following table and discussion identify our principal Global Spine products by trade name and describe their primary\napplications:\nBone Growth Therapies Products\nProduct Primary Application\nCervicalStim Spinal Fusion Therapy PEMF non-invasive cervical spinal fusion therapy used to enhance bone\ngrowth\nSpinalStim Spinal Fusion Therapy PEMF non-invasive lumbar spinal fusion therapy used to enhance bone\ngrowth\nPhysioStim Bone Healing Therapy PEMF non-invasive appendicular skeleton healing therapy used to enhance\nbone growth in nonunion fractures\nAccelStim LIPUS healing therapy used to enhance bone growth in certain fresh, distal\nradius, and tibial diaphysis fractures and nonunion fractures\nSpinal Implants and Enabling Technologies Products\nPrimary Application Product\nPosterior Spinal Fixation Procedures Pedicle screw systems for open and MIS procedures and adult deformity\nprocedures featuring modular technology and accompanying instrumentation\ndesigned to reduce the number of trays needed for surgery and that provides\nsurgeons with multiple intra-operative options to facilitate posterior lumbar\nfixation. We also provide powerful instrumented compression and distraction\nof the spine. Products include our Mariner, Firebird, Firebird NXG, Janus,\nDaytona, Newport, and Phoenix product lines. These brands also include\nseveral different screw types including, cannulated, fenestrated, HA coated,\nand cortical cancellous. These options give surgeons a full portfolio of choices\nfor their patients without having to utilize several different screw systems.\nArtificial Cervical Disc Replacement Procedures Our next-generation artificial disc, M6-C artificial cervical disc, developed to\nreplace an intervertebral disc damaged by cervical disc degeneration is the\nonly artificial cervical disc that mimics the anatomic structure of a natural disc\nby incorporating an artificial viscoelastic nucleus and fiber annulus into its\ndesign.\n6\nArtificial Lumbar Disc Replacement Procedures Our next-generation artificial disc, M6-L artificial cervical disc, developed to\nreplace an intervertebral disc damaged by lumbar disc degeneration; the only\nartificial lumbar disc that mimics the anatomic structure of a natural disc by\nincorporating an artificial viscoelastic nucleus and fiber annulus into its\ndesign. (Not available in the U.S.)\nAnterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (\"ALIF\") A complete portfolio of ALIF products, including interbody spacers, disc\nProcedures preparation instruments, access systems, and plating/ fixation options. Our\nspacers come in a variety of material options including PEEK, PEEK Titanium\ncomposite (\"PTC\"), and 3D printed Titanium. Some of our product also\ncontain U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") cleared Nano surface\ntechnology (\"Nanovate\") that is scientifically proven to upregulate osteogenic\nfactors in vitro. The multiple material types allow surgeons to select the\nmaterial best for their patients, and they come in a variety of footprints and\nlordotic options. The interbodies come with a large graft area to\naccommodate the addition of biologics to aid in the fusion process. Some of\nour interbodies include integrated fixation to eliminate the need for\nadditional fixation. These options provide a complete list of options for the\nALIF procedural category. Our main contributors to this category include\nMeridian, Waveform A, Reef A, and Pillar SA PTC.\nPosterior Cervical Fixation Procedures We provide spinal fixation systems with novel instrumentation and\nanatomically designed implants to provide a safe and effective solution\ndesigned to improve surgical flow when navigating through complex posterior\ncervical procedures. These products include a wide array of screws, rods, and\ninstruments to aid surgeons in performing these procedures. Our products\ninclude Northstar OCT and Centurion.\nPosterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (\"PLIF\")/ Our PLIF/TLIF portfolio includes a variety of interbodies as well as several disc\nTransforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (\"TLIF\") prep and access options. The interbodies come in both straight and curved\nProcedures footprints to accommodate surgeons in placement of the interbodies, and a\nchoice of materials from PEEK, PEEK Titanium Composite and 3D printed\nTitanium. Some of our product also contain FDA cleared Nanovate that is\nscientifically proven to upregulate osteogenic factors in vitro. Our main\nproducts in the static PLIF/TLIF interbodies are Waveform TA/TO, Reef TA/TO,\nand Forza. Our straight product category contains both traditional static\ninterbodies as well as expandable options. These options include both our\nForza XP and Explorer TO product lines. These expandable options allow\nsurgeons to minimize their exposure and expand the interbody in-situ to the\npreferred height and lordosis that best suits their patient. To aid in access we\nalso offer several retractor options with our latest screw-based retractor\ncalled Fathom. These retractors paired with our posterior disc prep options\ncompletes a surgeon’s need for all PLIF/TLIF procedures.\nLateral Lumbar Interbody Fusion (\"LLIF\") Procedures The LLIF portfolio includes a full portfolio of interbodies, additional fixation\noptions, retractor access systems and disc prep instrumentation.

These\ninterbodies can be paired with the Regatta plate to provide auxiliary fixation\nduring the LLIF procedure. The Lattus Retractor is our newest market leading\naccess retractor providing surgeons the ability to access the disc space and\nconduct the LLIF procedure. This pairs seamlessly with several lateral disc\nprep options that aid surgeons in completing their discectomy prior to\ninterbody placement.\nAnterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (\"ACDF\") The ACDF portfolio includes interbodies with and without integrated fixation\nProcedures and plating systems to provide fixation of the anterior cervical spine. Like the\nrest of our portfolio our cervical interbodies come in a wide variety of\n7\nfootprints and lordotic options as well as material options giving surgeons the\nability of choice to accommodate their patient populations. Our top\nproducing cervical interbodies include, Waveform C, and Construx brands.\nThe Shoreline product brand provides the ability to turn interbodies without\nintegrated fixation into fixated spacers reducing time surgeons spend in the\noperating room and making it seamless to fixate interbodies into the disc\nspace. When selecting an interbody without fixation an anterior cervical plate\nis needed. Our top brands of cervical plates are Admiral and Cetra. In addition\nto these options, we also offer several different disc and endplate preparation\noptions to satisfy the ACDF procedure.\nRevision Surgical Procedures As an adjunct to our posterior lumbar fixation portfolio, we offer two main\nproducts, Mariner Outrigger and Connectors, that are designed to help\nsurgeons tackle difficult revision cases. These sets are constructed with an\nindustry leading number of connectors, specially designed rods, and\ninstruments to aid in these cases. Giving surgeons a tremendous number of\noptions is the key to the success of these sets.\nSI Fusion Procedures Firebird SI is a minimally invasive screw system that is intended for fixation of\nsacroiliac joint disruptions in skeletally mature patients. This has and\ncontinues to be a product differentiator as many competitors do not offer SI\nfixation options. Firebird SI is one of the only 3D printed Titanium products on\nthe market and the only 3D printed product that also has Nanotechnology\nclaims with our Nanovate technology.\nOther procedures: Corpectomy, Laminoplasty, Jazz Outside of the main spinal procedural categories we also offer several\nBands products in areas such as corpectomy (VuMesh), laminoplasty (Newbridge),\nand a unique product, Jazz Bands.

These non-invasive\nportable devices are intended to be used as part of a home treatment program prescribed by a physician.\nWe offer two spinal fusion therapy devices: the SpinalStim and CervicalStim devices. Our stimulation products use a PEMF\ntechnology designed to enhance the growth of bone tissue following surgery and are placed externally over the site to be healed.\nResearch data shows that our PEMF signal induces mineralization and results in a process that stimulates new regeneration at the\nspinal fusion site. Some spine fusion patients are at greater risk of not achieving a solid fusion of new bone around the fusion site.\nThese patients typically have one or more risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, or diabetes, or their surgery involves the revision of\na failed fusion or the fusion of multiple levels of vertebrae in one procedure. For these patients, post-surgical bone growth therapy\nhas been shown to significantly increase the probability of fusion success.\nThe SpinalStim device is a non-invasive spinal fusion stimulator system designed for the treatment of the lumbar region of the spine.\nThe device uses proprietary technology and a wavelength to generate a PEMF signal. The FDA has approved the SpinalStim system\nas a spinal fusion adjunct to increase the probability of fusion success and as a non-operative treatment for salvage of failed spinal\nfusion at least nine months post-operatively.\nOur CervicalStim product remains the only FDA-approved bone growth stimulator on the market indicated for use as an adjunct to\ncervical spine fusion surgery. It is indicated for patients at high-risk for non-fusion.\nThe SpinalStim and CervicalStim systems are accompanied by an application for mobile devices called STIM onTrack. The mobile app\nincludes a first-to-market feature that enables physicians to remotely view patient adherence to prescribed treatment protocols and\n9\npatient reported outcome measures. Designed for use with smartphones and other mobile devices, the STIM onTrack tool helps\npatients follow their prescription with daily treatment reminders and a device usage calendar. The app is free and available through\nthe Android and Apple App Stores.\nBone Growth Therapies — Orthopedic Therapy\nOur PhysioStim bone healing therapy products use PEMF technology similar to that used in our spine stimulators. The primary\ndifference is that the PhysioStim devices are designed for use on the appendicular skeleton.\nA bone’s regenerative power results in most fractures healing naturally within a few months. However, in the presence of certain\nrisk factors, some fractures do not heal or heal slowly, resulting in nonunions. Traditionally, orthopedists have treated such\nnonunion conditions surgically, often by means of a bone graft with fracture fixation devices, such as bone plates, screws, or\nintramedullary rods. These are examples of “invasive” treatments. Our patented PhysioStim bone healing therapy products are\ndesigned to use a low level of PEMF signals to noninvasively activate the body’s natural healing process. The devices are\nanatomically designed, allowing ease of placement, patient mobility, and the ability to cover a large treatment area.\nSimilar to our SpinalStim and CervicalStim systems, the PhysioStim device is also accompanied by the STIM onTrack mobile app,\nenabling physicians treating patients with nonunion fractures to remotely view and assess patient adherence to prescribed\ntreatment protocols and patient reported outcome measures.\nThe AccelStim device provides a safe and effective nonsurgical treatment to improve nonunion fracture healing and accelerate the\nhealing of indicated fresh fractures. The device stimulates the bone’s natural healing process through LIPUS waves to the fracture\nsite.\nSpinal Implants — Motion Preservation Solutions\nOur M6-C cervical and M6-L lumbar artificial discs are used to treat patients suffering from degenerative disc disease of the spine.\nThe M6 discs are the only FDA-approved artificial discs that mimic the anatomic structure of a natural disc by incorporating an\nartificial viscoelastic nucleus and fiber annulus into their design. Like a natural disc, this unique construct allows for shock absorption\nat the implanted level, as well as provides a controlled range of motion when the spine transitions in its combined complex\nmovements. Both discs have European Commission CE mark approval and in February 2019, we received FDA approval of the M6-C\nartificial cervical disc to treat patients with a single-level cervical disc degeneration. We released the M6-C artificial cervical disc in\nthe U.S. in 2019 through a controlled market launch accompanied by an extensive training and education curriculum for surgeons. In\naddition, we have initiated a U.S. 2-level investigational device exemption (“IDE”) study for the M6-C artificial cervical disc, which is\ncurrently enrolling.\nSpinal Implants — Spinal Fixation Solutions\nWe provide a wide range of implants and fixation products for use in spinal surgery, and we cover the entire spine from occiput to\nsacrum. See below for a discussion of our portfolio based on the segmentation of our internal franchise groups:\nCervical\nOur cervical portfolio includes fixation, interbodies, plates, and motion preservation devices. Our interbody spacer brands\nand materials include PTC, Waveform, Reef, and Nanovate 3D printed titanium surface technologies. Each coming with\ndifferent material, clinical, and handling characteristics that can be options for clinicians to make the proper choice for their\npatients. Some of our spacers also have the option for integrated fixation which eliminates the necessity for additional\nfixation. In addition to our spacers, our surgical grade titanium plating systems, Admiral and Cetra, allow for anterior\nfixation of the cervical spine. Lastly, for posterior fixation we offer two systems, Northstar OCT and Centurion, as well as a\nlaminoplasty system, Newbridge. These systems are comprehensive systems comprised of rods, connectors, and screws\nthat are implanted for posterior fixation.\n10\nInterbody\nOur robust interbody group has options for every approach vector, including anterior lumbar, posterior lumbar, and lateral.\nWithin each group there are several material types, including a thermoplastic compound called PEEK, 3D printed titanium\nwith FDA approved Nanotechnology claims, and two different composites, Nanometalene and PTC, comprised of both PEEK\nand titanium. Our anterior lumbar portfolio has several different footprints and lordotic options as well as options for\nintegrated fixation or plating. These brands include Waveform A, Reef A, Pillar SA PTC, Unity Lumbosacral Plating, and\nMeridian. Our lateral portfolio takes full advantage of our top-of-the-line retractor systems to gain access to the disc space.\nThe lateral portfolio is complete with the highly competitive footprints and plating options as well. These brands include\nSkyhawk, Regatta L, and Waveform L, which are utilized in direct lateral, prone lateral, and anterior to the psoas\nprocedures. Our posterior portfolio, utilized for PLIF and TLIF procedures, has two key segmentations, static and\nexpandable. Our expandable posterior interbodies allow for a smaller incision and smaller exposure that then expands to\ncreate or fill the space of the disc space. Our expandable brands are Forza XP, our top performing interbody implant, and\nExplorer TO. In the static posterior interbodies, we have several brands serving all material types and offering both straight\nand curved footprints to aid in posterior procedures. Our brands are Forza, Forza PTC, Forza Ti, Waveform TA/TO, and Reef\nTA/TO.\nThoracolumbar\nIn our thoracolumbar franchise we have a complete line of fixation products for degenerative spinal conditions, as well as\nfor complex deformity, midline, and revision cases. Our posterior brands are all modular, meaning surgeons have the option\nto select from several different screw shank varieties including, cannulated, fenestrated, HA coated, cortical cancellous, and\na traditional dual lead option. This allows the surgeon to maintain the instrumentation of the parent system, but then select\nthe proper screw shank for the patient, offering maximum clinical value. The Firebird/ Firebird NXG, Phoenix, and Mariner\nbrands are available for open or minimally invasive procedures and have options such as connectors, mono axial screws,\nand many more instrumentation options to aid in a variety of cases. Also within this franchise group is our SI fixation\nproduct, Firebird SI, the first 3D printed SI fixation product and one of the only with Nanotechnology claims.\nEnabling Technologies\nOur machine vision 7D FLASH navigation platform is used in a variety of posterior spinal procedures, including degenerative,\ndeformity, tumor, trauma, and revision surgery. The platform can be utilized in MIS/percutaneous, mini-open, or open techniques.\nThe technology also offers a comprehensive cranial platform for use in cranial neurosurgery.\nOur innovative 7D FLASH Navigation System with 7D Technology delivers a comprehensive navigation platform that utilizes visible\nlight, machine-vision cameras, and intelligent software algorithms to create a 3D image within seconds for surgical navigation. The\nnovel technology allows for a fast image reconstruction for surgical navigation with no disruption to surgeon workflow and\neliminates radiation exposure during the procedure to the patient, surgeon, and operating room staff.\nOur Spine Module is our leading product in the FLASH Navigation Portfolio with over 130 installations globally. Our recent launch of\nthe FLASH Percutaneous Module has reached over 25 installations in the US. In 2023, we further enhanced the FLASH Percutaneous\nModule to include preplanning features, as well as integrating fixation systems such as Mariner MIS Posterior Fixation System,\nPhoenix MIS Posterior Fixation System, and the Fathom Pedicle Based Retractor System. Multiple new spinal reference frame\nfixation options were also launched in 2023 to accommodate spinal fusion procedures from cervical spine to pelvis. Further\nenhancements and new features to the Spine Module and Percutaneous Module are in development and are expected to launch in\n2024.\nIn addition to these new products focused on spine, the FLASH Navigation Portfolio also includes our Cranial Module for use in\ncranial surgeries. The technology uses a completely contactless workflow, acquiring hundreds of thousands of virtual fiducials using\nthe patient’s own anatomy, and results in nearly instantaneous cranial registrations to the skin or skull in almost any surgical\nposition. In 2024, we anticipate the commercial launch of FLASH EVD (“Extra Ventricular Drainage”), a new mobile bed-side\nnavigational system leveraging 7D Technology designed for fast and reliable EVD placement. Initial cadaveric testing has been\ncompleted and FLASH EVD is currently under regulatory review.\nBiologics — Regenerative Solutions\nOur biologics portfolio is focused on best-in-class bone grafting solutions from each of the major bone grafting categories - cellular\nallografts, DBMs, and synthetics. The breadth of the portfolio within each segment allows for a consultative approach with both\nphysicians and hospitals to determine the best product based on clinical performance and price.\n11\nOur largest portfolio of products is within DBMs, which includes both putty and fiber-based forms that provide different handling\nand performance based on clinical applications. Leading this portfolio are Strand Plus, 100% DMB Fiber with Accell, Evo3/Evo3c, and\nDBM putty with Accell. ABM is a key differentiator within the DBM market. This internally processed, proprietary technology is an\nopen structured, dispersed form of DBM, which increases the bioavailability of bone proteins at an earlier time in the healing\ncascade. When combined with traditional DBM, it provides a biphasic release of growth factors to promote healing.\nOur cellular allografts portfolio features a market-leading graft with Trinity Elite and our newly released Virtuous Lyograft, both co-\nbranded with MTF biologics. Trinity Elite, an allograft with viable cells, continues to be a market leader due to the long-standing\nclinical supported through various clinical studies. Virtuous Lyograft is particularly unique in that it is a first-of-its-kind, shelf-stable\ncellular allograft for spine and orthopedic procedures provided in a room-temperature, ready-to-use, moldable form.\nRegarding synthetic solutions, our focus products are Cove and Mozaik. Cove, an advanced bioactive synthetic, is the newest\nintroduction into this segment. Cove has a unique surface topography of the β-TCP and HA granule and has demonstrated the ability\nto grow bone in a muscle pouch. Additionally, Cove has handling characteristics ideal for ensuring graft placement remains where it\nis needed. The combination of Cove and Mozaik provides different value options within this portfolio to meet varying customer\nneeds.\nIn addition to each of the major categories, Orthofix has continued to invest in products that address specific procedural and clinical\nneeds. Our solutions address many of the issues that physicians see with graft delivery and containment within the surgical site.\nSeveral of our solutions address this through handling characteristics of product, shape and design, instrumentation to aid delivery,\nor even added materials to aid in graft containment. All of these solutions are to improve the ease of use and consistency of our\nproducts while driving better clinical outcomes.\nWe receive marketing fees through our collaboration with MTF for the Virtuous, Trinity Elite, FiberFuse, and certain other tissues.\nMTF processes the tissues, maintains inventory, and invoices hospitals, surgery centers, and other points of care for service fees,\nwhich are submitted by customers via purchase orders. We have exclusive worldwide rights to market the Virtuous and Trinity Elite,\nand exclusive rights to market the FiberFuse tissues in the U.S.\nOur other leading tissue forms and synthetics such as, Strand Plus, Strand, Evo3, Evo3c, Ballast, Cove, and Mozaik are all processed\ninternally through IsoTis Orthobiologics. This completely integrated business unit allows for a continuous feedback cycle with\nresearch and development, marketing, manufacturing, and quality to ensure high-quality products delivered with consistent\ncustomer fulfillment.\nTo date, our Biologics products are offered primarily in the U.S. market due in part to restrictions on providing U.S. human donor\ntissue and bovine collagen in certain countries.\nGlobal Spine Future Product Applications\nWe remain very active with multiple internal developments to support future, new technology commercialization efforts. These new\ntechnologies will apply to both the cervical and thoracolumbar spinal anatomy. We expect that the contribution of new, internally\ndeveloped technologies and undefined external acquisitions will be the primary driver of future growth. In addition, we also have\ninitiated a U.S. 2-Level IDE study for the M6-C artificial cervical disc.\nRegarding our Bone Growth Therapy business, we have participated in research at the Wake Forest University Health Sciences,\nChinese University of Hong Kong, and University of California San Francisco, where scientists conducted animal and cellular studies\nto identify the mechanisms of action of our PEMF signals on bone, cartilage, meniscus, nerve, and efficacy of healing. From these\nefforts, some studies have been published in peer-reviewed journals. Among other insights, the studies illustrate positive effects of\nPEMF on callus formation and bone strength, meniscus and nerve injury repair, as well as proliferation and differentiation of cells\ninvolved in tissue regeneration and healing. Furthermore, we believe that the previous research work with Cleveland Clinic, the\nChinese University of Hong Kong, and the University of Pennsylvania, allowing for characterization and demonstration of the\nOrthofix new PEMF waveform, is paving the way for signal optimization for a variety of new applications and indications. This\ncollection of pre-clinical data, along with additional clinical data, could represent new clinical indication opportunities for our\nregenerative stimulation solutions.\nGlobal Orthopedics\nThe Global Orthopedics reporting segment offers products and solutions for limb deformity correction and complex limb\nreconstruction with a focus on use in trauma, adult and pediatric limb reconstruction, and foot and ankle procedures.

Our\nfracture repair products consist of fixation devices designed to stabilize a broken bone until it can heal. With these devices, we can\ntreat simple and complex fracture patterns, along with achieving deformity corrections.\nExternal Fixation\nExternal fixation devices are used to correct bone deformities, stabilize fractures, and offer an ideal treatment for complex fractures,\nfractures near the joints, and in patients with known risk factors or co-morbidities. The treatment is minimally invasive and allows\nexternal manipulation of the bone to obtain and maintain final bone alignment (reduction). The bone is fixed in this way until healing\noccurs. External fixation allows small degrees of micromotion (dynamization), which promotes blood flow at the fracture or fusion\nsite and accelerates the bone healing process. External fixation devices may also be used temporarily in complex trauma cases to\nstabilize the fracture prior to treating it definitively. In these situations, the device offers rapid fracture stabilization, which is\nimportant in life-saving as well as limb salvage procedures.\nWe offer most of our products in sterile packaging, which fulfills the need of a streamlined and ready-to-use set of products,\nparticularly in trauma applications where timing is crucial.\nExamples of our external fixation devices include the TrueLok, TL-HEX, TrueLok Evo, the Galaxy and Galaxy Gemini Fixation Systems,\nand the LRS Advanced Limb Reconstruction System.\nInternal Fixation\nInternal fixation devices consist of either long rods, commonly referred to as nails, or plates that are attached to the bone with the\nuse of screws. Nails and plates come in various sizes, depending on the bone that requires treatment. A nail is inserted into the\nmedullary canal of a fractured long bone of the human arm or leg (e.g., humerus, femur, or tibia). Alternatively, a plate is attached\nby screws to an area such as a broken wrist, hip, or foot. Examples of our internal fixation devices include Chimaera, AHN, and the G-\nBEAM Fusion Beaming System.\nThe Fitbone Intramedullary Limb Lengthening System provides an internal option for limb lengthening of the femur and tibia and\ntogether with our external fixation solutions, provides Orthofix with the most complete limb reconstruction portfolio on the market.\nWe are continuing to invest in the Fitbone technology platform in order to offer surgeons more solutions for deformity correction\nand bone defect management.\nIn addition to treating bone fractures, we also design, manufacture, and distribute devices intended to treat congenital bone\nconditions, such as angular deformities (e.g., bowed legs in children), degenerative diseases, and conditions resulting from a\nprevious trauma. An example of a product offered in this area is eight-Plate Plus.\nProduct Development\nOur primary research and development facilities are located in Lewisville, Texas, Carlsbad, California, Toronto, Canada, and Verona,\nItaly.\nWe have a research and development organization dedicated to advancing our portfolio of spinal implants, biologics, orthopedic\ndevices, and machine vision image guidance innovations through product development and clinical affairs programs. Our product\ndevelopment efforts employ an integrated team approach that involves collaboration between surgeons, our engineers, our\nmachinists, and our regulatory personnel. We also work with leading hospital research institutions, surgeons, consultants, and\ncertain non-profit organizations, such as MTF Biologics, on the long-term scientific planning and evolution of our products and\n15\ntherapies. Several of the products that we market have been developed through these collaborations. In addition, we periodically\nreceive suggestions for new products and product enhancements from the scientific and medical community, some of which result\nin us entering into assignment or license agreements with physicians and third parties.\nFor our spine and orthopedics products, our product development teams, in consultation with design surgeons, formulate a design\nfor the product and then our machinists build prototypes for testing our prototyping development and testing operation at our\nfacilities. We use a broad scope of technologies designed to allow us to meet the complex engineering requirements of customers.\nAs part of the development process, surgeons test the implantation of the products in our in-house cadaveric laboratories, which\naids in the design of new products intended to meet the needs of both the surgeon, the patient, and the healthcare ecosystem. Our\nteam refines or redesigns the prototype as necessary based on the results of the product testing, allowing our team to perform rapid\niterations of the design-prototype-test development cycle. Our clinical and regulatory personnel work in parallel with our product\nengineering personnel to facilitate regulatory clearances of our products. We believe that these product development efforts allow\nour team to provide solutions that respond to the needs of our surgeon customers and their patients.\nSimilar to the spine and orthopedics product development process, our software engineers, product managers, and design surgeons\nare working towards the full integration of our spinal implants and biologics product lines with our machine vision 7D FLASH\nNavigation System. This includes the design of specific software modules, features and tracked instruments designed to meet the\nneeds of a wide range of procedures including, degenerative, complex, revision, minimally invasive and deformity spine procedures.\nIn addition, we are also exploring opportunities to integrate the 7D FLASH Technology into a variety of adult and pediatric\northopedic applications.\nFor biologics, we plan to develop line extensions for our innovative biologics technologies that will continue to improve bone\nforming potential while addressing specific procedural requirements both in the spine field and in general orthopedic applications.\nWe are investigating new product formulations in DBM, while continuously looking at process improvements within tissue\nprocessing. Our Biologics research and development team has experience in biomaterial sciences and bringing next generation\ntechnologies to market.\nIn 2023, 2022, and 2021, we incurred research and development expenses of $80.2 million, $49.1 million, and $49.6 million,\nrespectively.\nPatents, Trade Secrets, Assignments and Licenses\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, assignment and license agreements, and non-disclosure agreements to protect\nour proprietary intellectual property. We possess numerous U.S. and foreign patents, have numerous pending patent applications,\nand have license rights under patents held by third parties. Many of our products are covered by patents in the major markets in\nwhich they are sold. We do not believe that the expiration of any single patent is likely to significantly affect our intellectual property\nposition. The medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on\nallegations of patent infringement. Patent litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain.\nOur success is dependent, in part, on us not infringing upon patents issued to others, including our competitors and potential\ncompetitors. While we make extensive efforts to ensure that our products do not infringe other parties’ patents and proprietary\nrights, our products and methods may be found by a court to be covered by patents held by our competitors. For a further\ndiscussion of these risks, please see Item 1A of this Annual Report under the heading “Risk Factors.”\nWe rely on confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees, consultants, and other parties to protect, in part, trade\nsecrets and other proprietary technology.\nWe obtain assignments or licenses of varying durations for certain of our products from third parties. We typically acquire rights\nunder such assignments or licenses in exchange for lump-sum payments or arrangements under which we pay a percentage of sales\nto the licensor. However, while assignments or licenses to us generally are irrevocable, no assurance can be given that these\narrangements will continue to be made available to us on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. The terms of our license and\nassignment agreements vary in length from a specified number of years, to the life of the patents, or for the economic life of the\nproduct. These agreements generally provide for royalty payments and termination rights in the event of a material breach.\nCompliance and Ethics Program\nIt is our fundamental policy to conduct business in accordance with the highest ethical and legal standards. We have a\ncomprehensive compliance and ethics program, which is overseen by a Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, who reports directly to\nour Chief Executive Officer and the Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors. The program is intended to promote lawful\nand ethical business practices throughout our domestic and international businesses. It is designed to prevent and detect violations\n16\nof applicable federal, state, and local laws in accordance with the standards set forth in guidance issued by the U.S. Department of\nJustice (“U.S. DOJ”) (“Evaluation of Corporate Compliance Programs” (updated March 2023)), the Office of Inspector General (HCCA-\nOIG “General Compliance Program Guidance” (November 2023)), and the U.S. Sentencing Commission (“Effective Compliance and\nEthics Programs” (November 2014)). Key elements of the program include:\n• Organizational oversight by senior-level personnel responsible for the compliance function within the Company;\n• Written standards and procedures, including a Corporate Code of Conduct;\n• Methods for communicating compliance concerns, including anonymous reporting mechanisms;\n• Investigation and remediation measures to ensure a prompt response to reported matters and timely corrective action;\n• Compliance education and training for employees and contracted business associates;\n• Auditing and monitoring controls to promote compliance with applicable laws and to assess program effectiveness;\n• Disciplinary guidelines to enforce compliance and address violations;\n• Due diligence reviews of high-risk intermediaries and exclusion lists screening of employees and contracted business\nassociates; and\n• Risk assessments to identify areas of compliance risk.\nGovernment Regulation\nClassification and Approval of Products by the FDA and other Regulatory Authorities\nOur research, development, clinical programs, and our manufacturing and marketing operations, are subject to extensive regulation\nin the U.S. and other countries. Most notably, all of our products sold in the U.S. are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic\nAct (the “FDCA”) and the Public Health Services Act as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The regulations that cover our\nproducts and facilities vary widely from country to country. The amount of time required to obtain approvals or clearances from\nregulatory authorities also differs from country to country.\nUnless an exemption applies, each medical device we commercially distribute in the U.S. is covered by premarket notification\n(“510(k)”) clearance, letter to file, approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”), or some other approval from the FDA. The\nFDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes, which generally determine the type of FDA approval required. Devices\ndeemed to pose low risk are placed in class I, devices deemed to pose moderate risk are placed in class II, and devices deemed to\npose the greatest risks, requiring more regulatory controls to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, or devices\ndeemed not substantially equivalent to a device that previously received 510(k) clearance (as described below), are placed in class\nIII. Our Spinal Implants and Global Orthopedics products are, for the most part, classified as class II devices and the instruments used\nwith these products are generally classified as class I. Our 7D FLASH Navigation System is classified as class II and certain accessories\nthereto are classified as class I. Our Bone Growth Therapies products and the M6-C artificial cervical disc are currently classified as\nclass III, and have been approved for commercial distribution in the U.S. through the PMA process. However, an FDA panel\nrecommended that bone growth stimulator devices be reclassified by the FDA from class III to class II devices with special controls.\nFor additional discussion of this development, see Item 1A of this Annual Report under the heading “Risk Factors.”\nThe medical devices we develop, manufacture, distribute, and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous\nother federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. The process of obtaining FDA clearance and other regulatory approvals to\ndevelop and market a medical device, particularly from the FDA, can be costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance\nsuch approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. While we believe we have obtained all necessary clearances and approvals\nfor the manufacture and sale of our products and that they are in material compliance with applicable FDA and other material\nregulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue such compliance.\nIn 2017, the European Union (“E.U.”) adopted the E.U. Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) (Council Regulations 2017/745), which\nimposes strict requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including new quality system and post-market\nsurveillance requirements. The regulation, as amended in March 2023, provides a transition period for all currently approved\nmedical devices prior to May 2021 (under the European Medical Device Directive) to meet the additional requirements, and for\nhigher risk devices, this transition period was extended until December 2027 and until December 2028 for medium-and-lower risk\ndevices. After this transition period, all medical devices marketed in the E.U. will require certification according to these new\nrequirements. This regulation has required us to incur, and we expect to continue to incur, significant costs through the transition\nperiod and beyond to maintain compliance with the additional requirements. Failure to meet the requirements of the regulation\n17\ncould adversely impact our business in the E.U. and other countries that utilize or rely on E.U. requirements for medical device\nregistrations.\nIn the E.U., our products that contain human-derived tissue, including demineralized bone material, are not medical devices as\ndefined in the MDR. They are also not medicinal products as defined in Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of the E.U. Today, the regulations in the E.U. governing products that contain human-derived tissue, if applicable, vary from\none E.U. member state to the next. Because of the absence of a harmonized regulatory framework and the proposed regulation for\nadvanced therapy medicinal products in the E.U., the approval process for human-derived cell or tissue-based medical products in\nthe E.U. may be extensive, lengthy, expensive, and unpredictable.\nCertain countries, as well as the E.U., have issued regulations that govern products that contain materials derived from animal\nsources. Regulatory authorities are particularly concerned with materials infected with the agent that causes bovine spongiform\nencephalopathy (\"BSE\"). These regulations affect our biomaterial products for the spine, which contain material derived from bovine\ntissue. Although we take steps designed to provide that our products are safe and free of agents that can cause disease, products\nthat contain materials derived from animals, including our products, may become subject to additional regulation, or even be\nbanned in certain countries, because of concern over the potential for prion transmission. Significant new regulations, a ban of our\nproducts, or a movement away from bovine-derived products because of an outbreak of BSE could have a material and adverse\neffect on our business or our ability to expand our business.\nWithin our Biologics product category, we market tissue for bone repair and reconstruction under the brand name Trinity ELITE, our\nallogeneic bone matrix comprised of cancellous bone containing viable cells and a demineralized cortical bone component. In\naddition, we provide demineralized cortical fiber technologies under the brand name FiberFuse, structural allografts for spinal\nfusion, and an amniotic membrane, which is a natural tissue barrier. These allografts are regulated under the FDA’s Human Cell,\nTissues and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (\"HCT/P\") regulatory paradigm and not as a medical device, biologic, or a drug. These\ntissues are regulated by the FDA as minimally-manipulated tissue and are covered by the FDA’s “Good Tissues Practices” regulations,\nwhich cover all stages of allograft processing. There can be no assurance our suppliers will continue to meet applicable regulatory\nrequirements or that those requirements will not be changed in ways that could adversely affect our business. Further, there can be\nno assurance these products will continue to be made available to us or that applicable regulatory standards will be met or remain\nunchanged. Moreover, products derived from human tissue or bones are from time to time subject to recall for certain\nadministrative or safety reasons and we may be affected by one or more such recalls.\nIn addition to our allograft solutions (HCT/Ps), we market and distribute additional biologics products that are synthetic in nature\nand are regulated by the FDA as medical devices, specifically Opus BA and the Opus MG lines of synthetic grafts. We also provide\nancillary technologies regulated by the FDA as medical devices that aid in the delivery of our bone grafting options clinically. These\nproducts are sourced from third party manufacturers, which we believe maintain an adequate inventory to avoid disruptions in\nproduct supply.\nWe also manufacture products derived from human tissue (demineralized bone tissue). Internally produced HCT/Ps may fall within\nthe definition of a biological product, medical device, or drug regulated under the FDCA. These biologic, device, or drug HCT/Ps must\ncomply both with the requirements exclusively applicable to HCT/Ps and with requirements applicable to biologics, devices or drugs,\nincluding premarket clearance or approval from the FDA.\nSection 361 of the Public Health Service Act authorizes the FDA to issue regulations to prevent the introduction, transmission, or\nspread of communicable disease. HCT/Ps regulated as 361 HCT/Ps are subject to requirements relating to registering facilities and\nlisting products with the FDA, screening and testing for tissue donor eligibility, Good Tissue Practice when processing, storing,\nlabeling, and distributing HCT/Ps, including required labeling information, stringent record keeping, and adverse event reporting.\nThe American Association of Tissue Banks (\"AATB\") has issued operating standards for tissue banking. Accreditation is voluntary, but\ncompliance with these standards is a requirement to become an AATB-accredited tissue establishment. In addition, some states in\nthe U.S. have their own tissue banking regulations. We are AATB-accredited and licensed or have permits for tissue banking in\nCalifornia, Florida, New York, Maryland, and other states that require specific licensing or registration.\nProcurement of certain human organs and tissue for transplantation is subject to the restrictions of the National Organ Transplant\nAct (\"NOTA\"), which prohibits the transfer of certain human organs, including skin and related tissue for valuable consideration, but\npermits the reasonable payment associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality\ncontrol, and storage of human tissue and skin. We reimburse tissue banks for their expenses associated with the recovery, storage,\nand transportation of donated human tissue they provide to us for processing. We include in our pricing structure amounts paid to\ntissue banks to reimburse them for their expenses associated with the recovery and transportation of the tissue, in addition to\ncertain costs associated with the processing, preservation, quality control and storage of the tissue, marketing and medical\neducation expenses, and costs associated with development of tissue processing technologies. NOTA payment allowances may be\n18\ninterpreted to limit the amount of costs and expenses that we may recover in our pricing for our products, thereby reducing our\nfuture revenue and profitability.\nFor a further description of some of the risks associated with matters described above, see Item 1A of this Annual Report under the\nheading “Risk Factors.”\nCertain Other Product and Manufacturing Regulations\nAfter a device is placed in the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These regulatory requirements include:\nproduct listing and establishment registration; Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), which requires manufacturers, including third-\nparty manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all\naspects of the manufacturing process; labeling regulations and governmental prohibitions against the promotion of products for\nuncleared, unapproved, or off-label uses or indications; clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or\nefficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices; approval of product modifications\nthat affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our PMA approved devices; Medical Device Adverse Event Reporting regulations,\nwhich require that manufacturers report to the FDA and other foreign governmental agencies if their device may have caused or\ncontributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious\ninjury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur; post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-\napproval study commitments; post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to\nprovide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain\nconditions, order device manufacturers to recall a product from the market that is in violation of governing laws and regulations;\nregulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and notices of corrections or removals.\nWe and certain of our suppliers also are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and European Notified\nBodies to determine our compliance with the FDA’s QSR and other international regulations. If the FDA were to find that we or\ncertain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations, the agency could institute a wide variety of enforcement\nactions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions, such as: fines and civil penalties against us, our officers, our\nemployees, or our suppliers; delays in clearing or approving, or refusal to clear or approve our products; withdrawal or suspension of\napproval of our products or those of our third-party suppliers by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; product recall or seizure;\ninterruption of production; operating restrictions; injunctions; and criminal prosecution. In addition to FDA inspections, all of our\nmanufacturing facilities are subject to annual Notified Body inspections.\nMoreover, governmental authorities outside the U.S. have become increasingly stringent in their regulation of medical devices. Our\nproducts may become subject to more rigorous regulation by non-U.S. governmental authorities in the future. Additional regulation,\nwhether in the U.S. or internationally, may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. For a description of some\nof the risks associated with the regulatory requirements described above, see Item 1A of this Annual Report under the heading “Risk\nFactors.”\nAccreditation Requirements\nOur subsidiary, Orthofix US LLC, has been accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Health Care, Inc. (“ACHC”), for medical\nsupply provider services with respect to durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (“DMEPOS”). ACHC, a\nprivate, not-for-profit corporation, which is certified to ISO 9001:2015 standards, was developed by home care and community-\nbased providers to help companies improve business operations and quality of patient care. Although accreditation is generally a\nvoluntary activity, where healthcare organizations submit to peer review their internal policies, processes, and patient care delivery\nagainst national standards, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) required DMEPOS suppliers to become\naccredited. We believe that by attaining accreditation, Orthofix US LLC has demonstrated its commitment to maintain a higher level\nof competency and a willingness to strive for excellence in its products, services, and customer satisfaction.\nThird-Party Payor Requirements\nOur products may be reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare, or\nprivate insurance plans and healthcare networks. Third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device\nprovided to a patient or used in a procedure does not meet applicable payment criteria or if the policyholder’s healthcare insurance\nbenefits are limited. Also, non-government third-party payors are increasingly challenging the medical necessity and prices paid for\nour products and services. The Medicare program is expected to continue to implement a new payment mechanism for certain\nDMEPOS items via the implementation of its competitive bidding program. Bone growth therapy devices are currently exempt from\nthis competitive bidding process.\n19\nLaws Regulating Healthcare Fraud and Abuse; State Healthcare Laws\nOur sales and marketing practices are also subject to a number of U.S. laws regulating healthcare fraud and abuse, such as the\nfederal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal Physician Self-Referral Law (known as the “Stark Law”), the Civil False Claims Act, and\nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as well as numerous state laws regulating healthcare and\ninsurance. These laws are enforced by the Office of Inspector General within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n(“HHS”), the U.S. DOJ, and other federal, state, and local agencies. Among other things, these laws and others generally (i) prohibit\nthe provision of anything of value in exchange for the referral of patients or for the purchase, order, or recommendation of any item\nor service reimbursed by a federal healthcare program (including Medicare and Medicaid); (ii) require that claims for payment\nsubmitted to federal healthcare programs be truthful; (iii) prohibit the transmission of protected healthcare information to persons\nnot authorized to receive that information; and (iv) require the maintenance of certain government licenses and permits.\nLaws Protecting the Confidentiality of Health Information\nU.S. federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain health information, in particular individually identifiable information\nsuch as medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of that protected information. At the federal level, the HHS promulgates\nhealth information privacy and security rules under HIPAA. These rules protect health information by regulating its use and\ndisclosure, including for research and other purposes. Failure of a HIPAA “covered entity” to comply with HIPAA regarding such\n“protected health information” could constitute a violation of federal law, subject to civil and criminal penalties. Covered entities\ninclude healthcare providers (including certain of those that sell devices or equipment) that engage in particular electronic\ntransactions, including, as we do, the transmission of claims to health plans. Consequently, health information that we access,\ncollect, analyze, and otherwise use and/or disclose includes protected health information that is subject to HIPAA. As noted above,\nmany state laws also pertain to the confidentiality of health information. Such laws are not necessarily preempted by HIPAA, in\nparticular those state laws that afford greater privacy protection to the individual than HIPAA. These state laws typically have their\nown penalty provisions, which could be applied in the event of an unlawful action affecting health information.\nIn the E.U., the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data\nbreaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance.\nInternationally, some countries have also passed laws that require individually identifiable data on their citizens to be maintained on\nlocal servers and that may restrict transfer or processing of that data.\nThese laws and regulations impact the ways in which we use and manage personal data, protected health information, and our\ninformation technology systems. They also impact our ability to move, store, and access data across geographic boundaries.\nCompliance with these requirements may require changes in business practices, complicate our operations, and add complexity and\nadditional management and oversight needs. They also may complicate our clinical research activities, as well as product offerings\nthat involve transmission or use of clinical data.\nPhysician Payments Sunshine Provision of the Affordable Care Act\nThe Physician Payments Sunshine Provision of the Affordable Care Act (Section 6002) (the “Sunshine Act”), requires public disclosure\nto the U.S. government of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals, including in-kind transfers of value, such as gifts or meals.\nThe Sunshine Act also provides penalties for non-compliance. The Sunshine Act requires that we file an annual report on March 31st\nof each calendar year for the transfers of value incurred for the prior calendar year.\nIn 2018, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act\n(the “SUPPORT Act”) was signed into law. The SUPPORT Act expands the reporting obligation under the Sunshine Act to include\npayments and other transfers of value made to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered\nnurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives. These expanded reporting obligations were effective for payments reported in\n2022, with payment tracking beginning in 2021. Non-compliance with the Sunshine Act or SUPPORT Act is subject to civil monetary\npenalties.\nIn addition to the Sunshine Act, as expanded by the SUPPORT Act, we seek to comply with other international and individual state\ntransparency laws, such as the transparency laws of Massachusetts and Vermont.\nSales, Marketing and Distribution\nWe have a broad sales network comprised of direct sales representatives, sales agents, and distributors. This established sales\nnetwork provides us with a platform to introduce new products and expand sales of existing products. Our products are distributed\nin more than 60 countries worldwide.\n20\nReporting Segments and Product Categories\nOrthofix manages the business by two reporting segments, Global Spine and Global Orthopedics, which account for 85% and 15%,\nrespectively, of our total net sales in 2023.\nSales Network\nOur U.S. sales network is generally comprised of a mix of direct sales representatives and independent distributors, dependent upon\neach product category. An increasing number of these independent distributors sell products for more than one product category.\nOur Bone Growth Therapies product category is largely supported by a hybrid distribution network of direct sales representatives\nand independent distributors, whereas our Spinal Implants, Biologics, and Orthopedics sales organizations primarily consist of\nregional and territory business managers who oversee a broad network of independent distributors and sales agents.\nWe market our Enabling Technologies portfolio through a direct sales force in the U.S. who collaborate with our independent sales\nagents to generate either a capital sale or to place systems and components in an account in a capital efficient manner in return for\na long-term revenue commitment for our Spinal Implants and/or Biologics products.\nIn the U.S., we typically consign our Biologics products and consign or loan our Spinal Implants and Orthopedics implant sets to\nhospitals and independent sales agents, who in turn deliver them to the hospital for a single surgical procedure. In other instances,\nwe leave sets with hospitals that are high volume users for use in multiple procedures. These sets typically contain the instruments,\nincluding disposables, and implants required to complete a surgery. Our Orthopedics business provides a wide array of single use\npack procedural solutions, alleviating the burden of instrument sets.\nWe focus on entering distribution relationships in territories with a high potential for growth, where our partner will carry our\nproducts exclusively, except with respect to clinical markets that our products do not address. We believe these more exclusive\nrelationships allow us to grow faster and in a more cost-effective manner in these territories over the long term. We also plan to\ncontinue to invest in additional instrument sets and marketing and education efforts to support the expansion of our independent\nsales agent footprint.\nOutside the U.S., we employ direct sales representatives in certain markets and also contract with independent stocking distributors,\nwho purchase our products directly from us and independently sell them. In order to provide support to our independent sales\nnetwork, we have sales and product specialists who regularly visit independent distributors to provide training and product support.\n21\nMarketing and Product Education\nWe market and sell our products principally to physicians, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, integrated health delivery systems,\nand other purchasing organizations.\nWe support our sales force and sales expansion efforts through comprehensive and specialized training workshops for physicians\nand sales specialists consistent with the AdvaMed Code of Ethics (“AdvaMed Code”) and the MedTech Europe Code of Ethical\nBusiness Practice (“MedTech Code”). We organize regular multilingual teaching seminars in multiple locations and also virtually. To\nthis end, we leverage the capacity of our hands-on cadaveric training laboratories located at our Lewisville, Texas, Carlsbad,\nCalifornia, and Wayne, Pennsylvania facilities to increase the number of training opportunities for surgeons and sales agents. In-\nperson trainings are also held at our facility in Verona, Italy, and in various locations in Latin America. We believe training and\neducation will help surgeons become adept with our products and techniques, thereby improving outcomes for their patients. In\nrecent years, thousands of surgeons from around the world have attended these in person and virtual product education seminars,\nwhich have included a variety of lectures from specialists, as well as demonstrations and hands-on workshops.\nWe also produce marketing and training materials, including materials outlining surgical procedures, for our customers, sales force,\nand distributors in a variety of languages, using printed, video, and multimedia formats. We require all of our sales force, direct and\nindependent, to undergo extensive product, policy, and compliance training to ensure adherence to our standards, policies, and\napplicable law.\nCompetition\nThe global spine, biologics, orthopedics, and image guided surgery markets are highly competitive. We face significant competition\nin these markets from the spine and orthopedic divisions of large multinational medical device companies, established companies\nfocused solely or primarily on spine and orthopedics, and from smaller, emerging companies focused on product innovation. These\ncompetitors are focused on bringing new technologies to market and acquiring technologies and technology licenses that directly\ncompete with our products or that have potential product advantages that could render our products obsolete or noncompetitive.\nOur Bone Growth Therapies product category competes principally with similar products marketed by Zimmer Biomet, DJO Global,\nand Bioventus. Our primary competitors in the Biologics, Enabling Technologies, and Spinal Implants markets include Alphatec Spine,\nBaxter, B. Braun, Brainlab, Bioventus, Cerapedics, DePuy Synthes Spine (a Johnson & Johnson company), Globus Medical, Medtronic,\nStryker, XTANT Medical, ZimVie and various smaller public and private companies. For Global Orthopedics devices, our principal\ncompetitors include DePuy Synthes, Stryker, Smith & Nephew, Globus Medical, Enovis, Paragon 28, and OrthoPediatrics.\nWe believe that we enhance our competitive position by focusing on product features such as ease of use, versatility, cost, and\npatient acceptability, together with value-added services, such as the STIM onTrack mobile app, HEX RAY software, OrthoNext\npreoperative planning, and our medical education services. We attempt to avoid competing based solely on price. Overall cost and\nmedical effectiveness, innovation, reliability, value-added service, and training are the most prevalent methods of competition in the\nmarkets for our products, and we believe we compete effectively.\nManufacturing and Sources of Supply\nIn general, raw materials essential to our businesses are readily available from multiple sources. For reasons of quality assurance,\navailability, or cost effectiveness, certain components and raw materials are available only from one supplier. Our relationships with\nsuppliers that cannot be replaced without a material expense or delay are governed by written contracts, which are generally supply\nagreements. These agreements set forth the process by which we order components or raw materials, as applicable, from such\nsuppliers (which process is either on a purchase order basis or based on quarterly or annual forecasts and in some cases require us\nto purchase minimum amounts) and the related fees for purchasing such components or raw materials. These agreements outline\nthe rights of each party with respect to quality assurance, inspection, and compliance with applicable law and contain what we\nbelieve to be customary indemnification provisions for commercial agreements. Each of these agreements is entered into in the\nordinary course of our business, is immaterial in amount and significance, and not a contract upon which our business is\nsubstantially dependent. In addition, we endeavor to maintain sufficient inventory of components and raw materials so that our\nproduction will not be significantly disrupted even if a particular component or material is not available for a period of time.\nBone Growth Therapies, Spinal Implants, Enabling Technologies, and Global Orthopedic Products\nWe generally design, develop, assemble, test, and package our Bone Growth Therapies, Spinal Implants, Enabling Technologies, and\nGlobal Orthopedic products, and subcontract the manufacturing of a substantial portion of the component parts and instruments.\nAlthough certain aspects of our key raw materials are obtained from a single source, we believe alternate sources for these\n22\nmaterials are available. Further, we believe an adequate inventory supply is maintained to avoid product flow interruptions.\nHistorically, we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining the materials necessary to meet our production schedules.\nOur products are currently manufactured and assembled in the U.S., Canada, Germany, Spain, China, and Italy. We believe our\nplants comply in all material respects with the requirements of the FDA and all relevant regulatory authorities outside the U.S. For a\ndescription of the laws to which we are subject, see Item 1, “Business”, under the subheadings “Corporate Compliance and Ethics\nProgram” and “Government Regulation.” We actively monitor each of our subcontractors in order to maintain manufacturing and\nquality standards and product specification conformity.\nBiologics\nMost of our Biologics products contain material derived from human or bovine tissue. We only source our raw materials from tissue\nbanks registered with the FDA and accredited by the AATB. The donors are screened, tested, and processed by the tissue banks in\naccordance with FDA and AATB requirements. Additionally, each donor must pass FDA-specified bacterial and viral testing before\nraw material is distributed to us for further processing. We receive with each donor lot a certification of the safety of the raw\nmaterial from the tissue bank’s medical director. As an added safety assurance, each lot of bone is released into the manufacturing\nprocess only after our quality assurance microbiologists screen the incoming bone and serology test records. During our\nmanufacturing process, the bone particles are subjected to our proprietary process and terminally sterilized. This process is designed\nto support the safety and effectiveness of our DBM products.\nThe collagen used in our collagen ceramic matrix products is derived only from the deep flexor tendon of cattle less than 24 months\nold from New Zealand. The World Health Organization classifies different types of cattle tissue for relative risk of BSE transmission.\nDeep flexor tendon is in the lowest-risk category for BSE transmission (the same category as milk, for example) and is therefore\nconsidered to have a negligible risk of containing the agent that causes BSE (an improperly folded protein known as a prion).\nWe also partner with MTF Biologics to provide our customers allograft solutions (HCT/Ps) for various spine, orthopedic and other\nbone repair needs. MTF Biologics provides donor screening, processing, and quality standards that are expected by our customers.\nOur partnership with MTF allows us to exclusively market the Virtuos Lyograph, Trinity ELITE, FiberFuse and FiberFuse Strip, and\ncertain other tissue forms and we have a non-exclusive marketing rights for our Opus BA and Opus MG Set synthetic, biologic\nofferings.\nHuman Capital Resources\nOur key human capital objectives in managing our business include attracting, developing, and retaining top talent while integrating\ndiversity, equity, and inclusion principles and practices into our core values.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 1,634 employees worldwide. Of these, 1,271 were employed in the U.S. and 363 were employed\nat other non-U.S. locations. Our relations with our Italian employees, who numbered 221 at December 31, 2023, are governed by\nthe provisions of a National Collective Labor Agreement setting forth mandatory minimum standards for labor relations in the metal\nmechanic workers industry. We are not a party to any other collective bargaining agreements.\nCompensation and Benefits\nBecause attracting, developing, and retaining high-level talent is a key component of our human capital objectives, we seek to\nprovide competitive compensation and benefits packages, and to prioritize the health and wellness of our employees. In addition to\nthe comprehensive and competitive health plans that we offer, our employees receive access to the following benefits: a 401(k)\nretirement plan with a Company match, an employee stock purchase plan, virtual physician consults, a Company-provided basic life\ninsurance and disability benefits, a corporate wellness program, an onsite fitness center for certain locations, paid parental leave, an\nemployee assistance program, a flexible spending account, health savings accounts, and local employee discounts programs.\nTalent Development\nWe believe that success comes from investing in our people and ensuring our workforce is aligned with our mission and values. To\nachieve this goal, we devote time and resources to assist our employees in being familiar with our business, industry, and product\nofferings. We have developed a robust onboarding program for our newly hired associates that provides a comprehensive overview\nof our product portfolio and company history. We put an emphasis on training our employees and sales representatives to\nunderstand our business, including the underlying medical conditions that our products treat. In addition, we strive to support our\n23\nteams in the areas of development, mentoring, engagement, and health and wellness, enabling them to do their best work as they\ngrow their careers. In 2023, we launched the second cohort of our Leadership Excellence and Acceleration Program (\"LEAP\")\ndedicated to fostering a culture of excellence and innovation through continued development of our key talent. All of our employees\nare encouraged to work with their managers to create individual plans to guide their career progression, taking advantage of\nlearning curriculum and training opportunities to support their growth and continued success.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe are committed to fostering, cultivating, and preserving a culture that promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion. We seek to\ndemonstrate our commitment to providing equal and equitable opportunities to all employees through programs such as our\nMoving 4ward initiative, a program created to embrace the value of diversity and reflect the communities where we live and work.\nAdditionally, we proudly support the Orthofix Women’s Network, a program that provides opportunities for women to learn from\neach other and grow within our company and our industry. Throughout the year, we promote a variety of diverse voices to our\nemployees by recognizing events such as Black History Month, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Women’s History Month, Asian Pacific\nAmerican Heritage Month, LGBTQ Pride Month, Mental Health and Awareness Month, Diwali, Ramadan, Kwanzaa, Juneteenth, and\nHispanic and Native American Heritage Months among others. We seek to embrace and encourage our employees’ differences and\nknow that diversity, equity, and inclusion help build a truly global, transformative business and will continue to be a source of our\nstrength. Building on this belief, we incorporate into our new hire orientation, a training titled, “Hiring, Leading and Fostering\nDiverse and Inclusive Teams” for all hiring managers, leaders, and interviewers.\nHealth and Safety\nPromoting and protecting the health and safety of our workforce is a top priority. Health and safety matters are responsibilities that\nwe share throughout our organization. Employees' safety risks vary depending on the roles they perform, and we seek to tailor our\nsafety efforts accordingly. Key areas of focus include corporate compliance with responsible hazardous waste management,\nrecycling, emergency preparedness, and other safety programs aimed at reducing and eliminating serious injuries. We periodically\nmeasure employee sentiment through engagement surveys and share results and action plans with employees.\nCommunity\nWe support a variety of charitable organizations through monetary and product donations, fundraising efforts, educational\npartnerships with colleges and universities, and local community development. Over the years, we have raised funds and awareness\nfor disaster response organizations, veteran support groups, food and shelter insecurity groups, and health-related institutions\namong others. In 2023, we continued our corporate objective to measure our community outreach as part of our annual incentive\nprogram to encourage volunteerism. Under our “Orthofix Gives Back” initiative, our employees contributed 2,755 hours to\nprograms, which exceeded our communicated goal. We proudly supported Steps2Walk, Ronald McDonald House, American Red\nCross Disaster Relief, The Trevor Project, Boys & Girls Club, Toys for Tots, Meals on Wheels, Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children,\nSickKids Hospital, and various blood drives, food pantries and other charitable initiatives in the communities we live and work in\naround the world.\n24\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report and the exhibits hereto, you should carefully consider the risks\ndescribed below. These risks are not the only ones that we may face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently\nconsider immaterial may also impair our business operations. This Annual Report also contains forward-looking statements that\ninvolve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements\nas a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by us described below or elsewhere in this Annual Report. Investing in our\ncommon stock involves a high degree of risk and if any of these risks or uncertainties occur, the trading price of our common stock\ncould decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. The disclosures in this Item 1A of this Annual Report under the\nheading “Risk Factors” relate to the combined company subsequent to the merger unless otherwise noted.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe section provides a summary of many of the risks we are exposed to in the normal course of our business activities. The summary\ndoes not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read the summary together with the more\ndetailed discussion of risks set forth following this section as well as elsewhere in this report.\n• Integration of the Orthofix and SeaSpine businesses is expected to be expensive and time-intensive and we may not be\nable to successfully integrate the businesses and/or realize anticipated synergies and benefits in a timely manner, if at\nall.\n• We are subject to a wide range of requirements, regulations, and laws due to our international operations and related to\nthe medical device industry in which we operate, the violation of any of which could subject us to adverse\nconsequences.\n• Ongoing healthcare reform initiatives and changes in third-party reimbursement policies and in the healthcare industry\naimed at cost containment may adversely impact our business.\n• We and certain of our suppliers are subject to extensive government regulation that increases our costs and could limit\nour ability to market or sell our products.\n• Oversight of the medical device industry might affect the way we sell medical devices and compete in the marketplace.\n• A FDA panel recommended that bone growth stimulator devices be reclassified by the FDA from Class III to Class II\ndevices, which could increase future competition for us in this product category and negatively affect our future sales of\nsuch products.\n• We are subject to requirements relating to hazardous materials which may impose significant compliance or other costs\non us.\n• The COVID-19 pandemic or other such global events, and the related effects thereof, could materially adversely affect,\nour operations, supply chain, manufacturing, product demand, product distribution, customers, and other business\nactivities.\n• Our business may be adversely affected if consolidation in the healthcare industry leads to demand for price concessions\nor if a GPO or similar entity excludes us from being a supplier.\n• The industry in which we operate is highly competitive. New product developments and improvements by our\ncompetitors could make our products or technologies non-competitive or obsolete. Similarly, unless clinical studies\ndemonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products, alone and relative to competitive products, our sales may be\nadversely affected.\n• Our ability to market products successfully depends, in part, upon the acceptance of the products not only by\nconsumers, but also by independent third parties, including physicians, hospitals, and third-party payors.\n• Clinical development is a lengthy and expensive process with an inherently uncertain outcome. Failure to successfully\ncomplete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates on our anticipated timelines at\nreasonable costs to us, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial\ncondition.\n• If the third parties on which we rely to conduct our clinical studies do not perform as contractually required or expected,\nwe may not obtain required approvals for or commercialize our products.\n• Unfavorable negative publicity concerning both alleged improper methods of tissue recovery from donors and disease\ntransmission from donated tissue could limit widespread acceptance of some of our products.\n• We may not be able to successfully introduce new products to the market and, if we do, market acceptance or the\nmarket size for our products may not be as we expect.\n25\n• There is no guarantee that regulatory authorities, U.S. or foreign, will grant clearance or premarket approval of our\nfuture products.\n• Our success depends on our ability to successfully educate and train surgeons and their staff on the benefits, safety,\ncost-effectiveness, and proper use of our products.\n• Security breaches, cyber-attacks, loss of data, and other disruptions to our information technology systems could\ncompromise sensitive information and/or adversely affect our business.\n• Our business could be harmed if any of our manufacturing, development, or research facilities are damaged and/or our\nmanufacturing processes are interrupted.\n• We depend on a limited number of third-party manufacturers and suppliers for manufacturing and processing activities,\ncomponents, and raw materials. Failure of these third parties to perform as expected could result in substantial delays,\nincreased costs or failures of our product development programs, or delayed or unsuccessful commercialization of our\nproducts.\n• We may not maintain or grow our revenue if we are unable to maintain and expand our network of independent sales\nrepresentatives and distributors.\n• Our success depends on the services of key members of our senior management and other key employees.\n• Our business is subject to economic, political, regulatory, and other risks associated with international sales and\noperations.\n• Our failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our position in the marketplace\nor prevent or impede the commercial protection of our products.\n• We may be subject to third parties claims for infringement or misappropriation of their intellectual property.\n• There have been substantial intellectual property disputes in our industry, which are inherently costly, divert significant\ntime and other resources, and have unpredictable outcomes.\n• We may have significant product or other liability exposure, some of which may not be covered by insurance, and if\ncovered by insurance, such coverage may not cover all claims, which could require us to pay substantial sums.\n• Our efforts to identify, pursue, and implement new business opportunities (including acquisitions) may be unsuccessful.\n• We have invested in and provided loans to privately-held companies and if they are unsuccessful, we may lose all of our\ninvestment and our loans may not be repaid.\n• Our sales volumes and our operating results may fluctuate.\n• Our goodwill, intangible assets, and fixed assets are subject to potential impairment which could adversely affect our\nfuture financial results.\n• We maintain a $150.0 million financing agreement secured by a pledge of substantially all of our property. Our failure to\ncomply with the facility’s covenants could result in an event of default, which could adversely affect our future.\n• We must maintain high levels of inventory, which could consume a significant amount of our resources and reduce our\ncash flows.\n• Our future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future, and such funds may not\nbe available on acceptable terms or at all.\n• Our business could be negatively impacted by corporate citizenship and environmental, social, and governance (\"ESG\")\nmatters and/or our reporting of such matters.\n26\nRisks Related to our Merger with SeaSpine\nThe combined company may be unable to successfully integrate the Orthofix and SeaSpine businesses and realize the anticipated\nbenefits of the merger.\nThe success of the merger will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate the Orthofix and SeaSpine\nbusinesses, and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and technological opportunities, and\noperational efficiencies from the merger in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing customer, supplier, and employee\nrelations and does not result in decreased revenues due to losses of, or decreases in orders by, customers. If we are unable to\nachieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or\nmay take longer to realize than expected, and the value of our common stock may decline. Integration may result in additional and\nunforeseen expenses, and we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the merger on a timely basis or at all.\nWhile we have successfully completed a number of integration activities since the closing of merger, the remainder of our\nintegration activities may not be completed smoothly or successfully. The integration of the two companies may result in material\nchallenges, including, without limitation:\n• managing a larger, more complex combined medical device business;\n• maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees;\n• retaining existing business and operational relationships, including customers, suppliers, and employees and other\ncounterparties, as may be impacted by contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by\nthe merger, and attracting new business and operational relationships;\n• unanticipated issues in integrating the numerous systems involved in operating our businesses, including information\ntechnology, communications, purchasing, accounting, and finance, including integrating different accounting policies,\nsales, billing, payroll, employee benefits, regulatory compliance, and other systems;\n• successfully addressing inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, or policies that could affect our ability to\nmaintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger;\n• consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations;\n• coordinating geographically separate organizations, systems, and facilities and addressing possible differences in\nbusiness backgrounds, corporate cultures, and management philosophies; and\n• unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the merger.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control, and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreases in the\namount of expected revenues, and other adverse impacts, which could materially affect our financial position, results of operations,\nand cash flows. In addition, the integration of certain operations requires the dedication of significant management resources, which\nmay temporarily distract management’s attention from our day-to-day business. Employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the\nintegration process may also disrupt our business.\nOur future results may be adversely impacted if we do not effectively manage our complex operations following the completion of\nthe merger.\nFollowing the merger, the size of our business has become significantly larger. Our ability to successfully manage this expanded\nbusiness will depend, in part, upon our ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration of\nthe Orthofix and SeaSpine businesses, but also the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased\ncosts and complexity. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in integrating the businesses or that we will realize the\nexpected operating efficiencies, cost savings, and other benefits as originally anticipated from the merger.\nWe have incurred substantial expenses related to the merger and we expect to incur substantial additional expenses related to the\nintegration of the Orthofix and SeaSpine businesses.\nWe incurred substantial expenses in connection with the completion of the merger and we have incurred substantial expenses\nrelated to integration activities performed to date in order to integrate a large number of processes, policies, procedures,\noperations, technologies, and systems of Orthofix and SeaSpine. These activities remain ongoing for certain integration areas, thus\n27\nwe expect to continue to still incur significant expenses associated with these activities in the future. The substantial majority of\nthese costs are believed to be non-recurring expenses related to the transaction, our facilities, our personnel, and systems\nconsolidation costs. We may incur additional costs or suffer loss of business under third-party contracts that are terminated or that\ncontain change in control or other provisions that may be triggered by the completion of the merger, and/or losses of, or decreases\nin orders by, customers, and may also incur costs to (i) retain certain key management personnel and employees or (ii) associated\nwith restructuring activities following the merger. These incremental transaction-related and integration costs may exceed the\nsavings the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies\nrelated to the integration of the businesses, particularly in the near term and in the event there are material unanticipated costs.\nFactors beyond our control could affect the total amount or timing of these expenses, many of which, by their nature, are difficult to\nestimate accurately.\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal control over financial\nreporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud, which could harm our business and the\ntrading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in our effort to prevent\nfinancial fraud. We are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls. As\nhas occurred in several years prior, these evaluations may result in the conclusion that enhancements, modifications, or changes to\nour internal controls are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular\nbasis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including\ncollusion, management override, and failure of human judgment. Because of this, control procedures are designed to reduce rather\nthan eliminate business risks. Also, previously effective internal controls may become inadequate over time because of changes in\nour business or operating structure, and we may fail to take measures to evaluate the adequacy of and update these controls, as\nnecessary. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or if management or our independent registered public\naccounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial\nreports or prevent fraud, which could harm our financial condition and operating results, and could result in a loss of investor\nconfidence and a decline in our stock price.\nWe recently identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and our business and stock price may be\nadversely affected if our internal control over financial reporting is not effective.\nDuring the financial close for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we identified a material weakness in our internal controls over\nfinancial reporting related to the operation of certain management review controls pertaining to business combinations and\ngoodwill. A more complete description of this material weakness is included in Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures\" in this Form 10-K.\nAs previously discussed, if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or if management or our independent\nregistered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce\nreliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could harm our financial condition and operating results, and could result in a loss\nof investor confidence and a decline in our stock price.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and other similar anti-bribery laws and any violations of such laws\ncould subject us to adverse consequences.\nThe FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making\nimproper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also imposes\naccounting standards and requirements on U.S. publicly traded entities and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent\nthe diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. Because of the predominance of\ngovernment-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with\ngovernmental entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws.\nIn recent years, both the U.S. and non-U.S. regulators have increased regulation, enforcement, inspections, and governmental\ninvestigations of the medical device industry, including increased U.S. government oversight and enforcement of the FCPA. Despite\nimplementation of a comprehensive global healthcare compliance program, we may be subject to more regulation, enforcement,\ninspections, and investigations by governmental authorities in the future.\nAny failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations in the U.S. or abroad could adversely affect us in a variety of\nways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil, and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of\n28\nindividuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, suspension or withdrawal of CE Certificates of Conformity, seizure of\nshipments, restrictions on certain business activities, disgorgement and other remedial measures, disruptions of our operations, and\nsignificant management distraction. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the\ndisruption of our distribution and sales activities. Any reduction in international sales, or our failure to further develop our\ninternational markets, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to federal and state healthcare fraud, abuse, and anti-self-referral laws, and could face substantial penalties if we are\ndetermined not to have fully complied with such laws.\nHealthcare fraud and abuse regulations by federal and state governments impact our business. Healthcare fraud and abuse laws\npotentially applicable to our operations include:\n• The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying\nremuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service\nreimbursable under a federal healthcare program (such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs);\n• The federal Stark law, which prohibits physician self-referral, specifically a referral by a physician of a Medicare or Medicaid\npatient to an entity providing designated health services if the physician or an immediate family member has a financial\nrelationship with that entity;\n• Federal false claims laws, which prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for\npayment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal government payors that are false or fraudulent; and\n• State and non-U.S. laws analogous to each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may\napply to items or services reimbursed by non-governmental or non-U.S. governmental third-party payors, including\ncommercial insurers.\nFederal and state government agencies, as well as private whistleblowers, have significantly increased investigations and\nenforcement activity under these laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the\ncurtailment or restructuring of our operations, or the exclusion from participation in federal, non-U.S., or state healthcare programs.\nAlthough we exercise care in structuring our sales and marketing practices, customer discount arrangements, and interactions with\nhealthcare professionals to comply with these laws and regulations, we cannot provide assurance that government officials will not\nassert that our practices are not in compliance or that government regulators or courts will interpret those laws or regulations in a\nmanner consistent with our interpretation. Even if an investigation is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, we may spend\nconsiderable time and resources defending ourselves and the adverse publicity surrounding any assertion that we may have\nengaged in violative conduct could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation with existing and potential customers and\non our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nReimbursement policies of third parties, cost containment measures, and healthcare reform could adversely affect the demand for\nour products and limit our ability to sell our products.\nMaintaining and growing sales of our products depends on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-\nparty payors, both within and outside the U.S. Our products are sold either directly by us or by independent sales representatives to\ncustomers or to our independent distributors and purchased by hospitals, healthcare providers, and patients. These products may\nbe reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare, or private insurance\nplans, managed care organizations, and healthcare networks. Major third-party payors for medical services in the U.S. and\ninternationally continue to work to contain health care costs, are increasingly challenging the policies and the prices charged for\nmedical products and services, and have or may implement initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price\nregulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments,\nand managed-care arrangements. Any medical policy developments that eliminate, reduce, or materially modify coverage of our\nreimbursement rates for our products could have an impact on our ability to sell our products. In addition, third-party payors\ncontinually review and revise their coverage and reimbursement policies for procedures involving the use of our products and can,\nwithout notice, eliminate or reduce coverage or reimbursement if they determine that a device or product provided to a patient or\nused in a procedure does not meet applicable payment criteria or if the policyholder’s healthcare insurance benefits are limited.\nFor example, in the past, a major national third-party insurer in the U.S. reduced coverage (from all or most cases to limited\nindications) for biomechanical devices (e.g., spine cages) used in cervical fusion procedures, stating that the devices had not been\nshown to be more effective than bone graft. In addition, certain insurers have limited coverage for vertebral fusions in the lumbar\nspine and other insurers may adopt similar coverage decisions in the future. Limits put on reimbursement could make it more\ndifficult to buy our products and substantially reduce, or possibly eliminate, patient access to our products. In addition, should\ngovernmental authorities continue to enact legislation or adopt regulations that affect third-party coverage and reimbursement,\n29\naccess to our products and coverage by private or public insurers may be reduced with a consequential material adverse effect on\nour sales and profitability.\nCMS, in its ongoing implementation of the Medicare program, periodically reviews medical study literature to determine how the\nliterature addresses certain procedures and therapies in the Medicare population. The impact that this information could have on\nMedicare coverage policy for our products is currently unknown, and we cannot provide assurances that the resulting actions will\nnot restrict Medicare coverage for our products. There can be no assurance that we or our distributors will not experience\nsignificant reimbursement problems in the future related to these or other proceedings.\nAs required by law, CMS has continued efforts to implement a competitive bidding program for selected DMEPOS items paid for by\nthe Medicare program. In this program, Medicare rates are based on bid amounts for certain products in designated geographic\nareas, rather than the Medicare fee schedule amount. Bone growth stimulation products are currently exempt from this competitive\nbidding process. We cannot predict which products from any of our businesses may ultimately be affected or whether or when the\ncompetitive bidding process may be extended to our businesses. There can be no assurance that the implementation of the\ncompetitive bidding program will not have an adverse impact on the sales of some of our products.\nWith respect to international sales, market acceptance may depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement\nwithin prevailing healthcare payment systems. Reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary\nsignificantly by country. As in the U.S., our products may not obtain coverage and reimbursement approvals in a timely manner, if at\nall, in a particular international market. In addition, even if we obtain country-specific coverage and reimbursement approvals, we\ncould incur considerable expense to do so. Our failure to obtain such coverage and approvals would negatively affect market\nacceptance of our products in the international markets in which such failure occurs and the expenses incurred in connection with\nobtaining such coverage and approvals could outweigh the benefits of obtaining them.\nGlobally, our products are sold in many countries, such as the U.K., Germany, France, and Italy, which have publicly funded\nhealthcare systems. The ability of hospitals supported by such systems to purchase our products is dependent, in part, upon public\nbudgetary constraints. Any increase in such constraints may have a material adverse effect on our sales and collection of accounts\nreceivable from such sales.\nIf governmental agencies and other third-party payors reduce coverage of and/or reimbursement for procedures using our products,\nour business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Further, we cannot be certain\nthat, under current and future payment systems, the cost of our products will be adequately incorporated into the overall cost of\nthe procedure and, accordingly, we cannot be certain that the procedures performed with our products will be reimbursed at a cost-\neffective level, or at all.\nWe and certain of our suppliers may be subject to extensive government regulation that increases our costs and could limit our ability\nto market or sell our products.\nThe medical devices we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state,\nand foreign governmental authorities. These authorities regulate the development, approval, classification, testing, manufacturing,\nlabeling, marketing, and sale of medical devices. Likewise, our use and disclosure of certain categories of health information may be\nsubject to federal and state laws, implemented and enforced by governmental authorities that protect health information privacy\nand security. For a description of these regulations, see Item 1, “Business,” under the subheading “Government Regulation.”\nThe approval or clearance by governmental authorities, including the FDA in the U.S., is generally required before any medical\ndevices may be marketed in the U.S. or other countries. We cannot predict whether, in the future, the U.S. or foreign governments\nmay impose regulations that have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe process of obtaining FDA clearance and approvals to develop and market a medical device can be costly, time-consuming, and\nsubject to the risk that such clearances or approvals will not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The regulatory process may delay\nor prohibit the marketing of new products and impose substantial additional costs if the FDA lengthens review times for new\ndevices. Further, the FDA has the ability to change the regulatory classification of a cleared or approved device from a higher to a\nlower regulatory classification, or to reclassify an HCT/P, either of which could materially adversely impact our ability to market or\nsell our devices.\nIn addition, we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting. For example, the Federal Medical Device Reporting\nregulation requires us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may\nhave caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or that a malfunction occurred that would be likely to cause or contribute to\na death or serious injury upon recurrence.\n30\nWe and certain of our suppliers also are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our\ncompliance with FDA’s QSR and other regulations. Allegations may be made against us or against our suppliers, including donor\nrecovery groups or tissue banks, claiming that the acquisition or processing of biomaterials products does not comply with\napplicable FDA regulations or other relevant statutes and regulations. Allegations like these could cause regulators or other\nauthorities to investigate or take other action against us or our suppliers, or could cause negative publicity for us or our industry\ngenerally. If the FDA were to investigate us, because of an allegation or otherwise, and if the FDA were to conclude that we are not\nin compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health\nrisk, the agency could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions\nsuch as fines and civil penalties against us, our officers, our employees, or our suppliers; unanticipated expenditures to address or\ndefend such actions; delays in clearing or approving, or refusal to clear or approve, our products; withdrawal or suspension of\napproval of our products or those of our third-party suppliers by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; product recall or seizure;\ninterruption of production; operating restrictions; injunctions; and criminal prosecution. The FDA also has the authority to request\nrepair, replacement, or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us. The FDA may also recommend\nprosecution to the U.S. DOJ. Any notice or communication from the FDA regarding a failure to comply with applicable requirements,\nor negative publicity or product liability claims resulting from any adverse regulatory action, could have a material adverse effect on\nour development of new laboratory tests, business strategy, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe have little control over the ongoing compliance of our suppliers with applicable regulations. Their failure to comply may expose\nus to regulatory action and other liability, including fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in new\nproduct approval or clearance, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval or clearance.\nMoreover, governmental authorities outside the U.S. have become increasingly stringent in their regulation of medical devices, and\nour products may become subject to more rigorous regulation by non-U.S. governmental authorities in the future. U.S. or non-U.S.\ngovernment regulations may be imposed in the future that may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. The\nEuropean Commission (“EC”) has harmonized national regulations for the control of medical devices through European Medical\nDevice Directives with which manufacturers must comply. Under these new regulations, manufacturing plants must have received a\nfull Quality Assurance Certification from a “Notified Body” in order to be able to sell products within the member states of the E.U.\nThis Certification allows manufacturers to stamp the products of certified plants with a “CE” mark. Products covered by the EC\nregulations that do not bear the CE mark cannot be sold or distributed within the E.U. We have received certification for all currently\nexisting manufacturing facilities.\nIn addition, until a completed mutual recognition agreement exists between Switzerland and the E.U., Switzerland will be considered\na Third Country. The company has, however, pursued registration of certain key products in Switzerland under their new laws.\nSimilar activities have been pursued in the United Kingdom in relation to Brexit.\nOversight of the medical device industry might affect the way we sell medical devices and compete in the marketplace.\nThe FDA, the U.S. Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. DOJ, and other\nregulatory agencies actively enforce regulations prohibiting the promotion of a medical device for a use that has not been cleared or\napproved by the FDA. Use of a device outside its cleared or approved indications is known as “off-label” use. Physicians may\nprescribe our products for off-label uses, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician’s choice of treatment within the\npractice of medicine. However, if a regulatory agency determines that our promotional materials, training, or activities constitute\nimproper promotion of an off-label use, the regulatory agency could request that we modify our promotional materials, training, or\nactivities, or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine,\nand/or criminal penalties. Although our policy is to refrain from statements and activities that could be considered off-label\npromotion of our products, any regulatory agency could disagree and conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion and,\npotentially, caused the submission of false claims. Moreover, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of injury to\npatients, and, in turn, the risk of product liability claims. In addition, we may be subject to compliance actions, penalties, or\ninjunctions if the FDA challenges one or more of our determinations that a product modification did not require new approval or\nclearance by the FDA.\nA FDA panel recommended that bone growth stimulator devices be reclassified by the FDA from Class III to Class II devices, which\ncould increase future competition for us in this product category and negatively affect our future sales of such products.\nWe have the market leading bone growth stimulation platform as the only company to provide both PEMF and LIPUS bone healing\nsolutions. Our bone growth therapy products currently are designated as Class III devices. Class III devices are subject to the FDA’s\nmost rigorous pathway to approval for medical devices in the U.S. The FDA may change classification of a device only if the proposed\nnew class has sufficient regulatory controls to provide reasonable assurances of safety and effectiveness.\n31\nIn September 2020, the FDA’s Orthopedic and Rehabilitation Devices Panel recommended that bone growth stimulator devices be\nreclassified from Class III to Class II devices with “special controls” to ensure patient safety and therapy efficacy. These proposed\nspecial controls include the condition that such devices be subject to rigorous clinical studies and post market surveillance for any\nnew products. This would be in addition to other special controls and the Class II general requirement that any new products show\n“substantial equivalence” to already-cleared or approved devices.\nWe believe that the panel’s recommendation correctly recognizes the importance of PMA-like clinical data for these devices, so that\nmanufacturers will continue to be required to submit robust clinical data under the approval or clearance process to ensure the\nsafety and efficacy of these devices for patients. We, along with other bone growth stimulation manufacturers, submitted comments\nin response to the FDA’s proposed rulemaking to underscore the panel’s recommendation of the need for robust clinical data prior\nto approval or clearance of bone growth stimulator products, together with post market surveillance requirements.\nIn the long-term, the recommended reclassification could enhance the ability of competitors to enter the market if they are able to\ncreate technologies with comparable efficacy to our devices, which could result in our products facing additional competition,\nthereby negatively affecting our future sales of these products.\nWe continue to be affected by U.S. healthcare reform initiatives.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (or collectively the\n“ACA”), has caused a number of substantial changes to occur in recent years in the way healthcare is financed by both governmental\nand private insurers. The ACA is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage, improve quality, and\nreduce costs over time. Among other things, the ACA:\n• Established a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical\neffectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research; and\n• Implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals,\nphysicians, and other providers to improve the coordination, quality, and efficiency of certain healthcare services through\nbundled payment models.\nU.S. government agencies continue efforts to modify provisions of the ACA. For example, CMS began permitting states to impose\nwork requirements on persons covered by Medicaid expansion plans, certain federal subsidies to insurers have ended, and certain\nshort-term insurance plans not offering the full array of ACA benefits have been allowed to extend in duration. Some of these\nchanges are being challenged in U.S. courts and so their long-term impact remains uncertain. This changing federal landscape has\nboth positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry, with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of\nfederal law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the industry. Persisting uncertainty with respect\nto the scope and effect of certain provisions of the ACA have made compliance costly. Any future changes to the ACA or other such\nlegislation, depending on their nature, could affect rebates, prices, or the rate of price increases for health care products and\nservices, or required reporting and disclosure, and could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain or increase sales of any of\nour products and achieve profitability. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law.\nHowever, any changes that have the effect of reducing reimbursements for our products or reducing medical procedure volumes\ncould have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to differing customs and import/export rules in several jurisdictions in which we operate.\nWe import and export our products to and from a number of different countries around the world. Foreign governmental\nregulations have become increasingly stringent and more common, and we may become subject to even more rigorous regulation\nby foreign governmental authorities. Numerous laws restrict, and in some cases prohibit, U.S. companies from directly or indirectly\nselling goods, technology, or services to people or entities in certain countries. In addition, these laws require that we exercise care\nin structuring our sales and marketing practices and effecting product registrations in foreign countries. Compliance with these\nregulations is costly.\nThe import and export of our products involve subsidiaries and third parties operating in jurisdictions with different customs and\nimport/export rules and regulations. Customs authorities in such jurisdictions may challenge our treatment of customs and\nimport/export rules relating to product shipments under aspects of their respective customs laws and treaties. If we are\nunsuccessful in defending our treatment of customs and import/export classifications, we may be subject to additional customs\nduties, fines, or penalties that could adversely affect our profitability.\nIn addition, changes in U.S. or foreign policies regarding international trade could also negatively impact our business. The\nenactment of or increases in tariffs, or other such charges, on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete,\nmay have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations.\n32\nThe sales and marketing practices of our industry have been the subject of increased scrutiny from federal and state government\nagencies.\nAdvaMed (U.S.), MedTech Europe (Europe), MEDEC and MedTech Canada (Canada), and MTAA (Australia), some of the principal\ntrade associations for the medical device industry, have promulgated model codes of ethics that set forth standards by which its\nmembers should (and non-member companies may) abide in the promotion of their products in various regions. We have\nimplemented policies and procedures for compliance consistent with the standards promulgated by these associations, and we train\nour sales and marketing personnel on our policies regarding sales and marketing practices. Nevertheless, the sales and marketing\npractices of our industry have been the subject of increased scrutiny from federal and state government agencies. We believe this\ntrend will continue and that it could affect our ability to retain customers and other relationships important to our business.\nFor example, prosecutorial scrutiny and governmental oversight, at both the state and federal levels, over some major device\ncompanies regarding the retention of healthcare professionals have limited how medical device companies may retain healthcare\nprofessionals as consultants. Various hospital organizations, medical societies, and trade associations are establishing their own\npractices that may require detailed disclosures of relationships between healthcare professionals and medical device companies, or\nban or restrict certain marketing and sales practices, such as gifts and business meals. In addition, the ACA, as well as certain state\nlaws, require detailed disclosure of expenses incurred on behalf of and remuneration made to certain healthcare professionals and\nteaching hospitals, the publicity surrounding which could have a negative impact on our relationships with our customers and ability\nto seek input on product design or involvement in research. As a result of laws, rules, and regulations, or our own or third-party\npolicies that prohibit or restrict interactions, or the growing perception that any interaction between healthcare professionals and\nindustry are tainted, we may be unable to engage with our healthcare professional customers in the same manner or to the same\ndegree, or at all, as would otherwise be the case, which may adversely affect our ability to understand our customer’s needs and to\nincorporate into our development programs feedback that addresses these needs. If we are unable to develop and commercialize\nnew products that address the needs of our physician customers and their patients, our products may not be broadly accepted in\nthe marketplace, or at all, which would have a negative effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to requirements relating to hazardous materials which may impose significant compliance or other costs on us.\nOur research, development, and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of certain hazardous materials. For example,\nour allograft bone tissue processing may generate waste materials that in the U.S. are classified as medical waste. In addition, we\nlease facilities at which hazardous materials could have been used. Because of the foregoing, we are subject to federal, state,\nforeign, and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling, treatment, remediation, and disposal of\nhazardous materials and certain waste products.\nAlthough we believe that our procedures for handling and disposing of hazardous materials comply with applicable laws as currently\nin effect, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In addition, under some\nenvironmental laws and regulations, we could also be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our past\nor present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites, even if such contamination was not caused by us. If an accident occurs,\nstate or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In\naddition, if an accident or environmental discharge occurs, or if we discover contamination caused by prior operations, including by\nprior owners and operators of properties we acquire, we could be liable for cleanup obligations, damages, and fines. Any related\nliability could exceed our resources. If such unexpected costs are substantial, this could significantly harm our financial condition and\nresults of operations. We carry no insurance specifically covering environmental claims relating to the use of hazardous materials.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related supply chain and raw material disruptions previously had material adverse impacts to our global\noperations and financial condition. Other such global events could similarly have a material impact on our global operations and the\noperations of our supply chain, which could adversely impact our business results and financial condition.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers to manufacture or supply certain products or components. In the event of interruption\nwithin our supply chain, or global shortages of key supplies or components, we may not be able to increase capacity from other\nsources or develop alternative or secondary sources without incurring significant additional costs and/or substantial delays. For\nexample, the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily led to a global shortage of semiconductor chips, which are used in certain of our\nproducts. This shortage was primarily caused by manufacturers experiencing shutdowns or slowdowns during the pandemic, and it\ntook several fiscal quarters for normalized capacity to return. In addition, limitations in key raw material supplies could also cause\nsemiconductor chip and other component shortages potentially in the future. To the extent such shortages are experienced,\nparticularly on a longer-term basis, this could adversely affect our ability to procure key components and manufacture certain of our\n33\nproducts or it could require us to redesign any affected products in order to incorporate more readily available components, which\nmay require additional regulatory testing and approvals. Thus, our business could be adversely affected in a significant manner if\none or more of our suppliers are impacted by any interruption at a particular location or in relation to a particular material or\ncomponent.\nOur business may be adversely affected if consolidation in the healthcare industry leads to demand for price concessions or if a GPO\nor similar entity excludes us from being a supplier.\nBecause healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade, numerous initiatives and reforms have been launched by\nlegislators, regulators, and third-party payors to curb these costs. As a result, there has been a trend toward healthcare cost\ncontainment through aggregating purchasing decisions and industry consolidation, along with the growth of managed care\norganizations, all of which has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical therapies. For example:\n• There has been consolidation among healthcare facilities and purchasers of medical devices, particularly in the U.S. One\nof the results of such consolidation is that GPOs, IDNs, and large single accounts use their market power to consolidate\npurchasing decisions, which intensifies competition to provide products and services to healthcare providers and other\nindustry participants, resulting in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market\nsegments. For example, some GPOs negotiate pricing for its member hospitals and require us to discount, or limit our\nability to increase, prices for certain of our products. In particular, certain of our DBM products are priced at a premium\nto competitors' DBM products and a significant price reduction could result in a material adverse effect on our\nprofitability.\n• Physicians increasingly have moved from independent, out-patient practice settings toward employment by hospitals\nand other larger healthcare organizations, which align physicians’ product choices with their employers’ price\nsensitivities and adds to pricing pressures. Hospitals have introduced and may continue to introduce new pricing\nstructures into their contracts to contain healthcare costs, including fixed price formulas and capitated and construct\npricing.\n• Certain hospitals provide financial incentives to doctors for reducing hospital costs (known as gainsharing), rewarding\nphysician efficiency (known as physician profiling), and encouraging partnerships with healthcare service and goods\nproviders to reduce prices.\n• Existing and proposed laws, regulations, and industry policies, in both domestic and international markets, regulate or\nseek to increase regulation of sales and marketing practices and the pricing and profitability of companies in the\nhealthcare industry.\nAs the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services to industry participants has become and may\ncontinue to become more intense. This has resulted and may continue to result in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of\ncertain suppliers from important markets as GPOs, IDNs, and large single accounts continue to use their market power to\nconsolidate purchasing decisions and as larger manufacturers use their broad offerings to secure exclusive arrangements. If a GPO\nwere to exclude us from their supplier list, our net sales could be adversely impacted. We expect that market demand, government\nregulation, third-party reimbursement policies, and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry,\nwhich may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products.\nIn addition, the largest device companies with multiple product franchises have increased their effort to leverage and contract\nbroadly with customers across franchises by providing volume discounts and multi-year arrangements that could prevent our access\nto these customers or make it difficult (or impossible) to compete on price.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive. New developments by others could make our products or technologies non-\ncompetitive or obsolete.\nThe medical devices industry is highly competitive. We compete with a large number of companies, many of which have significantly\ngreater financial, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, and technical resources than we do. Many of our competitors may be able\nto develop products and processes competitive with, or superior to, our own. Our competitors may also have: stronger intellectual\nproperty portfolios; broader spine surgery product offerings and products supported by more extensive clinical data; more\nestablished distribution networks; entrenched relationships with physicians; significantly greater name recognition and more\nrecognizable trademarks for products similar to the products we sell; more established relationships with healthcare providers and\npayors; greater experience in obtaining and maintaining FDA and other regulatory clearances or approvals for products and product\nenhancement; and greater experience in launching, marketing, and selling products than we do. Many of our competitors specialize\nin a specific product or focus on a particular market segment, making it more difficult for us to increase our overall market position.\n34\nThe frequent introduction by competitors of products that are, or claim to be, superior to our products, or that are alternatives to\nour existing or planned products may also create market confusion that may make it difficult to differentiate the benefits of our\nproducts over competing products. In addition, the entry of multiple new products and competitors may lead some of our\ncompetitors to employ pricing strategies that could adversely affect the pricing of our products and pricing in the spine market\ngenerally.\nFurthermore, we may not be able to successfully develop or introduce new products that are less costly or offer better performance\nthan those of our competitors, or offer purchasers of our products payment and other commercial terms as favorable as those\noffered by our competitors. For more information regarding our competitors, see Item 1, “Business,” under the subheading\n“Competition.”\nIn addition, the spine and orthopedic medical device industry in which we compete is undergoing, and is characterized by, rapid and\nsignificant technological change. We expect competition to intensify as technological advances are made. New technologies and\nproducts developed by other companies are regularly introduced into the market, which may render our products or technologies\nnon-competitive or obsolete.\nOur ability to market products successfully depends, in part, upon the acceptance of the products not only by consumers, but also by\nindependent third parties.\nOur ability to market our products successfully depends, in part, on the acceptance of the products by independent third parties\n(including hospitals, physicians, other healthcare providers, and third-party payors) as well as patients. Market acceptance for any of\nour products requires, among other things, that we timely secure regulatory clearance and/or approval; demonstrate the value of\nour products, both to our physician customers and payors, which may require that we collect clinical data and/or conduct clinical\nstudies; effectively educate and train our physician customers and their staff on the proper use of our products; obtain and maintain\ncoverage and adequate reimbursement for our products, both within and outside the U.S., including under Medicare and Medicaid\nand from private payors; attract and retain a network of independent sales agents and stocking distributors focused on\nneurophysicians and orthopedic spine physicians; develop and execute effective marketing strategies; protect the proprietary\npositions of our products, including through patent protection; and consistently produce quality products in sufficient quantities to\nmeet demand. Significant risks are associated with each of these activities and other activities required to achieve market\nacceptance of both our current and future products, including risks inherent in collaborations, or use of nascent manufacturing or\nimaging techniques, such as additive processing (more commonly known as 3D printing) or advanced optical technologies and\nmachine version-based registration algorithms. Unanticipated side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning any of our products\ncould have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain hospital approvals or achieve acceptance by prescribing physicians, managed\ncare providers, and other retailers, customers, and patients.\nClinical studies are expensive and subject to extensive regulation and their results may not support our product candidate claims or\nmay result in the discovery of adverse effects.\nIn developing new products or new indications for, or modifications to, existing products, we may conduct or sponsor pre-clinical\ntesting, clinical studies, or other clinical research. We are conducting post-market clinical studies of some of our products to gather\ninformation about their performance or optimal use. The data collected from these clinical studies may ultimately be used to\nsupport additional market clearance or approval for these products or future products. If any of our new products require premarket\nclinical studies, these studies are expensive, the outcomes are inherently uncertain, and they are subject to extensive regulation and\nreview by numerous governmental authorities, both in the U.S. and abroad, including by the FDA and, if federal funds are involved\nor if an investigator or site has signed a federal assurance, are subject to further regulation by the Office for Human Research\nProtections and the National Institutes of Health. For example, clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with FDA\nregulations, local regulations, and according to principles and standards collectively called “Good Clinical Practices.” Failure to\ncomply with applicable regulations could result in regulatory and legal enforcement action, including fines, penalties, suspension of\nstudies, and also could invalidate the data and make it unusable to support an FDA submission. Even if any of our future premarket\nclinical studies are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our product candidates and/or\nproposed claims or that the FDA or foreign authorities and Notified Bodies will agree with our interpretation and conclusions\nregarding the data they generate. Success in pre-clinical studies and early clinical studies does not ensure that later clinical studies\nwill succeed, and we cannot be sure that the results of later studies will replicate those of earlier or prior studies. The clinical study\nprocess may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for the proposed indicated uses, which could\ncause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of others. Any delay or termination of our clinical studies will\ndelay the filing of our product submissions and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate\nrevenues. It is also possible that patient subjects enrolled in our clinical studies of our marketed products will experience adverse\n35\nside effects that are not currently part of the product candidate’s profile and, if so, these findings may result in lower market\nacceptance, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf the third parties on which we rely to conduct our clinical studies and to assist us with pre-clinical development do not perform as\ncontractually required or expected, we may not obtain regulatory clearance, approval, or a CE Certificate of Conformity for our\nproducts or be able to successfully commercialize our products.\nWe often must rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators, and contract\nlaboratories, to assist in conducting our clinical studies and other development activities. If these third parties do not successfully\ncarry out their contractual duties, comply with applicable regulatory obligations, or meet expected deadlines, or if these third parties\nneed to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to failing to adhere to clinical\nprotocols, to applicable regulatory requirements or otherwise, our pre-clinical development activities and clinical studies may be\nextended, delayed, suspended, or terminated. Under these circumstances, we may not be able to obtain regulatory\nclearance/approval or a CE Certificate of Conformity for our products or be able to successfully commercialize our products on a\ntimely basis, if at all, and our business, operating results, and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur allograft and cellular bone allografts could expose us to certain risks that could disrupt our business.\nA portion of our Biologics business markets allograft tissues that are derived from human cadaveric donors, and our ability to market\nthe tissues depends on our supplier continuing to have access to donated human cadaveric tissue, as well as the maintenance of\nhigh standards by the supplier in its processing methodology. The supply of such donors is inherently unpredictable and can\nfluctuate over time. The allograft tissues are regulated under the FDA’s HCT/P regulatory paradigm and not as a medical device,\nbiologic, or drug. There can be no assurance that the FDA will not at some future date re-classify the allograft tissues, and the\nreclassification of this product from a human tissue to a medical device could have adverse consequences for us or for the supplier\nof this product and make it more difficult or expensive for us to conduct this business by requiring premarket clearance or approval,\nas well as compliance with additional post-market regulatory requirements.\nIn addition, procurement of certain human organs and tissue for transplantation is subject to the NOTA, which prohibits the transfer\nof certain human organs, including skin and related tissue, for valuable consideration, but permits the reasonable payment\nassociated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, and storage of human tissue\nand skin. If we were to be found to have violated NOTA’s prohibition on the sale or transfer of human tissue for valuable\nconsideration, we would potentially be subject to criminal enforcement sanctions, which could materially and adversely affect our\nresults of operations.\nBecause of the absence of a harmonized regulatory framework and the proposed regulation for advanced therapy medicinal\nproducts in the E.U., as well as for other countries, the approval process in the E.U. for human-derived cell or tissue-based medical\nproducts could be extensive, lengthy, expensive, and unpredictable. Among others, some of our Biologics products are subject to\nE.U. member states’ regulations that govern the donation, procurement, testing, coding, traceability, processing, preservation,\nstorage, and distribution of HCT/Ps. These E.U. member states’ regulations include requirements for registration, listing, labeling,\nadverse-event reporting, and inspection and enforcement. Some E.U. member states have their own tissue banking regulations,\nincluding new requirements related to COVID-19 and donor screening. Non-compliance with various regulations governing our\nproducts in any E.U. member state could result in the banning of our products in such member state or enforcement actions being\nbrought against us, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nUnfavorable media reports or other negative publicity concerning both alleged improper methods of tissue recovery from donors and\ndisease transmission from donated tissue could limit widespread acceptance of some of our products.\nUnfavorable reports of improper or illegal tissue recovery practices, both in the U.S. and internationally, as well as incidents of\nimproperly processed tissue leading to the transmission of disease, may affect the rate of future tissue donation and market\nacceptance of technologies incorporating human tissue. In addition, negative publicity could cause the families of potential donors\nto become reluctant to donate tissue to for-profit tissue processors. For example, the media has reported examples of alleged illegal\nharvesting of body parts from cadavers and resulting recalls conducted by certain companies selling human tissue-based products\naffected by the alleged illegal harvesting. These reports and others could have a negative effect on our tissue regeneration business.\nWe may not be able to successfully introduce new products to the market and market opportunities that we expect to develop for our\nproducts may not be as large as we expect.\nTo be and remain competitive, we need to continue to make improvements in our products, develop new products, introduce our\nproducts into new markets, and successfully respond to technological advances. Doing so is technologically challenging and involves\n36\nsignificant risks and uncertainty. Despite our planning, the process of developing and introducing new products (including product\nenhancements) is inherently complex, uncertain, and involves risks. The success of any of our new product offerings or\nenhancement or modification to our existing products will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n• properly identify and anticipate physician and patient needs;\n• develop new products, enhancements, or modifications in a timely manner;\n• obtain regulatory clearance and/or approvals for new products or product enhancements or modifications in a timely\nmanner;\n• achieve timely alpha and/or full commercial launches of new products;\n• provide adequate training to potential users of new products and product enhancements or modifications;\n• receive adequate reimbursement approval of third-party payors such as Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurers;\n• gain broad market acceptance (including by physicians); and\n• develop an effective marketing and distribution network.\nIn addition, competitors could develop products that are more effective, less expensive to manufacture, priced more competitively,\nor that are ready for commercial introduction before our products. The introduction of new products by our competitors may lead\nus to reduce the prices of our products, result in reduced margins or loss of market share, and/or render our products obsolete or\nnoncompetitive.\nThese risks make it inherently difficult to forecast and predict the future net sales of our products. If we cannot develop technically\nand commercially viable new products and enhancements or modifications to our existing products on a consistent basis and before\nour competitors, our prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if the market opportunities that we expect to\ndevelop for our products, including new products, are not as large as we expect, it could adversely affect our ability to grow our\nbusiness.\nIt is also important that we carefully manage our introduction of new products and enhancements or modifications to our existing\nproducts. If potential customers delay purchases until new or enhanced or modified products are available, it could negatively\nimpact our sales. In addition, to the extent we have excess or obsolete inventory as we transition to new or enhanced or modified\nproducts, it would result in margin reducing write-offs for obsolete inventory, and our results of operations may suffer.\nThere is no guarantee that the FDA will grant 510(k) clearance or premarket approval, or that equivalent foreign regulatory\nauthorities will grant the foreign equivalent, of our future products, and failure to obtain necessary clearances or approvals for our\nfuture products would adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nIn general, unless an exemption applies, a medical device and modifications to the device or its indications must receive either\npremarket approval or premarket clearance from the FDA before it can be marketed in the U.S. While in the past we have received\nsuch clearances, we may not succeed in the future in receiving approvals and clearances in a timely manner, or at all. The process of\nobtaining approval or clearance from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies for new products, or for enhancements or\nmodifications to existing products, could:\n• take significant time;\n• require the expenditure of substantial resources;\n• involve rigorous and expensive pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as post-market surveillance;\n• involve modifications, repairs, or replacements of our products; and\n• result in limitations on the indicated uses of our products.\nSome of our new products will require FDA 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA prior to being marketed. Any modification to a\n510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, including significant design and manufacturing\nchanges, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design, or manufacture, requires a new 510(k) clearance or,\npossibly, approval of a PMA. Similarly, modifications to PMA-approved products may require submission and approval of a PMA\nsupplement. The FDA requires every manufacturer to determine whether a new 510(k) or PMA is needed in the first instance, and\nthe FDA has issued guidance on assessing modifications to 510(k)-cleared and PMA-approved devices to assist manufacturers with\n37\nmaking these determinations. However, the FDA may review any such determination and the FDA may not agree with our\ndeterminations regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. We have modified some of our 510(k)-cleared\nproducts and have determined, based on our understanding of FDA guidance, that certain changes did not require new 510(k)\nclearances. If the FDA disagrees with our determination and requires us to seek new 510(k) clearances, or PMA approval, for\nmodifications to our cleared products, we may have to stop marketing or distributing our products, we may need to recall the\nmodified product until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.\nSignificant delays in receiving clearance or approval, or failing to receive clearance or approval for our new products would have a\nmaterial and adverse effect on our ability to expand our business.\nOutside the U.S., clearance or approval procedures can vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and\nvalidation and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain clearance or approval in other countries might\ndiffer from that required to obtain FDA clearance or approval. The regulatory process in other countries may include all of the risks\nto which we are exposed in the U.S., as well as other risks. Favorable regulatory action in one country does not ensure favorable\nregulatory action in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory clearance or approval in one country may have a negative\neffect on the regulatory process in others. Failure to obtain clearance or approval in other countries or any delay or setback in\nobtaining such clearance or approval have a material and adverse effect on our business, including that our products may not be\ncleared or approved for all indications requested, which could limit the uses of our products and have an adverse effect on product\nsales.\nIn the European Economic Area (“EEA”), we must inform the Notified Body that carried out the conformity assessment of the\nmedical devices we market or sell in the EEA of any planned substantial change to our quality system or any significant change to our\ndevices. The Notified Body will then assess the change and verify whether it affects the products’ conformity with the Essential\nRequirements or the conditions for the use of the device. If the assessment is favorable, the Notified Body may issue a new CE\nCertificate of Conformity or an addendum to the existing CE Certificate of Conformity. If it is not, we may not be able to continue to\nmarket and sell the applicable product in the EEA, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nWe cannot be certain that we will receive required approval or clearance from the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies for new\nproducts, including modifications to existing products, on a timely basis, or at all. Failing to receive approval or clearance for new\nproducts on a timely basis would have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGrowing our business requires that we properly educate and train physicians regarding the distinctive characteristics, benefits,\nsafety, clinical efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of our products.\nAcceptance of our products depends in part on our ability to (i) educate the medical community as to the distinctive characteristics,\nbenefits, safety, clinical efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of our products compared to alternative products, procedures, and\ntherapies, and (ii) train physicians in the proper use and implementation of our products. This is particularly true in instances of\nnewly launched products or in the introduction of a product into a new market, such as our launch of the M6-C artificial cervical disc\nwithin the U.S. We support our sales force and distributors through specialized training workshops in which physicians and sales\nspecialists participate. We also produce marketing materials, including materials outlining surgical procedures, for our sales force\nand distributors in a variety of languages using printed, video, and multimedia formats. To provide additional advanced training for\nphysicians, consistent with the AdvaMed Code and the MedTech Code, we organize regular multilingual teaching seminars in\nmultiple locations. However, convincing physicians to dedicate the time and energy necessary for adequate training is challenging,\nand we may not be successful in our efforts to educate the medical community and properly train physicians. Physicians who do not\nuse our products may be hesitant to do so for the following or other reasons:\n• lack of experience with our products, techniques, or technologies, or with the equipment necessary to use any of the\nforegoing;\n• existing relationships with those who sell competitive products;\n• the time required for physician and medical staff education and training on new products, techniques, and equipment\nand technologies;\n• lack or perceived lack of clinical evidence supporting patient benefit relative to competing products;\n• our products not being included on hospital formularies, in IDNs, or on GPO preferred vendor lists;\n• less attractive coverage and/or reimbursement within healthcare payment systems for our products and procedures\ncompared to other products and procedures;\n38\n• other costs associated with introducing new products and the equipment necessary to use new products; and\n• perceived risk of liability that could be associated with the use of new products, techniques, or technologies.\nIf physicians are not properly trained, they may misuse or ineffectively use our products, which may result in unsatisfactory patient\noutcomes, patient injury, negative publicity, or lawsuits against us. In addition, a failure to educate the medical community regarding\nour products may impair our ability to achieve market acceptance of our products.\nIn addition, we believe recommendations and support of our products by influential physicians are essential for market acceptance\nand adoption. If we do not receive support from such physicians or long-term data does not show the benefits of using our products,\nphysicians may not use our products. If we are not successful in convincing physicians of the merits of our products, we may not\nmaintain or grow our sales or achieve or sustain profitability.\nRelatedly, although we believe our training methods for physicians are conducted in compliance with FDA and other applicable\nregulations developed both nationally and in third countries, if the FDA or other regulatory agency determines that our training\nconstitutes promotion of an unapproved use or promotion of an intended purpose not covered by the CE mark affixed to our\nproducts or FDA approved labeling, they could request that we modify our training or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions,\nincluding the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine, and/or criminal penalty.\nSales of, or the price at which we sell, our products may be adversely affected unless the safety and efficacy of our products, alone\nand relative to competitive products, is demonstrated in clinical studies.\nGenerally, we have obtained 510(k) clearance to manufacture, market, and sell the products we market in the U.S. and the right to\naffix the CE mark to the products we market in the EEA. To date, we have not been required to generate new clinical data to support\nour 510(k) clearances, CE marks, or product registrations in other countries. However, the E.U. Medical Device Regulations, which\nreplaced the prior medical device directives in May 2021, require submission of certain pre- and post-market data to maintain our\nCE marks. Additionally, we recently completed an analysis of which of our product systems will require submission of clinical data\npursuant to MEDDEV 2.7.1 rev 4, which sets forth the EC’s guidance on the clinical evaluation of medical devices. Accordingly, and in\nline with our vision to deliver clinical value, we have commenced clinical data collection activities for certain of our marketed\nproducts as more fully described elsewhere in this \"Risk Factors\" section.\nIn part due to the increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective treatments, purchasing decisions of our customers\nincreasingly will be based on clinical data that demonstrates the value of our products or the effectiveness of our products relative\nto others. Conducting clinical studies is expensive and time-consuming and outcomes are uncertain. See “Clinical studies are\nexpensive and subject to extensive regulation and their results may not support our product candidate claims or may result in the\ndiscovery of adverse effects,” above. We may elect not to, or may be unable to, fund the clinical studies necessary to generate the\ndata required for all of our products to compete effectively, in part due to the breadth of our product portfolio. Currently, we do not\nexpect to undertake such clinical studies for all of our products and only expect to do so where we anticipate the benefits will\noutweigh the costs on a risk-adjusted basis. However, even when we elect and are able to fund such clinical studies on one or more\nof our products, such studies may not succeed. Data we generate may not be consistent with our existing data and may demonstrate\nless favorable safety or efficacy, which could reduce demand for our products and negatively impact future sales. Neurophysicians\nand orthopedic spine physicians may be less likely to use our products if more robust, or any, clinical data supporting the safety and\nefficacy of competing products is available. If we are unable to or unwilling to generate clinical data supporting the safety and\neffectiveness of our products, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nFurther, future patient studies or clinical experience may indicate that treatment with our products does not improve patient\noutcomes.\nWith the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, funds have been appropriated for the U.S. Department\nof Health and Human Services’ Healthcare Research and Quality to conduct comparative effectiveness research to determine the\neffectiveness of different drugs, medical devices, and procedures in treating certain conditions and diseases. Some of our products\nor procedures performed with our products could become the subject of such research. It is unknown what effect, if any, this\nresearch may have on our business. Further, future research or experience may indicate that treatment with our products does not\nimprove patient outcomes or improves patient outcomes less than we initially expected. Such results would reduce demand for our\nproducts, affect sustainable reimbursement from third-party payors, significantly reduce our ability to achieve expected revenue,\nand could cause us to withdraw our products from the market and could prevent us from sustaining or increasing profitability.\nMoreover, if future results and experience indicate that our products cause unexpected or serious complications or other\nunforeseen negative effects, we could be subject to significant legal liability, negative publicity, and damage to our reputation, and\nwe could experience a dramatic reduction in sales of our products, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. The spine medical device market has been particularly prone to potential\n39\nproduct liability claims that are inherent in the testing, manufacture, and sale of medical devices and products for spine surgery\nprocedures.\nWe may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems, which could adversely affect our cash flows,\noperating results, and financial condition.\nOur operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, which encompass all of our major business functions. We\nrely upon such information technology systems to manage and replenish inventory, fill and ship customer orders on a timely basis,\ncoordinate our sales activities across all of our products and services, and coordinate our administrative activities. A substantial\ndisruption in our information technology systems for any prolonged time period (arising from, for example, system capacity limits\nfrom unexpected increases in our volume of business, outages, or delays in service) could result in delays in receiving inventory and\nsupplies or filling customer orders and adversely affect our customer service and relationships. Our systems might be damaged or\ninterrupted by natural or man-made events, or by computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions\naffecting the internet. There can be no assurance that such delays, problems, or costs will not have a material adverse effect on our\ncash flows, operating results, and financial condition.\nAs our operations grow in both size and scope, we will continuously need to improve and upgrade our information technology\nsystems and infrastructure while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our information technology systems and infrastructure.\nAn expansion of our information technology systems and infrastructure may require us to commit substantial financial, operational,\nand technical resources before the volume of our business increases, with no assurance that the volume of business will increase.\nAny such upgrades to our information technology systems and information technology, or new technology, now and in the future,\nrequire that our management and resources be diverted from our core business to assist in integrating such upgrades or new\ntechnology. There can be no assurance that the time and resources our management will need to devote to these upgrades, service\noutages, or delays due to the installation of any new or upgraded technology (and customer issues therewith), or the impact on the\nreliability of our data from any new or upgraded technology, will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating\nresults, and financial condition.\nA significant portion of our operations run on a single Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) platform. To manage our international\noperations efficiently and effectively, we rely heavily on our ERP system, internal electronic information and communications\nsystems, and on systems or support services from third parties. Any of these systems are subject to electrical or telecommunications\noutages, computer hacking, or other general system failure. It is also possible that future acquisitions will operate on different ERP\nsystems and that we could face difficulties in integrating operational and accounting functions of new acquisitions. Difficulties in\nupgrading or expanding our ERP system or system-wide or local failures that affect our information processing could adversely affect\nour cash flows, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by a failure or compromise from a cyber-attack, data breach or ransomware attack, which could have\nan adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on information technology systems to perform our business operations, including processing, transmitting, and storing\nelectronic information, and interacting with customers, suppliers, healthcare payors, and other third parties. Like other medical\ndevice companies, the size and complexity of our information technology systems make them vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious\nintrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, ransomware attack, or other significant disruption. Our information systems\nrequire an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new\nsystems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the\nincreasing need to protect financial or personal information related to patients and customers, and changing customer patterns.\nFor example, third parties may attempt to hack into our products to obtain data relating to patients, disrupt the performance of our\nproducts, or access our proprietary information. We could also be subject to a ransomware attack, which is a type of malicious\nsoftware that infects a computer and restricts users' access to it until a ransom is paid to unlock it. Any failure by us to maintain or\nprotect our information technology systems and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions, or other breaches, could\nresult in the unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property, or other\nmisappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations and\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn the U.S., Federal and State privacy and security laws require certain of our operations to protect the confidentiality of personal\ninformation including patient medical records and other health information. In Europe, the Data Protection Directive requires us to\nmanage individually identifiable information in the E.U. and, the GDPR may impose fines of the greater of 20 million Euros or four\npercent of our global revenue in the event of violations. Internationally, some countries have also passed laws that require\nindividually identifiable data on their citizens to be maintained on local servers and that may restrict the transfer or processing of\n40\nthat data. We are also subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which went into effect in January 2020. In\nNovember 2020, California passed the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), which builds on the CCPA and expands consumer\nprivacy rights to more closely align with the GDPR. The CPRA went into effect on January 1, 2023, and applies to information\ncollected on or after January 1, 2022. The CCPA and CPRA, among other things, create new data privacy obligations for covered\ncompanies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their\ninformation. The CCPA also created a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially\nincreasing risks associated with a data breach. It remains unclear what, if any, additional modifications will be made to the CPRA by\nthe California legislature or how it will be interpreted. We believe that we meet the expectations of applicable regulations and that\nthe ongoing costs of compliance with such rules are not material to our business, but could become material due to new regulations.\nThere is no guarantee that we will be able to comply with these regulations, or otherwise avoid the negative reputational and other\neffects that might ensue from a significant data breach or failure to comply with applicable data privacy regulations, each of which\ncould have significant adverse effects on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn recent years, companies around the world have seen a surge in wire transfer “phishing” attacks that attempt to trick employees\ninto wiring money from company bank accounts to criminals’ bank accounts. In some cases, companies have lost millions of dollars\nto such relatively simple attacks, and these funds often are not recovered. While we take efforts to train employees to be cognizant\nof these types of attacks and take appropriate precautions, the level of technological sophistication used by attackers has increased\nin recent years, and a successful attack against us could lead to the loss of significant funds.\nAlthough we possess insurance against the risk of cyber-attacks, there can be no assurance that the liability related to any such\nevents will not exceed or insurance coverage limits or that such insurance will continue to be available on reasonable, commercially\nacceptable terms, or at all. If the costs of maintaining adequate insurance coverage should increase significantly in the future, our\noperating results could be materially adversely impacted.\nThe physical effects of climate change or legal, regulatory, or market measures intended to address climate change could adversely\naffect our operations and operating results.\nShifts in weather patterns caused by climate change are expected over time to increase the frequency, severity, or duration of\ncertain adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts, extreme\ntemperatures, or flooding, each of which could cause more significant business and supply chain interruptions, damage to our\nproducts and facilities as well as the infrastructure of hospitals, medical care facilities, and other customers, reduced workforce\navailability, and increased costs of raw materials and components. While we do not expect climate change to materially affect the\ndemand for our products, or the amount of persons with medical conditions we treat, climate change could also contribute to\ncollateral effects such as increased transmission of viruses or airborne illnesses, which could contribute to unpredictable events,\nsuch as putting stress on hospitals and other medical facilities and/or supply chains, and thus disrupting the elective surgery market\nin which we do business. In addition, increased public concern over climate change could result in new legal or regulatory\nrequirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change, which could include the adoption of more stringent environmental\nlaws and regulations or stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations. Such developments could result in increased\ncompliance costs and adverse impacts on raw material sourcing, manufacturing operations, and the distribution of our products,\nwhich could adversely affect our operations and operating results.\nIf any of our manufacturing, development, or research facilities are damaged and/or if our manufacturing processes are interrupted,\nwe could experience supply disruptions and/or lost revenues and our business could be seriously harmed.\nDamage to our manufacturing, development, or research facilities, or disruption to our business operations for any reason, including\ndue to natural disaster (such as earthquake, wildfires, and other fires or extreme weather), power loss, communications failure,\nunauthorized entry, or other events, such as a flu or other health epidemic (such as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic), could\ncause us to discontinue development and/or manufacturing of some or all of our products for an undetermined period of time. The\nproperty damage and business interruption insurance coverage on these facilities that we maintain might not cover all losses under\nsuch circumstances, and we may not be able to renew or obtain such insurance in the future on acceptable terms with adequate\ncoverage or at reasonable costs. If our facilities were damaged, they could be difficult to replace and could require substantial lead\ntime to repair or replace. In particular, we manufacture certain of our biologics products in one facility in Irvine, California, and any\ndamage to that facility could adversely affect our ability to timely satisfy demand for those products. Out of an abundance of\ncaution, in October 2020, we relocated part of our Biologics finished goods inventory from our Irvine facility to our Carlsbad office\ndue to the threat of the Silverado Fire that was causing evacuations throughout Orange County, California. Disruptions to our\nbusiness operations may result from damage to the facilities of, or disruption to the business operations of our suppliers. For\nexample, if we are unable to obtain disposables or other materials required to maintain “clean room” sterility in our Irvine facility,\nwe may be unable to continue to manufacture products at that facility, which products accounts for a significant amount of our total\n41\nrevenue. Any significant disruption to our manufacturing operations and to our ability to meet market demand likely would have an\nadverse impact on our sales and revenues as key stakeholders, including our independent sales agents and stocking distributors and\nphysician customers, transition to what they perceive as more reliable sources of products.\nWe depend on third-party manufacturers for many of our products.\nWe contract with third-party manufacturers to produce many of our products like many other companies in the medical device\nindustry. If we or any such manufacturer fail to meet production and delivery schedules, it can have an adverse impact on our ability\nto sell such products. Further, whether we directly manufacture a product or utilize a third-party manufacturer, shortages and\nspoilage of materials, labor stoppages, product recalls, manufacturing defects, and other similar events can delay production and\ninhibit our ability to bring a new product to market in timely fashion. For example, the supply of the Trinity ELITE and Trinity\nEvolution allografts are derived from human cadaveric donors, and our ability to market the tissues depends on MTF continuing to\nhave access to donated human cadaveric tissue and their continued maintenance of high standards in their processing methodology.\nWe depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for processing activities, components and raw materials and losing any of\nthese suppliers, or their inability to provide us with an adequate supply of materials that meet our quality and other requirements,\ncould harm our business.\nOutside suppliers, some of whom are sole-source suppliers, provide us with products, raw materials, and components used in\nmanufacturing our products. We strive to maintain sufficient inventory of products, raw materials, and components so that our\nproduction will not be significantly disrupted if a particular product, raw material, or component is not available to us for a period of\ntime, including as a result of a supplier's loss of its ISO or other certification or as a result of any of the disruptions described below\nunder the risk factor titled “If any of our manufacturing, development, or research facilities are damaged and/or if our\nmanufacturing processes are interrupted, we could experience supply disruptions and/or lost revenues and our business could be\nseriously harmed.” For example, a certain number of our products require titanium, which is sourced from third party suppliers.\nWhile the titanium required for such products is not directly sourced from Russia, the current geopolitical events involving Russia\nand Ukraine is negatively impacting the wider titanium supply chain and such geopolitical events and factors relating thereto or\nresulting therefrom, including the imposition of sanctions, may negatively impact the ability of our local supply sources to timely\nsupply titanium to us. In addition, some of our suppliers may choose to discontinue making their products available in the E.U. rather\nthan follow MDR, which would require us to identify alternate supply sources for those products. Any such disruption in our\nproduction could harm our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAlthough we believe there are alternative supply sources, replacing our suppliers may be impractical or difficult in many instances.\nFor example, we could have difficulty obtaining similar services or products from other suppliers that are acceptable to the FDA or\nother foreign regulatory authorities and who are able to provide the appropriate supply volumes at an acceptable cost. In addition, if\nwe are required to transition to new suppliers for certain services or components of our products, the use of services, components,\nor materials furnished by these alternative suppliers could require us to alter our operations, and if we are required to change the\nmanufacturer of a critical component of our products, we will have to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities,\nprocedures, and operations that comply with our quality and applicable regulatory requirements, which could further impede our\nability to manufacture our products in a timely manner. Transitioning to a new supplier could be time-consuming and expensive,\nmay result in interruptions in our operations and product delivery, could affect the performance specifications of our products, or\ncould require that we modify the design of those systems.\nIf we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of products, raw materials, or components that meet our quality and other\nrequirements on a timely basis for any reason, we may not produce sufficient quantities of our products to meet market demand\nuntil a new or alternative supply source is identified and qualified and, as a result, we could lose customers, our reputation could be\nharmed and our business could suffer. Furthermore, an uncorrected defect or supplier’s variation in a component or raw material\nthat is incompatible with our manufacturing, or unknown to us, could harm our ability to manufacture products.\nFurther, under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (\"FDASIA\"), which includes the Medical Device User Fee\nAmendments of 2012, as well as other medical device provisions, all U.S. and foreign manufacturers must have a FDA Establishment\nRegistration and complete Medical Device listings for sales in the U.S. While we believe that our facilities materially comply with\nthese requirements, we also source products from foreign contract manufacturers. It is possible that some of our foreign contract\nmanufacturers will not comply with applicable requirements and choose not to register with the FDA. In such an event, we will need\nto determine if there are alternative foreign contract manufacturers who comply with the applicable requirements. If such a foreign\ncontract manufacturer is a sole supplier of one of our products, there is a risk that we may not be able to source another supplier.\nFurthermore, we rely on a small number of tissue banks accredited by the AATB for the supply of human tissue, a crucial component\nof our biologics products that serve as bone graft substitutes. Any failure to obtain tissue from these sources or to have the tissue\n42\nprocessed by these sources for us in a timely manner will interfere with our ability to meet demand for our biologics products\neffectively. The processing of human tissue into biologics products is labor intensive and maintaining a steady supply stream is\nchallenging. In addition, due to seasonal changes in mortality rates, some scarce tissues used for our biologics products are at times\nin particularly short supply. If governments require additional donor testing due to COVID-19, this could also strain the supply of\ntissue. We cannot be certain that our supply of human tissue from our suppliers will be available at current levels or will meet our\nneeds or that we will be able to successfully negotiate commercially reasonable terms with other accredited tissue banks.\nIf we are unable to maintain and expand our network of independent sales representatives and distributors, we may not maintain or\ngrow our revenue.\nWe sell our products in many countries through independent sales representatives and distributors. Frequently, our independent\nsales representatives and our distributors have the exclusive right to sell our products in their respective territories. If any of our\nindependent sales representatives or distributors fail to adequately promote, market, and sell our products, our sales could\nsignificantly decrease. The terms of our agreements with our independent sales representatives and distributors vary in length,\ngenerally from one to ten years. Under the terms of our standard distribution agreements, each party has the right to terminate in\nthe event of a material breach by the other party and we generally have the right to terminate if the distributor does not meet\nagreed sales targets or fails to make payments on time. Any termination of our existing relationships with independent sales\nrepresentatives or distributors could have an adverse effect on our business unless and until commercially acceptable alternative\ndistribution arrangements are put in place. In addition, we operate in areas of the world that have been or may be\ndisproportionately affected by recessions or disasters and we bear risk that existing or future accounts receivable may be\nuncollected if these distributors or hospitals experience disruptions to their business that cause them to discontinue paying ongoing\naccounts payable or become insolvent.\nFurther, we face significant challenges and risks in managing our geographically dispersed distribution network and retaining the\nindependent sales representatives and distributors who make up that network, and as we launch new products and increase our\nmarketing efforts with respect to existing products, we plan to expand the reach of our marketing and sales efforts and may need to\nhire new independent sales representatives and distributors. Independent sales representatives and distributors require significant\ntechnical expertise in various areas such as spinal care practices, spine injuries and disease, and spinal health and they require\ntraining and time to achieve full productivity. We may not attract or retain qualified independent sales representatives and\ndistributors or enter into agreements with them on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, if at all. This could be due to a\nnumber of factors, including, but not limited to, perceived deficiencies, or gaps, in our existing product portfolio, intense\ncompetition for services of independent sales representatives and distributors, or because of the disruption associated with\nrestrictive covenants to which representatives or distributors may be subject and potential litigation and expense associated\ntherewith. We may also experience unforeseen disengagement from independent sales representatives and distributors who have\nworked with us for many years. Even if we enter into agreements with additional qualified independent sales representatives or\ndistributors, it often takes 6 to 12 months for new sales representatives or distributors to reach full operational effectiveness and\nthey may not generate revenue as quickly as we expect them to, commit the necessary resources to effectively market and sell our\nproducts, or ultimately succeed in selling our products. Our success will depend largely on our ability to continue to hire, train,\nretain, and motivate qualified independent sales representatives and distributors. If we cannot expand our sales and marketing\ncapabilities domestically and internationally, if we fail to train new independent sales representatives and distributors adequately,\nor if we experience high turnover in our sales network, we may not commercialize our products adequately, or at all, which would\nadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMoreover, because our independent sales representatives and distributors are not our employees, we have limited control over\ntheir activities and, generally, we do not enter into exclusive relationships with them. If one or more of them were to be retained by\na competitor, whether or an exclusive or non-exclusive basis, they may divert business from us to our competitor, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our sales.\nIn order to compete, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and key employees, and our failure to do so could have an\nadverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn order to compete, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial,\ntechnical, sales, marketing, research, development, finance, information and technology, and other support positions representing\ndiverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, engineers, technical staff, and sales\nrepresentatives is critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees in the medical device industry can be intense.\nMaintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive,\nare important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain\nhighly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected.\n43\nMoreover, replacing key employees may be a difficult, costly, and protracted process, and we may not have other personnel with\nthe capacity to assume all of the responsibilities of a departing employee. Competition for qualified personnel, particularly for key\npositions, is intense among companies in our industry, and many of the organizations against which we compete for qualified\npersonnel have greater financial and other resources and different risk profiles than us, which may make them more attractive\nemployers. All of our employees, including our management personnel, may terminate their employment with us at any time\nwithout notice. If we cannot attract and retain highly qualified personnel, as needed, we may not achieve our financial and other\ngoals.\nTo attract, retain, and motivate qualified executives and key employees, we utilize stock-based incentive awards, such as employee\nstock options and restricted stock units. Certain awards vest based upon the passage of time while others vest upon the\nachievement of certain performance-based and/or market-based conditions. If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate,\nas measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, and ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to\nattract, retain, and motivate our employees could be adversely impacted, which could negatively affect our results of operations\nand/or require us to increase the amount we expend on cash and other forms of compensation.\nIn addition, future internal growth could impose significant added responsibilities on our management, and we will need to identify,\nrecruit, maintain, motivate, and integrate additional employees to manage growth effectively. If we do not effectively manage such\ngrowth, our expenses may increase more than expected, we may not achieve our goals, and our ability to generate and/or grow\nrevenue could be diminished.\nOur business is subject to economic, political, regulatory, and other risks associated with international sales and operations.\nBecause we sell our products in many different countries, our business is subject to risks associated with conducting business\ninternationally. We anticipate that net sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our\ntotal net sales. In addition, certain of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future\nresults could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\n• changes in a specific country’s or region’s political, social, or economic conditions;\n• difficulties in staffing and managing widespread operations;\n• having to comply with export control laws, including, but not limited to, the Export Administration Regulations and trade\nsanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the\nDepartment of the Treasury, as well as the laws and regulations administered by the Department of Commerce;\n• complex data privacy requirements, including, but not limited to, the GDPR;\n• differing regulatory requirements for obtaining clearances or approvals to market our products, and unexpected changes in\nregulatory requirements;\n• changes in, or uncertainties relating to, foreign rules and regulations that may impact our ability to sell our products,\nperform services or repatriate profits to the U.S.;\n• tariffs, trade barriers, export regulations, and other regulatory and contractual limitations that may adversely impact our\nability to sell our products in certain foreign markets, the scope and consequences of which are subject to changing\nagendas of political, business, and environmental groups;\n• consequences from changes in tax or customs laws;\n• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n• limitations on or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries or joint\nventures;\n• differing multiple payor reimbursement regimes, government payors, or patient self-pay systems;\n• differing labor laws and standards;\n• an inability, or reduced ability, to protect our intellectual property, including any effect of compulsory licensing imposed by\ngovernment action;\n• availability of government subsidies or other incentives that benefit competitors in their local markets that are not available\nto us; and\n44\n• having to comply with various U.S. and international laws, including the FCPA and anti-money laundering laws, and violation\nby our independent sales representatives or distributors of such laws.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nWe depend on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, but we may not be able to maintain the\nconfidentiality of these assets or assure their protection.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our current and future technologies and products and to defend our\nintellectual property rights. If we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately, competitors may manufacture and market\nproducts that are similar to, or that compete directly with, our products. Numerous patents covering our technologies have been\nissued to us and we have filed, and expect to continue to file, patent applications seeking to protect newly developed technologies\nand products in various countries, including the U.S. Some patent applications in the U.S. are maintained in secrecy until the patent\nis issued. Because the publication of discoveries tends to follow their actual discovery by several months, we may not be the first to\ninvent or file patent applications on any of our discoveries. Further, there is a substantial backlog of patent applications at the U.S.\nPatent and Trademark Office, and the approval or rejection of patent applications may take several years. Patents may not be issued\nwith respect to any of our patent applications and existing or future patents issued to or licensed by us and may not provide\nadequate protection or competitive advantages for our products. Patents that are issued may be challenged, invalidated, or\ncircumvented by our competitors. Furthermore, our patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing, using, or\ncommercializing products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our products. Moreover, if patents are not issued with\nrespect to our products arising from research, we may not be able to maintain the confidentiality of information relating to these\nproducts. In addition, if a patent relating to any of our products lapses or is invalidated, we may experience greater competition\narising from new market entrants.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, unpatented proprietary expertise, and continuing technological innovation that we protect, in part, by\nentering into confidentiality agreements with assignors, licensees, suppliers, employees, and consultants. These agreements may be\nbreached and there may not be adequate remedies in the event of a breach. Disputes may arise concerning the ownership of\nintellectual property or the applicability or enforceability of confidentiality agreements. Moreover, our trade secrets and proprietary\ntechnology may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors.\nIn addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using physical and\ntechnological security measures. Such measures may not, for example, in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an\nemployee or third party with authorized access, adequately protect our proprietary information. Our security measures may not\nprevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor, and recourse we\ntake against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Unauthorized parties may also\nattempt to copy or reverse engineer certain aspects of our products that we consider proprietary. Enforcing a claim that a party\nillegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is\nunpredictable.\nWe may face claims by third parties that our agreements with employees, consultants, or advisors obligating them to assign\nintellectual property to us are ineffective or in conflict with prior or competing contractual obligations of assignment, which could\nresult in ownership disputes regarding intellectual property we have developed or will develop and interfere with our ability to\ncapture the commercial value of such intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to resolve an ownership dispute, and if we\nare unsuccessful, we may be precluded from using certain intellectual property or may lose our exclusive rights in that intellectual\nproperty. Either outcome could harm our business and competitive position.\nFurthermore, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of\nthe U.S., if at all. Since certain of our issued patents and pending patent applications are for the U.S. only, we lack a corresponding\nscope of patent protection in other countries. Thus, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing products in other\ncountries that are similar to some of our products.\nIf we are unable to obtain, protect, and enforce patents on our technology and to protect our trade secrets, such inability could have\na material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n45\nThird parties may claim that we infringe on their proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling certain of our\nproducts.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability, both in the U.S. and in foreign countries, to operate without infringing upon the\npatents and proprietary rights of others, and to obtain appropriate licenses to patents or proprietary rights held by third parties if\ninfringement would otherwise occur.\nThere has been substantial litigation in the medical device industry with respect to the manufacture, use, and sale of new products.\nThese lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties. We may be required to defend\nagainst allegations relating to the infringement of patent or proprietary rights of third parties. Any such litigation could, among other\nthings:\n• Require us to incur substantial expense, even if we are successful in the litigation;\n• Require us to divert significant time and effort of our technical and management personnel;\n• Result in the loss of our rights to develop or make certain products; and\n• Require us to pay substantial monetary damages or royalties in order to license proprietary rights from third parties or to\nsatisfy judgments or to settle actual or threatened litigation.\nAlthough patent and intellectual property disputes within the medical devices industry have often been settled through\nassignments, licensing, or similar arrangements, costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include the\nlong-term payment of royalties. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or a failure to\nobtain necessary assignments or licenses, could result in us having to pay substantial damages (which may be increased up to three\ntimes of awarded damages) and/or substantial royalties, and could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some products or\nincrease our costs to market these products unless we obtain a license or are able to redesign our products to avoid infringement.\nAny such license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to\nredesign our products in a way that would not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. If we fail to obtain any required\nlicenses or make any necessary changes to our products or technologies, we may have to withdraw existing products from the\nmarket or may be unable to commercialize one or more of our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, we generally indemnify our customers and sales representatives with respect to infringement by our products of the\nproprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers or sales representatives. These\nclaims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers or sales representatives,\nregardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to indemnify, or pay damages on behalf of,\nour customers or sales representatives or may have to obtain licenses for the products they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary\nlicenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our products.\nIf we seek to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation or other proceedings, it could require us to spend\nsignificant time and money, the results of which are uncertain.\nTo protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may have to initiate or defend litigation against or by third parties, such as\ninfringement suits, opposition proceedings, or seeking a court declaration that we do not infringe the proprietary rights of others or\nthat their rights are invalid or unenforceable. We may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to\ndefend our intellectual property rights against a challenge. Even if we prevail, the cost of litigation, including the diversion of\nmanagement and other resources, could affect our profitability and could place a significant strain on our financial resources.\nOur ability to enforce our intellectual property rights depends on our ability to detect infringement. It may be difficult to detect\ninfringers who do not advertise the components used in their products. Moreover, it may be difficult or impossible to obtain\nevidence of infringement in a competitor’s or potential competitor’s product. The medical device industry is characterized by the\nexistence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. It is not unusual for\nparties to exchange letters surrounding allegations of intellectual property infringement and licensing arrangements. In addition, the\npatent positions of medical device companies, including our patent position, may involve complex legal and factual questions, and,\ntherefore, the scope, validity, and enforceability of any patent claims we have or may obtain cannot be predicted with certainty.\n46\nWe may be subject to claims that we, our employees, or our independent sales agents or stocking distributors have wrongfully used\nor disclosed alleged trade secrets of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our\ncompetitors.\nMany of our employees were employed at other medical device companies, including our competitors or potential competitors, and\nin some cases, were employed at such medical device companies immediately prior to joining us. In addition, many of our\nindependent sales representatives and distributors sell, or in the past have sold, products of our competitors. We may be subject to\nclaims that we, our employees, or our independent sales representatives or distributors intentionally, inadvertently, or otherwise\nused or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of former employers or competitors. In addition, we have been and\nmay in the future be subject to claims that we caused an employee, or encouraged/assisted an independent sales agent, to breach\nthe terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nLitigation is expensive and time-consuming, and could divert management attention and resources away from our business. Even if\nwe prevail, the cost of litigation could affect our profitability. If we do not prevail, in addition to any damages we might have to pay,\nwe may lose valuable intellectual property rights or employees, independent sales representatives, or distributors. There can be no\nassurance that this type of litigation or the threat thereof will not adversely affect our ability to engage and retain key employees,\nsales representatives, or distributors.\nRisks Related to Litigation and Product Liability Matters\nWe may be subject to product and other liability claims that may not be covered by insurance and could require us to pay substantial\nsums.\nWe are subject to an inherent risk of, and adverse publicity associated with, product liability and other liability claims, whether or\nnot such claims are valid. Spine surgery involves significant risk of serious complications, including bleeding, nerve injury, paralysis\nand even death. In addition, if neurosurgeons and orthopedic spine surgeons are not sufficiently trained in the use of our products,\nthey may misuse or ineffectively use our products, which may result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes or patient injury. We could\nbecome the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing flaws, design defects,\nor inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients.\nIn addition, the development of allograft implants and technologies for human tissue repair and treatment may entail particular risk\nof transmitting diseases to human recipients, and any such transmission could result in the assertion of product liability claims\nagainst us.\nProduct liability claims are expensive to defend, divert our management’s attention and, if we are not successful in defending the\nclaim, can result in substantial monetary awards against us or costly settlements. Further, successful product liability claims made\nagainst one or more of our competitors could cause claims to be made against us or expose us to a perception that we are\nvulnerable to similar claims. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit and regardless of the outcome or\nwhether it is fully pursued, may result in: decreased demand for our products, injury to our reputation, significant litigation costs,\nproduct recalls, loss of revenue, the inability to commercialize new products or product candidates, and adverse publicity regarding\nour products. Any of these may have a material and adverse effect on our reputation with existing and potential customers and on\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, a recall of some of our products, whether or not the result of\na product liability claim, could result in significant costs and loss of customers.\nWe maintain product liability insurance coverage in amounts and scope that we believe are reasonable and adequate. There can be\nno assurance, however, that product liability or other claims will not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that such insurance will\ncontinue to be available on reasonable, commercially acceptable terms, or at all. A successful product liability claim that exceeds our\ninsurance coverage limits could require us to pay substantial sums and could have a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition. In addition, a recall of some of our products, whether or not the result of a product liability claim, could result in\nsignificant costs and loss of customers.\nOur insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some risks, which will leave us exposed to significant uninsured\nliabilities.\nWe do not carry insurance for all categories of risk to which our business is or may be exposed. Some of the policies we maintain\ninclude product liability insurance, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, property insurance, cybersecurity insurance, general\nliability insurance, and workers’ compensation insurance. We do not know, however, if we will be able to maintain insurance\ncoverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against losses. If the costs of maintaining adequate\ninsurance coverage should increase significantly in the future, our operating results could be materially adversely impacted. Even if\nwe have insurance, a claim could exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or it may be excluded from coverage under the\n47\nterms of the policy. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our\ncash position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Potential Acquisitions, Investments, and Divestitures\nOur efforts to identify, pursue, and implement new business opportunities (including acquisitions) may be unsuccessful and may have\nan adverse effect on our business.\nOur growth depends, in large part, on our ability to identify, pursue, and implement new business opportunities that expand our\nproduct offerings, capabilities, and geographic presence, and we compete with other medical device companies for these\nopportunities. Our efforts to identify such opportunities focus primarily on potential acquisitions of new businesses, products or\ntechnologies, licensing arrangements, commercialization arrangements, and other transactions with third parties. We may not be\nable to identify business opportunities that meet our strategic criteria or that are acceptable to us or our stockholders. Even if we\nare able to identify acceptable business opportunities, we may not be able to pursue or implement such business opportunities (or,\nin the case of acquisitions or other transactions, complete such acquisitions or other transactions) in a timely manner or on a cost-\neffective basis (or at all), and we may not realize the expected benefits of such business opportunities. If we are not able to identify,\npursue, and implement new business opportunities, it will adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nIn addition, pursuing and implementing new business opportunities (particularly acquisitions) may involve significant costs and entail\nrisks, uncertainties, and disruptions to our business, especially where we have limited experience as a company developing or\nmarketing a particular product or technology or operating in a particular geographic region. We may be unable to integrate a new\nbusiness, product, or technology effectively, or we may incur significant charges related to an acquisition or other business\nopportunity (for example, amortization of acquired assets or asset impairment charges), which may adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations. Newly acquired technology or products may require additional development efforts\nprior to commercial sale, including clinical testing and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities; such\nadditional development efforts may involve significant expense and ultimately be unsuccessful. Any cross-border acquisitions or\ntransactions may involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned above, including those related to integration of operations\nacross different cultures and languages, currency risks, and the particular economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with\nspecific countries. To the extent we issue additional equity in connection with acquisitions, this may dilute our existing stockholders.\nFurthermore, as a result of acquisitions of other healthcare businesses, we may be subject to the risk of unanticipated business\nuncertainties, regulatory and other compliance matters, or legal liabilities relating to those acquired businesses for which the sellers\nof the acquired businesses may not indemnify us, for which we may not be able to obtain insurance (or adequate insurance) or for\nwhich the indemnification may not be sufficient to cover the ultimate liabilities.\nWe have provided over $10.0 million in investments and loans to a privately-held company in Switzerland and may not be able to\nrecoup our investment.\nIn October 2020, we entered into agreements with Neo Medical SA, a privately-held Swiss-based medical technology company\ndeveloping a new generation of products for spinal surgery (“Neo Medical”). Our collaboration with Neo Medical focuses on co-\ndeveloping with them a cervical platform and deploying single-use, sterile-packed procedure solutions designed to increase\noperating room efficiencies, reduce procedural times and costs, improve patient outcomes through novel device designs and\ntechniques, and reduce infection rates. These instruments are designed for surgical settings including acute care hospitals,\noutpatient hospitals, and also ASCs. Under our agreements with Neo Medical, we will also exclusively distribute Neo Medical’s\nthoracolumbar procedure solutions to certain U.S. accounts.\nIn connection with these arrangements, we purchased $5.0 million of Neo Medical’s preferred stock and loaned CHF 4.6 million\n($5.0 million as of the issuance date) to Neo Medical pursuant to a convertible loan agreement. The loan accrues interest at an\nannual rate of 8% and is convertible by either party into additional shares of Neo Medical’s preferred stock. If not otherwise\nconverted to preferred stock in the interim, the loan and all accrued interest become due and payable in October 2024. In October\n2021, the Company entered into an additional Convertible Loan Agreement (the “Additional Convertible Loan”), pursuant to which\nthe Company loaned Neo Medical an additional CHF 0.6 million ($0.7 million as of the issuance date). In January 2022, the Company\nelected to convert the Additional Convertible Loan into shares of Neo Medical’s preferred stock.\nNeo Medical is using the proceeds of our preferred stock purchase and loans to fund its ongoing operations. However, no assurance\ncan be made that Neo Medical’s business ultimately will be successful. As such, we could ultimately be unable to recoup any value\nfor the preferred stock that we purchased and/or unable to recoup the amount of our loan.\n48\nWe may incur significant costs or retain liabilities associated with disposition activity.\nWe may from time to time sell, license, assign, or otherwise dispose of or divest assets, the stock of subsidiaries, or individual\nproducts, product lines, or technologies, which we determine are no longer desirable for us to own, some of which may be material.\nAny such activity could result in us incurring costs and expenses from these efforts, some of which could be significant. This may also\nresult in us retaining liabilities related to the assets or properties disposed of even though, for instance, the income-generating\nassets have been disposed. These costs and expenses may be incurred at any time and may have a material impact on our results of\noperations.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results and Need for Financing\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past. Our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate\nsignificantly and we may experience losses depending on a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. Such factors\ninclude:\n• economic conditions worldwide, which could affect the ability of hospitals and other customers to purchase our\nproducts and could result in a reduction in elective and non-reimbursed operative procedures;\n• increased competition;\n• market acceptance of our existing products, as well as products in development, and the demand for, and pricing of, our\nproducts and the products of our competitors;\n• costs, benefits, and timing of new product introductions;\n• the timing of or failure to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for new products;\n• lost sales and other expenses resulting from stoppages in our production or from third parties supplying our business,\nincluding as a result of product recalls or field corrective actions;\n• the availability and cost of components and materials, including raw materials such as human tissue;\n• accurate predictions of product demand and production capabilities sufficient to meet that demand;\n• our ability to realize expected yield improvements and scrap reduction initiatives that we have undertaken;\n• higher than anticipated independent sales representatives and distributors commissions;\n• our ability to purchase or manufacture and ship our products efficiently and in sufficient quantities to meet sales\ndemands;\n• the timing of our research and development expenditures;\n• expenditures for major initiatives;\n• the timing and level of reimbursement, changes in reimbursement or denials in coverage for our products by third-party\npayors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, private and public health insurers, and foreign governmental health systems;\n• the ability of our independent sales representatives and distributors to achieve expected sales targets and for new\nagents and stocking distributors to become familiar with our products in a timely manner;\n• the timing of and our ability to successfully onboard and/or hire new sales agents and distributors;\n• the loss of certain customers, sales agents, or distributors, or the removal of our contractual ability to sell to certain\ncustomers, hospitals, or healthcare providers;\n• peer-reviewed publications discussing the clinical effectiveness of our products;\n• inspections of our manufacturing facilities for compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulations (Good\nManufacturing Practices), which could result in Form 483 observations, warning letters, injunctions, or other adverse\nfindings from the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory bodies, and corrective actions, procedural changes, and other\nactions, including product recalls, that we determine are necessary or appropriate to address the results of those\ninspections, any of which may affect production and our ability to supply our customers with our products;\n49\n• the costs to comply with new regulations from the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory bodies, such as the\nrequirements to establish a unique device identification system to adequately identify medical devices through their\ndistribution and use;\n• the increased regulatory scrutiny of certain of our products, including products we manufacture for others, which could\nresult in them being removed from the market;\n• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and\n• the impact of acquisitions, including the impact of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, if future operating\nresults of the acquired businesses are significantly less than the results anticipated at the time of the acquisitions.\nIn addition, we may experience meaningful variability in our sales and gross profit among quarters, as well as within each quarter, as\na result of several factors, including but not limited to (and in addition to those listed above):\n• the number of products sold in the quarter;\n• the unpredictability of sales of full sets of spinal implants and instruments to our international stocking distributors; and\n• the number of selling days in the quarter.\nOur goodwill, intangible assets, and fixed assets are subject to potential impairment; we have recorded significant goodwill\nimpairment charges in the past and may be required to record additional charges to future earnings if our remaining goodwill or\nintangible assets become impaired.\nA significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill, intangible assets, and fixed assets. The carrying value of these assets may be\nreduced if we determine that those assets are impaired, including intangible assets from recent acquisitions.\nMost of our intangible and fixed assets have finite useful lives and are amortized or depreciated over their useful lives on a straight-\nline basis. The underlying assumptions regarding the estimated useful lives of these intangible assets are analyzed on at least an\nannual basis and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that the carrying value of the assets may not be\nrecoverable. Any such changes are adjusted through accelerated amortization, if necessary. Whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, we test intangible assets for impairment based\non estimates of future cash flows. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our\nintangible assets and/or goodwill may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, slower growth\nrates in our industry, the introduction of newer technology or competing products that may cannibalize future sales, or other\nmaterially adverse events that have implications on the profitability of our business. When testing for impairment of finite-lived\nintangible assets held for use, we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an intangible\nasset is considered to be impaired, the amount of the impairment will equal the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of\nthe asset.\nGoodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. We review our two reporting units for potential goodwill\nimpairment in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing, and more often if an event or\ncircumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a full impairment of the\nGlobal Orthopedics goodwill. This resulted in an impairment charge of $11.8 million, which is reflected within acquisition-related\namortization and remeasurement on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. If actual results differ from the assumptions and\nestimates used in the goodwill and intangible asset calculations, we could incur future impairment or amortization charges, which\ncould negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks related to foreign currency exchange rates.\nBecause some of our revenue, operating expenses, assets, and liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies, we are subject to\nforeign exchange risks that could adversely affect our operations and reported results. To the extent that we incur expenses or\nrecognize net sales in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, any change in the values of those foreign currencies relative to the U.S.\nDollar could cause our profits to decrease or our products to be less competitive against those of our competitors. To the extent that\nour current assets denominated in foreign currency are greater or less than our current liabilities denominated in foreign currencies,\nwe have potential foreign exchange exposure. The fluctuations of foreign exchange rates during 2023 had a favorable impact of $2.3\nmillion on net sales outside of the U.S. Although we seek to manage our foreign currency exposure by matching non-dollar revenues\nand expenses, exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future. To\nminimize such exposures, we may enter into currency hedges from time to time.\n50\nIn addition, for those foreign customers who purchase our products in U.S. Dollars, currency exchange rate fluctuations between the\nU.S. Dollar and the currencies in which those customers do business may have a negative effect on the demand for our products in\nforeign countries where the U.S. Dollar has increased in value compared to the local currency. Converting our earnings from\ninternational operations to U.S. Dollars for use in the U.S. can also raise challenges, including problems moving funds out of the\ncountries in which the funds were earned and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in foreign countries where the usual\naccounts receivable payment cycle is longer.\nOur global operations may expose us to tax risks.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment and interpretation of tax laws are\nrequired to estimate our tax liabilities. Tax laws and rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change as a result of\npolitical and economic conditions. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in those tax laws, changes in\nthe mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, vesting of equity\nawards at a price below the original valuation, historical entity classification elections, and the resolution of matters arising from tax\naudits.\nBeginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures\nimmediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years, or 15 years for such\nexpenditures incurred outside of the U.S. This requirement may have a significant impact on our cash tax liability and our effective\ntax rate as we perform research and development in the U.S., Italy, and Canada.\nCertain of our subsidiaries sell products directly to other Orthofix subsidiaries or provide marketing and support services to other\nOrthofix subsidiaries. These intercompany sales and support services involve subsidiaries operating in jurisdictions with differing tax\nrates and we must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex\nincome tax regulations. Tax authorities in these jurisdictions may challenge our treatment of such intercompany transactions. If we\nare unsuccessful in defending our treatment of intercompany transactions, we may be subject to additional tax liability, interest, or\npenalty, which could adversely affect our profitability and operating cash flow.\nWe maintain a $150.0 million financing agreement secured by a pledge of substantially all of our property.\nOn November 6, 2023, we, as borrower, and certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a Financing Agreement (the\n“Financing Agreement”) with Blue Torch Finance LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and certain lenders party thereto.\nThe Financing Agreement provides for a $100.0 million senior secured term loan (the “Initial Term Loan”), a $25.0 million senior\nsecured delayed draw term loan facility (the “Delayed Draw Term Loan”), and a $25.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility\n(the “Revolving Credit Facility,” and together with the Initial Term Loan and the Delayed Draw Term Loan, the “Credit Facilities”),\neach of which mature on November 6, 2027. In connection with entering into the Financing Agreement, we repaid in full amounts\noutstanding and terminated all commitments under our prior credit agreement (which had a maturity date of October 25, 2024).\nThe Initial Term Loan was fully funded on November 6, 2023. As of the date of this filing (March 5, 2024), we had not made any\nborrowings under the Delayed Draw Term Loan, but had borrowed $15.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nBorrowings under the Financing Agreement were and may be used for, among other things, (i) the repayment in full of amount that\nwe had outstanding under our prior credit agreement, (ii) working capital and (iii) other general corporate purposes. Borrowings\nunder the Credit Facilities bear interest at a floating rate, which will be, at our option, either the three-month SOFR rate (subject to a\nfloor of 3.00% and a credit spread adjustment of 0.26161%) (the “Adjusted Term SOFR Rate”) plus an applicable margin of 7.25%, or\na base rate plus an applicable margin of 6.25%. A revolving unused line fee of 2.00% is payable monthly in arrears based on the\naverage amount of the undrawn portion of each lender’s revolving credit commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility for the\npreceding month. A delayed draw unused fee equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus a margin of 1.00% is payable monthly in\narrears based on the average amount of the undrawn portion of each lender’s delayed draw term loan commitments in respect of\nthe Delayed Draw Term Loan for the preceding month. Certain of our existing and future material subsidiaries (collectively, the\n“Guarantors”) are required to guarantee the repayment of our obligations under the Financing Agreement. Our obligations and each\nof the Guarantors with respect to the Financing Agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets and the assets of\neach of the Guarantors, including, without limitation, accounts receivables, deposit accounts, intellectual property, investment\nproperty, inventory, equipment, and equity interests in their respective subsidiaries.\nThe Financing Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on our and our subsidiaries'\nability to incur additional debt, grant or permit additional liens, make investments and acquisitions, merge or consolidate with\nothers, dispose of assets, pay dividends and distributions, pay subordinated indebtedness, and enter into affiliate transactions. In\naddition, the Financing Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum level of liquidity at all times, a\nmaximum consolidated leverage ratio (measured on a quarterly basis), and a minimum asset coverage ratio (measured on a monthly\n51\nbasis). The Financing Agreement also includes events of default customary for facilities of this type and upon the occurrence of such\nevents of default, subject to customary cure rights, all outstanding loans under the Credit Facilities may be accelerated and/or the\nlenders’ commitments terminated.\nWe believe that we will be in compliance with the covenants in future fiscal quarters. However, there can be no assurance that we\nwill be in such compliance, and if we are not, the failure to do so could result in an event of default, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our financial position in the event that we continue to have significant amounts drawn under the facility at such\ntime.\nWe must maintain high levels of inventory, which could consume a significant amount of our resources and reduce our cash flows.\nBecause we maintain substantial inventory levels to meet the needs of our customers, we are subject to the risk of inventory excess,\nobsolescence, and shelf-life expiration. Many of our spinal implant products come in sets. Each set includes a significant number of\ncomponents in various sizes so that the physician may select the appropriate spinal implant based on the patient’s needs. In a typical\nsurgery, not all of the implants in the set are used, and therefore certain sizes of implants placed in the set or that we purchase for\nreplenishment inventory may become obsolete before they can be used. In addition, to market our products effectively, we often\nmust provide hospitals and independent sales agents with consigned sets that typically consist of spinal implants and instruments,\nincluding products to ensure redundancy and products of different sizes. Further, our biologics products have expiration dates,\nwhich range from one to five years, and these products may expire before they can be used. If a substantial portion of our inventory\nis deemed excess, becomes obsolete, or expires, it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows due to the\nresulting costs associated with the inventory impairment charges and costs required to replace such inventory. Further, as we\nincreasingly launch new products and product systems, we may cannibalize older products and product systems, which could\nexacerbate excess and obsolete charges.\nWe may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions, and such financing\nmay not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions. The capital and\ncredit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption, which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both\nborrowers and investors, and we may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate\nfunds are not available to us on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop or enhance products, or respond to\ncompetitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we raise\ncapital by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities, we may be subject to limitations on our operations due to restrictive\ncovenants.\nWe hold our cash and cash equivalents that we use to meet our working capital and operating expense needs in deposit accounts\nthat could be adversely affected if the financial institutions holding such funds fail.\nWe hold our cash and cash equivalents used to meet our working capital and operating expense needs in deposit accounts at\nmultiple financial institutions. The balance held in these accounts typically exceeds the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(\"FDIC\") standard deposit insurance limit or similar government guarantee schemes. If a financial institution in which we hold such\nfunds fails or is subject to significant adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets, we could be subject to a risk of loss of all\nor a portion of such uninsured funds or be subject to a delay in accessing all or a portion of such uninsured funds. Any such loss or\nlack of access to these funds could adversely impact our short-term liquidity and ability to meet our operating expense obligations.\nFor example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (\"SVB\"), and Signature Bank, were closed by state regulators and the FDIC was\nappointed receiver for each bank. The FDIC created successor bridge banks and all deposits of SVB and Signature Bank were\ntransferred to the bridge banks under a systemic risk exception approved by the United States Department of Treasury, the Federal\nReserve, and the FDIC. If financial institutions in which we hold funds for working capital and operating expenses were to fail, we\ncannot provide any assurances that such governmental agencies would take action to protect our uninsured deposits in a similar\nmanner.\nGeneral Risks\nOur stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, which may make future prices of our stock difficult to predict.\nInvestors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, results of operations, or\ncash flows. Our stock price, like that of other medical device companies, can be volatile and can be affected by, among other things:\nspeculation, coverage, or sentiment in the media or the investment community; the announcement of new, planned or\n52\ncontemplated products, services, technological innovations, acquisitions, divestitures, or other significant transactions by us or our\ncompetitors; our quarterly financial results and comparisons to estimates by the investment community or financial outlook\nprovided by us; the financial results and business strategies of our competitors; publication of research reports about us or our\nindustry or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts; changes in laws or regulations\naffecting our business, including tax legislation; changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles;\nthreatened or actual litigation or governmental investigations; and inflation; market volatility or downturns caused by outbreaks,\nepidemics, pandemics, geopolitical tensions or conflicts, or other macroeconomic dynamics. General or industry specific market\nconditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our\nperformance also may affect the price of our stock.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the stocks of medical device companies in particular, have experienced extreme price\nand volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. This\ncould limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common\nstock. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall\nmarket and in the market price of a company’s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs,\ndivert our management’s attention and resources, and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe expend substantial resources to comply with laws and regulations relating to public companies, and any failure to maintain\ncompliance could subject us to regulatory scrutiny and cause investors to lose confidence in our company, which could harm our\nbusiness and have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nLaws and regulations affecting public companies, including provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act of 2010 and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, and by the\nNasdaq Stock Market increase our accounting, legal, and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming\nand costly. We cannot predict or estimate with any reasonable accuracy the total amount or timing of the costs we may incur to\ncomply with these laws and regulations.\nWe are also subject to SEC regulations that require us to determine whether our products contain certain specified minerals,\nreferred to under the regulations as “conflict minerals,” and, if so, to perform an extensive inquiry into our supply chain, to\ndetermine whether such conflict minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. Compliance\nwith these regulations has increased our costs and has been time-consuming for our management and our supply chain personnel\n(and time-consuming for our suppliers), and we expect that continued compliance will continue to require significant money and\ntime. In addition, to the extent any of our disclosures are perceived by the market to be “negative,” it may cause customers to\nrefuse to purchase our products. Further, if we determine to make any changes to products, processes, or sources of supply, it may\nresult in additional costs, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designates certain courts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be\ninitiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest\nextent permitted by applicable law: (A) the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of\nDelaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, or, if both the Court of Chancery of the State\nof Delaware and the Superior Court of the State of Delaware lack subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Delaware) and any state (or, if applicable, federal) appellate court therefrom shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i)\nany derivative action, suit, or proceeding brought on behalf of our company, (ii) any action, suit, or proceeding asserting a claim of\nbreach of fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, or other employee, or stockholder of ours to our company\nor our stockholders or any action asserting a claim for aiding and abetting any such breach of fiduciary duty, (iii) any action, suit, or\nproceeding asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees arising pursuant to, or seeking to\nenforce any right, obligation, or remedy under, any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (the “DGCL”) or our\n(certificate of incorporation or bylaws, (iv) any action, suit, or proceeding as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of\nChancery of the State of Delaware, or (v) any action, suit, or proceeding asserting a claim against us or our current or former\ndirectors, officers, employees, or stockholders governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases subject to the court’s having\npersonal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants (including personal jurisdiction by reason of any such\nindispensable party’s consent to personal jurisdiction in the State of Delaware or such court); and (B) the federal district courts of\nthe United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended. These provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to obtain a judicial forum that such\nstockholder may prefer for disputes governed by these provisions.\n53\nEnvironmental, social, and corporate governance (“ESG”) regulations, policies and provisions may make our supply chain more\ncomplex and may adversely affect our relationships with customers.\nThere is an increasing focus on the governance of environmental and social risks. A number of our customers who are payors or\ndistributors have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that include ESG provisions that their suppliers or manufacturers\nmust comply with, or they may seek to include such provisions in their terms and conditions. An increasing number of participants in\nthe medical device industry are also joining voluntary ESG groups or organizations, such as the Responsible Business Alliance. These\nESG provisions and initiatives are subject to change, can be unpredictable, and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with,\ngiven the complexity of our supply chain and the outsourced manufacturing of certain components of our products. If we are unable\nto comply, or are unable to cause our suppliers to comply, with such policies or provisions, a customer may stop purchasing products\nfrom us, and may take legal action against us, which could harm our reputation, revenue, and results of operations.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by corporate citizenship and ESG matters and/or our reporting of such matters.\nThere is an increasing focus from certain investors, customers, consumers, and other stakeholders concerning corporate citizenship\nand sustainability matters. We could be perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters. Our business could be\nnegatively impacted by such matters. Any such matters, or related corporate citizenship and sustainability matters, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe have implemented cybersecurity programs designed to maintain and protect our information technology systems and the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. These programs serve to maintain compliance with applicable laws and\nregulations governing ethical business practices, including our relationships with suppliers, customers, and business partners.\nWe maintain formal processes for our cybersecurity program and incident response procedures, which are updated at least annually\nand reviewed by external legal and cybersecurity advisors. These processes include, among other things, detailed steps on how we\nassess cyber risks, identify threats, and determine the materiality of cyber incidents. These processes also designate certain roles\nwithin the company to execute these policies and certain leadership roles to manage material risk escalation. These processes\nendeavor to follow the National Institute of Standards and Technology (\"NIST\") Cybersecurity Framework and are tested at least\nannually.\nOur Information Security team uses automated technology, third-party partners, and direct review of system indicators to monitor\nand implement the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents, and to stay current with the\nchanging threat landscape. We also leverage encryption technologies and other measures to safeguard systems. We engage third\nparties as part of our cyber program, including external security firms that provide security technology, conduct regular security\naudits, and conduct penetration testing. We also engage third parties to conduct regular drills, such as tabletop exercises, to help\nwith our overall preparedness.\nWe also engage third-party service providers to assist with managing various other aspects of our business. We have implemented\nprocesses designed to both assess and maintain oversight of third-party service providers with regards to cybersecurity risks. These\nservice providers are subject to due diligence reviews of their information security programs during our vendor evaluation process.\nOur employees are responsible for complying with our data security standards and are required to complete annual training to\nunderstand the behaviors and technical requirements necessary to keep data secure. We also require that cybersecurity training be\npart of the onboarding process for new hires.\nAs of December 31, 2023, cybersecurity risks have not materially affected our business strategy, results of operations, or financial\ncondition.\nGovernance\nCybersecurity is an important component of our enterprise risk management program. While the full Board of Directors has primary\nresponsibility for risk oversight, the Board of Directors utilizes its committees, as appropriate, to monitor and address the risks that\n54\nmay be within the scope of a particular committee’s expertise or charter. The Board of Directors receives updates at quarterly board\nmeetings on committee activities from each committee Chair.\nThe Audit and Finance Committee has oversight over and regularly reviews our cybersecurity, including IT risks, controls,\nprocedures, and plans to mitigate cybersecurity risks and respond to security incidents. The Audit and Finance Committee receives\nreports on at least a quarterly basis from the Chief Information Officer and the Vice President, Information Security, on, among\nother issues, our cyber risks and threats, the status of projects, management’s strategies to strengthen our IT systems, assessments\nof our security program, third-party assessments and testing, our emerging threat landscape, and the review of our cybersecurity\ninsurance policy. Pursuant to our incident response procedures, material cyber incidents will be reported to the Chair of the Audit\nand Finance Committee upon a determination of material status. Due to the importance of cybersecurity, the full Board of Directors\nalso receives updates on cybersecurity matters from management at least annually.\nManagement is responsible for our company’s day-to-day risk management activities. Our cybersecurity program is led by our Chief\nInformation Officer, who is responsible for assessing and managing cybersecurity risks. He has 25 years of experience in both military\nand corporate leadership roles, including 12 years of experience in CIO-level leadership roles, including consulting with major firms,\ncovering technology and security operations responsibility.\nOur Vice President, Information Security, who reports to our Chief Information Officer, is responsible for cybersecurity program\nexecution, risk management, and oversight of information security staff and consultants. She has 20 years of experience in IT roles,\nincluding 13 years in IT leadership roles and 5 years in cybersecurity program execution and oversight of information security.\nOur Manager, Information Security, who reports to our Vice President, Information Security, is responsible for managing our security\nanalyst team and the tactical execution of security operations. He has nine years of experience in security roles, including seven\nyears in technical system administration roles. He also has the following certifications: ISC2 CCSP, ISC2 SSCP, CompTIA Security+, EC-\nCouncil Certified Encryption Specialist (\"ECES\"), EC-Council Certified Incident Handler (\"ECCIH\").\nAs cybersecurity risks arise, our Information Security team executes the incident response procedure and communicates the\nappropriate details to management in alignment with the escalation steps in the procedure. In addition, our Chief Information\nOfficer, Vice President, Information Security, and Manager, Information Security, conduct monthly cybersecurity program status\nreviews with the Information Security team that includes KPI tracking, risk assessment, escalation actions, and project status.\nItem 2.

The primary metric used in managing the Company\nis adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\", a non-GAAP financial measure) (which\nis described further in Note 16 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report).\n63\nThe following table presents adjusted EBITDA by segment and reconciles consolidated adjusted EBITDA to loss before income taxes:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nAdjusted EBITDA by reporting segment\nGlobal Spine $ 91,115 $ 62,692 $ 71,086\nGlobal Orthopedics 442 5,267 9,260\nCorporate (45,272) (19,406) (19,084)\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA $ 46,285 $ 48,553 $ 61,262\nReconciling items:\nInterest expense, net $ 8,631 $ 1,288 $ 1,837\nDepreciation and amortization 53,063 29,019 41,355\nShare-based compensation expense 35,707 18,443 15,432\nForeign exchange impact (1,581) 3,291 3,981\nSeaSpine merger-related costs 36,623 12,010 —\nStrategic investments 2,272 4,018 5,700\nAcquisition-related fair value adjustments 33,393 (15,595) (2,014)\n(Gain) loss on investments 1,781 187 (644)\nLitigation and investigation costs 14,453 803 33\nMedical device regulation 9,446 10,261 8,018\nBusiness interruption - COVID-19 — 2,387 320\nSuccession charges 1,176 147 739\nLoss before income taxes $ (148,679) $ (17,706) $ (13,495)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at December 31, 2023, was $37.8 million compared to $50.7 million at December 31,\n2022.\nYear Ended December, 31,\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022 Change\nNet cash from operating activities $ (45,753) $ (11,538) $ (34,215)\nNet cash from investing activities (33,131) (24,534) (8,597)\nNet cash from financing activities 65,322 (78) 65,400\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and restricted cash 619 (997) 1,616\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ (12,943) $ (37,147) $ 24,204\nThe following table presents free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, which is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures\nfrom net cash from operating activities.\nYear Ended December, 31,\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022 Change\nNet cash from operating activities $ (45,753) $ (11,538) $ (34,215)\nCapital expenditures (62,050) (23,160) (38,890)\nFree cash flow $ (107,803) $ (34,698) $ (73,105)\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities decreased $34.2 million\n• Unfavorable change in net loss of $24.4 million, excluding the impact of non-cash adjustments to net loss\n• Unfavorable change of $9.8 million relating to changes in working capital accounts, primarily attributable to changes in\ninventory levels, partially offset by recoupment activities associated with the CMS Accelerated and Advance Payment\nProgram in prior year and favorable changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities\n64\nTwo of our primary working capital accounts are accounts receivable and inventory. Day’s sales in receivables were 59 days at\nDecember 31, 2023, compared to 62 days at December 31, 2022 (calculated using fourth quarter net sales and ending accounts\nreceivable). Inventory turns were consistent at 1.2 times as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows from investing activities decreased $8.6 million\n• Primarily driven by an increase of $38.9 million in capital expenditures, largely due to the inclusion of SeaSpine's financial\nresults within the 2023 financial results\n• Partially offset by an increase of $29.4 million attributable to cash acquired as a result of the Merger\n• Further offset by a favorable change of $0.9 million associated with certain asset acquisitions and other investing activities\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows from financing activities increased $65.4 million\n• Increase of $95.5 million in net borrowings associated with proceeds from our new Financing Agreement during 2023,\nborrowings made under our Prior Credit Agreement, and the repayment of our Prior Credit Agreement upon execution of\nthe Financing Agreement\n• Increase of $2.0 million related to the conclusion of the Fitbone Contract Manufacturing and Supple Agreement with\nWittenstein in 2022, which was accounted for as a finance lease obligation\n• Partially offset by a decrease of $26.9 million associated with the termination and repayment of SeaSpine's credit facility\n• Further offset by a decrease of $2.7 million for tax withholdings obligations from shares traded and a decrease in other\nfinancing activities of $2.3 million\nCredit Facilities\nOn November 6, 2023, we entered into a Financing Agreement (the \"Financing Agreement\") with Blue Torch Finance LLC and certain\nlenders party thereto, which provides for a $100.0 million senior secured term loan (the \"Initial Term Loan\"), a $25.0 million senior\nsecured delayed draw term loan facility (the \"Delayed Draw Term Loan\") which, subject to certain conditions specified in the\nFinancing Agreement, may be drawn on or prior to March 30, 2024, and a $25.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the\n\"Revolving Credit Facility\", and together with the Initial Term Loan and the Delayed Draw Term Loan, the \"Credit Facilities\"), each of\nwhich mature on November 6, 2027. In connection with entering into the Financing Agreement, we repaid in full amounts\noutstanding and terminated all commitments under the prior $175.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility evidenced by\nthat certain Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Prior Credit Agreement\"), dated as of October 25, 2019.\nBorrowings under the Financing Agreement were and may be used for, among other things, the repayment in full of the Prior Credit\nAgreement, working capital and other general corporate purposes of the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have $100.0 million outstanding borrowings under the Financing Agreement related to the Initial Term\nLoan. As of December 31, 2023, we have not made any borrowings under the Delayed Draw Term Loan or the Revolving Credit\nFacility. However, on January 10, 2024, we borrowed $15.0 million under the $25.0 million secured revolving credit facility for\nworking capital purposes. In addition, we intend to utilize the Delayed Draw Term Loan following the completion of the audit of\nfinancial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. For additional information regarding the credit facility, see Note 11 of\nthe Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nWe have no outstanding borrowings on our Italian line of credit of €5.5 million ($6.1 million) as of December 31, 2023. This\nunsecured line of credit provides us the option to borrow amounts in Italy at rates which are determined at the time of borrowing.\nOther\nFor information regarding Contingencies, see Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual\nReport.\nLattus Spine LLC (\"Lattus\") Contingent Consideration\nIn connection with the Merger, we assumed a contingent consideration obligation under a purchase agreement between SeaSpine\nand Lattus executed in December 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, we may be required to make installment payments at\n65\ncertain dates based on future net sales of certain products (the \"Lateral Products\"). The estimated fair value of the contingent\nconsideration arrangement as of December 31, 2023, was $8.5 million; however, the actual amount ultimately paid could be higher\nor lower than the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration. As of December 31, 2023, we classified the remaining\ncontingent consideration liability within other long-term liabilities. For additional discussion of this matter, see Note 12 of the Notes\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nLegion Innovations, LLC Asset Acquisition\nOn December 29, 2022, we entered into a technology assignment and royalty agreement with Legion Innovations, LLC, a U.S.-based\nmedical device technology company, whereby we acquired intellectual property rights to certain assets. As consideration, we paid\n$0.2 million in January 2023, with additional payments contingent upon reaching future commercialization and revenue-based\nmilestones.\nIGEA S.p.A Exclusive License and Distribution Agreement\nIn April 2021, we entered into an Exclusive License and Distribution Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with IGEA S.p.A (“IGEA”),\nan Italian manufacturer and distributor of bone and cartilage stimulation systems. Per the terms of the License Agreement, we have\nthe exclusive right to sell IGEA products in the U.S. and Canada. As consideration for the License Agreement, we agreed to pay up to\n$4.0 million, of which $0.5 million was paid in 2021, with certain payments contingent upon achieving an FDA milestone.\nIn May 2022, we achieved FDA approval pertaining to the acquired technology, triggering a contingent consideration milestone\nobligation of $3.5 million. Of this amount, $1.5 million was paid in 2022, $1.0 million was paid in May 2023, and $1.0 million was\naccrued within other current liabilities as of December 31, 2023.\nUnremitted Foreign Earnings\nUnremitted foreign earnings were $33.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company’s investment in foreign subsidiaries\ncontinues to be indefinite in nature; however, the Company may periodically repatriate a portion of these earnings to the extent\nthat it does not incur significant additional tax liability.\nContractual Obligations\nAs a result of our operations, we are subject to certain contractual obligations with material cash requirements. Our material\ncontractual obligations include, but are not limited to (i) our contingent consideration arrangement under a purchase agreement\nbetween SeaSpine and Lattus assumed in the Merger, (ii) contingent consideration arrangements associated with certain asset\nacquisitions or business combinations, of which material obligations are described above, (iii) operating lease and finance lease\nobligations, and (iv) uncertain tax positions.\nRefer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a further description of our\ncontingent consideration arrangements (Notes 12 and 17), lease obligations (Note 9), and uncertain tax positions (Note 20).\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current\nor future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, cash flows,\nliquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to investors. In addition, we do not consider the backlog of firm\norders to be material.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion of operating results is based upon the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The preparation of\nthese statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and\nexpenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, which are based on historical experience\nand various other assumptions that management believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at that point in time. Actual\nresults may differ, significantly at times, from these estimates.\nWe believe the estimates described below are the most critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements. We have\nreviewed these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\n66\nRevenue Recognition\nThe process for recognizing revenue involves significant assumptions and judgments for certain of our revenue streams. Revenue\nrecognition policies are “critical accounting estimates” because changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimates could\nmaterially affect key financial measures, including net sales, gross margin, operating income, adjusted EBITDA, and net income.\nBone Growth Therapies revenue is largely attributable to the U.S. and is comprised of third-party payor transactions and wholesale\nrevenue.\nFor revenue derived from third-party payors, including commercial insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations, preferred\nprovider organizations, and governmental payors, such as Medicare, in connection with the sale of our Bone Growth Therapies\nproducts, we recognize revenue when the stimulation product is fitted to and accepted by the patient and all applicable documents\nthat are required by the third-party payor have been obtained. Amounts paid by these third-party payors are generally based on\nfixed or allowable reimbursement rates. These revenues are recorded at the expected or preauthorized reimbursement rates, net of\nany contractual allowances or adjustments. Certain billings are subject to review by the third-party payors and may be subject to\nadjustment.\nWholesale revenue is related to the sale of our Bone Growth Therapies products directly to physicians and other healthcare\nproviders. Wholesale revenues are recognized upon shipment and receipt of a confirming purchase order, which is when the\ncustomer obtains control of the promised goods.\nBiologics revenue is largely attributable to the U.S. and is mostly processed from within our Irvine facility. In addition, we have a\nlong-standing collaborative arrangement with MTF that provides exclusive global marketing rights to MTF's Trinity and FiberFuse\nproduct families. We receive marketing fees from MTF based on sales of products covered under the collaborative arrangement.\nMTF is considered the principal in these arrangements; therefore, we recognize these marketing service fees on a net basis upon\nshipment of the product to the customer and receipt of a confirming purchase order.\nSpinal Implants and Global Orthopedics products are distributed world-wide, with U.S. sales largely comprised of commercial\nrevenue and international sales derived from commercial sales and through stocking distributor arrangements.\nCommercial revenue is largely related to the sale of our Spinal Implants and Global Orthopedics products to hospital customers.\nCommercial revenues are recognized when these products have been utilized and a confirming purchase order has been received\nfrom the hospital.\nStocking distributors purchase our products and then re-sell them directly to customers, such as hospitals. Revenue derived from\nstocking distributor arrangements is recognized upon shipment and receipt of a confirming purchase order, which is when the\ndistributor obtains control of the promised goods. The transaction price is estimated based upon our historical collection experience\nwith the stocking distributor. This percentage, which is specific to each stocking distributor, is then used to calculate the transaction\nprice. Cost of sales is also recorded upon transfer of control of the product to the customer, which is when our performance\nobligation has been satisfied.\nAllowance for Expected Credit Losses and Contractual Allowances\nThe process for estimating the ultimate collection of accounts receivable involves significant assumptions and judgments. The\ndetermination of the contractual life of accounts receivable, the aging of outstanding receivables, as well as the historical\ncollections, write-offs, and payor reimbursement experience over the estimated contractual lives of such receivables, are integral\nparts of the estimation process related to reserves for expected credit losses and the establishment of contractual allowances.\nAccounts receivable are analyzed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of both reserves for expected credit losses and\ncontractual allowances. Revisions in allowances for expected credit loss estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt\nexpense within sales and marketing expenses. Revisions to contractual allowances are recorded as an adjustment to net sales. These\nestimates are periodically tested against actual collection experience. In addition, we analyze our receivables by geography and by\ncustomer type, where appropriate, in developing estimates for expected credit losses.\nWe believe our allowance for credit losses is sufficient to cover customer credit risks; however, a 10% change in our allowance for\ncredit losses as of December 31, 2023, would result in an increase or decrease to sales and marketing expense of $0.7 million.\nAdditionally, we believe our estimate to establish contractual allowances is sufficient to cover customer credit risks; however, a 10%\nchange in our reserve for contractual allowances as of December 31, 2023, would result in an increase or decrease to net sales of\n$0.4 million. Our allowance for credit losses and estimation of contractual allowances are “critical accounting estimates” because\nchanges in the assumptions used to develop the estimates could materially affect key financial measures, including net sales, gross\nmargin, operating income, adjusted EBITDA, net income, and accounts receivable.\n67\nInventory Allowances\nReserves for excess, slow moving, and obsolete inventory are calculated as the difference between the cost of inventory and market\nvalue, and are based on assumptions and judgments about new product launch periods, overall product life cycles, forecasted\ndemand, and market conditions. In the event of a decrease in demand for our products, excess product production, or a higher\nincidence of inventory obsolescence, we could be required to increase our inventory reserves, which would increase cost of sales\nand decrease gross profit. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs. If conditions or assumptions used in\ndetermining the market value or forecasted demand change, additional inventory adjustments in the future may be necessary. Our\ninventory allowance is a “critical accounting estimate” because changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimate could\nmaterially affect key financial measures, including gross profit, operating income, adjusted EBITDA, net income, and inventory.\nValuation of Intangible Assets\nOur intangible assets are comprised primarily of patents, acquired or developed technology, in-process research and development\n(“IPR&D”), customer relationships, trade names, trademarks, and licensing arrangements. We make significant judgments in relation\nto the valuation of intangible assets resulting from business combinations or asset acquisitions. Intangible assets acquired in a\nbusiness combination that are used for IPR&D activities are considered to have indefinite lives until the completion or abandonment\nof the associated project. Upon reaching the end of the relevant project, we will either amortize the acquired IPR&D over its\nestimated useful life or expense the acquired IPR&D should the project be unsuccessful with no future alternative use.\nSignificant judgment is required related to the forecasting of future operating results within our discounted cash flow valuation\nmodels to determine the valuation of intangible assets. Key assumptions include the anticipated useful lives of acquired intangibles,\nthe projected cash flows associated with each intangible asset, the estimated probability of success for acquired IPR&D projects, and\nprojected growth rates and discount rates. It is possible that significant changes in plans or assumptions may affect the\nrecoverability of these assets and could potentially result in impairment. Our valuation of intangible assets is a “critical accounting\nestimate” because changes in the assumptions used to develop these estimates could materially affect key financial measures,\nincluding operating income and net income.\nGoodwill\nOur goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired from business combinations. The determination of\nthe value of goodwill and intangible assets arising from business combinations requires extensive use of accounting estimates and\njudgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired.\nWe test goodwill at least annually for impairment, and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist. These\nindicators include, among others, significant declines in sales, earnings, or cash flows, or the development of a material adverse\nchange in the business climate. Assessing goodwill impairment involves a high degree of judgment due to the estimates and\nassumptions used. We believe the estimates and assumptions involved in the impairment assessment to be critical because\nsignificant changes in such estimates and assumptions could materially affect key financial measures, including operating income\nand net income.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed a quantitative assessment for our annual goodwill impairment analysis. Upon\nestimating the fair value of each of reporting unit, we determined the Global Orthopedics reporting unit’s fair value was less than its\ncarrying value of net assets. This resulted in recording a full impairment of the Global Orthopedics goodwill of $11.8 million, which\nwas reflected within Acquisition-related amortization and remeasurement for the year ended December 31, 2021. The assessment\nconcluded there were no indicators of impairment for the Global Spine goodwill.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a qualitative assessment for our annual goodwill impairment analysis, which did not\nresult in an impairment charge. This qualitative analysis considered all relevant factors specific to the reporting units, including\nmacroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and relevant entity-specific events.\nIn the third quarter of 2023, we announced the termination of the former President and Chief Executive Officer, former Chief\nFinancial Officer, and former Chief Legal Officer, from their respective roles. Immediately following the announcement, our market\ncapitalization decreased by approximately 30%, indicating that an impairment may exist. As a result, we performed an interim\nquantitative assessment of our goodwill as of September 30, 2023. Upon performing our assessment, we determined the Global\nSpine reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value as of September 30, 2023.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a qualitative assessment for our goodwill impairment analysis, which did not result in\nan impairment charge. This quantitative analysis considered all relevant factors specific to the reporting units, including\nmacroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and relevant entity-specific events.\n68\nWe estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a weighted average of fair value derived from both an income approach and\na market approach. The fair value measurements are based on significant inputs that are unobservable in the market, with key\nassumptions including, but not limited to, our forecasted future net sales and expenses, terminal growth rates, discount rates\napplied, and allocation of corporate-level expenses to each reporting unit. Significant changes in these assumptions could result in a\nsignificantly higher or lower fair value, which in turn can affect the ultimate conclusion regarding if goodwill is impaired.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or\nmost advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.\nThe two most significant items that are or were recorded at fair value as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, include (i) contingent\nconsideration attributable to Lattus and (ii) our convertible loan agreements with Neo Medical.\nThe contingent consideration obligation consists of future installment payments at certain dates based on future net sales of Lateral\nProducts. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement as of December 31, 2023, was $8.5 million;\nhowever, the actual amount ultimately paid could be higher or lower than the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration.\nThe estimated fair value of the Lattus contingent consideration is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation and a discounted cash\nflow model requiring significant inputs which are not observable in the market. The significant inputs include assumptions related to\nthe timing and probability of certain product launch dates, estimated future sales of the products, revenue risk-adjusted discount\nrate, revenue volatility, and discount rates matched to the timing of payments.\nWe estimate the fair value of our convertible loan agreements with Neo Medical using option-pricing models and a probability-\nweighted discounted cash flow model. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are unobservable in the\nmarket, with significant unobservable inputs including applicable discount rates, implied volatility, the likelihood and projected\ntiming of repayment or conversion, and projected cash flows in support of the estimated enterprise value of Neo Medical. Significant\nchanges in these assumptions could result in a significantly higher or lower fair value. Holding other inputs constant, an increase of\nthe present value factor by 5% would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of the convertible loan of $0.5 million, whereas a\ndecrease of the present value factor by 5% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of the convertible loan by $0.2\nmillion.\nOur fair value measurements are a \"critical accounting estimate\" because changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimate\ncould materially affect key financial measures, including operating income and net income.\nOther Fair Value Measurements Utilized in Purchase Accounting\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination or asset acquisition are recorded at fair value as of the date of\nacquisition. Common adjustments to historical carrying values recognized for such assets or liabilities include (i) adjusting the basis\nof acquired inventory from net realizable value to fair value, (ii) adjusting acquired plant, property, and equipment, net of any\nhistorical accumulated depreciation, to the asset’s estimated fair value, and (iii) the remeasurement of right-of-use assets and\nassumed lease liabilities. The determination of the acquisition date fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires\nmanagement's judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to future expected\ncash flows, useful lives, and discount rates.\nAs part of the Merger, we acquired SeaSpine's inventory, including raw materials, work-in-process (\"WIP\"), and finished goods. Raw\nmaterials had not been subjected to any manufacturing processes that would add additional value, therefore we determined book\nvalue is representative of fair value. We assessed the fair value of the WIP and finished goods inventory using the comparative sales\nmethod. The estimated step-up in fair value on acquired inventory recognized in connection with the Merger was $48.2 million. As\nof December 31, 2023, the unamortized step-up in fair value on acquired inventory remaining was $12.2 million.\nWe estimated the fair value of the various classes of property, plant, and equipment acquired using the income approach, sales\ncomparison approach, and the cost approach. The estimated fair value of property, plant, and equipment acquired in connection\nwith the Merger was $68.9 million.\nIntangible assets primarily included customer relationships, developed technology, and in-process research and development.\nDetermining the fair value of intangible assets acquired as part of purchase accounting requires us to make significant estimates.\nThese estimates include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, royalty savings, and the discount rate used to\ndiscount those cash flows to present value.\nWe estimated the fair value of acquired right-of-use assets and assumed lease liabilities acquired in connection with the Merger\nusing the yield capitalization method of the income approach. Acquired right-of-use assets and assumed lease liabilities are\nmeasured based on the remaining lease payments over the remaining portion of the lease term. As our leases do not provide an\n69\nimplicit rate, our incremental borrowing rate is used as a discount rate, based on the information available as of the acquisition date,\nin determining the present value of lease payments.\nThese fair value measurements are a “critical accounting estimate” because changes in the assumptions used to develop the\nestimate could materially affect key financial measures, including operating income and net income.\nLitigation and Contingent Liabilities\nFrom time to time, we are parties to or targets of lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings, including product liability, personal\ninjury, patent and intellectual property, health and safety, and employment and healthcare regulatory matters, which are handled\nand defended in the ordinary course of business. These lawsuits, investigations, or proceedings could involve a substantial number\nof claims and could also have an adverse impact on our reputation and customer base. Although we maintain various liability\ninsurance programs for liabilities that could result from such lawsuits, investigations, or proceedings, we are self-insured for a\nsignificant portion of such liabilities.\nWe accrue for such claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The\nassessments of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable,\noften involve a series of complex judgments about future events. Among the factors that we consider in this assessment are the\nnature of existing legal proceedings, investigations, and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if reasonably\nestimable), the progress of the matter, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, the\ninvolvement of the U.S. Government and its agencies in such proceedings, our experience in similar matters and the experience of\nother companies, the facts available to us at the time of assessment, and how we intend to respond, or have responded, to the\nproceeding, investigation or claim. Our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings, investigations\nor claims progress. For matters where we are not currently able to reasonably estimate the range of reasonably possible loss, the\nfactors that have contributed to this determination include the following: (i) the damages sought are indeterminate, or an\ninvestigation has not manifested itself in a filed civil or criminal complaint, (ii) the matters are in the early stages, (iii) the matters\ninvolve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties, and/or (iv) discussions\nwith the government or other parties in matters that may be expected ultimately to be resolved through negotiation and settlement\nhave not reached the point where we believe a reasonable estimate of loss, or range of loss, can be made. In such instances, we\nbelieve that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible\neventual loss, fine, penalty, or business impact, if any.\nChanges in the facts and circumstances associated with a claim could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash\nflows in the period that reserve estimates are recorded or revised. We believe our insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to\ncover currently estimated exposures, but we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur liabilities in excess of recorded\nreserves or our present insurance coverage. Litigation and contingent liabilities are “critical accounting estimates” because changes\nin the assumptions used to develop the estimates could materially affect key financial measures, including operating income,\nadjusted EBITDA, and net income.\nTax Matters\nWe and each of our subsidiaries are taxed at the rates applicable within each of their respective jurisdictions. Our income tax\nexpense, effective tax rate, deferred tax assets, and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits\narise. Further, certain of our subsidiaries sell products directly to our other subsidiaries or provide administrative, marketing, and\nsupport services to our other subsidiaries. These intercompany sales and support services involve subsidiaries operating in\njurisdictions with differing tax rates. The tax authorities in such jurisdictions may challenge our treatment under residency criteria,\ntransfer pricing provisions, or other aspects of their respective tax laws, which could affect our composite tax rate and provisions.\nWe sometimes engage in transactions in which tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty. We account for these uncertain tax\npositions in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, which requires significant judgment in assessing the estimated tax\nconsequences of a transaction. We evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the\nweight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that, on an evaluation of the technical merits, the tax position\nwill be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. We measure the tax benefit as the\nlargest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We re-evaluate our income tax positions\nperiodically to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in or interpretations of tax law, effectively settled\nissues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit\nor an additional charge to the tax provision, which could have a material impact to the financial statements.\n70\nWe establish a valuation allowance when measuring deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets\nwill not be realized in the foreseeable future. This process requires significant judgment as we must project the current tax liability\nand estimate the deferred tax assets and liabilities into future periods, including net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. In\nassessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider recent operating results, availability of taxable income in carryback years,\nfuture reversals of taxable temporary differences, future taxable income projections (exclusive of reversing temporary differences),\nand all prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.\nTax matters are “critical accounting estimates” because changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimates could materially\naffect key financial measures, including net income.\nShare-based compensation\nWe use the Black-Scholes valuation model to calculate the fair value of service-based stock options. The value is recognized as\nexpense over the service period net of actual forfeitures. The expected term of options granted is estimated based on a number of\nfactors, including the vesting and expiration terms of the award, historical employee exercise behavior for both options that are\ncurrently outstanding and options that have been exercised or are expired, the historical volatility of our common stock, and an\nemployee’s average length of service. The risk-free interest rate is determined based upon a constant U.S. Treasury security rate\nwith a contractual life that approximates the expected term of the option award. We estimate expected volatility based on the\nhistorical volatility of our stock.\nWe use the Monte Carlo valuation methodology to calculate the fair value of market-based restricted stock units, with any discounts\nfor post-vesting restrictions estimated using the Chaffe Model. The value is recognized as expense over the requisite service period\nand adjusted for forfeitures as they occur. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of the awards\nincorporates the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied.\nThe fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is calculated based upon (i) the closing stock price at the date of grant and\n(ii) the number of stock units expected to vest at the conclusion of the performance period. The value is recognized as expense over\nthe derived requisite service period beginning in the period in which the grants are deemed probable to vest. Vesting probability is\nassessed based upon forecasted financial results metrics or applicable milestones associated with the grant and requires significant\njudgment.\nAs part of the Merger, our Board of Directors determined to treat the transaction as a \"Change in Control\" under applicable\nagreements and equity plans. As a result, all outstanding and previously granted performance-based and market-based restricted\nstock units were converted to time-based restricted stock units. We used the Monte Carlo valuation methodology to calculate the\nfair value of the performance-based and market-based restricted stock units. The value is recognized as expense over the requisite\nservice period and adjusted for forfeitures as they occur.\nDetermining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of employee stock awards requires estimates and\njudgments. Our share-based compensation is a “critical accounting estimate” because changes in the assumptions used to develop\nestimates of fair value or the requisite service period could materially affect key financial measures, including gross profit, operating\nincome, and net income.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items provides investors with greater transparency to\nthe information used by senior management in its financial and operational decision-making. We believe it is important to provide\ninvestors with the same non-GAAP metrics that senior management uses to supplement information regarding the performance and\nunderlying trends of our business operations in order to facilitate comparisons to historical operating results and internally evaluate\nthe effectiveness of our operating strategies. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates comparisons of our\nunderlying operating performance with other companies in the industry that also supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP\nfinancial measures.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures used in this Annual Report may have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered\nin isolation or as a replacement for GAAP financial measures. Some of the limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are that they exclude items that reflect an economic cost that can have a material effect on cash flows. Similarly,\ncertain non-cash expenses, such as equity compensation expense, do not directly impact cash flows, but are part of total\ncompensation costs accounted for under GAAP.\n71\nConstant Currency\nConstant currency is a non-GAAP measure, which is calculated by using foreign currency rates from the comparable, prior-year\nperiod, to present net sales at comparable rates. Constant currency can be presented for numerous GAAP measures, but is most\ncommonly used by management to analyze net sales without the impact of changes in foreign currency rates.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and excludes\nthe impact of share-based compensation, gains and losses related to changes in foreign exchange rates, charges related to the\nSeaSpine merger and other strategic investments, acquisition-related fair value adjustments, interest and gains and losses on\ninvestments, litigation and investigation costs, charges related to initial compliance with regulations set forth by the European Union\nMedical Device Regulation, charges related to business interruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and succession charges.\nAdjusted EBITDA is the primary metric used by our Chief Operating Decision Maker in managing the business.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from net cash from\noperating activities. Free cash flow is an important indicator of how much cash is generated or used by our normal business\noperations, including capital expenditures. Management uses free cash flow as a measure of progress on its capital efficiency and\ncash flow initiatives.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations. Primary exposures include changes in interest\nrates and foreign currency fluctuations. These exposures can impact sales, cost of sales, costs of operations, and the cost of\nfinancing and yields on cash and short-term investments. We may use derivative financial instruments, where appropriate, to\nmanage these risks. However, our risk management policy does not allow us to hedge positions we do not hold nor do we enter into\nderivative or other financial investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with the outstanding debt related to our Initial Term Loan, which bears interest at\nfloating rates based on a three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, plus an applicable borrowing margin or at a base\nrate (as defined in the Financing Agreement) plus an applicable borrowing margin. Therefore, interest rate changes generally do not\naffect the fair market value of the debt, but do impact future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant.\nWe believe that a concentration of credit risk related to our accounts receivable is limited because our customers are geographically\ndispersed and the end users are diversified across several industries. It is reasonably possible that changes in global economic\nconditions and/or local operating and economic conditions in the regions these customers operate, or other factors, could affect the\nfuture realization of these accounts receivable balances.\nOur foreign currency exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. Dollar against the Euro, Brazilian\nReal, Australian Dollar, Swiss Franc, British Pound, or Canadian Dollar. We are subject to transactional currency exposures when our\nsubsidiaries (or the Company itself) enter into transactions denominated in a currency other than their functional currency. For the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a foreign currency gain of $1.6 million on the statement of operations and\ncomprehensive loss resulting from gains and losses in foreign currency transactions.\nWe are also subject to currency exposure from translating the results of our global operations into the U.S. Dollar at exchange rates\nthat fluctuate during the period. The U.S. Dollar equivalent of international sales denominated in foreign currencies was favorably\nimpacted during the year ended December 31, 2023, and unfavorably impacted during the year ended December 31, 2022, by\nmonthly foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of the U.S. Dollar against all of the foreign functional currencies for our\ninternational operations. As we continue to distribute and manufacture our products in selected foreign countries, we expect that\nfuture sales and costs associated with our activities in these markets will continue to be denominated in the applicable foreign\ncurrencies, which could cause currency fluctuations to materially impact our operating results. An analysis was performed to\ndetermine the sensitivity of our current year net sales and operating income to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We\ndetermined that if the U.S. Dollar decreased in value by 10% relative to all foreign currencies of our international operations it would\nresult in an increase in net sales of $9.4 million and an increase in operating income of $0.6 million. If the U.S. Dollar increased in\nvalue by 10% relative to all foreign currencies of our international operations it would result in a decrease in net sales of $9.4 million\nand a decrease in operating income of $0.6 million.\n72\nItem 8.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAt the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, under the supervision and with the participation of our management,\nincluding our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness\nof the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, our President and Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial\nreporting related to management's review activities for business combinations and goodwill as disclosed below.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as\nsuch term is defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the\nCompany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of\nDirectors regarding the preparation of reliable financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of\nthe inherent limitations in any internal control, no matter how well designed, misstatements may occur and not be prevented or\ndetected. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to\nfinancial statement preparation. Further, the evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was made as\nof a specific date, and continued effectiveness in future periods is subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because\nof changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may decline.\nIn connection with the preparation and filing of this Annual Report, the Company’s management, including our President and Chief\nExecutive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the framework set forth in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Based on its evaluation, the\nCompany’s management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2023, due\nto a material weakness in the design and operation of certain management review controls pertaining to business combinations and\nassessing recoverability of goodwill, resulting from insufficient evidence supporting the precision over the determination of certain\nestimates and insufficient evidence supporting the operating effectiveness of the associated review controls. This material weakness\ndid not result in any misstatements to the consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nNotwithstanding the material weaknesses, management has concluded that the financial statements included elsewhere in this\nAnnual Report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with\nGAAP.\nAs permitted by the SEC Staff interpretive guidance for recently acquired businesses, management's assessment and conclusion on\nthe effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023, excludes an assessment of the\ninternal control over financial reporting of the SeaSpine business acquired on January 5, 2023. SeaSpine represents approximately\n52% of consolidated total assets and approximately 35% of consolidated revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nErnst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, which follows this report.\n73\nPlan to Remediate Material Weakness\nIn order to address and resolve the identified material weakness, management, with oversight from our Audit Committee, is in\nprocess of developing a detailed plan for remediation, which will include:\n• Evaluating skill set gaps and hiring additional accounting, finance, and/or financial reporting personnel, as needed, with\nrelevant public company accounting and financial reporting experience to develop and implement additional policies,\nprocedures, and controls as it pertains to business combinations, asset acquisitions, and/or other processes heavily\ndependent on the usage of prospective financial information;\n• Providing ongoing training for key personnel responsible for internal control over financial reporting; and\n• Enhancing or designing and implementing controls over the completeness and accuracy of information used in financial\nreporting and forecasted financial results, particularly as it relates to the accounting for business combinations and\ngoodwill.\nWe are committed to remediating the material weaknesses and we are making progress in that effort. The actions we are taking are\nsubject to ongoing senior management review, as well as oversight from the Audit Committee. When fully implemented and\noperational, we believe the measures described above will remediate the underlying causes of the control deficiencies that gave rise\nto the material weakness and will strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. However, remediation efforts are\nexpected to continue beyond the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. Further, we will not be able to fully remediate this material\nweakness until these steps have been completed and have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. We may also\nidentify additional measures that may be required to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial\nreporting, necessitating further action.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe are working towards implementing processes and procedures to address the material weakness noted above. However, none of\nthese efforts have resulted in the remediation of the material weaknesses noted above as of December 31, 2023. There have been\nno changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2023 other than the identification of the\nmaterial weakness and the remediation plan disclosed above that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially\naffect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n74\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Orthofix Medical Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Orthofix Medical Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described below on\nthe achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Orthofix Medical Inc. (the Company) has not maintained effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a\nreasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or\ndetected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management’s assessment.\nManagement identified a material weakness in its review controls over business combinations and assessment of the recoverability\nof goodwill.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s\nassessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of\nSeaSpine Holdings Corporation, which is included in the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 52%\nof total assets as of December 31, 2023 and 35% of revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial\nreporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of SeaSpine Holdings\nCorporation.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),\nthe consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, the related consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period\nended December 31, 2023, and the related notes. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent\nof audit tests applied in our audit of the 2023 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated\nMarch 5, 2024, which expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment\nof the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal\nControl over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting\nbased on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to\nthe Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material\nrespects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness\nexists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing\nsuch other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to\nthe maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of\n75\nthe company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance\nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes\nin conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nDallas, Texas\nMarch 5, 2024\nItem 9B.

The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management’s estimates and\njudgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Other financial\ninformation in the report to shareholders is consistent with that in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at a reasonable cost that assets\nare safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial\nstatements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure\nproviding division of responsibilities, and careful selection and training of qualified personnel.\nThe Company engaged Ernst & Young LLP, independent registered public accountants, to audit and render an opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements in accordance with auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates). These standards include an assessment of the systems of internal controls and tests of transactions to the extent considered\nnecessary by them to support their opinion.\nThe Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of outside directors of the Company, meets periodically with\nmanagement and our independent registered public accountants to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss\nmatters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Ernst & Young LLP has full and free access to the Audit Committee.\nJames Hinrichs\nChairman of the Audit Committee\nMassimo Calafiore\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, Director\nJulie Andrews\nChief Financial Officer\n87\nORTHOFIX MEDICAL INC.\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPage\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements.................................................................................................................................

F-9\nF-1\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Orthofix Medical Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Orthofix Medical Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders' equity and\ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the\n“consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the\nthree years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and\nour report dated March 5, 2024 expressed an adverse opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to\nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a\ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nfinancial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that\nwere communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are\nmaterial to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of the critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as\na whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit\nmatters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nF-2\nInventory Excess and Obsolescence Reserves\nDescription of At December 31, 2023, the Company’s inventory balance was $222.2 million, which is net of management’s\nthe Matter estimate of inventory excess and obsolescence reserves. As described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial\nstatements, management adjusts the value of its inventory to net realizable value to the extent it determines\ninventory cost cannot be recovered due to obsolescence or other factors. In order to make these\ndeterminations, management estimates future demand to determine the appropriate inventory reserves and\nto make corresponding adjustments to the carrying value of these inventories to reflect them at the lower of\ncost or net realizable value.\nAuditing management’s estimate of the inventory excess and obsolescence reserves involved a high degree of\nsubjectivity because the estimate was sensitive to changes in assumptions, including estimated product\ndemand, length of product life cycles, and the period required to evaluate the level of market acceptance for\nnew products. These assumptions have a significant effect on the measurement of inventory excess and\nobsolescence reserves.\nHow We We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that\nAddressed the address the risks of material misstatement relating to the measurement and valuation of inventory excess and\nMatter in Our obsolescence reserves. For example, we tested controls over the Company’s processes to estimate the\nAudit inventory excess and obsolescence reserves, management’s review and approval of the model used to\nestimate the inventory excess and obsolescence reserve, including the data inputs and outputs of such model\nand management’s qualitative adjustments to the model.\nTo test the inventory excess and obsolescence reserve balance, we performed audit procedures that included,\namong others, evaluating the significant assumptions and qualitative adjustments described above and the\nunderlying data used by the Company in its analysis. Our audit procedures included testing the completeness\nand accuracy of the underlying data used in the model and evaluating whether such data was representative\nof current circumstances. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and performed\nsensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the inventory excess and\nobsolescence reserves that would result from changes in the assumptions.\nAccounting for business combination\nDescription of As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed a significant\nthe Matter acquisition during 2023 for a total purchase price of $376.7 million. The transaction was accounted for as a\nbusiness combination.\nAuditing the Company's acquisition accounting was complex due to the significant size of the transaction and\nsignificant estimations used by management in determining the fair values of intangible assets, which utilized\nprospective financial information. The Company valued customer relationships using the multi-period excess\nearnings method and valued developed technologies using the relief from royalty method.

Business and basis of presentation\nDescription of the Business\nOrthofix Medical Inc. and its Subsidiaries (the “Company” or \"Orthofix\") merged with SeaSpine Holdings Corporation (\"SeaSpine\") in\nJanuary 2023 to form a leading global spine and orthopedics company with a comprehensive portfolio of biologics, innovative spinal\nhardware, bone growth therapies, specialized orthopedic solutions, and a leading surgical navigation system. Its products are\ndistributed in more than 60 countries worldwide.\nThe Company is headquartered in Lewisville, Texas, where it conducts general business, product development, medical education\nand manufacturing, and has primary offices in Carlsbad, CA, with a focus on spine and biologics product innovation and surgeon\neducation, and Verona, Italy, with an emphasis on product innovation, production, and medical education for orthopedics. The\ncombined company’s global research and development, commercial and manufacturing footprint also includes facilities and offices\nin Irvine, CA, Toronto, Canada, Sunnyvale, CA, Wayne, PA, Olive Branch, MS, Maidenhead, UK, Munich, Germany, Paris, France, and\nSão Paulo, Brazil.\nThe merger with SeaSpine was completed on January 5, 2023, with SeaSpine continuing as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orthofix\nfollowing the transaction. For additional discussion of the merger with SeaSpine, see Note 4. The shares of common stock of\nOrthofix, as the corporate parent entity in the combined company structure, continue to trade on NASDAQ under the symbol\n\"OFIX\".\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.

Significant accounting policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”)\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure\nof contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses\nduring the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to contractual allowances,\nallowances for expected credit losses, inventories, valuation of intangible assets, goodwill, fair value measurements (including fair\nvalue measurements associated with business combinations and/or asset acquisitions), litigation and contingent liabilities, income\ntaxes, and share-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, future expectations, and other relevant\nassumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments\nabout the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from\nthese estimates.\nThe following is a discussion of accounting policies and methods used in our consolidated financial statements that are not\npresented within other footnotes.\nMarket risk\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency\nfluctuations. The Company’s objective is to limit the impact of such movements on earnings and cash flows. In order to achieve this\nobjective, the Company seeks to balance its non-U.S. Dollar denominated income and expenditures.\nThe financial statements for operations outside the U.S. are generally maintained in their respective local currency. All foreign\ncurrency denominated balance sheet accounts, except shareholders’ equity, are translated to U.S. Dollars at year end exchange\nrates, and revenue and expense items are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Gains and losses resulting\nfrom the translation of foreign currency are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of\nshareholders’ equity. Transactional foreign currency gains and losses, including those generated from intercompany operations, are\nincluded in other income (expense), net and was a gain of $1.6 million, a loss of $3.3 million, and a loss of $4.0 million for the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nFinancial instruments and concentration of credit risk\nFinancial instruments that could subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents,\nand accounts receivable. Generally, cash is held at large financial institutions and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid money\nmarket funds. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers, generally does not require collateral, and maintains\na reserve for expected credit losses. The Company believes that a concentration of credit risk related to accounts receivable is\nlimited because customers are geographically dispersed and end users are diversified.\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nIn November 2023, following the termination of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A., as Administrative Agent, and certain lender parties thereto, Bank of America required collateral of approximately $4.7 million\nof the Company’s cash as a banking service obligation. This cash has been reclassified to restricted cash as of December 31, 2023.\nInvesting activities that did not result in cash receipts or cash payments during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021\nconsisted of the following, which were not included within cash from investing activities in the Company’s consolidated statements\nof cash flows:\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nSupplemental disclosure of cash flow information:\nNoncash investing activities:\nIntangible assets acquired in asset acquisitions $ — $ 2,000 $ —\nF-10\nAdvertising costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs are included within sales and marketing expense and totaled $0.5\nmillion for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nResearch and development costs, including collaborative arrangements\nExpenditures for research and development are expensed as incurred. Expenditures related to the Company’s collaborative\narrangement with MTF Biologics (“MTF”) are expensed based on the terms of the related agreement. The Company recognized $0.8\nmillion, less than $0.1 million, and $0.8 million in research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022,\nand 2021, respectively.\nIn October 2020, the Company and Neo Medical SA, a privately held Swiss-based company developing a new generation of products\nfor spinal surgery (“Neo Medical”), entered into a co-development agreement covering the parties’ joint development of single use\ninstruments for cervical spine procedures. In connection with this agreement, the Company is responsible for the payment of\nvariable costs associated with the development of the specified products. Research and development expenses incurred under this\ncollaborative arrangement totaled $0.1 million, $0.5 million, and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and\n2021, respectively.\n3. Recently adopted accounting standards and recently issued accounting pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nAdoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2021-10—Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities\nabout Government Assistance\nIn November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2021-10, which aims to increase the transparency\nof government assistance by requiring entities to provide information about the nature of the transaction, terms and conditions\nassociated with the transaction, and financial statement line items affected by the transaction. The Company voluntarily elected to\nearly adopt this standard for the year ended December 31, 2021, on a prospective basis. Adoption of this standard did not have a\nsignificant impact to the existing disclosures made in relation to government assistance received by the Company in 2020 as part of\nthe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\").\nAdoption of ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the accounting for income taxes\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, which reduces the complexity of accounting for income taxes by eliminating\ncertain exceptions to the general principles in Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 740, Income Taxes. Additionally, the ASU\nsimplifies U.S. GAAP by amending the requirements related to the accounting for \"hybrid\" tax regimes and also adding the\nrequirement to evaluate when a step up in the tax basis of goodwill should be considered part of the business combination and\nwhen it should be considered a separate transaction. The Company adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2021, with certain\nprovisions applied retrospectively and other provisions applied prospectively. Adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact to\nthe Company’s consolidated balance sheet, statements of operations, or cash flows.\nAdoption of ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848)\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, which provided temporary optional guidance to ease the potential financial reporting\nburden of the expected market transition away from the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate. The new guidance provided optional\nexpedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contract modifications, hedge accounting, and other transactions affected by\nreference rate reform if certain criteria are met through December 31, 2022. The Company adopted this ASU effective March 12,\n2020, the effective date of the ASU, on a prospective basis. Adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact to the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheet, statements of operations, or cash flows.\nAdoption of ASU 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities with Contracts with Customers\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, which aims to address diversity in practice and inconsistency related to the\naccounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination. The amendments require that an entity\nrecognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers. Adoption of this standard resulted in the recognition of $2.2 million in contract liabilities\nassociated with acquired revenue contracts as a result of the Company’s merger with SeaSpine, which closed on January 5, 2023.\nF-11\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nTopic Description of Guidance Effective Date Status of Company's Evaluation\nFair Value Measurement Clarifies the guidance in Topic 820, Fair Value January 1, The Company is currently evaluating the\nof Equity Securities Measurement, when measuring the fair value 2024 impact this ASU may have on its\nSubject to Contractual of an equity security subject to contractual consolidated financial statements, but does\nSale Restrictions (ASU restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity not expect this ASU to have a material\n2022-03) security and introduces new disclosure impact on disclosures within the Company's\nrequirements for equity securities subject to consolidated financial statements.\ncontractual sale restrictions.

The\namendments are to be applied prospectively,\nbut retrospective application is permitted.\n4. Mergers and acquisitions\nMerger with SeaSpine\nOn January 5, 2023, the Company and SeaSpine completed an all-stock merger of equals (the \"Merger\") to create a leading global\nspine and orthopedics company with highly complementary portfolios of biologics, innovative spinal hardware, bone growth\ntherapies, specialized orthopedic solutions, and a leading surgical navigation system. As a result of the Merger, each share of\nSeaSpine common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger was converted into the right to\nreceive 0.4163 shares of Orthofix common stock.\nF-12\nThe Merger is being accounted for as an acquisition of SeaSpine by Orthofix under the acquisition method of accounting for business\ncombinations in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Therefore, Orthofix is treated as the acquirer for accounting purposes. In identifying the\nacquirer, Orthofix and SeaSpine considered the structure of the transaction and other actions contemplated by the merger\nagreement (the \"Merger Agreement\"), relative outstanding share ownership, market values, the composition of the combined\ncompany's Board of Directors, and the relative size of Orthofix and SeaSpine.

As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company recorded goodwill totaling $123.6 million, which was assigned to the Global Spine reporting\nsegment. Specifically, the goodwill includes the assembled workforce and synergies associated with the combined entity. The\ngoodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.\nF-13\nThe Company recognized $9.9 million in direct acquisition-related costs, which exclude integration-related activities, that were\nexpensed during the year ended December 31, 2023. These costs are included in the consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive income (loss), primarily within general and administrative expenses. The Company's results of operations included\n$258.9 million of net sales from SeaSpine for the year ended December 31, 2023, and a net loss attributable to SeaSpine of $84.0\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nUnaudited Pro Forma Financial Information\nDue to the Merger closing on January 5, 2023, all SeaSpine financial results for fiscal year 2023, except for the first four days of\nJanuary, are included in Orthofix's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The following unaudited pro\nforma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2023, is based on the Company's historical consolidated financial\nstatements adjusted to reflect as if the Merger closed as of January 1, 2022.\nThe unaudited pro-forma information makes certain adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense to reflect the fair value\nrecognized in the purchase price allocation and to remove one-time transaction-related costs.

The following table\nsummarizes integration costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2023, and 2022.\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(U.S. Dollars, in millions) 2023 2022\nCompensation-related integration costs $ 17.7 $ —\nInternational spine restructuring 1.3 —\nFee paid to financial advisor to the Merger 5.5 —\nProfessional fees / consulting fees 5.8 —\nProduct rationalization charges 6.0 —\nOther costs to complete 1.4 —\nTotal $ 37.7 $ —\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the Company approved and initiated certain restructuring activities to streamline costs and to better\nalign talent with operational needs following the consummation of the Merger. This program was expanded in the third quarter of\n2023 to include further restructuring activities related to the Company's international spine business. The Company expects to incur\ntotal pre-tax expenses of approximately $18.2 million associated with the restructuring activities, which will be recognized within\noperating expenses. The table below provides a summary of restructuring costs incurred during the period and the resulting\nliabilities as of December 31, 2023, which are recognized within other current liabilities.\nPayments Made /\nBalance as of Currency Translation Balance as of\n(U.S. Dollars, in millions) December 31, 2022 Charges Incurred Adjustment December 31, 2023\nU.S. Severance costs $ — $ 11.2 $ (10.2) $ 1.0\nU.S. Retention costs — 5.3 (0.3) 5.0\nU.S. Payroll taxes — 0.7 (0.4) 0.3\nInternational spine restructuring\nseverance — 1.0 (0.3) 0.7\nTotal $ — $ 18.2 $ (11.2) $ 7.0\nF-14\n5. Inventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value, after provision for excess, obsolete, or impaired items,\nwhich is reviewed and updated on a periodic basis by management. For inventory procured or produced, whether internally or\nthrough contract manufacturing arrangements, at the Company's manufacturing facility in Italy, cost is determined on a weighted-\naverage basis, which approximates the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. For inventory procured or produced, whether internally or\nthrough contract manufacturing arrangements, at the Company's manufacturing facilities in Texas and California, standard cost,\nwhich approximates actual cost on the FIFO method, is used to value inventory. Standard costs are reviewed by management, at\nleast annually or more often, in the event circumstances indicate a change in cost has occurred.\nWork-in-process and finished products include material, labor, and production overhead costs. Field and consignment inventory,\nwhich represents immediately saleable finished products inventory that is in the possession of the Company’s independent sales\nrepresentatives or located at third-party customers, such as distributors and hospitals, is included within finished products.\nDecember 31,\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022\nRaw materials $ 28,390 $ 17,035\nWork-in-process 53,510 19,243\nFinished products 140,266 63,872\nInventories $ 222,166 $ 100,150\nThe Company adjusts the value of its inventory to the extent management determines that the cost cannot be recovered due to\nobsolescence or other factors. In order to make these determinations, management uses estimates of future demand for each\nproduct to determine the appropriate inventory reserves and to make corresponding adjustments to the carrying value of these\ninventories to reflect the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value.\n6. Property, plant, and equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment is stated at cost or estimated fair value when acquired as part of a business combination, less\naccumulated depreciation. Costs include all expenditures necessary to place the asset in service, generally including freight and sales\nand use taxes. Property, plant, and equipment also includes instrumentation held by customers, which is generally used to facilitate\nthe implantation of the Company’s products.\nThe useful lives of these assets are generally as follows:\nYears\nBuildings 25 to 33\nPlant and equipment 1 to 10\nInstrumentation 3 to 4\nComputer software 3 to 7\nFurniture and fixtures 4 to 8\nThe Company evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the\nuseful lives of the assets. Depreciation of leasehold improvements is computed over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life\nof the asset. Total depreciation expense was $34.2 million, $19.6 million, and $20.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022, and 2021, respectively.\nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs and minor renewals and improvements, which do not extend the lives of the respective\nassets, are expensed as incurred. All other expenditures for renewals and improvements are capitalized. The assets and related\naccumulated depreciation are adjusted for property retirements and disposals, with the resulting gain or loss included in earnings.\nFully depreciated assets remain in the accounts until retired from service.\nF-15\nDecember 31,\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022\nCost\nBuildings $ 4,103 $ 3,867\nPlant and equipment 70,252 48,358\nInstrumentation 154,192 92,607\nComputer software 43,040 40,685\nFurniture and fixtures 11,010 7,917\nConstruction in progress 41,751 4,515\nFinance lease assets 23,337 23,276\nProperty, plant, and equipment, gross 347,685 221,225\nAccumulated depreciation (188,625) (162,996)\nProperty, plant, and equipment, net $ 159,060 $ 58,229\nThe Company capitalizes system development costs related to internal-use software during the application development stage.\nCosts related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is\namortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which generally ranges from three to seven years.\nLong-lived assets are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances have occurred that would\nindicate impairment. For purposes of the evaluation, the Company groups its long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the\nlowest level of identifiable cash flows if the asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities. If the\ncarrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual\ndisposition of the asset group, the Company will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified.\nThe Company generally determines fair value of long-lived assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows. In determining\nthe estimated future cash flows associated with the assets, the Company uses estimates and assumptions about future revenue\ncontributions, cost structures, and remaining useful lives of the asset group. The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated\ncash flows, discount rates, and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment.\n7. Intangible assets\nIntangible assets are recorded at cost, or when acquired as a part of a business combination, at estimated fair value, less\naccumulated amortization. These assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets, which the Company\nbelieves is materially consistent with the pattern of economic benefit provided by the assets.\nDecember 31,\nWeighted Average\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) Amortization Period 2023 2022\nCost\nDeveloped technology 7.9 years $ 92,416 $ 43,699\nPatents 10.0 years 43,262 40,108\nIPR&D Indefinite 4,674 300\nCustomer relationships 12.1 years 49,197 15,572\nLicense and other 9.6 years 24,584 23,295\nTrademarks—finite lived 10.0 years 1,797 1,875\n9.5 years 215,930 124,849\nAccumulated amortization\nDeveloped technology $ (28,898) $ (17,830)\nPatents (40,494) (37,506)\nCustomer relationships (11,988) (6,938)\nLicense and other (16,240) (14,386)\nTrademarks—finite lived (820) (801)\n(98,440) (77,461)\nIntangible assets, net $ 117,490 $ 47,388\nAcquired IPR&D represents the fair value assigned to acquired research and development assets that have not reached technological\nfeasibility. In a business combination, the fair value assigned to acquired IPR&D is determined by estimating the remaining costs to\ndevelop the acquired technology into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting revenues from the projects, and\nF-16\ndiscounting the net cash flows to present value. The revenue and cost projections used to value acquired IPR&D are, as applicable,\nreduced based on the probability of success of developing the asset. Additionally, estimated revenues consider the relevant market\nsizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology, and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by the\nCompany and its competitors. The rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value are commensurate with the\nstage of development of the project and uncertainties in the economic estimates used in the projections. Any future costs to further\ndevelop the IPR&D subsequent to acquisition are recorded to research and development expense as incurred.\nIPR&D assets are considered to be indefinite-lived assets until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and\ndevelopment efforts. During the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they are not amortized but tested for impairment.\nImpairment testing is performed at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment. If\nand when development is complete, which generally occurs when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the\nassociated assets are reclassified to developed technology and are amortized over an assigned useful life that best reflects the\neconomic benefits provided by these assets.\nAmortization expense for intangible assets was $18.9 million, $9.4 million, and $9.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023,\nDecember 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Future amortization expense for intangible assets is estimated as follows:\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) Amortization\n2024 $ 20,948\n2025 19,849\n2026 18,810\n2027 18,426\n2028 14,890\nThereafter 19,893\nTotal finite-lived intangible assets, net $ 112,816\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, net 4,674\nIntangible assets, net $ 117,490\n8. Goodwill\nThe Company tests goodwill at least annually for impairment. The Company tests more frequently if indicators are present or\nchanges in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. These indicators include, among others, declines in sales, earnings, or\ncash flows, or the development of a material adverse change in the business climate. The Company assesses goodwill for\nimpairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment.\nThe following table presents the net carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, and a rollforward of such\nbalances from December 31, 2022, by reportable segment:\nGoodwill\nBalance as of Acquired in Currency Balance as of\nDecember 31, the Merger translation December 31,\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2022 with SeaSpine Impairment adjustment 2023\nGlobal Spine - Gross $ 71,317 $ 123,617 $ — $ — $ 194,934\nGlobal Spine - Accumulated Impairment Loss — — — — $ —\nGlobal Spine - Net $ 71,317 $ 123,617 $ — $ — $ 194,934\nGlobal Orthopedics - Gross $ 11,130 $ — $ — $ 347 $ 11,477\nGlobal Orthopedics - Accumulated Impairment Loss (11,130) — — (347) $ (11,477)\nGlobal Orthopedics - Net $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nGoodwill, net of accumulated impairment losses $ 71,317 $ 123,617 $ — $ — $ 194,934\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company performed a quantitative assessment of its goodwill. The Company estimated the fair\nvalue of each reporting unit using a weighted average of fair value derived from both an income approach and a market approach\n(all Level 3 fair value measurements). Upon estimating the fair value of each of its reporting units, the Company determined its\nGlobal Orthopedics reporting unit’s fair value was less than its carrying value of net assets. This resulted in recording a full\nF-17\nimpairment of the Global Orthopedics goodwill of $11.8 million, which was reflected within Acquisition-related amortization and\nremeasurement. The assessment concluded there were no indicators of impairment for the Global Spine goodwill.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company performed a qualitative assessment for its annual goodwill impairment analysis, which\ndid not result in an impairment charge. This qualitative analysis considered all relevant factors specific to the reporting units,\nincluding macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and relevant entity-specific\nevents.\nIn the third quarter of 2023, the Company announced the termination of its former President and Chief Executive Officer, former\nChief Financial Officer, and former Chief Legal Officer, from their respective roles. Immediately following the announcement, the\nCompany’s market capitalization decreased by approximately 30%, indicating that an impairment may exist. As a result, the\nCompany performed an interim quantitative assessment of its goodwill as of September 30, 2023. The Company estimated the fair\nvalue of each reporting unit using a weighted average of the fair value derived from both an income approach and a market\napproach (all Level 3 fair value measurements). Upon performing its assessment, the Company determined its Global Spine\nreporting unit's fair value exceed its carrying value of net assets as of September 30, 2023.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company performed a qualitative assessment for its annual goodwill impairment analysis, which\ndid not result in an impairment charge. This qualitative analysis considered all relevant factors specific to the reporting units,\nincluding macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and relevant entity-specific\nevents.\n9. Leases\nThe Company determines if a contractual arrangement qualifies as a lease at inception. The Company’s leases primarily relate to\nfacilities, vehicles, equipment, and certain contract manufacturing agreements. Lease assets represent the Company’s right to use\nan underlying asset for the lease term, while lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease\nterm. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate is used as a discount rate,\nbased on the information available at the commencement date, in determining the present value of lease payments. Lease assets\nalso include the impact of any prepayments made and are reduced by the impact of any lease incentives.\nThe Company does not recognize lease liabilities or lease assets on the balance sheet for short-term leases (leases with a lease term\nof twelve months or less as of the commencement date). Rather, any short-term lease payments are recognized as an expense on a\nstraight-line basis over the lease term. The current period short-term lease expense reasonably reflects the Company's short-term\nlease commitments.\nFor all classifications of leases, the Company combines lease and non-lease components to account for them as a single lease\ncomponent. Variable lease payments are excluded from the lease liability and recognized in the period in which the obligation is\nincurred. Additionally, lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the\nCompany will exercise the option.\nF-18\nA summary of the Company’s lease portfolio as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, is presented in the table below:\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands, except lease term and discount December 31, December 31,\nrate) Classification 2023 2022\nAssets\nOperating leases Other long-term assets $ 19,869 $ 6,788\nFinance leases Property, plant and equipment, net 16,345 17,360\nTotal lease assets $ 36,214 $ 24,148\nLiabilities\nCurrent\nOperating leases Other current liabilities $ 3,477 $ 1,638\nFinance leases Current portion of finance lease liability 708 652\nLong-term\nOperating leases Other long-term liabilities 17,125 5,376\nFinance leases Long-term portion of finance lease liability 18,532 19,239\nTotal lease liabilities $ 39,842 $ 26,905\nWeighted Average Remaining Lease Term\nOperating leases 6.2 years 4.5 years\nFinance leases 16.6 years 17.6 years\nWeighted Average Discount Rate\nOperating leases 7.3% 4.0%\nFinance leases 4.4% 4.4%\nThe components of lease costs were as follows:\nFor the Year Ended For the Year Ended For the Year Ended\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nFinance lease costs:\nAmortization of right-of-use assets $ 1,013 $ 1,238 $ 2,049\nInterest on finance lease liabilities 857 890 933\nOperating lease costs 5,015 2,126 2,234\nShort-term lease costs 313 152 213\nVariable lease costs 1,883 932 815\nTotal lease costs $ 9,081 $ 5,338 $ 6,244\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\nFor the Year Ended For the Year Ended For the Year Ended\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease\nliabilities\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 7,682 $ 3,805 $ 4,627\nOperating cash flows from finance leases 857 885 907\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases 652 2,594 537\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations\nOperating leases 16,688 5,603 589\nFinance leases — — 149\nF-19\nA summary of the Company’s remaining lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023, is included below:\nOperating Finance\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) Leases Leases\n2024 $ 4,861 $ 1,538\n2025 4,788 1,543\n2026 4,607 1,562\n2027 3,441 1,593\n2028 1,785 1,624\nThereafter 6,766 19,396\nTotal undiscounted value of lease liabilities 26,248 27,256\nLess: Interest (5,646) (8,016)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 20,602 $ 19,240\nCurrent portion of lease liabilities $ 3,477 $ 708\nLong-term portion of lease liabilities 17,125 18,532\nTotal lease liabilities $ 20,602 $ 19,240\n10.

The Financing Agreement provides for a $100.0 million senior secured term loan (the “Initial Term\nLoan”), a $25.0 million senior secured delayed draw term loan facility (the “Delayed Draw Term Loan”) which, subject to certain\nconditions specified in the Financing Agreement, may be drawn on or prior to March 30, 2024, and a $25.0 million senior secured\nrevolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility,” and together with the Initial Term Loan and the Delayed Draw Term Loan, the\n“Credit Facilities”), each of which mature on November 6, 2027. In connection with entering into the Financing Agreement, the\nCompany repaid in full amounts outstanding and terminated all commitments under the Company’s prior $175 million senior\nsecured revolving credit facility evidenced by that certain Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of October 25,\n2019, among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company as borrowers and guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as\nadministrative agent, and the lenders party thereto (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the “Prior Credit\nAgreement”). The Initial Term Loan was fully funded on the effective date of November 6, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the\nCompany had not made any borrowings under the Delayed Draw Term Loan or the Revolving Credit Facility. However, on January\n10, 2024, the Company borrowed $15.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, which remains outstanding as of the date of this\nfiling.\nBorrowings under the Financing Agreement were and may be used for, among other things, the repayment in full of the Prior Credit\nAgreement, working capital and other general corporate purposes of the Company. Borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear\ninterest at a floating rate, which will be, at the Company’s option, either the three-month SOFR rate (subject to a floor of 3.00% and\na credit spread adjustment of 0.26161%) (the “Adjusted Term SOFR Rate”) plus an applicable margin of 7.25%, or a base rate plus an\napplicable margin of 6.25%. A revolving unused line fee of 2.00% is payable monthly in arrears based on the average amount of the\nundrawn portion of each lender’s revolving credit commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility for the preceding month. A\ndelayed draw unused fee equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus a margin of 1.00% is payable monthly in arrears based on the\naverage amount of the undrawn portion of each lender’s delayed draw term loan commitments in respect of the Delayed Draw\nTerm Loan for the preceding month.\nCertain of the Company’s existing and future material subsidiaries (collectively, the “Guarantors”) are required to guarantee the\nrepayment of the Company’s obligations under the Financing Agreement. The obligations of the Company and each of the\nGuarantors with respect to the Financing Agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all assets of the Company and each of\nthe Guarantors, including, without limitation, accounts receivables, deposit accounts, intellectual property, investment property,\ninventory, equipment and equity interests in their respective subsidiaries.\nThe Financing Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on the Company’s and its\nsubsidiaries ability to incur additional debt, grant or permit additional liens, make investments and acquisitions, merge or\nconsolidate with others, dispose of assets, pay dividends and distributions, pay subordinated indebtedness, and enter into affiliate\ntransactions. In addition, the Financing Agreement contains financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain a minimum level\nof liquidity at all times, a maximum consolidated leverage ratio (measured on a quarterly basis), and a minimum asset coverage ratio\n(measured on a monthly basis). The Financing Agreement also includes events of default customary for facilities of this type and\nupon the occurrence of such events of default, subject to customary cure rights, all outstanding loans under the Credit Facilities may\nbe accelerated and/or the lenders’ commitments terminated.\nThe Financing Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantors. These\nrepresentations and warranties have been made solely for the benefit of the Agent and the lenders party to the Financing\nAgreement and such representations and warranties should not be relied on by any other person, including investors. In addition,\nsuch representations and warranties (i) have been qualified by disclosures made to the Agent and the lenders in connection with the\nagreement, (ii) are subject to the materiality standards contained in the agreement which may differ from what may be viewed as\nmaterial by investors and (iii) were made only as of the date of the agreement or such other date as is specified in the agreement.\nIn conjunction with obtaining the Financing Agreement, the Company paid $2.0 million in debt issuance costs and lenders fees.\nThese costs have been allocated amongst each of the Initial Term Loan, Delayed Draw Term Loan, and Revolving Credit Facility and\nare being amortized over the life of the Financing Agreement. Capitalized debt issuance costs attributable to the Delayed Draw Term\nLoan and Revolving Credit Facility are included in other long-term assets, net of accumulated amortization, whereas capitalized debt\nissuance costs associated with the Initial Term Loan are recognized as a direct reduction of the outstanding indebtedness. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, debt issuance costs associated with all credit facilities (whether the Financing\nAgreement or the Prior Credit Agreement), net of accumulated amortization, were $1.9 million and $0.7 million, respectively. Debt\nissuance costs amortized or expensed totaled $1.3 million, $0.4 million, and $0.4 million for each of the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nF-21\nPrior Credit Agreement\nAs disclosed above, on October 25, 2019, the Company, and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively with the Company,\nthe “Borrowers”), as borrowers, and certain material subsidiaries of the Company as guarantors, entered into the Prior Credit\nAgreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMorgan”), as Administrative Agent, and certain lender parties thereto. The Prior\nCredit Agreement provided for a $300.0 million secured revolving credit facility, amending and restating the revolving credit facility\nthat previously existed with such lenders. The Prior Credit Agreement had a maturity date of October 25, 2024. On March 1, 2023,\nthe Amended Credit Agreement and the Facility were amended to replace London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\")-based pricing\nwith Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\")-based pricing.\nOn June 13, 2023, the Company entered into a Limited Consent, Limited Waiver and Second Amendment to the Original Credit\nAgreement (the \"Consent and Amendment\"). Under the terms of the Consent and Amendment, the parties agreed to reduce the size\nof the secured revolving credit facility, off of which certain fees are based, from $300.0 million to $175.0 million, and to increase the\napplicable interest rate in certain circumstances.\nOn January 3, 2023, the Company borrowed $30.0 million for working capital purposes, including to fund certain Merger-related\nexpenses, under the Prior Credit Agreement. Subsequently, the Company borrowed an additional $49.0 million to fund working\ncapital needs whereby, as of the effective date of the Financing Agreement, the Company had $79.0 million in principal amount of\nborrowings outstanding under the Prior Credit Agreement. In connection with entering into the Financing Agreement, the Company\nrepaid in full all amounts outstanding and terminated all commitments under the Prior Credit Agreement.\nItalian Line of Credit\nThe Company has an unused available Italian line of credit of €5.5 million ($6.1 million and $5.9 million) at December 31, 2023, and\n2022, respectively. This unsecured line of credit provides the Company the option to borrow amounts in Italy at interest rates\ndetermined at the time of borrowing.\n12. Fair value measurements and investments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or\nmost advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.\nNon-financial assets and liabilities of the Company measured at fair value include any long-lived assets that are impaired in a\ncurrently reported period or equity securities measured at observable prices in orderly transactions. The authoritative guidance also\ndescribes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities\nLevel 2: observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities\nLevel 3: unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its\nown assumptions\nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, long-term secured debt,\navailable for sale debt securities, equity securities, contingent consideration, and deferred compensation plan liabilities. The carrying\nvalue of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of\nthese instruments. The Company’s secured term loan carries a floating rate of interest; therefore, the carrying value of long-term\ndebt is considered to approximate the fair value.\nF-22\nThe Company’s available for sale debt securities, equity securities, contingent consideration, and deferred compensation plan\nliabilities are the only financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as follows:\nBalance\nDecember 31,\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 2023\nAssets\nNeo Medical convertible loan agreement $ — $ — $ 6,760 $ 6,760\nNeo Medical preferred equity securities — 4,951 — 4,951\nBone Biologics equity securities — — — —\nOther investments — — 1,309 1,309\nTotal $ — $ 4,951 $ 8,069 $ 13,020\nLiabilities\nLattus contingent consideration $ — $ — $ (8,500) $ (8,500)\nSpinal Kinetics contingent consideration — — — —\nDeferred compensation plan — (1,674) — (1,674)\nTotal $ — $ (1,674) $ — $ (10,174)\nBalance\nDecember 31,\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 2022\nAssets\nNeo Medical convertible loan agreements $ — $ — $ 7,140 $ 7,140\nNeo Medical preferred equity securities — 6,084 — 6,084\nBone Biologics equity securities — — — —\nOther Investments — — 1,726 1,726\nTotal $ — $ 6,084 $ 7,140 $ 14,950\nLiabilities\nSpinal Kinetics contingent consideration $ — $ — $ — $ —\nDeferred compensation plan — (1,515) — (1,515)\nTotal $ — $ (1,515) $ — $ (1,515)\nThe fair value of the Company’s deferred compensation plan liabilities is determined based on inputs that are readily available in\npublic markets or that can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets; therefore, the Company has\ncategorized this liability as a Level 2 financial instrument.\nNeo Medical Convertible Loan Agreements and Equity Investment\nOn October 1, 2020, the Company purchased shares of Neo Medical’s preferred stock for consideration of $5.0 million and entered\ninto a Convertible Loan Agreement (the “Convertible Loan”) pursuant to which Orthofix loaned Neo Medical CHF 4.6 million, or $5.0\nmillion at the date of issuance. The Convertible Loan bears interest at 8.0%, with interest due semi-annually. At each interest\npayment date, the borrower may elect to capitalize any interest due to the then outstanding principal balance of the loan. The\nConvertible Loan matures on October 1, 2024. If a change in control of Neo Medical occurs prior to the maturity date, the\nConvertible Loan shall become immediately due upon such event. The Convertible Loan may be convertible by either party into\nshares of Neo Medical’s preferred stock. The Company may convert the loan at its own election at any time prior to the full\nrepayment or settlement of the Convertible Loan. Neo Medical may elect to convert the loan only in the event of a qualified\nfinancing event, as defined within the agreement. The price per share at which the loan converts is dependent upon (i) the party\nelecting conversion and (ii) Neo Medical’s price per share in its most recent fundraising activities at the time of conversion, as\nspecified within the agreement.\nIn October 2021, the Company entered into an additional Convertible Loan Agreement (the “Additional Convertible Loan”), pursuant\nto which the Company loaned Neo Medical an additional CHF 0.6 million ($0.7 million as of the issuance date). In January 2022, the\nCompany elected to convert the Additional Convertible Loan into shares of Neo Medical’s preferred stock.\nThe equity securities are recorded in other long-term assets and are considered an investment that does not have a readily\ndeterminable fair value. As such, the Company measures this investment at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes\nresulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer.\nF-23\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of the carrying value of the Company’s investment in Neo Medical preferred equity\nsecurities for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022:\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022\nFair value of Neo Medical preferred equity securities at January 1 $ 6,084 $ 5,413\nConversion of loan into preferred equity securities — 671\nForeign currency remeasurement recognized in other income, net 388 —\nUnrealized loss recognized in other income (expense), net (1,521) —\nFair value of Neo Medical preferred equity securities at December 31 $ 4,951 $ 6,084\nCumulative unrealized gain (loss) on Neo Medical preferred equity securities (720) 413\nThe Convertible Loan is recorded in other current assets as an available for sale debt security as of December 31, 2023, while as of\nDecember 31, 2022, this balance was classified within other long-term assets. The Convertible Loan is recorded at fair value, with\napplicable interest recorded in interest income. The fair value of the Convertible Loan is based upon significant unobservable inputs,\nincluding the use of option-pricing models, Monte Carlo simulations for certain periods, and a probability-weighted discounted cash\nflows model, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. Therefore, the Company has categorized this asset as a Level 3\nfinancial asset.\nSome of the more significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Convertible Loan include applicable\ndiscount rates, implied volatility, the likelihood and projected timing of repayment or conversion, and projected cash flows in\nsupport of the estimated enterprise value of Neo Medical. Holding other inputs constant, changes in these assumptions could result\nin a significant change in the fair value of the Convertible Loan. If the amortized cost of the Convertible Loan exceeds its estimated\nfair value, the security is deemed to be impaired, and must be evaluated for the recognition of credit losses. Impairment resulting\nfrom credit losses is recognized within the statement of income, while impairment resulting from other factors is recognized within\nother comprehensive income (loss). As of December 31, 2023, the Company has recognized $0.3 million in credit losses related to\nthe Convertible Loan.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the Convertible Loan(s), measured at fair value\nusing significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022\nFair value of Neo Medical Convertible Loans at January 1 $ 7,140 $ 7,148\nAdditions — —\nInterest recognized in interest income, net 496 436\nForeign currency remeasurement recognized in other income (expense), net 617 (67)\nUnrealized gain (loss) recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (1,233) 294\nExpected credit loss recognized in other income (expense), net (260) —\nConversion of Additional Convertible Loan into preferred equity securities — (671)\nFair value of Neo Medical Convertible Loans at December 31 $ 6,760 $ 7,140\nContractual value of Neo Medical Convertible Loans at December 31 $ 7,020 $ 5,907\nAllowance for credit loss recognized in other income (expense), net (260) —\nAmortized cost basis of Neo Medical Convertible Loans at December 31 $ 6,760 $ 5,907\nThe following table provides quantitative information related to certain key assumptions utilized within the valuation of the\nConvertible Loan as of December 31, 2023:\nFair Value as of\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) December 31, 2023 Unobservable inputs Estimate\nNeo Medical Convertible Loan $ 6,760 Cost of equity discount rate 19.3%\nPresent value factor 15.3%\nImplied volatility 81.1%\nF-24\nBone Biologics Equity Securities\nUntil August of 2022, the Company held an investment in common stock of Bone Biologics Inc. (“Bone Biologics”), a developer of\northobiologic products. Prior to 2021, the equity securities were considered an investment that did not have a readily determinable\nfair value as Bone Biologics had very limited trading volumes. As such, the Company measured the investments at cost, less any\nimpairments, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar\ninvestment of the same issuer.\nIn 2021, Bone Biologics completed a public offering of units, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock and one\nwarrant to purchase common shares. As a result, Bone Biologics’ common stock became actively traded on the NASDAQ (ticker\nBBLG). The Company concluded the investment represented a Level 1 fair value measurement subsequent to the public offering as\nthe common shares subsequently had quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. As such, the Company recorded the\ninvestment at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded within other income (expense), net, subsequent to the public offering.\nThe following table presents the changes in fair value recognized for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021:\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nBone Biologics equity securities at January 1 $ — $ 309 $ —\nFair value adjustments and impairments recognized in other income\n(expense), net — (183) 309\nProceeds from the disposition of equity securities — (126) —\nBone Biologics equity securities at December 31 $ — $ — $ 309\nOther investments\nOther investments represent other assets and investments recorded at fair value that are not deemed to be material for disclosure\non an individual basis. The fair value of these assets is based upon significant unobservable inputs, such as probability-weighted\ndiscounted cash flows models, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. Therefore, the Company has categorized\nthese assets as Level 3 financial assets. This balance is classified within other current assets as of December 31, 2023, and was\nclassified in other long-term assets as of December 31, 2022.\nSpinal Kinetics Contingent Consideration\nThe Company recognized a contingent consideration obligation in connection with the acquisition of Spinal Kinetics in 2018. The fair\nvalue of the remaining Spinal Kinetics contingent consideration, attributable to a revenue-based milestone, was concluded to be\nzero as the Company did not achieve the milestone prior to April 30, 2023, the end of the measurement period for achieving such\nmilestone.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for the contingent consideration measured at fair\nvalue using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022\nSpinal Kinetics contingent consideration at January 1 $ — $ 17,200\nDecrease in fair value recognized in acquisition-related amortization and\nremeasurement — (17,200)\nPayment made — —\nSpinal Kinetics contingent consideration at December 31 $ — $ —\nLattus Contingent Consideration\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company assumed a contingent consideration obligation under a purchase agreement between\nSeaSpine and Lattus Spine LLC (\"Lattus\") executed in December 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company may be\nrequired to make installment payments at certain dates based on future net sales of certain products (the \"Lateral Products\").\nThe estimated fair value of the Lattus contingent consideration is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation and a discounted cash\nflow model requiring significant inputs which are not observable in the market. The significant inputs include assumptions related to\nthe timing and probability of certain product launch dates, estimated future sales of Lateral Products, revenue risk-adjusted discount\nrate, revenue volatility, and discount rates matched to the timing of payments. The following table provides a reconciliation of the\nF-25\nbeginning and ending balances for the Lattus contingent consideration measured at estimated fair value using significant\nunobservable inputs (Level 3):\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022\nLattus contingent consideration estimated fair value at January 5 $ 11,200 $ —\nDecrease in fair value recognized in acquisition-related amortization and\nremeasurement (2,700) —\nLattus contingent consideration estimated fair value at December 31 $ 8,500 $ —\nThe following table provides quantitative information related to certain key assumptions utilized within the valuation as of\nDecember 31, 2023:\nFair Value as of\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) December 31, 2023 Unobservable inputs Estimate\nLattus Contingent Consideration $ 8,500 Counterparty discount rate 14.0%\nRevenue risk-adjusted discount rate 6.5%\n13. Commitments and contingencies\nContingencies policy\nThe Company records accruals for certain outstanding legal proceedings, investigations, or claims when it is probable that a liability\nhas been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company evaluates developments in legal\nproceedings, investigations, and claims that could affect the amount of any accrual, as well as any developments that would make a\nloss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable on a quarterly basis. When a loss contingency is not both probable and\nreasonably estimable, the Company does not accrue the loss. However, if the loss (or an additional loss in excess of the accrual) is at\nleast a reasonable possibility and material, then the Company discloses a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss, if\nsuch reasonable estimate can be made. If the Company cannot make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss,\nthen that is disclosed. In addition, legal fees and other directly related costs are expensed as incurred.\nIn addition to the matters described in the paragraphs below, in the normal course of its business, the Company is involved in\nvarious lawsuits from time to time and may be subject to certain other contingencies. The Company believes any losses related to\nthese matters are individually and collectively immaterial as to a possible loss and range of loss.\nArbitration claims with former executives\nIn September 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors terminated the employment of Keith Valentine, John Bostjancic and Patrick\nKeran, who had served respectively as the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Legal\nOfficer. The Board’s decision followed an investigation conducted by independent outside legal counsel and directed and overseen\nby the Company’s independent directors. As a result of the investigation, the Board determined that each of these executives\nengaged in repeated inappropriate and offensive conduct that violated multiple code of conduct requirements and was inconsistent\nwith the Company’s values and culture. The Company notified each of Messrs. Valentine, Bostjancic and Keran that their respective\nterminations were being made for “Cause,” as defined in applicable employment-related agreements (including each executive’s\nrespective Change in Control and Severance Agreement, dated June 19, 2023). The Company also notified each of Messrs. Valentine,\nBostjancic and Keran that it did not believe it was required to make any further payments to them, other than payment of salary\nthrough September 12, 2023. The Board also requested that Mr. Valentine resign as a director, which he did in October 2023.\nIn January 2024, the Company received written notices of arbitration claims from counsel to Messrs. Valentine, Bostjancic and\nKeran. Each of the arbitration claims asserts that the respective former executive was wrongfully terminated for “Cause” because\nthe former executive’s conduct did not meet the contractually applicable definition of “Cause.” The claims seek relief for, among\nother things, alleged breach of contract, defamation, false light invasion of privacy, deceit, as well as indemnification and\nadvancement for attorneys’ fees. The three former executives seek severance payments, as well as the value of forfeited equity\ngrants, under applicable change in control and severance agreements and further damages as a result of purported defamatory\nstatements. The Company disagrees with many of the assertions contained in the written notices of arbitration claims and intends to\nF-26\nvigorously defend the asserted claims. Due in part to the preliminary nature of this matter, the Company currently cannot\nreasonably estimate a possible loss, or range of loss, that may arise from the arbitration claims.\nItalian Medical Device Payback (“IMDP”)\nIn 2015, the Italian Parliament introduced rules for entities that supply goods and services to the Italian National Healthcare System.\nA key provision of the law is a ‘payback’ measure, requiring medical device companies in Italy to make payments to the Italian\ngovernment if medical device expenditures exceed regional maximum ceilings. Companies are required to make payments equal to\na percentage of expenditures exceeding maximum regional caps.\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the Italian Ministry of Health provided guidelines to the Italian regions and provinces on seeking\npayback of expenditure overruns relating to the years ended December 31, 2015, through December 31, 2018. Since receiving the\nguidelines, several regions and provinces have requested payment from affected medical device companies, including the Company.\nThe Company has taken legal action to dispute the legality of such measures.\nThe Company accounts for the estimated cost of the IMDP as sales and marketing expense and periodically reassesses the liability\nbased upon current facts and circumstances. As a result, the Company recorded expense of $1.3 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, expense of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and a benefit of $1.2 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, as a result of certain temporary relief provided by the Italian National Healthcare System in response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has accrued $7.6 million related to the IMDP, which it has classified\nwithin other long-term liabilities; however, the actual liability could be higher or lower than the amount accrued once all legal\nproceedings are resolved and upon further clarification of the IMDP by the Italian authorities for more recent fiscal years.\nCommitments\nThe Company is party to certain agreements with distributor partners that provide the Company with an option to purchase, and/or\nan option for those partners to require the Company to purchase, the distribution business of those partners at specified future\ndates. At such time, the Company or distributor may (in certain cases, subject to satisfying certain conditions) submit written notice\nto the other of its intention to exercise its rights and initiate or require the purchase. Upon the receipt of the written notice, the\nCompany and the distributor will work in good faith to consummate the purchase. Under certain of these agreements, the purchase\nprice would be paid in shares of the Company's common stock whereas for others, the purchase price can be paid in cash or shares\nat the Company’s option. Based on the closing price of the Company's common stock as of December 31, 2023, assuming all criteria\nare met and that the options under all the relevant agreements were exercised, the estimated total number of shares the Company\nwould issue under these agreements was approximately 1.6 million shares for agreements that must be settled in shares of the\nCompany’s stock. The Company has received notification from one such distributor, who has notified the Company of its decision to\nexercise its buyout option. The Company is currently in negotiations with this distributor in regard to the consummation of the\npotential acquisition.\n14. Shareholders’ equity\nDividends\nThe Company has not historically paid dividends to holders of its common stock. Certain subsidiaries of the Company have\nrestrictions on their ability to pay dividends in certain circumstances pursuant to the Financing Agreement. In the event that the\nCompany decides to pay a dividend to holders of its common stock in the future with dividends received from its subsidiaries, the\nCompany may, based on prevailing rates of taxation, be required to pay additional withholding and income tax on such amounts\nreceived from its subsidiaries.\nF-27\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains\n(losses) on available for sale debt securities. The Company’s policy is to release income tax effects related to items recognized within\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) using a portfolio approach. The components of and changes in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) are as follows:\nCurrency Neo Medical Accumulated Other\nTranslation Convertible Other Comprehensive\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) Adjustments Loans Investments Income (Loss)\nBalance at December 31, 2020 $ 1,833 $ 1,419 $ — $ 3,252\nOther comprehensive loss (2,544) (942) — (3,486)\nIncome taxes — 234 — 234\nBalance at December 31, 2021 $ (711) $ 711 $ — $ —\nOther comprehensive income (loss) (1,771) 294 101 (1,376)\nIncome taxes — — — —\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ (2,482) $ 1,005 $ 101 $ (1,376)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) 1,417 (1,233) (101) 83\nIncome taxes — — — —\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ (1,065) $ (228) $ — $ (1,293)\n15. Revenue recognition and accounts receivable\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company accounts for a contract when there is (i) approval and commitment from both parties, (ii) the rights of the parties are\nidentified, (iii) payment terms are identified, (iv) the contract has commercial substance, (v) and collectability of consideration is\nprobable. The Company’s contracts may contain one or more performance obligations. If a contract contains more than one\nperformance obligation, the Company allocates the total transaction price to each of the performance obligations based upon the\nobservable standalone selling price of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. The Company\nrecognizes revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, which typically occurs at a point\nin time upon shipment, delivery, or utilization, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to be\nentitled to in exchange for the promised goods or services. The consideration for goods or services reflects any fixed amount stated\nper the contract and estimates for any variable consideration, such as discounts, to the extent that is it probable that a significant\nreversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is\nresolved.\nThe following sections discuss the Company’s revenue recognition policies by significant product category:\nBone Growth Therapies\nBone Growth Therapies revenue is largely attributable to the U.S. and is comprised of third-party payor transactions and wholesale\nrevenue.\nThe largest portion of Bone Growth Therapies revenue is derived from third-party payors. This includes commercial insurance\ncarriers, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, and governmental payors, such as Medicare. Revenue\nis recognized when the product is fitted to and accepted by the patient and all applicable documents required by the third-party\npayor have been obtained. Amounts paid by third-party payors are generally based on fixed or allowable reimbursement rates.\nThese revenues are recorded at the expected or preauthorized reimbursement rates, net of any contractual allowances or\nadjustments. Certain billings are subject to review by the third-party payors and may be subject to adjustment.\nWholesale revenue is related to the sale of the Company’s bone growth stimulators directly to durable medical equipment suppliers.\nWholesale revenues are typically recognized upon shipment and receipt of a confirming purchase order, which is when the customer\nobtains control of the promised goods.\nBiologics\nBiologics revenue is largely attributable to the U.S. and is mostly processed from within our Irvine facility. In addition, we have a long\nstanding collaborative arrangement with MTF that provides exclusive global marketing rights to MTF’s Trinity and FiberFuse product\nF-28\nfamilies. Per the terms of the agreement, MTF sources the tissue, processes it to create the allografts, packages, and delivers the\ntissue to the customer. The Company received marketing fees from MTF based on sales of products covered under the collaborative\narrangement. MTF is considered the principal in these arrangements; therefore, the Company recognizes marketing service fees on a\nnet basis within net sales upon shipment of the product to the customer and receipt of a confirming purchase order.\nSpinal Implants and Global Orthopedics\nSpinal Implants and Global Orthopedics products are distributed world-wide, with U.S. sales largely comprised of commercial sales\nand international sales derived from both commercial sales and stocking distributor arrangements.\nCommercial revenue is largely related to the sale of the Company’s Spinal Implants and Global Orthopedics products to hospital\ncustomers. The customer obtains control and revenues are recognized when these products have been utilized and a confirming\npurchase order has been received from the hospital.\nOther revenues within the Spinal Implants and Global Orthopedics product categories are derived from stocking distributors, who\npurchase the Company’s products and then re-sell them directly to customers, such as hospitals. For stocking distributor\narrangements, it is the Company’s policy to recognize revenue upon shipment and receipt of a confirming purchase order, which is\nwhen the distributor obtains control of the promised goods. The transaction price for revenue recognition is estimated based upon\nthe Company’s historical collection experience with the stocking distributor.\nProduct Sales and Marketing Service Fees\nThe table below presents net sales, which includes product sales and marketing service fees, for each of the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nFor the year ended December 31,\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nProduct sales $ 693,345 $ 405,437 $ 409,554\nMarketing service fees 53,296 55,276 54,925\nNet sales $ 746,641 $ 460,713 $ 464,479\nMarketing service fees are received from MTF based on total sales of biologics tissues and relates solely to the Biologics product\ncategory within the Global Spine reporting segment, whereas product sales primarily consist of the sale of Bone Growth Therapies,\nSpinal Implants, non-MTF sourced Biologics, Enabling Technologies, and Global Orthopedics products. Marketing service fees\nreceived from MTF were $53.3 million, or approximately 32% of total Biologics revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2023. As\nMTF is the single supplier for certain allografts in the Company’s Biologics portfolio, derived from deceased donors for their bone\ngrafts and living donors for their amnion grafts, any event or circumstance that would impact MTF’s continued access to donors or\nthe Company’s ability to market these tissues may adversely impact the Company’s financial results.\nRevenues exclude any value added or other local taxes, intercompany sales, and trade discounts. Shipping and handling costs for\nproducts shipped to customers are included in cost of sales, and were $9.5 million, $4.2 million, and $3.5 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nAccounts receivable and related allowances\nPayment terms vary by the type and location of the Company’s customers and the products or services offered. The term between\ninvoicing and when payment is due is not significant.\nThe Company’s allowance for expected credit losses represents the portion of the receivable’s amortized cost basis that an entity\ndoes not expect to collect over the receivable’s contractual life, considering past events, current conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of future economic conditions.\nThe process for estimating the ultimate collection of accounts receivable involves certain assumptions and judgments. The\ndetermination of the contractual life of accounts receivable, the aging of outstanding receivables, as well as the historical\ncollections, write-offs, and payor reimbursement experience over the estimated contractual lives of such receivables, are integral\nparts of the estimation process related to reserves for expected credit losses and the establishment of contractual allowances.\nAccounts receivable are analyzed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of both reserves for expected credit losses and\ncontractual allowances. Revisions in allowances for expected credit loss estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt\nexpense within sales and marketing expenses. Revisions to contractual allowances are recorded as an adjustment to net sales. These\nF-29\nestimates are periodically tested against actual collection experience. In addition, the Company analyzes its receivables by\ngeography and by customer type, where appropriate, in developing estimates for expected credit losses.\nThe following table provides a detail of changes in the Company’s allowance for expected credit losses for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, and 2022:\nFor the year ended December 31,\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022\nAllowance for expected credit losses beginning balance $ 6,419 $ 4,944\nAddition resulting from the Merger with SeaSpine 137 —\nCurrent period provision for expected credit losses 820 2,095\nWrite-offs charged against the allowance and other (381) (450)\nEffect of changes in foreign exchange rates 135 (170)\nAllowance for expected credit losses ending balance $ 7,130 $ 6,419\nThe Company will generally sell receivables from certain Italian public hospitals each year to accelerate cash collections. During\n2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company sold €9.2 million, €9.2 million, and €8.4 million ($10.0 million, $9.6 million, and $9.9 million) of\nreceivables, respectively. The related fees for 2023, 2022, and 2021, were $0.4 million, $0.3 million, and $0.2 million, respectively,\nwhich were recorded as interest expense. Accounts receivables sold without recourse are removed from the balance sheet at the\ntime of sale.\nContract Liabilities\nThe Company’s contract liabilities largely related to a prepayment of $13.9 million received in 2020 from the Centers for Medicare\nand Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") as part of the Accelerated and Advance Payment Program of the CARES Act.\nOn October 1, 2020, the President of the United States signed the “Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021 and Other Extensions Act,”\nwhich relaxed a number of the Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payment Program’s recoupment terms for providers and\nsuppliers that received funds from the program. In April 2021, Medicare began to recoup 25% of Medicare payments otherwise\nowed to the provider or supplier for submitted claims. Recoupment then increased to 50% of Medicare payments in March 2022.\nThus, during these time periods, rather than receiving the full amount of payment for newly submitted claims, the Company’s\noutstanding balance under the Accelerated and Advance Payment Program was reduced by the recoupment amount until the full\nbalance had been repaid.\nThe following table provides a detail of changes in the Company’s contract liability associated with the Accelerated and Advanced\nPayment Program for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022\nContract liability beginning balance $ — $ 4,791\nRecoupment recognized in net sales — (4,791)\nContract liability ending balance $ — $ —\nOther Contract Assets\nThe Company’s contract assets, excluding accounts receivable (“Other Contract Assets”), largely consist of payments made to certain\ndistributors to obtain contracts, gain access to customers in certain territories, and to provide the benefit of the exclusive\ndistribution of the Company’s products. Other Contract Assets are included in other long-term assets and totaled $0.3 million and\n$1.1 million as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nOther Contract Assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related contract. For the year ended December 31,\n2023, the Company recorded $0.4 million in impairment charges related to the termination of certain distribution agreements. No\nimpairments were incurred for other contract assets 2022. Further, the Company applies the practical expedient to expense sales\ncommissions when incurred, as the applicable amortization period would be for one year or less.\nF-30\n16. Business segment information\nThe Company's operations are managed through two reporting segments: Global Spine and Global Orthopedics. These reporting\nsegments represent the operating segments for which the Chief Executive Officer, who is also the CODM, reviews financial\ninformation and makes resource allocation decisions among businesses. The primary metric used by the CODM in managing the\nCompany is adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (“adjusted EBITDA”, a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure). Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization,\nand excludes the impact of share-based compensation, gains and losses related to changes in foreign exchange rates, charges\nrelated to the SeaSpine merger and other strategic investments, acquisition-related fair value adjustments, gains and/or losses on\ninvestments, litigation and investigation charges, charges related to initial compliance with regulations set forth by the European\nUnion Medical Device Regulation, gains and/or losses related to the realized effects the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the\nCompany's business operations, and succession charges.\nCorporate activities are comprised of operating expenses not directly identifiable within the two reporting segments, such as human\nresources, finance, legal, and information technology functions. The Company neither discretely allocates assets, other than\ngoodwill, to its operating segments nor evaluates the operating segments using discrete asset information.\nGlobal Spine\nThe Global Spine reporting segment offers two primary product categories: (i) Bone Growth Therapies and (ii) Spinal Implants,\nBiologics, and Enabling Technologies.\nThe Bone Growth Therapies product category manufactures, distributes, sells, and provides support services for market leading\ndevices used adjunctively in high-risk spinal fusion procedures and to treat both nonunion and acute fractures in the orthopedic\nspace. These Class III medical devices are indicated as an adjunctive, noninvasive treatment to improve fusion success rates in the\ncervical and lumbar spine as well as a therapeutic treatment for non-spine acute and nonunion fractures. This product category uses\ndistributors and a direct sales channel to sell its devices to hospitals, healthcare providers, and patients, in the U.S.\nSpinal Implants, Biologics, and Enabling Technologies is comprised of (i) a broad portfolio of spine fixation and motion preservation\nimplant products used in surgical procedures of the spine, (ii) one of the most comprehensive biologics portfolios in both the\ndemineralized bone matrix and cellular allograft market segments, and (iii) image-guided surgical solutions to facilitate\ndegenerative, minimally invasive, and complex surgical procedures. Spinal Implants, Biologics, and Enabling Technologies products\nare sold through a network of distributors and sales representatives to hospitals and healthcare providers on a global basis for Spinal\nImplants and Enabling Technologies, and primarily within the U.S. for Biologics.\nGlobal Orthopedics\nThe Global Orthopedics reporting segment offers products and solutions for limb deformity correction and complex limb\nreconstruction with a focus on use in trauma, adult and pediatric limb reconstruction, and foot and ankle procedures. This reporting\nsegment specializes in the design, development, and marketing of external and internal fixation orthopedic products that are\ncoupled with enabling digital technologies to serve the complete patient treatment pathway. We sell these products through a\nglobal network of distributors and sales representatives to hospitals, healthcare organizations, and healthcare providers.\nCorporate\nCorporate activities are comprised of the operating expenses and activities of the Company not necessarily identifiable within the\ntwo reporting segments.\nThe table below presents net sales by major product category by reporting segment:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nPercent of Percent of Percent of\nTotal Net Total Net Total Net\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) Net Sales Sales Net Sales Sales Net Sales Sales\nBone Growth Therapies $ 212,530 28.5% $ 187,247 40.7% $ 187,448 40.4%\nSpinal Implants, Biologics, and Enabling Technologies 418,789 56.1% 165,927 36.0% 171,515 36.9%\nGlobal Spine 631,319 84.6% 353,174 76.7% 358,963 77.3%\nGlobal Orthopedics 115,322 15.4% 107,539 23.3% 105,516 22.7%\nNet sales $ 746,641 100.0% $ 460,713 100.0% $ 464,479 100.0%\nF-31\nThe following table presents adjusted EBITDA, the primary metric used in managing the Company, by reporting segment:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nAdjusted EBITDA by reporting segment\nGlobal Spine $ 91,115 $ 62,692 $ 71,086\nGlobal Orthopedics 442 5,267 9,260\nCorporate (45,272) (19,406) (19,084)\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA $ 46,285 $ 48,553 $ 61,262\nReconciling items:\nInterest expense, net $ 8,631 $ 1,288 $ 1,837\nDepreciation and amortization 53,063 29,019 41,355\nShare-based compensation expense 35,707 18,443 15,432\nForeign exchange impact (1,581) 3,291 3,981\nSeaSpine merger-related costs 36,623 12,010 —\nStrategic investments 2,272 4,018 5,700\nAcquisition-related fair value adjustments 33,393 (15,595) (2,014)\n(Gain) loss on investments 1,781 187 (644)\nLitigation and investigation costs 14,453 803 33\nMedical device regulation 9,446 10,261 8,018\nBusiness interruption - COVID-19 — 2,387 320\nSuccession charges 1,176 147 739\nLoss before income taxes $ (148,679) $ (17,706) $ (13,495)\nThe following table presents depreciation and amortization by reporting segment:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nGlobal Spine $ 41,213 $ 18,213 $ 17,548\nGlobal Orthopedics 7,158 6,696 8,233\nCorporate 4,692 4,110 3,818\nTotal $ 53,063 $ 29,019 $ 29,599\nGeographical information\nThe table below presents net sales by geographic destination for each reporting segment and for the consolidated Company:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nGlobal Spine\nU.S. $ 591,937 $ 332,846 $ 337,455\nInternational 39,382 20,328 21,508\nTotal Global Spine 631,319 353,174 358,963\nGlobal Orthopedics\nU.S. $ 28,892 25,997 24,490\nInternational 86,430 81,542 81,026\nTotal Global Orthopedics 115,322 107,539 105,516\nConsolidated\nU.S. 620,829 358,843 361,945\nInternational 125,812 101,870 102,534\nNet sales $ 746,641 $ 460,713 $ 464,479\nF-32\nThe following data includes net sales by geographic destination:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nU.S. $ 620,829 $ 358,843 $ 361,945\nItaly 20,060 19,098 20,187\nGermany 11,467 11,569 13,716\nUnited Kingdom 10,910 10,171 10,552\nFrance 11,096 10,377 10,475\nBrazil 6,452 5,668 5,108\nOthers 65,827 44,987 42,496\nNet sales $ 746,641 $ 460,713 $ 464,479\nThe following data includes property, plant, and equipment by geographic area:\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022\nU.S. $ 142,727 $ 44,802\nItaly 10,187 8,535\nGermany 3,030 3,115\nOthers 3,116 1,777\nTotal $ 159,060 $ 58,229\n17. Acquisition-related amortization and remeasurement\nAcquisition-related amortization and remeasurement consists of (i) the remeasurement of any related contingent consideration\narrangement, (ii) amortization related to intangible assets acquired through business combinations or asset acquisitions, (iii)\nrecognized costs associated with acquired IPR&D assets, which are recognized immediately upon acquisition, and (iv) impairments of\ngoodwill related to previously recognized business combinations. Components of acquisition-related amortization and\nremeasurement for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, are as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nChanges in fair value of contingent consideration $ (2,700) $ (17,200) $ (3,575)\nAmortization of acquired intangibles 17,408 8,196 7,907\nAcquired IPR&D 49 1,600 1,500\nImpairment of Global Orthopedics goodwill — — 11,756\nTotal $ 14,757 $ (7,404) $ 17,588\nLegion Innovations, LLC Asset Acquisition\nOn December 29, 2022, the Company entered into a technology assignment and royalty agreement with Legion Innovations, LLC, a\nU.S.-based medical device technology company, whereby the Company acquired intellectual property rights to certain assets. As\nconsideration, the Company agreed to pay $0.2 million in January 2023, with additional payments contingent upon reaching future\ncommercialization and revenue-based milestones. The Company accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition. As the\ntransaction was classified as an asset acquisition, the value of the consideration associated with the contingent milestones will be\nrecognized at the time that applicable contingencies are resolved and consideration is paid or becomes payable. The $0.2 million\ninitial payment was accrued as of December 31, 2022, and was recognized as acquired IPR&D costs, which was then immediately\nexpensed.\nIGEA S.p.A Asset Acquisition\nIn April 2021, the Company entered into an Exclusive License and Distribution Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with IGEA S.p.A\n(“IGEA”), an Italian manufacturer and distributor of bone and cartilage stimulation systems. As consideration for the License\nAgreement, the Company agreed to pay up to $4.0 million, with certain payments contingent upon reaching an FDA milestone. Of\nthis amount, $0.5 million was paid in 2021, which was recognized as acquired IPR&D costs within acquisition-related amortization\nand remeasurement. The Company accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition. As the transaction was classified as an\nF-33\nasset acquisition, the value of the consideration associated with the contingent milestones are be recognized at the time that\napplicable contingencies are resolved and consideration is paid or becomes payable. The License Agreement also includes certain\nminimum purchase requirements.\nIn May 2022, the Company achieved FDA approval pertaining to the acquired technology, triggering a contingent consideration\nmilestone obligation of $3.5 million. Of this amount, $1.5 million was paid in 2022 and $1.0 million was paid in 2023. The remaining\n$1.0 million is accrued within other current liabilities as of December 31, 2023.\n18. Share-based compensation\nAt December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company had stock option and award plans, and a stock purchase plan.\nMerger with SeaSpine\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, the equity awards of SeaSpine (including stock options and restricted stock units) outstanding as\nof immediately prior to the closing of the Merger were converted into equity awards denominated in shares of Orthofix common\nstock. The Company issued options to purchase 1.9 million shares of Orthofix common stock and 0.5 million shares of time-based\nvesting restricted stock in connection with the conversion of such awards. The estimated fair value of the portion of the SeaSpine\nequity awards for which the required service period had been completed at the time of the closing of the Merger was treated as\npurchase consideration. The remaining estimated fair value is recorded as compensation expense over the remainder of the service\nperiod associated with the awards.\nIn addition, as part of the Merger, the Board of Directors determined to treat the transaction as a “Change in Control” under\napplicable agreements and equity plans. Thus, in January 2023, all outstanding and previously granted performance-based and\nmarket-based restricted stock units were converted to time-based restricted stock units.\n2012 Long Term Incentive Plan\nThe Board of Directors adopted the Amended and Restated 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2012 LTIP”) on April 23, 2018,\nwhich was subsequently approved by shareholder ratification. The 2012 LTIP provides for the grant of options to purchase shares of\nthe Company’s common stock, stock awards (including restricted stock, unrestricted stock, and stock units), stock appreciation\nrights, performance-based awards, and other equity-based awards. All of the Company’s employees and the employees of the\nCompany’s subsidiaries and affiliates are eligible and may receive awards under the 2012 LTIP. In addition, the Company’s non-\nemployee directors, consultants, and advisors who perform services for the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates may receive\nawards under the 2012 LTIP. Awards granted under the 2012 LTIP expire no later than ten years after the date of grant. At\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company reserves a total of 11.3 million shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to the 2012 LTIP,\nsubject to certain adjustments set forth in the 2012 LTIP. At December 31, 2023, there were 1.6 million options outstanding under\nthe 2012 LTIP, of which 0.7 million were exercisable. In addition, there were 1.6 million restricted stock units outstanding, some of\nwhich contain performance-based vesting conditions, under the 2012 LTIP as of December 31, 2023.\nSeaSpine 2015 Plan\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company assumed awards outstanding under the SeaSpine Holdings Corporation Amended\nand Restated 2015 Incentive Award Plan Award Plan (the “SeaSpine 2015 Plan”). The SeaSpine 2015 Plan provides for the grant of\noptions to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, stock awards (including restricted stock, unrestricted stock, and stock\nunits), stock appreciation rights, performance-based awards and other equity-based awards. All of the Company’s employees and\nthe employees of the Company’s subsidiaries and affiliates are eligible and may receive awards under the SeaSpine 2015 Plan. In\naddition, the Company’s non-employee directors, consultants, and advisors who perform services for the Company and its\nsubsidiaries and affiliates may receive awards under the SeaSpine 2015 Plan. At December 31, 2023, the Company reserves a total of\n3.0 million shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to the SeaSpine 2015 Plan, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the\nSeaSpine 2015 Plan. At December 31, 2023, there were 1.0 million options outstanding under the SeaSpine 2015 Plan, of which 0.9\nmillion were exercisable. In addition, there were 0.2 million restricted stock units outstanding, some of which contain performance-\nbased vesting conditions, under the SeaSpine 2015 Plan as of December 31, 2023.\nInducement Plans\nIn August 2019, the Company appointed a new President of Global Spine, who was then subsequently promoted to President and\nChief Executive Officer, a position held until the closing of the merger with SeaSpine on January 5, 2023. As an inducement to accept\nemployment with the Company, the individual was awarded a grant of stock options to acquire up to less than 51 thousand shares\nF-34\nof common stock and an award of 15 thousand restricted stock units. As of December 31, 2023, there were 51 thousand options\noutstanding under this inducement, all of which were exercisable.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company assumed awards outstanding under the SeaSpine 2018 Employment Inducement\nIncentive Award Plan and the SeaSpine 2020 Employment Inducement Incentive Award Plan. As of December 31, 2023, there were\n0.3 million options outstanding under these inducements, 0.2 million of which were exercisable, and 17 thousand unvested\nrestricted stock units outstanding.\nIn January 2023, the Company granted options to acquire up to 0.9 million shares of common stock and awarded 0.5 million\nrestricted stock units to SeaSpine employees as an inducement to continue employment with the Company. As of December 31,\n2023, there were 0.3 million options outstanding under this inducement, none of which were exercisable, and 0.2 million unvested\nrestricted stock units outstanding.\nStock Purchase Plan\nThe Second Amended and Restated Stock Purchase Plan, as Amended (the “Stock Purchase Plan”) provides for the issuance of shares\nof the Company’s common stock to eligible employees and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries that elect to participate in\nthe plan and acquire shares of common stock through payroll deductions (including executive officers).\nDuring each purchase period, eligible employees may designate between 1% and 25% of their compensation to be deducted for the\npurchase of common stock under the plan (or such other percentage in order to comply with regulations applicable to employees\ndomiciled in or resident of a member state of the European Union). For eligible directors, the designated percentage will be applied\nto an amount equal to his or her director compensation paid in cash for the current plan period. The purchase price of the shares\nunder the plan is equal to 85% of the fair market value on the first day of the plan period or, if lower, on the last day of the plan\nperiod.\nDue to the compensatory nature of such plan, the Company records the related share-based compensation expense in the\nconsolidated statement of operations. Compensation expense is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, with such value\nrecognized as expense over the plan period. As of December 31, 2023, the aggregate number of shares reserved for issuance under\nthe Stock Purchase Plan is 3.6 million. As of December 31, 2023, a total of 2.8 million shares had been issued pursuant to the Stock\nPurchase Plan.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nShare-based compensation expense is recorded in the same line of the consolidated statements of operations as the employee’s\ncash compensation. The following tables present the detail of share-based compensation expense by line item in the consolidated\nstatements of income as well as by award type, for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nCost of sales $ 1,901 $ 826 $ 779\nSales and marketing 8,174 3,865 3,385\nGeneral and administrative 21,743 12,917 10,289\nResearch and development 3,889 835 979\nTotal $ 35,707 $ 18,443 $ 15,432\nYear Ended December 31,\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nStock options $ 6,130 $ 1,114 $ 1,893\nTime-based restricted stock awards and stock units 27,290 9,452 7,437\nPerformance-based / Market-based restricted stock units 227 6,425 4,414\nStock purchase plan 2,060 1,452 1,688\nTotal $ 35,707 $ 18,443 $ 15,432\nThe income tax benefit related to this expense was $5.8 million, $3.3 million, and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nF-35\nStock Options\nThe fair value of time-based stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model, with such value recognized as\nexpense over the service period, which is typically three to four years, net of actual forfeitures. A summary of the Company’s\nassumptions used in determining the fair value of the stock options granted during each of the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022, and 2021, is shown in the following table. The Company did not grant any time-based stock options in 2022.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nAssumptions:\nExpected term (in years) 6.0 — 6.0\nExpected volatility 36.8% – 42.3% — 34.4% – 34.8%\nRisk free interest rate 3.38% – 4.61% — 0.83% – 1.25%\nDividend yield — — —\nWeighted average grant date fair value $ 8.43 $ — $ 12.33\nThe expected term of the options granted is estimated based on a number of factors, including the vesting and expiration terms of\nthe award, historical employee exercise behavior for both options that are currently outstanding and options that have been\nexercised or are expired, and an employee’s average length of service. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the\nCompany’s common stock. The risk-free interest rate is determined based upon a constant U.S. Treasury security rate with a\ncontractual life that approximates the expected term of the option.\nSummaries of the status of the Company’s stock option plans as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, and changes during the year\nended December 31, 2023, are presented below:\nWeighted\nWeighted Average\nAverage Remaining\nExercise Contractual\n(In thousands) Options Price Term (Years)\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 1,299 $ 39.29\nAssumed SeaSpine awards 1,890 $ 36.05\nGranted 1,837 $ 19.92\nExercised - $ -\nForfeited or expired (1,803) $ 31.62\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 3,223 $ 30.64 4.97\nVested and expected to vest at December 31, 2023 3,223 $ 30.64 4.97\nExercisable at December 31, 2023 1,828 $ 36.78 2.68\nAs of December 31, 2023, the unamortized compensation expense relating to options granted and expected to be recognized was\n$4.8 million. This amount is expected to be recognized through December 2027 over a weighted average period of approximately\n1.2 years. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $0.0 million, $0.0 million, and $0.6 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we did not receive any cash from stock\noption exercises, and thus did not realize any tax benefit for the tax deductions from stock option exercises. The aggregate intrinsic\nvalue of options outstanding and options exercisable as of December 31, 2023, is calculated as the difference between the exercise\nprice of the underlying options and the market price of the Company’s common stock for options that had exercise prices lower than\n$13.48, the closing price of the Company’s stock on December 31, 2023. The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding was\n$0.1 million as of December 31, 2023. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercisable was $0.0 million as of that date.\nTime-based Restricted Stock Awards and Stock Units\nCompensation expense for time-based restricted stock awards and stock units, which represents the fair value of the stock\nmeasured at the market price at the date of grant, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is typically\nthree to four years, net of actual forfeitures.\nThe aggregate fair value of time-based restricted stock awards and stock units that vested during the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022, and 2021, was $17.2 million, $5.2 million, and $9.0 million, respectively. Unamortized compensation expense related to\ntime-based restricted stock awards and stock units amounted to $22.6 million at December 31, 2023. This amount is expected to be\nF-36\nrecognized through December 2026 over a weighted average period of approximately 1.6 years. The aggregate intrinsic value of\ntime-based restricted stock awards and stock units outstanding was $27.5 million as of December 31, 2023.\nPerformance-based and Market-based Restricted Stock Units\nCertain of the Company's outstanding restricted stock units contain performance-based vested conditions or market-based vesting\nconditions. As previously discussed, all outstanding performance-based and market-based restricted stock units were converted to\ntime-based restricted stock units in January 2023 upon completion of the Merger based on the Board of Directors' determination to\ntreat the transaction as a \"Change in Control\" under applicable agreements and equity plans.\nThe fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is calculated based upon the closing stock price at the date of grant. Such\nvalue is recognized as expense over the requisite service period beginning in the period in which they are deemed probable to vest,\nnet of actual forfeitures. Vesting probability is assessed based upon forecasted financial metrics or applicable milestones associated\nwith the applicable grant.\nThe fair value of market-based restricted stock units is determined at the date of the grant using the Monte Carlo valuation\nmethodology, with any discounts for post-vesting restrictions estimated using the Chaffe Model. The Monte Carlo methodology\nincorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Such value is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the vesting period, net of actual forfeitures.\nThe fair value of performance-based and/or market-based restricted stock units that vested and settled during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, totaled $0.0 million, $0.0 million, and $0.0 million, respectively. Unamortized compensation\nexpense for performance-based and/or market-based restricted stock units totaled less than $0.1 million at December 31, 2023, and\nis expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.0 years. The aggregate intrinsic value of\nperformance-based restricted stock units outstanding was $0.1 million as of December 31, 2023.\nA summary of the status of our time-based and performance-based and/or market-based restricted stock units as of December 31,\n2023, and 2022, and changes during the year ended December 31, 2023, are presented below:\nPerformance-based and/or\nTime-based Restricted Stock Market-based\nAwards and Stock Units Restricted Stock Units\nWeighted Weighted\nAverage Grant Average Grant\nDate Fair Date Fair\n(In thousands) Shares Value Shares Value\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 847 $ 34.18 516 $ 40.29\nAssumed SeaSpine awards 490 $ 22.76 — $ —\nConversion of performance-based and market-based stock units to time-\nbased stock units 516 $ 40.29 (516) $ 40.29\nGranted 1,496 $ 18.51 13 $ 20.10\nVested and settled (749) $ 29.04 (4) $ 22.76\nCancelled (560) $ 21.12 — $ —\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 2,040 $ 26.96 9 $ 22.69\n19. Defined contribution plans and deferred compensation\nDefined Contribution Plans\nOrthofix sponsors a defined contribution plan (the “401(k) Plan”) covering substantially all full-time U.S. employees. The 401(k) Plan\nallows participants to contribute up to 80% of their pre-tax compensation, subject to certain limitations, with the Company matching\n100% of the first 2% of the employee’s base compensation and 50% of the next 4% of the employee’s base compensation if\ncontributed to the 401(k) Plan. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, expenses incurred relating to the 401(k)\nPlan, including matching contributions, were approximately $4.6 million, $3.3 million, and $2.8 million, respectively.\nThe Company also operates defined contribution plans for its international employees meeting minimum service requirements. The\nCompany’s expenses for such contributions during each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, were $1.1 million,\n$1.1 million, and $1.2 million, respectively.\nF-37\nEffective February 1, 2024, Orthofix amended the 401(k) Plan to allow participants to contribute up to 90% of their pre-tax\ncompensation, subject to certain limitations, with the Company matching 100% of the first 4% of the employee's base\ncompensation.\nDeferred Compensation Plans\nUnder Italian Law, our Italian subsidiary accrues deferred compensation on behalf of its employees, which is paid on termination of\nemployment. The accrual for deferred compensation is based on a percentage of the employee’s current annual remuneration plus\nan annual charge. Deferred compensation is also accrued for the leaving indemnity payable to agents in case of dismissal, which is\nregulated by a national contract and is equal to approximately 4% of total commissions earned from the Company. The Company’s\nrelations with its Italian employees, who represent 14% of total employees at December 31, 2023, are governed by the provisions of\na National Collective Labor Agreement setting forth mandatory minimum standards for labor relations in the metal mechanic\nworkers industry. The Company is not a party to any other collective bargaining agreement. The balance in other long-term liabilities\nas of December 31, 2023, and 2022 was $1.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively, and represents the amount that would be\npayable if all the employees and agents had terminated employment at that date.\n20.

Deferred income tax liabilities is included in Other Long\nTerm Liabilities.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nrecognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax basis\nof assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using\nenacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those items are expected to be realized. Tax law and rate changes are recorded in\nthe period such changes are enacted. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that certain\ndeferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future.\nThe valuation allowance is primarily attributable to net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences in domestic and\ncertain foreign jurisdictions. The net increase in the valuation allowance of $116.4 million during the year principally relates to the\nexisting valuation allowance against the SeaSpine deferred tax assets at the time of the merger. The remaining activity is related to\nrecognizing a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset within the Company’s U.S. and Italy operations. The\nCompany considered many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of these deferred tax assets, including recent\ncumulative losses experienced by the subsidiary, expectations of future taxable income or loss, the carryforward periods available to\nthe Company for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. That increase was partially offset by a decrease of valuation\nallowances on net operating loss carryforwards in other foreign jurisdictions due to expiration, statutory rate changes, and changes\nregarding the realizability of net deferred tax assets. It is reasonably possible that the valuation allowance will increase in 2024 due\nto further losses in certain jurisdictions, offset by decreases related to the expiration of foreign net operating losses.\nF-39\nThe Company has federal net operating loss carryforwards of $331.7 million and federal research and development credits of $4.7\nmillion, including amounts from the acquisitions of SeaSpine and Spinal Kinetics. The increase in the current year is primarily related\nto U.S. Federal net operating loss carryforwards belonging to SeaSpine at the time of the Merger as well as research and\ndevelopment credit carryforwards. These federal carryforwards are subject to limitation under the provisions of Internal Revenue\nCode Section 382 and will begin to expire in 2026. The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $221.4\nmillion, principally related to California, Illinois, Michigan, and New York. Of this amount, $157.9 relates to SeaSpine and $20.6\nmillion relates to Spinal Kinetics. The increase in state net operating loss carryforwards is primarily due to existing losses acquired\nfrom SeaSpine. The SeaSpine state losses begin to expire in 2024 and the Spinal Kinetics state losses begin to expire in 2027. These\ncarryforwards are subject to limitation under various provisions implemented by each specific state jurisdiction. Additionally, the\nCompany has net operating loss carryforwards in various foreign jurisdictions of approximately $129.0 million, which mainly relate\nto the Company’s Netherlands, Brazil, and Canada operations. The majority of the foreign net operating losses do not expire. The\nCompany also has research and development credits in Canada of $0.9 million which begin to expire in 2041.\nUnremitted foreign earnings were $33.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company’s investment in foreign subsidiaries\ncontinues to be indefinite in nature; however, the Company may periodically repatriate a portion of these earnings to the extent\nthat it does not incur significant additional tax liability. Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any, associated with indefinitely\nreinvested earnings of foreign subsidiaries is not practicable.\nThe Company records a benefit for uncertain tax positions when the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than\nnot, based on an evaluation of the technical merits, that the tax position will be sustained on audit. The tax benefit is measured as\nthe largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement. The Company re-evaluates income tax positions\nperiodically to consider changes in facts or circumstances such as changes in or interpretations of tax law, effectively settled issues\nunder audit, and new audit activity. The Company includes interest and any applicable penalties related to income tax issues as part\nof income tax expense in its consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company’s unrecognized tax benefit was $3.0 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022,\nrespectively. The Company recorded net interest and penalties expense (benefit) on unrecognized tax benefits of $0.2 million, $0.1\nmillion, and $(0.4) million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and had approximately $1.1 million\nand $0.9 million accrued for payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Approximately $0.4\nmillion would unfavorably impact the Company’s effective tax rate if recognized. The Company believes it is reasonably possible\nthat, in the next 12 months, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest and penalties, related to the resolution of\nfederal, state, and foreign matters could be reduced by $1.2 million as audits close and statutes expire.\nA reconciliation of the gross unrecognized tax benefits (excluding interest and penalties) for the years ended December 31, 2023,\nand 2022, is shown below:\n(U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2023 2022\nBalance as of January 1, $ 1,743 $ 3,462\nAdditions for current year tax positions 416 46\nIncreases for prior year tax positions 815 16\nSettlements of prior year tax positions — (144)\nExpiration of statutes — (1,637)\nBalance as of December 31, $ 2,974 $ 1,743\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in certain state and foreign jurisdictions,\nincluding Italy, as well as other jurisdictions where the Company maintains operations. The statute of limitations with respect to\nfederal and state tax filings is closed for years prior to 2019. The statute of limitations with respect to the major foreign tax filing\njurisdictions is closed for years prior to 2018. The Company cannot reasonably determine if any state and local or foreign\nexaminations will have a material impact on its financial statements and cannot predict the timing regarding the resolution of these\ntax examinations.\nF-40\n21. Earnings per share (EPS)\nFor periods in which non-vested restricted stock awards with nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (referred to\nas participating securities) were outstanding, the Company used the two-class method of computing basic and diluted EPS. In other\nperiods, the Company used the treasury stock method of computing basic and diluted EPS.\nBasic EPS is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each of the respective years.\nDiluted EPS is computed using the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during each of\nthe respective years using the more dilutive of either the treasury stock method or two-class method (if other participating\nsecurities were outstanding). The difference between basic and diluted shares, if any, largely results from common equivalent\nshares, which represents the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of certain outstanding share options, the assumed vesting of\nrestricted stock granted to employees and directors, or the satisfaction of certain necessary conditions for contingently issuable\nshares (see Note 18).\nFor each of the three years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, no significant adjustments were made to net income for\npurposes of calculating basic and diluted EPS. The following is a reconciliation of the weighted average shares used in the diluted EPS\ncomputations:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nWeighted average common shares-basic 36,729 20,054 19,691\nEffect of diluted securities:\nUnexercised stock options and employee stock purchase plan — — —\nUnvested time-based restricted stock units — — —\nWeighted average common shares-diluted 36,729 20,054 19,691\nThere were 6.5 million, 2.3 million and 1.7 million weighted average outstanding options, time-based restricted stock awards and\nstock units, performance-based stock units, and market-based stock units not included in the diluted earnings per share\ncomputation for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, because inclusion of these awards was anti-\ndilutive or, for performance-based stock units and market-based stock units, all necessary conditions had not been satisfied by the\nend of the respective period.\nF-41"
