Our Caldwell team is continually focused on creating innovative products that elevate the user's experience on the range, and we nailed it with this one.“\n\n![](/system/files-encrypted/nasdaq_kms/inline-images/Screenshot%202024-10-22%20155014_0.png) Left: The Caldwell(R) Claymore(R) PullPupTM packs the power of a traditional clay target thrower into a compact handheld unit.  _Right: James Tayon, Chief Product Officer for American Outdoor Brands, accepts the NASGW Best New Accessory Award._\n\nThe Caldwell® Claymore® PullPup™ brings the power of a traditional clay target thrower and packs it into a compact handheld unit. The PullPup™ can launch standard, midi, and mini clay targets over fifty-five yards – on par with larger standard clay throwers. Dual grip safeties ensure that both hands remain out of the path of the target and arm when released. With its handheld design, the thrower can easily change the angle of the target at will, allowing shooters to practice different angles and test their skills. A clip on the arm holds the target in place allowing the PullPup™ to launch targets off-camber, for both traditional angles and on-edge target presentations. The Caldwell Claymore® PullPup™ is available at www.caldwellshooting.com. For more info, visit [www.caldwellshooting.com](http://www.caldwellshooting.com).\n\n_About Caldwell_ Caldwell® is a leading shooting accessory brand within the American Outdoor Brands, Inc. portfolio. Trusted by firearms owners for over two decades, Caldwell® innovates new products to Eliminate the Variables That Make You Miss™. \n\nContact: Jarrod Grove, Sr. Marketing Manager - Caldwelljgrove@aob.com\n\n## Social Share\n\n  * [ ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/american-outdoor-brands-inc \"linkedin\")\n\n\n\n## Investor Tools\n\n  * [ ](/investor-resources/email-alerts \"Email Alerts\")\n  * [ ](/rss-feeds \"RSS Feeds\")\n  * [ ](/investor-resources/investor-contacts \"Investor Contacts\")\n  * [ ](javascript:window.print\\(\\); \"Print Page\")\n\n\n\n[](# \"Back to top\")\n\n×\n"
