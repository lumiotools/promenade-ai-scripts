(“Dragonfly Energy” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: DFLI), maker of Battle Born Batteries® and an industry leader in energy storage, today, announced today that it will effect a 1-for-9 reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock. This will be effective for trading purposes as of the commencement of trading on Friday, November 22, 2024. Dragonfly Energy’s common stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “DFLI” and under a new CUSIP number, 26145B 304.\n\nAs a result of the reverse stock split, every nine pre-split shares of common stock outstanding will become one share of common stock. The par value of Dragonfly Energy’s common stock will remain unchanged at $0.0001 per share after the reverse stock split. The reverse stock split will not change the authorized number of shares of Dragonfly Energy’s common stock. The reverse stock split will affect all stockholders uniformly and will not alter any stockholder's percentage interest in Dragonfly Energy’s equity, except to the extent that the reverse stock split results in some stockholders owning a fractional share. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Instead, in lieu of any fractional shares to which a stockholder of record would otherwise be entitled as a result of the reverse stock split, the Company will issue to such stockholder such additional fraction of a share as is necessary to increase such resulting fractional share to a full share of common stock. The reverse stock split will also apply to common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Company’s outstanding warrants and stock options, with a proportionate adjustment to the exercise prices thereof, and under Dragonfly Energy’s equity incentive plans.\n\nThe reverse stock split will reduce the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding from approximately 63.2 million to approximately 7.0 million.\n\nThe Company’s stockholders approved the reverse stock split by a majority of the votes cast at the Company’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on November 12, 2024, to be effected in the discretion of the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) at a ratio of not less than 1-for-5 and not more than 1-for-20 (the “Reverse Stock Split Proposal”). The Board approved the reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-9 on November 11, 2024, subject to stockholder approval of the Reverse Stock Split Proposal.\n\nEquinity Trust Company, LLC is acting as the exchange agent and transfer agent for the reverse stock split. Stockholders holding their shares in book-entry form or in brokerage accounts need not take any action in connection with the reverse stock split. Beneficial holders are encouraged to contact their bank, broker or custodian with any procedural questions.\n\n**About Dragonfly Energy**\n\nDragonfly Energy Holdings Corp.

(“Dragonfly Energy” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: DFLI), maker of Battle Born Batteries® and an industry leader in energy storage, today reported its financial and operational results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Net Sales were $12.7 million, compared to $15.9 million in Q3 2023\n  * Gross Profit was $2.9 million, compared to $4.6 million in Q3 2023\n  * Operating Expenses were $(8.9) million, compared to $(10.5) million in Q3 2023\n  * Net Loss of $(6.8) million, compared to Net Loss of $(10.0) million in Q3 2023\n  * Diluted Net Loss per share was $(0.11), compared to Net Loss of $(0.17) per share in Q3 2023\n  * EBITDA was $(0.8) million, compared to $(5.7) million in Q3 2023\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $(5.5) million, compared to $(4.6) million in Q3 2023\n\n\n\n**Operational and Business Highlights**\n\n  * Completed a pilot demonstration of methane reduction power solutions for the oil & gas industry.\n  * Launched Dragonfly IntelLigence smart battery technology for the heavy-duty trucking industry, providing real-time system monitoring and app-based connectivity for fleets and drivers.\n  * Dragonfly Energy’s Battle Born Batteries are now available through Keystone Automotive Operations, a leading distributor in the automotive, RV, and marine sectors.\n\n\n\n“We remain committed to advancing lithium-ion battery innovation despite challenging economic conditions,” said Dr. Denis Phares, Chief Executive Officer of Dragonfly Energy. “Our strategic expansion into the heavy-duty trucking and oil & gas industries, paired with advancements like our Dragonfly IntelLigence technology, showcase our resilience and vision. We believe these efforts are building a strong foundation for long-term growth, enabling us to diversify and strengthen partnerships while positioning us for future success.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial and Operating Results**\n\nThird quarter 2024 Net Sales were $12.7 million, compared to $15.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower direct-to-consumers (“DTC”) battery sales offset by higher original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) battery and accessory, sales and licensing revenue. For the third quarter 2024, DTC Net Sales decreased by $5.2 million, compared to $10.3 million in the third quarter of 2023 due to decreased customer demand for Dragonfly Energy’s products due to rising interest rates and inflation. OEM Revenue increased by $1.8 million, compared to $5.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. The Company believes this increase may be attributable to a recovering RV market, the implementation of the Company’s smart battery technology product line, and Dragonfly Energy beginning to penetrate the heavy-duty trucking market.\n\nThird quarter 2024 Gross Profit was $2.9 million, compared to $4.6 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were $(8.9) million, compared to $(10.5) million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced headcount, lower shipping costs, lower legal costs, and lower overall stock-based compensation costs.\n\nTotal Other Expense in the third quarter of 2024 was $(0.8) million, compared to Total Other Expense of $(4.1) million in the third quarter of 2023. Other Expense of $(0.8) million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 is comprised primarily of interest expense of $5.6 million related to our debt securities offset by a positive change in the fair market value of warrant liability in the amount of $4.9 million.\n\nThe Company had a Net Loss of $(6.8) million, or $(0.11) per diluted share in the third quarter of 2024, compared to Net Loss of $(10.0) million or $(0.17) per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023. This result was driven by lower sales partially offset by lower cost of goods sold, and lower operating expenses, and a decrease in other income (due to the change in fair market value of the Company’s warrant liability).\n\nEBITDA in the third quarter of 2024 was $(0.8) million, compared to $(5.7) million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Adjusted EBITDA excluding stock-based compensation, changes in the fair market value of the Company’s warrant liability, and other one-time expenses, was a $(5.5) million, compared to a $(4.6) million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe Company ended the third quarter of 2024 with $8.0 million in cash, up from $4.7 million that was available as of the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company’s $150 million equity line of credit remains effectively unutilized.

Adjusted non-GAAP measures exclude significant unusual items. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures as a supplement to, and not a substitute for financial information prepared on a GAAP basis.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA** Adjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the rules of the SEC because it excludes certain amounts included in net loss calculated in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, the Company calculates Adjusted EBITDA by EBITDA adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense and changes in fair market value of warrant liabilities.\n\nThe Company has included Adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by Dragonfly’s management team to evaluate its operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses. As such, the Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is helpful in highlighting trends in the ongoing core operating results of the business.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of net loss or other results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the Company’s cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments;\n\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company’s working capital needs;\n\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the Company’s tax expense or the cash requirements to pay taxes;\n\n\n  * although amortization and depreciation are non-cash charges, the assets being amortized and depreciated will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;\n\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items for which the Company may adjust in historical periods; and\n\n\n  * other companies in the industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than the Company does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\n\n\n**Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\n**_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA_** The following table presents reconciliations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for each of the periods indicated.\n\n**Dragonfly Energy Holdings Corp.**  \n---  \n**For the Three Months Ended September 30**  \n(in thousands, except share and per share data)  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nNet Loss Before Taxes| $| (6,779| )| $| (10,007| )  \nInterest Expense| 5,615| 3,987  \nDepreciation and Amortization| 327| 316  \nEBITDA| $| (837| )| $| (5,704| )  \n_Adjusted for EBITDA_  \nStock Based Compensation| 256| 946  \nChange in fair market value of warrant liability| (4,875| )| 145  \n**Adjusted EBITDA**|  $| (5,456| )| $| (4,613| )  \n  \nSource: Dragonfly Energy Holdings Corp.\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI3NDE4MCM2NTc5OTYwIzIyNTI3MDY=) ![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/YTc0MDdiODItODQyMC00N2U3LWFkOTMtNGVlZDNiOWQ5NWE3LTEyNjQyNTk=/tiny/Dragonfly-Energy-Holdings-Corp.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/5b65d91c-13e8-489c-ae0c-e86a6e08f658/small/dragonfly-energy-logo-black-png-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/5b65d91c-13e8-489c-ae0c-e86a6e08f658)\n\nSource: Dragonfly Energy Holdings Corp.\n\n[View All News](https://investors.dragonflyenergy.com/news/default.aspx)\n\n### Quick Links\n\n  * [SEC Filings](https://investors.dragonflyenergy.com/regulatory-filings/sec-filings/default.aspx)\n  * [Information Request Form](https://investors.dragonflyenergy.com/resources/information-request-form/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n### IR Contact\n\nCaldwell Bailey, ICR\n\n[775-221-8892](tel:775-221-8892) dragonflyIR@icrinc.com\n\n### Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

NATURE OF BUSINESS\nDragonfly Energy Holdings Corp. (“New Dragonfly” or the “Company”) sells lithium-ion battery packs for use in a wide variety of applications. The Company\nsells to distributors under the Dragonfly Energy brand name, and sells direct to consumers under the trade name Battleborn Batteries. In addition, the Company\ndevelops technology for improved lithium-ion battery manufacturing and assembly methods.\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND GOING CONCERN\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and present the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned\nsubsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.\nBasis of presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim\nfinancial information, and with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) set forth in Article 8 of\nRegulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The unaudited\ninterim financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a\nfair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Unaudited interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year. These\ncondensed consolidated financial statements should be read along with the 10-K filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024 (as amended April 29, 2024, the “Annual\nReport”) of the Company for the annual period ended December 31, 2023. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 was derived from the\naudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year then ended.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and\nthe satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result\nfrom the outcome of this uncertainty.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred losses from operations and had negative cash flow from operations. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company had $8,019 in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of $9,927. The Company’s ability to achieve\nprofitability and positive cash flow depends on its ability to increase revenue, contain its expenses and maintain compliance with the financial covenants in its\noutstanding indebtedness agreements.\nIn connection with the Company’s senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $75,000 (as amended, the “Term Loan”), the Company\nis obligated to comply with certain financial covenants, which include maintaining a maximum senior leverage ratio, minimum liquidity, a springing fixed\ncharge coverage ratio, and maximum capital expenditures (Note 6). On March 31, 2024, April 29, 2024, June 28, 2024, July 31, 2024, August 30, 2024,\nSeptember 30, 2024 and October 31, 2024 the Company obtained waivers from the Term Loan administrative agent and lenders of its failures to satisfy the\nliquidity requirement under the Term Loan for the quarters ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024 and the fiscal month ended April 30,\n2024, July 31, 2024, August 31, 2024, 2024, September 30, 2024, and October 31, 2024 as applicable. If the Company is unable to obtain a waiver or if the\nCompany is unable to comply with such covenants, the lenders have the right to accelerate the maturity of the Term Loan. These conditions raise substantial\ndoubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\n9\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND GOING CONCERN (CONTINUED)\nGoing Concern (Continued)\nIn addition, the Company will need to raise additional debt and/or equity financings to fund its operations, strategic plans, and meet its financial covenants. The\nCompany has historically been able to raise additional capital through issuance of equity and/or debt financings and the Company intends to use its equity\nfacility and raise additional capital as needed. However, the Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to raise additional equity, contain expenses, or\nincrease revenue, and comply with the financial covenants under the Term Loan.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements:\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting\n(Topic 280), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”) which will require companies to disclose significant segment expenses that\nare regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). The pronouncement is effective for annual filings for the year ended December 31,\n2024. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 will necessitate substantial changes to the notes to the financial statements, specifically in the area of segment disclosures.\nFor a company that operates as a single-segment entity and previously did not need to comply with ASC 280 Segment Reporting (“ASC 280”), the changes\ninclude:\n● Single reportable segment entities are required to provide the new disclosures and all disclosures currently required under ASC 280\n● Disclosure of the title and position of the CODM\n● Disclosure of significant segment expenses and “other segment items” for reach reportable segment\n● Disclosure of reportable segment profit or loss and assets in annual and interim periods\n● Disclosure of segment profitability measures used by the CODM provided such measures comply with the use of non-GAAP financial measures\nThe Company is still in the process of assessing the full impact of adopting this standard on the enhanced disclosure requirements in the notes to the\nCompany’s financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09\nrequires enhanced annual disclosures regarding the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2024, and may be adopted on a prospective or retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of\nthis guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all short-term debt securities purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company held no Cash Equivalents.\nFrom time to time the Company has amounts on deposit with financial institutions that exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any\nsignificant losses in such accounts.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company’s trade receivables are recorded when billed and represent claims against third parties that will be settled in cash. Generally, payment is due from\ncustomers within 30-90 days of the invoice date and the contracts do not have significant financing components. Trade accounts receivables are recorded gross\nand are net of any applicable allowance. The allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were not material.\nInventory\nInventories (Note 4), which consist of raw materials and finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out) or net realizable value, net of reserves\nfor obsolete inventory. The Company continually analyzes its slow moving and excess inventories. Based on historical and projected sales volumes and\nanticipated selling prices, the Company established reserves. Inventory that is in excess of current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to a level that\napproximates its estimate of future demand. Products that are determined to be obsolete are written down to net realizable value. The inventory reserve as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was not material.\n10\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues\nand expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company utilizes the use of estimates in its calculations for the\nreserve for obsolete or slow-moving inventory, right of use asset, warrant liability, equity-based compensation, and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition\nUnder Topic 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration\nthat the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are\nwithin the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations\nin the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue\nwhen (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable the entity will collect\nthe consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to the customer or reseller, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company\nexpects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods and services. Revenue associated with products holding rights of return are recognized when the Company\nconcludes there is not a risk of significant revenue reversal in the future periods for the expected consideration in the transaction. There are no material\ninstances including discounts and refunds where variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale. Generally, our revenue is\nrecognized at a point in time for standard promised goods at the time of shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer.\nThe Company may receive payments at the onset of the contract before delivery of goods for customers in the retail channel. Payment terms for distributors\nand OEMs are typically due within 30-90 days after shipment. In such instances, the Company records a customer deposit liability. The Company recognizes\nthese contract liabilities as sales after the revenue criteria are met. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the contract liability related to the\nCompany’s customer deposits were approximately $189 and $201, respectively.\nThe Company recognized $201 of the contract liability as of December 31, 2023 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company recognized\n$230 of the contract liability as of December 31, 2022 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nOn July 29, 2024, Dragonfly Energy Corp. (“Legacy Dragonfly”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Battle Born Battery Products, LLC (“Battle\nBorn LLC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Legacy Dragonfly, entered into a License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Stryten Energy LLC\n(“Stryten”) (Note 8). The $5,000 initial licensing fee is being recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over five years. For the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, the Company has recorded $167 in revenue related to the License Agreement. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nthe contract liability related to the Company’s deferred revenue were approximately $4,833 and $0, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had\n$1,000 in short term deferred revenue and $3,833 in long-term deferred revenue related to the License Agreement.\n11\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table present our disaggregated revenues by distribution channel:\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\nSales 2024 2023 2024 2023\nDirect to customer 5,153 10,305 16,890 30,314\nOriginal equipment manufacture 7,400 5,584 21,376 23,640\nLicense fee revenue 167 - 167 -\nTotal $ 12,720 $ 15,889 $ 38,433 $ 53,954\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company deemed it more appropriate to classify Retail and Distributor revenues as a single line item referred to\nas direct-to-consumer revenue. The Company has combined previously reported retail and distributor amounts to direct-to-consumer revenue to conform with\ncurrent year presentation. The consolidation into direct-to-consumer revenue is motivated by the Company’s strategic perspective on its operations and better\nrepresents how it evaluates their sales channels.\nProduct Warranty\nThe Company offers assurance type warranties from 5 to 10 years on its products. The Company estimates the costs associated with the warranty obligation\nusing historical data of warranty claims and costs incurred to satisfy those claims. The Company estimates, based upon a review of historical warranty claim\nexperience, the costs that may be incurred under its warranties and record a liability in the amount of such estimate at the time a product is sold. Factors that\naffect our warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. The Company periodically\nassesses the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability and adjust the accrual as claims data and historical experience warrants. The Company has assessed the\ncosts of fulfilling its existing assurance type warranties and has determined that the estimated outstanding warranty obligation at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 to be $482 and $307, respectively.\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nBeginning warranty obligation 307 328\nProvision of warranty expense 433 397\nSettlement of warranty claims (258) (418)\nEnding warrant obligation $ 482 $ 307\nConcentrations\nAs of September 30, 2024, receivables from Customer A, Customer B, and Customer C comprised approximately 19%, 12% and 10%, respectively, of\naccounts receivable. As of December 31, 2023, receivables from Customer D and E comprised approximately 28% and 10%, respectively, of accounts\nreceivable.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales from Customer A comprised approximately 15% of the Company’s total revenue. For the nine months\nended September 30, 2023, sales from Customer B accounted for approximately 19% of the Company’s total revenue. For the three months ended September\n30, 2024, sales from Customer A comprised approximately 16% of the Company’s total revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, sales from\nCustomer C accounted for approximately 11% of the Company’s total revenue.\n12\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nConcentrations (Continued)\nAs of September 30, 2024, payables to Vendor A and Vendor B comprised approximately 36% and 18%, respectively, of accounts payables. As of December\n31, 2023, payables to Vendor A comprised approximately 65% of accounts payables.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Vendor A accounted for approximately 11% of the Company’s total purchases. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, Vendor B accounted for approximately 16% of the Company’s total purchases. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Vendor A\nand Vendor C accounted for approximately 16% and 13%, respectively, of the Company’s total purchases. For the three months ended September 30, 2023,\nVendor C, D and E accounted for approximately 14%, 11%, and 10%, respectively, of the Company’s total purchases.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation arrangements with employees and non-employee consultants using a fair value method which requires\nthe recognition of compensation expense for costs related to all stock-based payments, including stock options (Note 12). The fair value method requires the\nCompany to estimate the fair value of stock-based payment awards to employees and non-employees on the date of grant using an option pricing model. Stock\nbased compensation costs are based on the fair value of the underlying option calculated using the Black Scholes option pricing model and recognized as\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. Restricted stock unit awards (“RSUs”) are valued based on the\nclosing trading value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the\naward. The Company measures equity-based compensation awards granted to non-employees at fair value as the awards vest and recognizes the resulting value\nas compensation expense at each financial reporting period.\nDetermining the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, expected dividend yield,\nexpected term, risk free rate of return, and the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock. Due to the lack of company specific historical and implied\nvolatility data, the Company has based its estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded.\nThe historical volatility is calculated based on a period of time commensurate with the expected term assumption. The group of representative companies have\ncharacteristics similar to the Company, including stage of product development and focus on the lithium-ion battery industry. The Company uses the simplified\nmethod, which is the average of the final vesting tranche date and the contractual term, to calculate the expected term for options granted to employees as it\ndoes not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. The risk-free interest rate is based on a\ntreasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options. The Company uses an assumed dividend yield of zero as the\nCompany has never paid dividends and has no current plans to pay any dividends on its common stock. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of net operating loss, credit carryforwards and temporary\ndifferences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts measured at the current enacted tax rates.\nThe Company recognizes a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by\ntaxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company had a liability of $91 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, of\nuncertain tax positions.\nThe Company’s accounting policy is to include penalties and interest related to income taxes if any, in selling, general and administrative expenses. The\nCompany regularly assesses the need to record a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than\nnot that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n13\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nNet Loss per Common Share\nBasic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss\nper share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period and, if dilutive, the weighted-average number of\npotential shares of common stock.\nThe weighted-average number of common shares included in the computation of diluted net loss gives effect to all potentially dilutive common equivalent\nshares, including outstanding stock options and warrants.\nCommon stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share if their effect is antidilutive. In periods in which the Company\nreports a net loss, diluted net loss per share is generally the same as basic net loss per share since dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued\nif their effect is anti-dilutive.\nThe following table sets forth the number of potential shares of common stock that have been excluded from diluted net loss per share because their effect was\nanti-dilutive:\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nWarrants 32,181,100 23,219,622\nRestricted stock units 109,375 217,000\nOptions 1,748,687 3,274,940\nWeighted average number of common shares-basic 34,039,162 26,711,562\nLeases\nAt the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances\npresent in the arrangement including the use of an identified asset(s) and the Company’s control over the use of that identified asset. The Company elected, as\nallowed under FASB ASU 2016-02, Leases (“ASC 842”), to not recognize leases with a lease term of one year or less on its balance sheet. Leases with a term\ngreater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and current and non-current lease liabilities, as applicable.\nSegment Reporting\nOperating segments are identified as components of an enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the\nCompany’s Chief Executive Officer to make decisions with respect to resource allocation and assessment of performance. To date, the Company has viewed its\noperations and manages its business as one operating segment.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the condensed consolidated financial statements and these\naccompanying notes. The reclassifications did not have a material impact on the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related\ndisclosures. The impact on any prior period disclosures was immaterial.\n14\nNOTE 3 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”), establishes a fair value hierarchy for instruments measured at fair value that distinguishes\nbetween assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and the Company’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). Observable inputs are inputs that\nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs\nare inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based\non the best information available in the circumstances.\nASC 820 identifies fair value as the exchange price, or exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in\nan orderly transaction between market participants. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC 820 establishes\na three-tier fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between the following:\n● Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n● Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for a similar asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n● Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset\nor liability.\nFinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. To the extent\nthat the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.\nAccordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. A financial\ninstrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n15\nNOTE 3 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (CONTINUED)\nThe following table presents assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets on a recurring basis as of\nSeptember 30, 2024:\nCarrying\nAmount Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAs of September 30, 2024\nLiabilities\nWarrant liability- Term Loan $ 5,017 $ 5,017 $ - $ - $ 5,017\nWarrant liability- June Public Offering 2,686 2,686 - - 2,686\nWarrant liability- Private Placement Warrants 11 11 - 11 -\nTotal liabilities $ 7,714 $ 7,714 $ - $ 11 $ 7,703\nThe following table presents assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets on a recurring basis as of\nDecember 31, 2023:\nCarrying\nAmount Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAs of December 31, 2023\nLiabilities\nWarrant liability- Term Loan $ 1,014 $ 1,014 $ - $ - $ 1,014\nWarrant liability- June Public Offering 3,434 3,434 - - 3,434\nWarrant liability- Private placement warrants 15 15 - 15 -\nTotal liabilities $ 4,463 $ 4,463 $ - $ 15 $ 4,448\nThe carrying amounts of accounts receivable and accounts payable are considered level 1 and approximate fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023 because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments.\nThe carrying value of the Term Loan as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 approximates fair value as the interest rate does not differ significantly\nfrom the current market rates available to the Company for similar debt and is considered level 2.\n16\nNOTE 3 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (CONTINUED)\nLevel 3 Roll forward\nFair value measurements categorized within Level 3 are sensitive to changes in assumptions or methodology used to determine fair value, and such changes\ncould result in a significant increase or decrease in the fair value.\nThe changes for Level 3 items measured at fair value on recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs are as follows:\nWarrant Liability – Warrant liability-\nTerm Loan June Public Offering\nFair value as of January 1, 2024 $ 1,014 $ 3,434\nChange in fair value, gain included in net loss(1) (4) (220)\nFair value as of March 31, 2024 1,010 3,214\nWarrants Issued 4,796 -\nChange in fair value, (gain) loss included in net loss(1) (304) 2,277\nFair value as of June 30, 2024 5,502 5,491\nWarrants Issued 1,585 -\nChange in fair value, (gain) loss included in net loss(1) (2,070) (2,805)\nFair value as of September 30, 2024 $ 5,017 $ 2,686\nWarrant Liability – Warrant liability-\nTerm Loan June Public Offering\nFair value as of January 1, 2023 $ 30,841 $ -\nWarrant exercises (8,822) -\nChange in fair value, gain included in net loss(1) (17,998) -\nFair value as of March 31, 2023 4,021 -\nWarrants Issued - 13,762\nWarrant exercises (2,462) -\nChange in fair value, gain included in net loss(1) (684) (150)\nFair value as of June 30, 2023 875 13,612\nChange in fair value, loss included in net loss(1) 36 154\nWarrant exercises - (617)\nFair value as of September 30, 2023 $ 911 $ 13,149\n(1)Changes in fair value of warrant liabilities are disclosed separately in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n17\nNOTE 4 - INVENTORY\nInventory consists of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nRaw material $ 20,692 $ 31,604\nFinished goods 3,321 7,174\nTotal inventory $ 24,013 $ 38,778\nNOTE 5 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLitigation\nFrom time to time the Company may be named in claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Currently, no legal proceedings, governmental actions,\nadministrative actions, investigations or claims are pending against the Company or involve the Company that, in the opinion of the Company’s management,\ncould reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial condition.\nOperating Leases\nThe Company has leases related to the main office, warehouse space, research and development lab, engineering office, and sales office, all located in Reno,\nNevada. The leases require annual escalating monthly payments ranging from $111 to $309. On February 2, 2022, the Company entered into a 124-month lease\nagreement in Reno, Nevada. The lease calls for monthly base rent of $230, $23 of fixed operating expense costs, and estimated monthly property taxes of $21.\nThe monthly base rent and fixed operating expense costs are subject to escalation of 3% and 2.4%, respectively, on an annual basis. A certificate of substantial\ncompletion has been issued and the lease commencement date was March 25, 2024. The Company began paying monthly rent under the lease on July 24, 2024.\nOn April 12, 2024 the Company entered into a lease agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to lease an approximately 64,000 square foot facility\n(the “Premises”) located in Fernley, Nevada, to be used for general, warehousing, assembly/light manufacturing, painting of products, storage fulfillment,\ndistribution of the Company’s products, and other uses as permitted under the Fernley Lease Agreement (the “Fernley Lease Agreement”). The effective date of\nthe lease is April 1, 2024 (the “Lease Commencement Date”). However, the initial term of the Fernley Lease Agreement (the “Term”) is for a period of sixty\n(60) months, effective June 1, 2024 (the “Rent Commencement Date”).

For the quarters ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, we sold 10,283 and 14,886 batteries,\nrespectively, and had $12.7 million and $15.9 million in net sales, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we\nsold 32,907 and 56,183 batteries, respectively, and had $38.4 million and $54.0 million in net sales, respectively. We currently offer a line of batteries across\nour “Battle Born” and “Dragonfly” brands, each differentiated by size, power and capacity, consisting of seven different models, four of which come with a\nheated option. We primarily sell “Battle Born” branded batteries directly to consumers (“DTC”) and “Dragonfly” branded batteries to original equipment\nmanufacturers (“OEMs”).\nOur decrease in sales is a reflection of weaker demand from both OEM and DTC customers in our core RV and marine markets due to rising interest rates and\ninflation. Our RV OEM customers currently include Keystone, THOR, Airstream, and REV, and we are in ongoing discussions with a number of additional RV\nOEMs to further increase adoption of our products. Related efforts include seeking to have RV OEMs “design in” our batteries as original equipment and\nentering into arrangements with members of the various OEM dealer networks to stock.\nWe currently source the lithium iron phosphate (“LFP”) cells incorporated into our batteries from a limited number of carefully selected suppliers that can meet\nour demanding quality standards and with whom we have developed long-term relationships.\nIn May 2024, we announced that we achieved full certification for our energy storage products to be deployed for use in oil & gas operations in North America.\nAs a result of this certification, we are working Connexa Energy Company (“Connexa”) to deliver a power product to Alegacy Equipment, LLC (“Alegacy\nEquipment”), a market leading natural gas compressor package company, and its affiliate Agnes Systems. The power systems, which Connexa expects to\nintegrate, are expected to be used in natural gas compression equipment to reduce methane emissions in gas pipelines. We expect the first of these systems to\nbe deployed in the fourth quarter of 2024 and this business line to begin contributing to net sales during the fourth quarter of 2024.\nTo supplement our battery offerings, we are also a reseller of accessories for battery systems. These include chargers, inverters, monitors, controllers and other\nsystem accessories from brands such as Victron Energy, Progressive Dynamics, Magnum Energy and Sterling Power. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase\nAgreement dated April 22, 2022 by and among us and Thomason Jones Company, LLC (“Thomason Jones”) and the other parties thereto, we also acquired\nthe assets, including the Wakespeed Offshore brand (“Wakespeed”) of Thomason Jones, allowing us to include our own alternator regulator in systems that we\nsell.\nIn addition, we have successfully developed innovative manufacturing processes for dry-electrode manufacturing of lithium-ion cells, and continue\ndevelopment efforts relating to next-generation solid-state technology. Since our inception, we have built a comprehensive patent portfolio around our\nproprietary dry-electrode battery manufacturing process, which eliminates the use of harmful solvents and energy-intensive drying ovens compared to\ntraditional methods. This translates to significant environmental and cost benefits, including reduced energy consumption, smaller space requirements, and a\nlower carbon footprint.\nMoreover, our solid-state technology in development removes the need for a liquid electrolyte, thereby addressing safety concerns related to flammability. Our\nunique competitive edge lies in the combination of solid-state technology with its scalable dry-electrode manufacturing process. This enables the rapid\nproduction of cells having an intercalation anode (like graphite or silicon), unlike many competitors reliant on less stable lithium metal anodes. We believe this\ndesign offers superior cyclability and safety, serving as a key differentiator in the energy storage market. Furthermore, internal production of both conventional\nand solid-state cells streamlines our supply chain and enables vertical integration, ultimately driving down production costs. In October 2023, we announced\nthe successful dry deposition of anode and cathode electrodes at scale using our patented battery manufacturing process. We are currently producing sample\ncells for prospective customers across a variety of chemistries and end-markets and expect to begin scaling production during 2025. In addition, we are\ncurrently exploring opportunities within North America as part of our efforts to build a cell manufacturing facility.\n39\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash totaling $8.0 million. Our net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $6.8 million and our net loss for the\nquarter ended September 30, 2023 was $10.0 million. As a result of becoming a publicly traded company, we continue to need to hire additional personnel and\nimplement procedures and processes to address public company regulatory requirements and customary practices. We have incurred and expect to continue to\nincur additional expenses as a public company for, among other things, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, director fees and additional internal and\nexternal accounting and legal and administrative resources, including increased audit and legal fees. As discussed under “Liquidity and Capital Resources”\nbelow, we expect that we will need to raise additional funds, including through the use of our $150 million equity facility (the “ChEF Equity Facility”) with\nChardan Capital Markets LLC (“CCM LLC”) and the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or by obtaining additional credit from financial\ninstitutions to fund, together with our principal sources of liquidity, ongoing costs, such as research and development relating to our solid-state batteries,\nexpansion of our facilities, and new strategic investments. If such financings are not available, or if the terms of such financings are less desirable than we\nexpect, we may be forced to take actions to reduce our capital or operating expenditures, including not seeking potential acquisition opportunities, eliminating\nredundancies, or reducing or delaying our production facility expansions, which may adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and\nprospects.\nLicense Agreement with Stryten\nOn July 29, 2024, Legacy Dragonfly and Battle Born Battery Products, LLC (“Battle Born LLC”), a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of Legacy\nDragonfly, entered into a License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Stryten. Pursuant to the License Agreement, Battle Born LLC granted Stryten an\nexclusive, worldwide license to use certain trademarks relating to Legacy Dragonfly’s lithium-ion battery brand, Battle Born Batteries® (the “Licensed\nTrademarks”) for business-to-business sales of batteries to customers within the following markets: (i) automative, (ii) marine, (iii) powersports, (iv) lawn and\ngarden, (v) golf cart, and (vi) military and defense (such industries, the “Stryten Market”). In exchange for the licensing rights, Stryten agreed to pay Battle\nBorn LLC an initial licensing fee of five million dollars ($5,000,000) (the “Initial Licensing Fee”). The License Agreement provides for mid-single digit\nroyalty payments based on net sales using the Licensed Trademarks, with a tiered structure reaching up to twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000), at which\npoint Stryten will be required to pay a nominal annual license fee. Additional fees will apply for battery design and contract manufacturing services outside of\nthe License Agreement.\nThe License Agreement is perpetual in term, unless terminated by: (i) Battle Born LLC if Stryten fails to pay the royalty payments required by the License\nAgreement and such royalty payments remain unpaid thirty (30) days after notice of such overdue payments (provided that Battle Born LLC uses reasonable\nefforts to discuss such overdue payments with Stryten), or (ii) either party (x) if the other party materially breaches the License Agreement and fails to cure\nsuch material breach within thirty (30) days of notice of such breach, (y) upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy-related events, or (z) under certain\ncircumstances, if the aggregate royalty payments received by Battle Born LLC under the License Agreement are less than fifteen million dollars ($15,000,000)\nafter five (5) years.\nChEF Equity Facility\nOn October 7, 2022, we entered into a purchase agreement with CCM LLC in connection with the ChEF Equity Facility, which was subsequently amended on\nMay 20, 2024 (as amended, the “Purchase Agreement”). We intend to opportunistically use the ChEF Equity Facility to help maintain minimum cash balances\nrequired by the lenders as we continue to execute on growing the business through product releases, customer/market expansion, and R&D milestones. We\nexpect to use the ChEF Equity Facility as a regular source of funds over the next twelve months and our available share balance increases, allowing for more\nconsistent purchases under the ChEF Equity Facility. Use of the ChEF Equity Facility may adversely affect us, including the market price of our common stock\nand future issuances may be dilutive to existing stockholders.\nJune 2023 Offering\nOn June 20, 2023, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Roth Capital Partners, LLC, as representative of the\nseveral underwriters (the “Underwriters”), pursuant to which we sold to the Underwriters, in a firm commitment underwritten public offering (the “June 2023\nOffering”), an aggregate of (i) 10,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001, and (ii) accompanying warrants to purchase up to 10,000,000\nshares of common stock (the “Investor Warrants”), at the combined public offering price of $2.00 per share and accompanying Investor Warrant, less\nunderwriting discounts and commissions, and (iii) warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 570,250 shares of common stock (the “Underwriters’\nWarrants”). In addition, we granted the Underwriters a 45-day over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 1,500,000 shares of common stock and/or\nInvestor Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of common stock at the public offering price per security, less underwriting discounts and\ncommissions.\nThe Investor Warrants are exercisable for five years from the closing date of the Offering, have an exercise price of $2.00 per share and are immediately\nexercisable. In the event of certain fundamental transactions, holders of the Investor Warrants will have the right to receive the Black Scholes Value (as defined\nin the Investor Warrants) of their Investor Warrants calculated pursuant to the formula set forth in the Investor Warrants, payable either in cash or in the same\ntype or form of consideration that is being offered and being paid to the holders of common stock. The Underwriters’ Warrants are exercisable upon issuance\nand will expire on June 20, 2028. The initial exercise price of the Underwriters’ Warrants is $2.50 per share, which equals 125% of the per share public offering\nprice in the Offering.\nAs part of the June 2023 Offering, the Underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment option in the amount of 1,405,000 shares of common stock and\nInvestor Warrants to purchase 1,405,000 shares of common stock. The June 2023 Offering closed on June 22, 2023. The aggregate net proceeds from this\noffering, including the partial over-allotment option, was approximately $20.7 million.\n40\nDecember 2023 Private Placement\nOn December 29, 2023, we received a waiver (the “December 2023 Waiver”) from the Term Loan Lenders (as defined below) in regards to our compliance\nwith the fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum senior leverage ratio with respect to the minimum cash requirements (the “Tests”) under the Term Loan (as\ndefined below) as of the last day of the quarter ended December 31, 2023.

Our batteries have now received approval for installation at Daimler Truck CTS,\nRush Enterprises CVS, and Fontaine Modification, all of which are PDI or modification and upfit centers. This development ensures the ready availability of\nbatteries for shipment on new trucks and allows for their inclusion in the tractor’s purchase price.\nOn June 18, 2024, we announced we entered into a partnership with Meyer Distributing, Inc. (“Meyer Distributing”), a leading distributor of specialty\nproducts across North America. We expect to leverage Meyer Distributing’s distribution network to deliver Battle Born Batteries to new business-to-business\ncustomers in the RV and surrounding industries.\nTrucking Market Milestones\nOn August 12, 2024, we announced that we would be partnering with Highway Transport, a leader in North American liquid chemical transportation, to\ntransition Highway Transport’s entire fleet of over 500 trucks to our Battle Born all-electric APUs. As part of the partnership, Highway Transport is expected to\ninstall the Battle Born all-electric APUs on new tractors in addition to retrofitting current models in Highway Transport’s fleet. This partnership with Highway\nTransport marks a major step forward for our reach in the commercial trucking sector. We believe the planned integration of the Battle Born all-electric APU\ninto Highway Transport’s fleet paves the way for wider adoption of our clean energy solutions, accelerating the transition towards a more sustainable\ntransportation landscape.\nOn July 1, 2024, we announced that we are now a provider of lithium based liftgate power solutions for Refreshment Services Pepsi, a privately-held\nindependent bottler and distributor for Pepsi-Cola® products. With distribution centers across the U.S., Refreshment Services Pepsi will begin integrating our\nBattle Born Batteries products into their fleet to power liftgate operations. The expansion of our lithium-based power solutions to liftgate applications broadens\nsales opportunities within the trucking market.\nRecent Developments\nIn October 2024, we completed a demonstration of our first off-grid methane reclamation payer system in collaboration with Alegacy Equipment and Anges\nSystems for the oil and gas industry.\nOn October 14, 2024, we introduced Dragonfly IntelLigence® to the heavy-duty trucking market. This patent-pending smart battery technology provides fleets\nand truck drivers access to real-time system monitoring and app-based connectivity. We believe Dragonfly IntelLigence provides additional value to our Battle\nBorn all-electric APUs by delivering enhanced visibility over our battery system.\nOn November 13, 2024, we announced we had entered into a partnership with Keystone Automotive Operations, Inc. (“Keystone Automotive”), a leading\ndistributor and marketer of specialty automotive equipment and accessories in North America, for the distribution of Battle Born Batteries products. This\npartnership is expected to increase the availability of Battle Born Batteries products by leveraging Keystone Automotive’s extensive distribution network.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Operating Results\nOur financial position and results of operations depend to a significant extent on the following factors:\nEnd Market Consumers\nThe demand for our products ultimately depends on demand from consumers in our current end markets. We generate sales through (1) DTC and (2) through\nOEMs, particularly in the RV market.\nAn increasing proportion of our sales has been and is expected to continue to be derived from sales to RV OEMs, driven by continued efforts to develop and\nexpand sales to RV OEMs with whom we have longstanding relationships. Our RV OEM sales have been on a purchase order basis, without firm revenue\ncommitments, and we expect that this will likely continue to be the case. Therefore, future RV OEM sales will be subject to risks and uncertainties, including\nthe number of RVs these OEMs manufacture and sell, which in turn may be driven by the expectations these OEMs have around end market consumer demand.\nDemand from end market consumers is impacted by a number of factors, including fuel costs and energy demands (including an increasing trend towards the\nuse of green energy), as well as overall macro-economic conditions, such as interest rates and inflation. Sales of our batteries have benefited from the increased\nadoption of the RV lifestyle, the demand for and inclusion of additional appliances and electronics in RVs, and the accelerating trend of solar power adoption\namong RV customers. However, rising fuel costs and other macro-economic conditions have caused a downward shift in decisions taken by end market\nconsumers around spending in the RV market and in July 2023, we were notified by our largest RV OEM customer that, due to weaker demand for its products\nand their subsequent focus on reducing costs, it would no longer install our storage solutions as standard equipment, but rather return to offering those solutions\nas an option to dealers and consumers. While this customer is not moving to a different solution or competitor, as a result in this change in strategy there was a\nmaterial limiting effect on our revenue in 2023. Based on our ongoing discussions with customers and current forecast projections, we remain cautiously\noptimistic about increased revenue potential in the RV market. While the DTC segment shows continued uncertainty amid broader market conditions, we have\nnoted progress in the OEM market, where daily revenue rates have been increasing in the third quarter of 2024. However, seasonality factors associated with\nthe holiday period in the fourth quarter of 2024 may limit gross revenue, even as OEM demand trends positively.\nWhile a significant portion of our sales come from the RV market, we also offer targeted solutions using the same products for the marine market. These\nsolutions cater to OEMs and consumers alike, addressing the power needs of various vessels like sailboats, powerboats, and fishing boats (center console and\nbass). We have worked closely to follow ABYC (American Boat & Yacht Council) Standards to develop systems that adhere to the recent ABYC E-13\nGuidelines (Standards for Lithium Batteries). We have also begun generating sales in the trucking market in the third quarter of 2024.\n42\nOur strategy includes plans to expand into other end markets that we have identified as opportunities for our LFP batteries, including medium and heavy-duty\ntrucking, specialty and work vehicles, solar integration, oil and gas, industrial, rail, material handling, and emergency and standby power in the medium term,\nand data centers, telecom and distributed on-grid storage in the longer term. We believe that our current LFP batteries and, eventually, our solid-state batteries,\nwill be well-suited to supplant traditional lead-acid batteries as a reliable power source for the variety of low power density uses required in these markets\n(such as powering the increasing number of on-board tools needed in emergency vehicles). The success of this strategy requires (1) continued growth of these\naddressable markets in line with our expectations and (2) our ability to successfully enter these markets. We expect to incur significant marketing costs\nunderstanding these new markets, and researching and targeting customers in these end markets, which may not result in sales. If we fail to execute on this\ngrowth strategy in accordance with our expectations, our sales growth would be limited to the growth of existing products and existing end markets.\nSupply\nWe currently rely on two carefully selected cell manufacturers located in China, and a single supplier, also located in China, to manufacture our proprietary\nbattery management system, and we intend to continue to rely on these suppliers going forward. Our close working relationships with our China-based LFP cell\nsuppliers, reflected in our ability to increase our purchase order volumes (qualifying us for related volume-based discounts) and order and receive delivery of\ncells in anticipation of required demand, has helped us moderate increased supply-related costs associated with inflation, currency fluctuations and U.S.\ngovernment tariffs imposed on our imported battery cells and to avoid potential shipment delays. To mitigate against potential adverse production events, we\nopted to build our inventory of key components, such as battery cells. However, as many of the supply chain challenges and delays that were prevalent over the\nlast several years have eased, we are now actively working down our inventory to more appropriate safety stock levels.\nAs a result of our battery chemistry and active steps we have taken to manage our inventory levels, we have not been subject to the shortages or price impacts\nthat have been present for manufacturers of nickel manganese cobalt and nickel cobalt aluminum batteries. As we look toward the production of our solid-state\ncells, we have signed a Commercial Offtake Agreement with a lithium mining company located in Nevada for the supply of lithium, which we expect will\nenable us to further manage our cost of goods over time.\nProduct and Customer Mix\nOur product sales consist of sales of seven different models of LFP batteries, along with accessories for battery systems (individually or bundled). These\nproducts are sold to different customer types (e.g., consumers, OEMs and distributors) and at different prices and involve varying levels of costs. In any\nparticular period, changes in the mix and volume of particular products sold and the prices of those products relative to other products will impact our average\nselling price and our cost of goods sold. Despite our work to moderate increased supply-related costs, the price of our products may also increase as a result of\nincreases in the cost of components due to inflation, currency fluctuations and tariffs. OEM sales typically result in lower average selling prices and related\nmargins, which could result in margin erosion, negatively impact our growth or require us to raise our prices. However, this reduction is typically offset by the\nbenefits of increased sales volumes. Sales of third-party sourced accessories typically have lower related margin. We expect accessory sales to increase as we\nfurther develop full-system design expertise and product offerings and consumers increasingly demand more sophisticated systems, rather than simple drop-in\nreplacements. In addition to the impacts attributable to the general sales mix across our products and accessories, our results of operations are impacted by the\nrelative margins of products sold. As we continue to introduce new products at varying price points, our overall gross margin may vary from period to period as\na result of changes in product and customer mix.\n43\nProduction Capacity\nAll of our battery assembly currently takes place at our 99,000 square foot headquarters and manufacturing facility located in Reno, Nevada. We currently\noperate three LFP battery production lines. Consistent with our operating history, we plan to continue to automate additional aspects of our battery production\nlines. Our existing facility has the capacity to add up to four additional LFP battery production lines and construct and operate a pilot production line for\ndomestic cell manufacturing, all designed to maximize the capacity of our manufacturing facility. Although our automation efforts are expected to reduce our\ncosts of goods, we may not fully recognize the anticipated savings when planned and could experience additional costs or disruptions to our production\nactivities.\nIn addition, we entered into a lease on February 8, 2022 for an additional 390,240 square foot warehouse in Reno, Nevada (the “Reno Warehouse”). The\ncommencement date for the lease for the Reno Warehouse was March 25, 2024, based on the construction project being identified as “substantially complete”.\nThe Reno Warehouse will enable us to consolidate various operations in Reno, NV and will allow for expected expansion for new markets. We expect to begin\noperations in the Reno Warehouse in the fourth quarter of 2024 with the consolidation of operations expected to occur in the second quarter of 2025.\nOn April 12, 2024, we entered into a lease agreement (the “Fernley Lease Agreement”) pursuant to which we agreed to lease an approximately 64,000 square\nfoot facility (the “Premises”) in Fernley, Nevada, to be used for general, warehousing, assembly/light manufacturing, painting of products, storage fulfillment,\ndistribution of our products, and other uses as permitted under in the Fernley Lease Agreement.\nCompetition\nWe compete with traditional lead-acid battery manufacturers and lithium-ion battery manufacturers, who primarily either import their products or components\nor manufacture products under a private label. As we continue to expand into new markets, develop new products and move towards production of our solid-\nstate cells, we will experience competition with a wider range of companies. These competitors may have greater resources than we do, and may be able to\ndevote greater resources to the development of their current and future technologies. Our competitors may be able to source materials and components at lower\ncosts, which may require us to evaluate measures to reduce our own costs, lower the price of our products or increase sales volumes in order to maintain our\nexpected levels of profitability.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development is primarily focused on the advanced manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries using a dry-electrode process. We are focused on\nscaling the process to allow for the low-cost domestic manufacturing of cells. We are also applying the dry-electrode process to the production of solid-state\nlithium-ion batteries having an LFP catholyte, a solid electrolyte and an intercalation-based anolyte (intercalation being the reversible inclusion of a molecule\nor ion into layered solids). The next stage in our technical development is to construct the battery to optimize performance and longevity to meet and exceed\nindustry standards for our target storage markets. Ongoing testing and optimizing of more complicated batteries incorporating layered pouch cells will assist us\nin determining the optimal cell chemistry to enhance conductivity and increase the number of cycles (charge and discharge) in the cell lifecycle. This is\nexpected to require significant additional expense, and we may need to raise additional funds to continue these research and development efforts.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nNet Sales\nNet sales are primarily generated from the sale of our LFP batteries to OEMs and consumers, as well as chargers and other accessories, either individually or\nbundled.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold includes the cost of cells and other components of our LFP batteries, labor and overhead, logistics and freight costs, and depreciation of\nmanufacturing equipment.\nGross Profit\nGross profit, calculated as net sales less cost of goods sold, may vary between periods and is primarily affected by various factors including average selling\nprices, product costs, product mix and customer mix.\n44\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and development\nResearch and development costs include personnel-related expenses for scientists, experienced engineers and technicians as well as the material and supplies to\nsupport the development of new products and our solid-state technology. As we work towards completing the development of our solid-state lithium-ion cells\nand the manufacturing of batteries that incorporate this technology, we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase significantly for the\nforeseeable future as we continue to invest in product development and optimizing and producing solid-state cells.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative costs include personnel-related expenses attributable to our executive, finance, human resources, and information technology\norganizations, certain facility costs, and fees for professional services.\nSelling and marketing\nSelling and marketing costs include outbound freight, personnel-related expenses, as well as trade show, industry event, marketing, customer support, and other\nindirect costs. We expect to continue to make the necessary sales and marketing investments to enable the execution of our strategy, which includes expanding\ninto additional end markets.\nTotal Other Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of interest expense, the change in fair value of the warrant liability and amortization of debt issuance costs.\nResults of Operations\nComparisons for the Three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. This data should be read\ntogether with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such\nfinancial statements and related notes.\nThree months ended September 30,\n2024 % Net Sales 2023 % Net Sales\n(in thousands)\nNet Sales $ 12,720 100.0 $ 15,889 100.0\nCost of Goods Sold 9,850 77.4 11,291 71.1\nGross profit 2,870 22.6 4,598 28.9\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development 1,631 12.8 1,385 8.7\nGeneral and administrative 4,361 34.3 6,005 37.8\nSales and marketing 2,904 22.8 3,083 19.4\nTotal Operating expenses 8,896 69.9 10,473 65.9\nLoss From Operations (6,026) (47.4) (5,875) (37.0)\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest expense, net (5,615) (44.1) (3,987) (25.1)\nOther expense (13) (0.1) - 0.0\nChange in fair market value of warrant liability 4,875 38.3 (145) (0.9)\nTotal Other Expense (753) (5.9) (4,132) (26.0)\nLoss Before Taxes (6,779) (53.3) (10,007) (63.0)\nIncome Tax Benefit - - - -\nNet Loss $ (6,779) (53.3) $ (10,007) (63.0)\nThree months ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nDTC 5,153 10,305\n% Net Sales 40.5 64.9\nOEM 7,400 5,584\n% Net Sales 58.2 35.1\nLicensing Revenue 167 -\n% Net Sales 1.3 0.0\nNet Sales $ 12,720 15,889\n45\nNet Sales\nNet sales decreased by $3.2 million, or 19.9%, to $12.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $15.9 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower DTC battery sales offset by higher OEM battery, accessory sales and licensing\nrevenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, DTC revenue decreased by $5.1 million to $5.2 million, compared to $10.3 million in the third\nquarter of 2023 due to decreased customer demand for our products, rising interest rates, and inflation. OEM revenue increased by $1.8 million to $7.4 million,\ncompared to $5.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. We believe this increase may be attributable to a recovering RV market, the implementation of our smart\nbattery technology product line, and us beginning to penetrate the heavy-duty trucking market. Licensing revenue was recognized in August and September in\nthe amount of $0.2 million. We expect our deployment of products for use in oil and gas operations in North America to begin contributing to net sales during\nthe fourth quarter of 2024.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of revenue decreased by $1.4 million, or 12.8%, to $9.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $11.3 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower unit volume. We expect our Cost of Goods Sold to increase in conjunction\nwith the anticipated increase in revenue over the next twelve months.\nGross Profit\nGross profit decreased by $1.7 million, or 37.6%, to $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $4.6 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a lower unit volume of sales. Gross margin decreased by 6.4% from\n28.9% to 22.5%, which is a result of higher lower margin OEM sales and lower higher margin DTC sales.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by $0.2 million, or 17.8%, to $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $1.4\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher wage expense in the amount of $0.2 million and $0.2 million\nfor increased lease expense for new lease offset by lower patent expense in the amount of $0.1 million and lower materials and supplies. While we expect to\ncontinue to grow the Research and Development headcount, we expect to do so at a slower rate than in prior years.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $1.6 million, or 27.4%, to $4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $6.0\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to employee-related costs in the amount of $1.3 million. Impacting\nthis is a higher stock-based compensation in the amount of $0.7 million both in the prior year along with lower employee-related costs in the amount of $0.6\nmillion due to decreased headcount. Professional services, legal, insurance expenses and travel are lower by $1.1 million. Offsetting these lower costs is an\nincrease in computer expense related to the Reno Warehouse in the amount of $0.1 million and rent expense in the amount of $0.7 million for the Reno\nWarehouse, which was mostly allocated to general and administrative expenses since we have not occupied the building as of September 30, 2024. We expect\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses, as a percentage of revenue, to decline over the next twelve months.\n46\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses decreased by $0.2 million, or 5.8%, to $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $3.1 million\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is mostly related to lower shipping costs of $0.2 million, which was related to a reduction in\nunits sold. We expect our Selling and Marketing Expenses to be relatively stable over the next twelve months.\nTotal Other (Expense) Income\nOther expense totaled $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to total other expense of $4.1 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2023. Other expense of $0.8 million in three months ended September 30, 2024 was comprised primarily of interest expense of $5.6\nmillion related to our debt securities and a positive change in fair market value of warrant liability in the amount of $4.9 million. The $4.1 million of other\nexpense in three months ended September 30, 2023 was comprised $4.0 million in interest expense related to our debt securities and a negative change in fair\nmarket value of warrant liability of $0.1 million.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nThere was no tax expense recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 or the three months ended September 30, 2023. Based on available\nevidence as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, management believes it is more likely than not that some or all the deferred tax assets will not be\nrealized. Accordingly, we established a 100% valuation allowance. As a result of the full valuation allowance, we did not record a tax benefit during the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 or the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nNet Loss\nWe experienced a net loss of $6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net loss of $10.0 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. As described above, this result was driven by lower sales partially offset by lower cost of goods sold, and lower operating expenses, and a\ndecrease in other income (due to the change in fair market value of our warrants).\nComparisons for the Nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This\ndata should be read together with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, and is qualified in its entirety by\nreference to such financial statements and related notes.\nNine months ended September 30,\n2024 % Net Sales 2023 % Net Sales\n(in thousands)\nNet Sales $ 38,433 100.0 $ 53,954 100.0\nCost of Goods Sold 29,345 76.4 40,765 75.6\nGross profit 9,088 23.6 13,189 24.4\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development 4,495 11.7 3,332 6.2\nGeneral and administrative 14,878 38.7 23,114 42.8\nSales and marketing 8,329 21.7 11,075 20.5\nTotal Operating expenses 27,702 72.1 37,521 69.5\n(Loss) From Operations (18,614) (48.4) (24,332) (45.1)\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest expense, net (15,253) (39.7) (11,981) (22.2)\nOther expense (36) (0.1) - 0.0\nChange in fair market value of warrant liability 3,130 8.1 19,182 35.6\nTotal Other (Expense) Income (12,159) (31.6) 7,201 13.3\nLoss Before Taxes (30,773) (80.1) (17,131) (31.8)\nIncome Tax Benefit - - - -\nNet Loss $ (30,773) (80.1) $ (17,131) (31.8)\n47\nNine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nDTC 16,890 30,314\n% Net Sales 44.0 56.2\nOEM 21,376 23,640\n% Net Sales 55.6 43.8\nLicense Revenue 167 -\n% of Net Sales 0.4 -\nNet Sales $ 38,433 53,954\nNet Sales\nNet sales decreased by 15.5 million, or 28.8%, to $38.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $54.0 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was mainly due to lower DTC and OEM battery and accessory sales offset by a higher average sales price\nand licensing revenue recognized at $0.2 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, DTC revenue decreased by $13.4 million to $16.9 million\ndue to decreased customer demand for our products related to rising interest rates and inflation. OEM revenue decreased by $2.3 million to $21.4 million\nprimarily due to our largest RV customer changing our product from a standard offering to an option. Excluding this customer our RV OEM sales were up 33%\nyear over year for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We expect our deployment of products for use in oil and gas operations in North America to\nbegin contributing to net sales during the fourth quarter of 2024.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of revenue decreased by $11.4 million, or 28.0%, to $29.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $40.8 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower unit volume resulting in a $10.9 million decrease of product cost and $0.5\nmillion decrease in labor expense associated with lower headcount. We expect our Cost of Goods Sold to increase in conjunction with the anticipated increase\nin revenue over the next twelve months.\nGross Profit\nGross profit decreased by $4.1 million, or 31.1%, to $9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $13.2 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a lower unit volume of sales.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by $1.2 million, or 34.9%, to $4.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $3.3\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher wage expense in the amount of $0.8 million and $0.3 million\nfor increased lease expense for new building in Fernley. Depreciation related to an increase in assets, which was higher by $0.1 million. While we expect to\ncontinue to grow the Research and Development headcount, we expect to do so at a slower rate than in prior years.\n48\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $8.2 million, or 35.6%, to $14.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to\n$23.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower employee related costs in the amount of $7.3 million.\nImpacting this is a prior year severance package in the amount of $0.7 million and lower stock-based compensation in the amount of $4.8 million along with\nlower employee related costs in the amount of $1.8 million due to decreased headcount. Professional services, legal and insurance expenses are lower by $2.1\nmillion as a result of prior year public offering expenses and lower insurance premiums. Travel expenses in General and Administrative decreased by $0.5\nmillion due to allocation to the other functional areas in 2024. Offsetting these lower expenses is a $1.7 million increase in rent expense for the Reno\nWarehouse, which was mostly allocated to general and administrative expenses since we have not occupied the building as of September 30, 2024. We expect\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses, as a percentage of revenue, to decline over the next twelve months.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses decreased by $2.8 million, or 24.8%, to $8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $11.1\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a $2.3 million decrease in wage-related expenses of which $1.2\nmillion is related to the prior year expense for the Wakespeed earnout and $1.0 million is due to lower stock compensation and bonus expense. Lower shipping\ncosts in the amount of $0.9 million was related to a reduction in units sold. Offsetting these lower expenses is an increase of $0.4 million other marketing\nexpense includes travel expenses allocated from general and administrative to selling and marketing in 2024.\nTotal Other Income (Expense)\nOther expense totaled $12.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to total other income of $7.2 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. Other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is comprised of a positive change in fair market value of our warrants\nin the amount of $3.1 million and $15.3 million in interest expense related to our debt securities. Other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nwas comprised of a positive change in fair market value of our warrants in the amount of $19.2 million partially offset by $12.0 million in interest expense\nrelated to our debt securities.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nThere was no tax expense recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Based on available evidence\nas of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, management believes it is more likely than not that some or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nAccordingly, we established a 100% valuation allowance. As a result of the full valuation allowance, we did not record a tax benefit during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 or the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNet Loss\nWe generated a net loss of $30.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net loss of $17.1 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. This was a result of an increase in other expense (primarily as a result of a change in fair market value of our warrants) and lower sales\noffset by decreased cost of goods sold and lower operating expenses.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The\npreparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical\nexperience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for\nmaking judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these\nestimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a recurring basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts,\nand experience. The effects of material revisions in an estimate, if any, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of\nthe change in the estimate.\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the\ntime the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates\nthat we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nManagement has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our board of directors. In\naddition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in\nthese and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements.\n49\nWe believe that the following accounting estimates are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nInventory Valuation\nWe periodically review physical inventory for excess, obsolete, and potentially impaired items and reserves. Any such inventory is written down to net\nrealizable value. The reserve estimate for excess and obsolete inventory is dependent on expected future use and requires management judgement. The level of\nthe estimate is assessed by considering the recent sales experience, the aging of inventories, and other factors that affect inventory obsolescence.\nWarrants\nWe apply relevant accounting guidance for warrants to purchase our stock based on the nature of the relationship with the counterparty. For warrants issued to\ninvestors or lenders in exchange for cash or other financial assets, we follow guidance issued within ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC\n480”), and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”), to assist in the determination of whether the warrants should be classified as liabilities or equity.\nWarrants that are determined to require liability classifications are measured at fair value upon issuance and are subsequently remeasured to their then fair\nvalue at each subsequent reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in current earnings. Warrants that are determined to require equity classifications\nare measured at fair value upon issuance and are not subsequently remeasured unless they are required to be reclassified. See “Note 9-Warrants” in our\naccompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for information on the warrants.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nWe use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of option grants. In estimating fair value, management is required to make certain\nassumptions and estimates such as the expected life of units, volatility of our future share price, risk-free rates, future dividend yields and estimated forfeitures\nat the initial grant date. Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) awards are valued based on the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant.\nChanges in assumptions used to estimate fair value could result in materially different results.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax\nconsequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates. The effect of a change in tax\nrates on deferred taxes is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe recognize the financial statement effect of an uncertain income tax position when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position\nwill be sustained upon examination. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be realized. A\nvaluation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount, which in the opinion of management is more likely than not to be realized.\nManagement judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded\nagainst our deferred tax assets. We consider factors such as the cumulative income or loss in recent years; reversal of deferred tax liabilities; projected future\ntaxable income exclusive of temporary differences; the character of the income tax asset, including income tax positions; tax planning strategies and the period\nover which we expect the deferred tax assets to be recovered in the determination of the valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from these\nestimates or we adjust our estimates in the future, we may need to adjust our valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and\nresults of operations.\nLeases\nAcquired right-of-use assets and assumed lease liabilities are measured based on the remaining lease payments over the remaining portion of the lease term. As\nour leases do not provide an implicit rate, our incremental borrowing rate is used as a discount rate in determining the present value of lease payments. Our\nincremental borrowing rate was determined by comparing current low- and high-end mortgage loan rates and calculating an average. For our new Damonte\nlease, to be conservative in our estimate, we chose to use the high-end average as our incremental borrowing rate .\nLicense Arrangement\nWe have entered into license arrangements that involve receiving upfront compensation, which is recognized as revenue over a five-year period. Management\nestimates the appropriate recognition pattern based on the expected delivery of related services and the period over which the economic benefits will be\nrealized. This estimate involves judgments about the timing of performance obligations and the likelihood of continued customer engagement. Changes in these\nassumptions or unexpected developments could result in adjustments to revenue recognition, impacting the financial statements. As of the reporting date,\nmanagement believes the estimate reflects the current understanding of the license arrangement’s performance obligations.\n50\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis Quarterly Report includes a non-generally accepted account principles within the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) measure that we use to supplement our\nresults presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Earnings before interest tax and amortization (“EBITDA”) is defined as earnings before interest and other\nincome (expenses), income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation,\nemployee separation expenses, costs associated with the June 2023 Offering, promissory note forgiveness, and change in the fair market value of warrant\nliabilities. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that we believe is useful to investors and analysts because it illustrates the underlying financial and\nbusiness trends relating to our core, recurring results of operations and enhances comparability between periods.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measure under U.S. GAAP and is not intended to be a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure and, as\ncalculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within the same industry.\nInvestors should exercise caution in comparing our non-GAAP measure to any similarly titled measure used by other companies. This non-GAAP measure\nexcludes certain items required by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to information reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe table below presents our adjusted EBITDA, reconciled to net (loss) income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30,\n2023.\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nNet loss $ (6,779) $ (10,007) $ (30,773) $ (17,131)\nInterest Expense 5,615 3,987 15,253 11,981\nDepreciation and Amortization 327 316 991 909\nEBITDA (837) (5,704) (14,529) (4,241)\nAdjusted for:\nStock-Based Compensation (1) 256 946 759 6,387\nSeparation Agreement (2) - - - 720\nJune Offering Costs (3) - - - 904\nChange in fair market value of warrant liability (4) (4,875) 145 (3,130) (19,182)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (5,456) $ (4,613) $ (16,900) $ (15,412)\n(1) Stock-Based Compensation is comprised of costs associated with option and RSU grants made to our employees, consultants and board members.\n51\n(2) Separation Agreement is comprised of $720 in cash severance associated with separation agreement dated April 26, 2023 between us and our former Chief\nLegal Officer.\n(3) June Offering Costs is comprised of fees and expenses, including legal, accounting, and other expenses associated with our secondary offering.\n(4) Change in fair market value of warrant liabilities represents the change in fair value from January 1, 2023 through September 30, 2023 and January 1,\n2024 through September 30, 2024, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations, including working\ncapital needs, debt service, acquisitions, contractual obligations and other commitments. We assess liquidity in terms of our cash flows from operations and\ntheir sufficiency to fund our operating and investing activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash totaling $8.0 million.\nOn July 29, 2024, Legacy Dragonfly and Battle Born LLC entered into the License with Stryten. In exchange for the licensing rights, Stryten agreed to pay\nBattle Born LLC the Initial Licensing Fee of five million dollars ($5,000,000). Per the License Agreement, payment for the Initial Licensing Fee is due within\n30 days of the effective date of the License Agreement. We received the Initial Licensing Fee in August 2024.\nWe expect our capital expenditures and working capital requirements to increase materially in the near future, as we continue our research and development\nefforts (particularly those related to lithium-ion cell manufacturing and battery development), expand our production lines, scale up production operations and\nlook to enter into adjacent markets for our batteries. We expect to deploy a significant amount of capital to continue our development and optimization of our\nsolid-state battery technology, as well as continued investment to automate and increase the production capacity of our existing assembly operation, expansion\nof our facilities and new strategic investments, including deployment and scaling of our dry-electrode cell manufacturing processes. To date, our focus has been\non seeking to prove the fundamental soundness of our manufacturing techniques and our solid-state chemistry. Moving forward, our solid-state related\ninvestments will focus on chemistry optimization and establishing a pilot line for pouch cell production. Over the next two to three years, we expect to spend in\nexcess of $50 million on solid-state development and cell manufacturing technologies. In connection with the contraction of our business and uncertainty\naround the timing of future needs, we reduced our purchase activities in 2024. As a result, our inventory balance at September 30, 2024 decreased by $14.8\nmillion to $24.0 million, compared to $38.8 million at December 31, 2023.\nWe expect that we will need to raise additional funds, including through the use of the ChEF Equity Facility and the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt\nsecurities or by obtaining additional credit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal sources of liquidity, ongoing costs, such as research\nand development relating to our solid-state batteries, expansion of our facilities, and new strategic investments, and strategic initiatives. If such financings are\nnot available, or if the terms of such financings are less desirable than we expect, we may be forced to take actions to reduce our capital or operating\nexpenditures, including by not seeking potential acquisition opportunities, eliminating redundancies, or reducing or delaying our production facility\nexpansions, which may adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. Further, any future debt or equity financings may be\ndilutive to our current stockholders.\n52\nFinancing Obligations and Requirements\nOn November 24, 2021, we issued $45 million of fixed rate senior notes, secured by among other things, a security interest in our intellectual property. As part\nof the Business Combination, we entered into a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $75 million (the “Term Loan”) pursuant\nto the Term Loan, Guarantee and Security Agreement (the “Original Term Loan Agreement”) by and among, us, Legacy Dragonfly, Alter Domus (US) LLC,\nas the Agent to the lenders time-to-time party thereto (such lenders, the “Term Loan Lenders”), the proceeds of which were used to repay the $45 million\nfixed rate senior notes, and ChEF Equity Facility. On June 28, 2024, we entered into the First Amendment with the Term Loan Lenders. The First Amendment\nprovided for a one-time issuance of the June 2024 Penny Warrants to purchase up to 2,100,000 shares of common stock and certain amendments to the Term\nLoan. On July 29, 2024, we entered into the Second Amendment with the Term Loan Lenders in connection with the License Agreement. On September 30,\n2024, we entered into the Third Amendment with the Term Loan Lenders, which provided for the issuance of the September 2024 Penny Warrants to purchase\nup to 3,000,000 shares of common stock and certain amendments to the Term Loan Agreement.\nIn connection with the License Agreement, on July 29, 2024, us, Legacy Dragonfly and Battle Born LLC entered into the Second Amendment (together with\nthe Original Term Loan, the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, and the Third Amendment, the “Term Loan Agreement”).\nPursuant to the Second Amendment, the Term Loan Lenders (i) consented to the transactions contemplated by the License Agreement and the Trademark\nTransfer Agreement and (ii) agreed to waive the mandatory prepayment under the Term Loan that would have been due to the Term Loan Lenders under the\nTerm Loan Agreement upon Battle Born LLC’s receipt of the Initial Licensing Fee. In connection with the Second Amendment, Battle Born LLC entered into\nthe Joinder.\nThe Term Loan proceeds were used to: (i) support the Business Combination, (ii) prepay the fixed rate senior notes at closing of the Business Combination, (iii)\npay fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing, (iv) to provide additional growth capital and (v) for other general/corporate purposes. The Term Loan\nwill mature on October 7, 2026, or the Maturity Date, and will be subject to quarterly amortization of 5% per annum beginning 24 months after issuance. The\ndefinitive documents for the Term Loan incorporate certain mandatory prepayment events and certain affirmative and negative covenants and exceptions\nhereto. The financial covenants for the Term Loan include a maximum senior leverage ratio covenant, a minimum liquidity covenant, a springing fixed charge\ncoverage ratio covenant, and a maximum capital expenditures covenant. On March 29, 2023, September 29, 2023, December 29, 2023, May 13, 2024, June 28,\n2024, and September 30, 2024, we obtained waivers from Alter Domus (US) LLC, as the administrative agent for the lenders (the “Administrative Agent”)\nand EICF Agent LLC and certain third-party financing source of our failure to satisfy the Tests under the Term Loan during the quarters ended March 31, 2023,\nSeptember 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024. On March 31, 2024, April 29, 2024, June 28, 2024, July 31,\n2024, August 30, 2024, September 30, 2024, and October 31, 2024 we received additional waivers from the Administrative Agent and the Term Loan Lenders\nin regard to our compliance with the liquidity requirement under the Term Loan as of the last day of the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024,\nand September 30, 2024, and as of the last fiscal day for the months ended April 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, July 31, 2024, August 31, 2024, September 30, 2024,\nand October 31, 2024. However, it is probable that we will fail to meet these covenants within the next twelve months. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we\nreclassified our notes payable from a long-term liability to a current liability. The Term Loan accrues interest as follows: (i) until April 1, 2024, at a per annum\nrate equal to adjusted secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) plus 7% payable in cash plus an amount ranging from 4.5% to 6.5%, depending on our senior\nleverage ratio; (ii) effective April 1, 2024 and thereafter, interest payable to certain lenders subject to regulations of the U.S. Small Business Administration\n(“SBA”) with outstanding principal on that date of $30,846 will be limited to 14.0% per annum (except for default interest permitted under SBA regulations, as\napplicable); and (iii) the other outstanding principal will accrue interest from April 1, 2024 thereafter until October 1, 2024, at a per annum rate equal to\nadjusted SOFR plus 7% payable in cash plus an amount ranging from 4.5% to 6.5%, depending on the senior leverage ratio of the consolidated company, and at\nall times thereafter, at a per annum rate equal to adjusted SOFR plus a margin ranging from 11.5% to 13.5%, depending on our senior leverage ratio.\nPayments of interest based on the Term Loan are as follows:\n(i) Interest payable on April 1, 2024, was paid in cash.\n(ii) Interest payable on July 1, 2024, became payable-in-kind.\n(iii) Interest payable on October 1, 2024, became payable partly in cash and partly in-kind, at a per annum rate equal to adjusted SOFR plus 7%\npayable in cash plus an amount ranging from 4.5% to 6.5% paid-in-kind, depending on the senior leverage ratio of the consolidated company (subject to the\n14.0% limit for lenders subject to SBA regulations).\n(iv) For each payment date occurring on or after January 1, 2025, interest will be payable in cash.\n53\nIn each of the foregoing cases, adjusted SOFR will be no less than 1%.\nWe may elect to prepay all or any portion of the amounts owed prior to the Maturity Date, provided that we provide notice to the Administrative Agent and the\namount is accompanied by the applicable prepayment premium, if any. Prepayments of the Term Loan are required to be accompanied by a premium of 5% of\nthe principal amount so prepaid if made prior to the October 7, 2023, 3% if made on and after October 7, 2023 but prior to October 7, 2024, 1% if made after\nOctober 7, 2024 but prior to October 7, 2025, and 0% if made on or after October 7, 2025. If the Term Loan is accelerated following the occurrence of an event\nof default, Legacy Dragonfly is required to immediately pay to lenders the sum of all obligations for principal, accrued interest, and the applicable prepayment\npremium.\nPursuant to the Term Loan Agreement, we have guaranteed the obligations of Legacy Dragonfly and such obligations will be guaranteed by any of Legacy\nDragonfly’s subsidiaries that are party thereto from time to time as guarantors. Also pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement, the Administrative Agent was\ngranted a security interest in substantially all of the personal property, rights and assets of us as and Legacy Dragonfly to secure the payment of all amounts\nowed to lenders under the Term Loan Agreement. In addition, we entered into a Pledge Agreement pursuant to which we pledged to the Administrative Agent\nour equity interests in Legacy Dragonfly as further collateral security for the obligations under the Term Loan Agreement. At the closing of the Business\nCombination, we issued to the Term Loan Lenders (i) the Penny Warrants exercisable to purchase an aggregate of 2,593,056 shares at an exercise price of $0.01\nper share, and (ii) warrants exercisable to purchase 1,600,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $10.00 per share.\nPursuant to the Purchase Agreement, on the terms of and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions in the Purchase Agreement, including the filing and\neffectiveness of a registration statement registering the resale by CCM LLC of the shares of common stock issued to it under the Purchase Agreement, we will\nhave the right from time to time at our option to direct CCM LLC to purchase up to a specified maximum amount of shares of common stock, up to a\nmaximum aggregate purchase price of $150 million over the term of the ChEF Equity Facility. The purchase price of the shares of common stock that we elect\nto sell to CCM LLC pursuant to the Purchase Agreement will be determined by reference to the VWAP of the common stock during the applicable VWAP\nPurchase Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) on which we have timely delivered written notice to CCM LLC directing it to purchase shares of\ncommon stock under the Purchase Agreement, less a fixed 3.5% discount to such VWAP. As consideration for its commitment to purchase shares of our\ncommon stock under the Purchase Agreement, we have agreed to pay a commitment fee of $1 million to CCM LLC (the “Commitment Fee”), payable by way\nof an additional 3.0% discount to such VWAP until the Commitment Fee has been paid in full. In connection with the ChEF Equity Facility, we filed a\nregistration statement registering the resale of up to 21,512,027 shares that may be resold into the public markets by CCM LLC, which represented\napproximately 36% of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we issued and sold\napproximately 588,500 shares of our common stock under this facility, resulting in net cash proceeds of $1,278,566. During the nine months ended September\n30, 2024, we issued and sold approximately 2,245,391 shares of our common stock under the ChEF Equity Facility, resulting in net cash proceeds of\n$1,705,193. From October 1, 2024 through the November 12, 2024, we issued and sold approximately 53,719 shares of our common stock under the ChEF\nEquity Facility, resulting in additional net cash proceeds of $26,660. Any sales of such shares into the public market could have a significant negative impact\non the trading price of our common stock. This impact may be heightened by the fact that sales to CCM LLC will generally be at prices below the current\ntrading price of our common stock. If the trading price of our common stock does not recover or experiences a further decline, sales of shares of common stock\nto CCM LLC pursuant to the Purchase Agreement may be a less attractive source of capital and/or may not allow us to raise capital at rates that would be\npossible if the trading price of our common stock were higher.\n54\nOn March 5, 2023, we issued a note in the principal amount of $1.0 million (the “Principal Amount”) to Brian Nelson, one of our directors, in a private\nplacement in exchange for cash in an equal amount (the “March Note”). The March Note became due and payable in full on April 1, 2023. We were also\nobligated to pay a fee in the amount of $100,000 (the “March Loan Fee”) to Mr. Nelson on April 4, 2023. The Principal Amount of the March Note was paid\nin full on April 1, 2023 and the March Loan Fee was paid in full on April 4, 2023.\nOn January 30, 2024, we issued an unsecured convertible promissory note (the “January Note”) in the principal amount of $1.0 million (the “January\nPrincipal Amount”) to Brian Nelson, one of our directors, in a private placement in exchange for cash in an equal amount. The January Note became due and\npayable in full on February 2, 2024. We were also obligated to pay $50,000 (the “January Loan Fee”) to Mr. Nelson on February 2, 2024. We paid the January\nPrincipal Amount and the January Loan Fee in full on February 2, 2024.\nOn February 27, 2024 we issued a convertible promissory (the “February Note”) in the amount of $1.7 million (the “February Principal Amount”) to Mr.\nNelson, in a private placement in exchange for cash in an equal amount. The February Note became due and payable in full on March 1, 2024. We were also\nobligated to pay a $85,000 loan fee (the “February Loan Fee”) to Mr. Nelson on March 1, 2024. We paid the February Principal Amount and the February\nLoan Fee on March 1, 2024.\nIn June 2023, we completed the June 2023 Offering which provided net proceeds to us, including the partial over-allotment option exercise, of approximately\n$20.7 million. In July 2023, upon a request from our Term Loan Lenders under the Term Loan Agreement, we repaid $5.3 million to satisfy a portion of our\noutstanding principal.\nIn 2024, we identified an underpayment of tariffs to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) in the amount of approximately $1.66 million in the\naggregate, related to the improper classification and valuation of certain of the products used in our batteries. We have reported the underpayment to CBP.\nGoing Concern\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we generated a net loss of $6.8 million and had a negative cash flow from operations. As of September 30, 2024, we\nhad approximately $8.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital deficit of $9.6 million.\nUnder the Term Loan Agreement, we are obligated to comply with certain financial covenants, which include maintaining a maximum senior leverage ratio,\nminimum liquidity, a springing fixed charge coverage ratio, and maximum capital expenditures. On March 29, 2023, September 29, 2023, December 29, 2023,\nMay 13, 2024, June 28, 2024, July 31, 2024, August 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, we obtained waivers from our Administrative Agent and the Term Loan\nLenders in regards to our failure to satisfy the Tests with respect to the minimum cash requirements under the Term Loan for the quarters ended, March 31,\n2023, September 30, 2023, December 31, 2024, March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024. On March 31, 2024, April 29, 2024, June 28, 2024,\nJuly 31, 2024, August 30, 2024, September 30, 2024, and October 31, 2024, we received additional waivers from our Administrative Agent and the Term Loan\nLenders in regards to our compliance with the liquidity requirement under the Term Loan as of the last day of the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2024, June\n30, 2024 and September 30, 2024 and as of the last day of the fiscal months ended April 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, July 31, 2024, August 31, 2024, September\n30, 2024, and October 31, 2024. In connection with the License Agreement, on July 29, 2024, us, Legacy Dragonfly and Battle Born LLC entered into the\nSecond Amendment. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Term Loan Lenders (i) consented to the transactions contemplated by the License Agreement and\nthe Trademark Transfer Agreement and (ii) agreed to waive the mandatory prepayment under the Loan Agreement that would have been due to the Lenders\nunder the Term Loan upon Battle Born LLC’s receipt of the Initial Licensing Fee. In connection with the Second Amendment, Battle Born LLC entered into the\nJoinder. It is probable that we will fail to meet these covenants within the next twelve months. If we are unable to comply with the financial covenants in our\nloan agreement, the Term Loan Lenders have the right to accelerate the maturity of the Term Loan. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to\ncontinue as a going concern.\nIn addition, we will need to raise additional debt and/or equity financing to fund our operations and strategic plans and meet our financial covenants. We have\nhistorically been able to raise additional capital through issuance of equity and/or debt financing and we intend to use the ChEF Equity Facility and raise\nadditional capital as needed. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to raise additional equity, contain expenses, or increase revenue, and comply\nwith the financial covenants under the Term Loan. If such financings are not available, or if the terms of such financings are less desirable than we expect, we\nmay be forced to take actions to reduce our capital or operating expenditures, including by not seeking potential acquisition opportunities, eliminating\nredundancies, or reducing or delaying our production facility expansions, which may adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and\nprospects. Further, future debt or equity financings may be dilutive to our current stockholders.\n55\nCash Flows for the Nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023\nNine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet Cash (used in)/provided by:\nOperating Activities $ (4,712) $ (16,727)\nInvesting activities $ (1,691) $ (6,507)\nFinancing activities $ 1,709 $ 18,688\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a net loss of $30.8 million partially\noffset by $4.8 million in deferred revenue related to the License Agreement, $6.6 million of payment in-kind interest accrued on the Term Loan and $14.8\nmillion decrease in inventory as a result of management’s decision to lower overall stocking levels to adjust for more modest demand.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $16.7 million for nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a net loss of $17.1 million and an increase\nin accounts receivable partially offset by lower inventory levels.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of\n$6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in capital\nequipment expenses.\nFinancing Activities\nThere was $1.7 million net cash provided in financing activities, primarily from proceeds of issuing and selling shares under ChEF Equity Facility for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $18.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nwas primarily due to net proceeds of $21.1 million from the June 2023 Offering partially offset by a $5.3 million principal payment of our notes payable.\nContractual Obligations\nOur estimated future obligations consist of short-term and long-term operating lease liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, we had $2.9 million in short-term\noperating lease liabilities and $23.3 million in long-term operating lease liabilities.\nAs disclosed above, we have a Term Loan and as of September 30, 2024, the principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan was $69.7 million.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot applicable.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under\nthe Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and\ncommunicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, as our principal executive officer, and Interim Chief Financial Officer, as our\nprincipal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n56\nIn connection with the preparation of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our management, with the participation of\nour Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-\n15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of\npossible controls and procedures. As described in our Annual Report, our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial\nreporting as a result of our failure to capture, and record, and pay tariffs correctly related to the imported merchandise on previously filed 2022 and 2021\nfinancial statements. Based upon the evaluation described above, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that, due to the\nmaterial weakness previously reported in our Annual Report that has not yet been remediated, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement described a plan to remediate the material weakness within our Annual Report. Management, with the assistance of a third-party service provider,\ncontinues to design and implement additional internal controls. Additionally, management continued its risk assessment to identify risks and objectives. There\nwere no other changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or\nare reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management will continue to evaluate and enhance our processes as\nnoted in the remediation plan described within our Annual Report. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer\nno assurance that these will ultimately have the intended effects.\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings. We are not currently a party to any litigation or legal proceedings that, in\nthe opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact\non us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this item.\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we issued certain additional Penny Warrants to purchase 12,849 shares of common stock to the Term Loan\nLenders in accordance with the anti-dilution provisions of the Penny Warrants with respect to certain sales we made under the ChEF Equity Facility. In\naddition, October 1, 2024 to November 12, 2024 we issued certain Penny Warrants to purchase 419 shares of common of common stock to the Term Loan\nLenders in accordance with the anti-dilution provisions of the Penny Warrants with respect to certain sales we made under the ChEF Equity Facility. The Penny\nWarrants were immediately exercisable upon issuance and will expire ten years from the date of issuance.
