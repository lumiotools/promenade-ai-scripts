Please see “ _Questions and Answers about the Stockholder Meeting — How do I attend the virtual Stockholder Meeting?_ ” in the accompanying proxy statement for more information. Even if you are planning on attending the Stockholder Meeting online, please promptly submit your proxy vote online, or, if you received a printed form of proxy in the mail, by completing, dating, signing and returning the enclosed proxy, so your shares will be represented at the Stockholder Meeting.\n\nYou are cordially invited to attend the Stockholder Meeting that will be held for the purpose of considering and voting on (i) an extension amendment proposal to amend the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), to extend the date (the “Termination Date”) by which the Company has to consummate an initial business combination (the “Charter Extension”) from December 17, 2024 (the “Current Termination Date”) to January 17, 2025 (the “Charter Extension Date”), and to allow us, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month (or such shorter period as WinVest SPAC LLC (the “Sponsor”) shall request) each time after the Charter Extension Date, by resolution of our board of directors (the “Board”), if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2025, or a total of up to six months after the Current Termination Date, unless the closing of an initial business combination shall have occurred prior thereto (the “Extension Amendment Proposal”); a copy of the proposed amendment is set forth in _Annex A_ to the accompanying proxy statement; (ii) an extension amendment proposal to the Company’s Investment Management Trust Agreement (the “Trust Agreement,” and such amendment, the “Trust Amendment”), dated September 14, 2021, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (“Continental,” or the “Trustee”), as amended, to extend the date (the “Liquidation Date”) on which the Trustee must liquidate the trust account (“Trust Account”) established by the Company in connection with its initial public offering (“IPO”) and the concurrent sale of warrants (“Private Placement Warrants”) to our Sponsor in a private placement from December 17, 2024 to January 17, 2025, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to further extend the Liquidation Date on a monthly basis for up to five times, from January 17, 2025 to June 17, 2025 (the “Trust Amendment Proposal”). A copy of the proposed amendment is set forth in _Annex B_ to the accompanying proxy statement; and (iii) an adjournment proposal to adjourn the Stockholder Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies if, based upon the tabulated vote at the time of the Stockholder Meeting, there are insufficient shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), represented either in person (including virtually) or by proxy to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the Stockholder Meeting or at the time of the Stockholder Meeting to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal (the “Adjournment Proposal”) (unless the Company determines that it is not necessary to hold the Stockholder Meeting as described in the accompanying proxy statement), each as more fully described below in the accompanying proxy statement, which is dated November 21, 2024 and is first being mailed to stockholders on or about that date.\n\nThe proposals to be voted upon at the Stockholder Meeting are as follows:\n\n1. | _Proposal No. 1 — Extension Amendment Proposal —_ To amend the Certificate of Incorporation to extend the Termination Date from the Current Termination Date to the Charter Extension Date and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month (or such shorter period as the Sponsor shall request) each time after the Charter Extension Date, by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2025, or a total of up to six months after the Current Termination Date, unless the closing of an initial business combination shall have occurred prior thereto. A copy of the proposed amendment is set forth in _Annex A_ to the accompanying proxy statement;  \n---|---  \n2. | _Proposal No. 2 — Trust Amendment Proposal —_ To amend the Trust Agreement to extend the Liquidation Date from December 17, 2024 to January 17, 2025, and to allow us, without another stockholder vote, to elect to further extend the Liquidation Date on a monthly basis for up to five times from January 17, 2025 to June 17, 2025. A copy of the proposed amendment is set forth in _Annex B_ to the accompanying proxy statement; and  \n3. | _Proposal No. 3 — Adjournment Proposal —_ To adjourn the Stockholder Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies if, based upon the tabulated vote at the time of the Stockholder Meeting, there are insufficient shares of our Common Stock represented (either in person (including virtually) or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the Stockholder Meeting or at the time of the Stockholder Meeting to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal.  \n  \nEach of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal is more fully described in the accompanying proxy statement. Please take the time to read carefully each of the proposals in the accompanying proxy statement before you vote.\n\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved and the Company determines to effect the Charter Extension, prior to filing an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State to effectuate the Charter Extension and entering into the Trust Amendment with Continental, the Sponsor (or one or more of its affiliates, members or third-party designees, including, but not limited to, any parties to a business combination agreement (including the Business Combination Agreement (as defined below)) or their affiliates) (the “Lender”) shall lend the Company $30,000 (the “Monthly Extension Payment”), which the Company shall deposit into the Trust Account, upon the Company’s first drawdown under a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note in the amount of up to $180,000 to be issued by the Company to the Lender (the “Note”). In addition, if the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved and the Charter Extension becomes effective, in the event that we have not consummated an initial business combination by January 17, 2025, without approval of our public stockholders, we may, by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, extend the Termination Date and Liquidation Date up to five times, each by one additional month (or such shorter period as the Sponsor shall request) (for a total of up to six additional months to complete an initial business combination), provided that we draw down and deposit into the Trust Account, for each such extension, the Monthly Extension Payment, for an additional aggregate deposit of up to $150,000 (if all five additional extensions are exercised). If we complete an initial business combination, we will repay the amounts loaned under the Note. If we do not complete an initial business combination by the applicable Termination Date, such Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. If the Sponsor designates a third party as Lender, we may negotiate with the Lender and vary the terms of the Note, issue securities and pay certain fees to the Lender in connection with the Note.\n\nThe purpose of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal is to allow the Company additional time to complete its previously announced Business Combination (as defined below) with Xtribe P.L.C., a public limited company incorporated and registered in England and Wales with number 07878011 (“Xtribe PLC”). On September 16, 2024, WinVest entered into an Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”), by and among WinVest, WinVest (BVI) Ltd., a British Virgin Islands business company registered with company number 2157117 and a wholly owned subsidiary of WinVest (“WinVest BVI”), Xtribe PLC and Xtribe (BVI) Ltd., a British Virgin Islands business company registered with company number 2157137 and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xtribe PLC (“Xtribe BVI”), which amended and restated a business combination agreement entered into by and among WinVest, Xtribe PLC and certain affiliates thereof on May 9, 2024 in its entirety. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement (and subject to the conditions and terms therein), a business combination between WinVest and Xtribe BVI will be effected through the following transactions: (i) Xtribe PLC will contribute substantially all of its assets and certain of its liabilities to Xtribe BVI and thereafter be dissolved, (ii) WinVest will merge with and into WinVest BVI, whereupon the separate existence of WinVest will cease and WinVest BVI will continue as the surviving entity incorporated under the BVI Business Companies Act (as revised) of the British Virgin Islands, as amended to date (the “BVI Companies Act”), and (iii) promptly thereafter, Xtribe BVI will merge with and into WinVest BVI, whereupon the separate existence of Xtribe BVI will cease and WinVest BVI will be the surviving entity incorporated under the BVI Companies Act (such transactions, collectively, the “Business Combination”). In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, WinVest BVI will be renamed “Xtribe Holding (BVI) Ltd.” **You are not being asked to vote on an initial business combination, including the Business Combination, at this time.**\n\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that we have until the Current Termination Date to complete an initial business combination. The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company to seek an extension of the Current Termination Date and the Liquidation Date and have the Company’s stockholders approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal to allow for a period of additional time to consummate the Business Combination. Although we are using our best efforts to complete the Business Combination as contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement as soon as practicable, without the Charter Extension, we do not believe we will be able to complete an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) on or before the Current Termination Date. If that were to occur, we would be precluded from completing the Business Combination or any other initial business combination and would be forced to liquidate. If we are unable to effect the Charter Extension, we will not be able to extend the Current Termination Date.\n\nThe Company’s Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (“Nasdaq”). Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2(b) requires that special purpose acquisition companies (“SPACs”), such as the Company, complete one or more business combinations by the 36-month anniversary of the effectiveness of their initial public offering registration statement, which date, in the case of the Company, was September 14, 2024 (the “Nasdaq Deadline”). We did not complete an initial business combination prior to the Nasdaq Deadline. As a result, we are in violation of Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2.\n\nAs previously reported, on September 17, 2024, we received a written notice (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that we had failed to comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2. On September 24, 2024, we timely requested a hearing before The Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) to appeal the Notice and to request an additional six-month extension (the “Nasdaq Extension”) to close the Business Combination, which request stayed the suspension of trading on our securities. Our hearing before the Panel was held on November 12, 2024. Our securities will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market until the hearing process concludes and the Panel issues a written decision. However, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant our request for a suspension of delisting or continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. If the Panel does not grant our request, our securities will be delisted from Nasdaq. Additionally, even if the Panel grants our request, the proposed extension of the Termination Date to June 17, 2025 would exceed the Nasdaq Extension. As a result, if the Nasdaq Extension is granted and the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved but we do not complete an initial business combination prior to the expiration of the Nasdaq Extension, Nasdaq may commence proceedings to delist our Common Stock. The announcement of delisting proceedings may adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock and, if our Common Stock is delisted, there may no longer be an active trading market for such Common Stock. In addition, the potential or actual delisting of our Common Stock may also adversely affect our ability to consummate an initial business combination, including the Business Combination. For more information see “ _Risk Factors — We are required by the Nasdaq Listing Rules to consummate an initial business combination within 36 months of the effectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement. As a result of our failure to consummate an initial business combination within this time period, our securities could be subject to delisting.”_\n\nWe reserve the right at any time to cancel the Stockholder Meeting and not to submit to our stockholders the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal and implement the Charter Extension and the Trust Amendment. In the event the Stockholder Meeting is cancelled, and the Business Combination is not consummated prior to the Current Termination Date, we will dissolve and liquidate in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation.\n\nWe believe that it is in the best interests of our stockholders that we obtain the Charter Extension. After careful consideration of all relevant factors, the Board has determined that the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal are each in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, has declared it advisable and recommends that you vote or give instruction to vote “FOR” the Extension Amendment Proposal, “FOR” the Trust Amendment Proposal and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.\n\nAs contemplated by the Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of shares of Common Stock issued as part of the units sold in our IPO (the “Public Stock”) may elect to redeem all or a portion of their Public Stock in exchange for their pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account if the Charter Extension is implemented (the “Redemption”), regardless of how such public stockholders vote in regard to the Extension Amendment Proposal. **If the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved by the requisite vote of stockholders (and not abandoned), holders of Public Stock remaining after the Redemption will retain their right to redeem their Public Stock for their pro rata portion of the funds available in the Trust Account upon consummation of an initial business combination, or if we do not complete an initial business combination, by the applicable Termination Date.**\n\nWe will not use the proceeds placed in the Trust Account and the interest earned thereon to pay any excise taxes that may be imposed on us pursuant to any current, pending or future rules or laws, including without limitation any excise tax due imposed under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 on any redemptions or stock buybacks by the Company. In the event (i) an excise tax and/or any other similar fees or taxes in nature are levied or imposed on us pursuant to any current, pending or future rule(s) or law(s), including without limitation any excise tax imposed under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 in relation to a redemption of securities as described herein or otherwise, and (ii) the holders of our shares of Common Stock approve the Extension Amendment Proposal, if such excise tax or fee has not been paid by us to the applicable regulatory authority on or prior to the due date for such a tax or fee, our Sponsor or a designee agrees to promptly (but in any event sufficiently prior to the due date for such tax or fee to assure timely payment thereof) either directly pay such tax or fee on behalf of us or advance to us such funds as necessary and appropriate to allow us to pay such tax or fee timely with respect to any future redemptions that occur prior to or in connection with a business combination or our liquidation. The Sponsor agrees not to seek recourse for such expenses from the Trust Account.\n\nOn November 20, 2024, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of the accompanying proxy statement, the redemption price per share was approximately $11.90 (which is expected to be the same approximate amount two business days prior to the Stockholder Meeting), based on the aggregate amount on deposit in the Trust Account of approximately $5,860,988.17 as of November 20, 2024 (including interest not previously released to the Company to pay its income or other tax obligations), divided by the total number of then-outstanding shares of Public Stock. The redemption price per share will increase between November 20, 2024 and the date that is two business days prior to the Stockholder Meeting due to any interest that accrues on the amount on deposit in the Trust Account prior to such date (less any amounts released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations between such dates). If the closing price of the Public Stock was to remain the same until the date of the Stockholder Meeting, exercising redemption rights would result in a public stockholder receiving approximately $0.09 more per share than if the shares were sold in the open market (based on the current per share redemption price and the closing price of our Public Stock as reported on Nasdaq on November 20, 2024). We cannot assure stockholders that they will be able to sell their Public Stock in the open market, even if the market price per share is lower than the redemption price stated above, as there may not be sufficient liquidity in our securities when such stockholders wish to sell their shares. We believe that such redemption right enables our public stockholders to determine whether or not to sustain their investments for an additional period if we do not complete the Business Combination on or before the Current Termination Date.\n\nApproval of both the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal is a condition to the implementation of the Charter Extension. If the Charter Extension is implemented, the amount held in the Trust Account will be reduced by withdrawals in connection with the Redemption. We cannot predict the amount that will remain in the Trust Account following the Redemption if the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved, and the amount remaining in the Trust Account may be only a small fraction of the $5,860,988.17 that was in the Trust Account as of November 20, 2024 (including interest not previously released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations).\n\nIf either the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal are not approved and the Business Combination is not completed on or before the Current Termination Date, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the Public Stock, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations, if any (less up to $100,000 of such interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the total number of the then-outstanding shares of Public Stock, which Redemption will completely extinguish our public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such Redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and the Board, in accordance with applicable law, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the each case to the Company’s obligations under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no distribution from the Trust Account with respect to our warrants or rights, which will expire worthless in the event of our winding up.\n\nIn the event of a liquidation, the Sponsor, our officers, our current and former directors and certain members of our advisory board (collectively, the “Initial Stockholders”) will not receive any monies held in the Trust Account as a result of their ownership of an aggregate of 2,875,000 shares of Common Stock issued prior to the IPO (the “Founder Shares”), and the Sponsor will not receive any monies held in the Trust Account as a result of its ownership of 10,900,000 Private Placement Warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 5,450,000 shares of Common Stock. As a consequence, a liquidating distribution will be made only with respect to the Public Stock.\n\nIf we liquidate, the Sponsor has agreed to indemnify us to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or any claims by a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement (including the Business Combination Agreement), reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) $10.10 per share of Public Stock or (ii) the actual amount per share of Public Stock held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.10 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable), nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We cannot assure you, however, that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Based upon the current amount in the Trust Account, the per-share price at which shares of Public Stock would be redeemed from cash held in the Trust Account would be approximately $11.90. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you that the per share distribution from the Trust Account, if we liquidate, will not be less than $11.90, plus interest, due to unforeseen claims of creditors.\n\nUnder the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. Because WinVest will not be complying with Section 280 of the DGCL, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires it to adopt a plan, based on facts known to it at such time, that will provide for the payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against WinVest within the subsequent 10 years. However, because WinVest is a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and its operations are limited to seeking to complete an initial business combination, the only likely claims to arise would be from vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.), prospective target businesses or potentially claims related to the excise tax under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.\n\nTO EXERCISE YOUR REDEMPTION RIGHTS, YOU MUST DEMAND IN WRITING THAT YOUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE REDEEMED FOR A PRO RATA PORTION OF THE FUNDS HELD IN THE TRUST ACCOUNT AND TENDER YOUR SHARES TO OUR TRANSFER AGENT AT LEAST TWO BUSINESS DAYS PRIOR TO THE VOTE AT THE STOCKHOLDER MEETING. IN ORDER TO EXERCISE YOUR REDEMPTION RIGHT, YOU NEED TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF AS A BENEFICIAL HOLDER AND PROVIDE YOUR LEGAL NAME, PHONE NUMBER AND ADDRESS IN YOUR WRITTEN DEMAND. YOU MAY TENDER YOUR SHARES BY EITHER DELIVERING YOUR SHARE CERTIFICATE TO THE TRANSFER AGENT OR BY DELIVERING YOUR SHARES ELECTRONICALLY USING THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY’S DWAC (DEPOSIT WITHDRAWAL AT CUSTODIAN) SYSTEM. IF YOU HOLD THE SHARES IN STREET NAME, YOU WILL NEED TO INSTRUCT THE ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE AT YOUR BANK OR BROKER TO WITHDRAW THE SHARES FROM YOUR ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO EXERCISE YOUR REDEMPTION RIGHTS.\n\nWith respect to the regulation of SPACs like the Company, on January 24, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) adopted final rules (the “SPAC Final Rules”) relating to, among other items, the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). The SPAC Final Rules became effective on July 1, 2024.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of the Company being deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act) and thus subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, prior to the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement pursuant to which the Company registered its securities offered in the IPO (the “IPO Registration Statement”), we instructed the Trustee to liquidate the U.S. government treasury obligations or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter to maintain all funds in the Trust Account in cash in an interest-bearing bank account until the earlier of the consummation of an initial business combination or our liquidation. Although we subsequently reinvested such funds in marketable securities, we could instruct the Trustee to liquidate the securities held in the Trust Account again in the future. As a result of any such liquidation, we may receive less interest, if any, on the funds held in the Trust Account than if the assets in the Trust Account had remained in U.S. government securities or money market funds. However, interest previously earned on the funds held in the Trust Account still may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any, and certain other expenses as permitted. As a result, our liquidation of the securities held in the Trust Account and the holding of all funds in the Trust Account in cash could reduce the dollar amount our public stockholders would receive upon any Redemption or the liquidation of the Company. See “ _Risk Factors — We have in the past instructed the Trustee to liquidate the securities held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in cash, and we could do so again in the future. As a result of any such liquidation, we may receive less interest, if any, on the funds held in the Trust Account, which would reduce the dollar amount our public stockholders would receive upon any Redemption or the liquidation of the Company._ ”\n\nApproval of each of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock.\n\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock who are present in person (including virtually) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the Stockholder Meeting. The Adjournment Proposal will only be put forth for a vote if there are insufficient shares of Common Stock present at the Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum or there are not sufficient votes to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal at the Stockholder Meeting.\n\nRecord holders of Common Stock at the close of business on November 5, 2024 (the “Record Date”) are entitled to vote or have their votes cast at the Stockholder Meeting. On the Record Date, there were 492,333 issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock held by public stockholders and 2,875,000 issued and outstanding Founder Shares held by the Initial Stockholders. Our warrants and rights do not have voting rights.\n\nOur Initial Stockholders intend to vote all of their Founder Shares in favor of the proposals being presented at the Stockholder Meeting and have, pursuant to a letter agreement, agreed to, among other things, waive their redemption rights with respect to any Common Stock held by them in connection with this Stockholder Meeting. The Founder Shares will be excluded from the pro rata calculation used to determine the per-share redemption price. As of the date of the accompanying proxy statement, the Initial Stockholders hold approximately 85.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, of which (i) approximately 75.4% is held by our Sponsor, (ii) approximately 7.4% is held by our officers and current and former directors and (iii) approximately 2.6% is held by certain members of our advisory board (in each of (ii) and (iii), excluding any securities indirectly owned by such officers, directors or advisory board members as a result of their membership interest in the Sponsor). As a result, approval of each of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal will not require the affirmative vote of any shares of Public Stock.\n\nThe accompanying proxy statement contains important information about the Stockholder Meeting, the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Whether or not you plan to attend the Stockholder Meeting, we urge you to read this material carefully and vote your shares.\n\nThe accompanying proxy statement is dated November 21, 2024 and is first being mailed to stockholders on or about that date.\n\nBy Order of the Board of Directors of WinVest Acquisition Corp.  \n---  \n/s/ _Lawrence S.

Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.

In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of terminology such as “outlook,” “believes,” “expects,” “potential,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “seeks,” “approximately,” “predicts,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “anticipates” or the negative version of these words or other comparable words or phrases.\n\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this proxy statement reflect the Company’s current views about future events and are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that may cause its actual results to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. The Company does not guarantee that the transactions and events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all). The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements:\n\n● | our ability to complete an initial business combination (including the Business Combination (as defined below));  \n---|---  \n● | the anticipated benefits of an initial business combination (including the Business Combination);  \n● | the issuance by the SEC of final rules to regulate special purpose acquisition companies (“SPACs”);  \n● | the risk of the Company being deemed an “investment company” for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”);  \n● | the volatility of the market price and liquidity of the Public Stock (as defined below) and other securities of the Company;  \n● | our liquidation of the securities held in the Trust Account (as defined below) to avoid being deemed an investment company;  \n● | the potential impact of the Excise Tax (as defined below);  \n● | the delisting of our securities from the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (“Nasdaq”) or an inability to have our securities listed on Nasdaq following an initial business combination; and  \n● | the use of funds not held in the Trust Account or available to the Company from interest income on the Trust Account balance.  \n  \nWhile forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future performance. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, data or methods, future events or other changes after the date of this proxy statement, except as required by applicable law. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could cause our future results, performance or transactions to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement, please see the section titled “ _Risk Factors_ ” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024, and in other reports we file with the SEC. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are based only on information currently available to us (or to third parties making the forward-looking statements).\n\n1  \n---  \n  \n**QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE STOCKHOLDER MEETING**\n\nThe questions and answers below highlight only selected information from this proxy statement and only briefly address some commonly asked questions about this special meeting of stockholders (the “Stockholder Meeting”) and the proposals to be presented at the Stockholder Meeting. The following questions and answers do not include all the information that is important to our stockholders. Stockholders are urged to read carefully this entire proxy statement, including the other documents referred to herein, to fully understand the proposals to be presented at the Stockholder Meeting and the voting procedures for the Stockholder Meeting, which will be held on December 10, 2024, at 9:30 a.m., Eastern Time, as a virtual meeting, or at such other time, on such other date and at such other place to which the meeting may be postponed or adjourned. You can participate in the meeting, vote, and submit questions via live webcast by visiting https://www.cstproxy.com/winvestacquisition/ext2024.\n\n**Q:** | **Why am I receiving this proxy statement?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.  \n  \nOn September 17, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (the “IPO”) of units (“Units”), each consisting of one share of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock,” and the Common Stock issued as part of the Units, the “Public Stock”), one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”) to purchase one-half of one share of Common Stock and one right (“Right”) to receive one-fifteenth of one share of Common Stock. Following the closing of the IPO, and the subsequent full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment on September 27, 2021, $116,150,000 ($10.10 per Unit) from the net proceeds of (i) the sale of the Units in the IPO and (ii) the concurrent sale of private warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants,” and, collectively with the Public Warrants, the “Warrants”) to WinVest SPAC LLC (the “Sponsor”) was placed in a trust account established at the consummation of the IPO that holds certain of the proceeds of the IPO and the Private Placement Warrants (the “Trust Account”).\n\nLike most blank check companies, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), initially provided for the return of the IPO proceeds held in the Trust Account to the holders of shares of our Public Stock if there was no qualifying initial business combination(s) consummated on or before December 17, 2022. On November 30, 2022, we held a special meeting of stockholders to approve an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to extend the date by which we have to consummate an initial business combination (the “Termination Date”) from December 17, 2022 to January 17, 2023, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after such date, by resolution of the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”), if requested by the Sponsor, upon the deposit of $125,000 per monthly extension into the Trust Account and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2023, or a total of up to six months after December 17, 2022, unless the closing of the Company’s initial business combination shall have occurred prior thereto. After exercising all five such monthly extensions and extending the Termination Date to June 17, 2023, on June 12, 2023, we held a second special meeting of stockholders to approve an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to extend the Termination Date from June 17, 2023 to July 17, 2023, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after such date, by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor, upon the deposit of $65,000 per monthly extension into the Trust Account and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until December 17, 2023, or a total of up to six months after June 17, 2023, unless the closing of the Company’s initial business combination shall have occurred prior thereto. After exercising all five such monthly extensions and extending the Termination Date to December 17, 2023, on November 30, 2023, we held a third special meeting of stockholders to approve an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to extend the Termination Date from December 17, 2023 to January 17, 2024, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after such date, by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor, upon the deposit of $55,000 per monthly extension into the Trust Account and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2024, or a total of up to six months after December 17, 2023, unless the closing of the Company’s initial business combination shall have occurred prior thereto. After exercising all five such monthly extensions and extending the Termination Date to June 17, 2024, on June 3, 2024, we held a fourth special meeting of stockholders to approve an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to extend the Termination Date from June 17, 2024 to July 17, 2024, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after such date, by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor, upon the deposit of $30,000 per monthly extension into the Trust Account and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until December 17, 2024 (the “Current Termination Date”), or a total of up to six months after June 17, 2024, unless the closing of the Company’s initial business combination shall have occurred prior thereto. We have since exercised five monthly extensions, extending the Termination Date to the Current Termination Date.\n\n2  \n---  \n  \nOn September 16, 2024, WinVest entered into an Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”), by and among WinVest, WinVest (BVI) Ltd., a British Virgin Islands business company registered with company number 2157117 and a wholly owned subsidiary of WinVest (“WinVest BVI”), Xtribe P.L.C., a public limited company incorporated and registered in England and Wales with number 07878011 (“Xtribe PLC”), and Xtribe (BVI) Ltd., a British Virgin Islands business company registered with company number 2157137 and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xtribe PLC (“Xtribe BVI,” and together with Xtribe PLC, “Xtribe”), which amended and restated a business combination agreement entered into by and among WinVest, Xtribe PLC and certain affiliates thereof on May 9, 2024 in its entirety. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement (and subject to the conditions and terms therein), a business combination between WinVest and Xtribe BVI will be effected through the following transactions: (i) Xtribe PLC will contribute substantially all of its assets and certain of its liabilities to Xtribe BVI and thereafter be dissolved, (ii) WinVest will merge with and into WinVest BVI, whereupon the separate existence of WinVest will cease and WinVest BVI will continue as the surviving entity incorporated under the BVI Business Companies Act (as revised) of the British Virgin Islands, as amended to date (the “BVI Companies Act”), and (iii) promptly thereafter, Xtribe BVI will merge with and into WinVest BVI, whereupon the separate existence of Xtribe BVI will cease and WinVest BVI will be the surviving entity incorporated under the BVI Companies Act (such transactions, collectively, the “Business Combination”). In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, WinVest BVI will be renamed “Xtribe Holding (BVI) Ltd.”\n\nAlthough we are using our best efforts to complete the Business Combination as contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement as soon as practicable, without the Charter Extension (as defined below), we do not believe we will be able to complete the Business Combination on or before December 17, 2024. We believe that it is in the best interests of our stockholders to continue the Company’s existence until June 17, 2025 in order to allow the Company additional time to complete the Business Combination, and we are therefore holding this Stockholder Meeting.\n\n**Q:** | **When and where will the Stockholder Meeting be held?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | The Stockholder Meeting will be held on December 10, 2024, at 9:30 a.m., Eastern Time, as a virtual meeting, or at such other time, on such other date and at such other place to which the meeting may be postponed or adjourned.  \n  \nWe encourage you to attend the Stockholder Meeting virtually. You can participate in the meeting, vote, and submit questions via live webcast by visiting https://www.cstproxy.com/winvestacquisition/ext2024. Please see “ _Questions and Answers about the Stockholder Meeting — How do I attend the virtual Stockholder Meeting?_ ” for more information.\n\n3  \n---  \n  \n**Q:** | **How do I vote?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | If you were a holder of record of shares of Public Stock at the close of business on November 5, 2024 (the “Record Date”), you may vote with respect to the proposals electronically, either prior to or during the Stockholder Meeting, or by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Voting by Mail.** By signing the proxy card and returning it in the enclosed prepaid and addressed envelope, you are authorizing the individuals named on the proxy card to vote your shares at the Stockholder Meeting in the manner you indicate. You are encouraged to sign and return the proxy card even if you plan to attend the Stockholder Meeting so that your shares will be voted if you are unable to attend the Stockholder Meeting.

Please note that you will not be able to vote or ask questions at the Stockholder Meeting if you choose to participate telephonically.\n\n**Q:** | **What are the specific proposals on which I am being asked to vote at the Stockholder Meeting?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | Our stockholders are being asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:  \n---|---  \n1. | _Proposal No. 1 — Extension Amendment Proposal —_ To amend our Certificate of Incorporation to extend the Termination Date (the “Charter Extension”) from the Current Termination Date to January 17, 2025 (the “Charter Extension Date”), and to allow us, without another stockholder vote, to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month (or such shorter period as the Sponsor shall request) each time after the Charter Extension Date, by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2025 (each, an “Additional Charter Extension Date”), or a total of up to six months after the Current Termination Date, unless the closing of an initial business combination shall have occurred prior thereto (the “Extension Amendment Proposal”). A copy of the proposed amendment, which we refer to as the “Extension Amendment,” is set forth in _Annex A_ to this proxy statement;  \n---|---  \n  \n4  \n---  \n  \n2. | _Proposal No. 2 — Trust Amendment Proposal —_ To amend the Trust Agreement (such amendment, the “Trust Amendment”), dated September 14, 2021, by and between the Company and Continental, as amended, to extend the date (the “Liquidation Date”) on which the Trustee must liquidate the Trust Account from December 17, 2024 to January 17, 2025, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to further extend the Liquidation Date on a monthly basis for up to five times from January 17, 2025 to June 17, 2025 (the “Trust Amendment Proposal”). A copy of the proposed amendment is set forth in _Annex B_ to this proxy statement; and  \n---|---  \n3. | _Proposal No. 3 — Adjournment Proposal —_ To adjourn the Stockholder Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies if, based upon the tabulated vote at the time of the Stockholder Meeting, there are insufficient shares of Common Stock represented either in person (including virtually) or by proxy to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the Stockholder Meeting or at the time of the Stockholder Meeting to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal (the “Adjournment Proposal”).  \n  \nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved and the Company determines to effect the Charter Extension, prior to filing the Extension Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State to effectuate the Charter Extension and entering into the Trust Amendment with Continental, the Sponsor (or one or more of its affiliates, members or third-party designees, including, but not limited to, any parties to a business combination agreement (including the Business Combination Agreement) or their affiliates) (the “Lender”) shall lend the Company $30,000 (the “Monthly Extension Payment”), which the Company shall deposit into the Trust Account upon the Company’s first drawdown of a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note in the amount of up to $180,000 to be issued by the Company to the Lender (the “Note”). In addition, if the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved and the Charter Extension and Trust Amendment become effective, in the event that we have not consummated an initial business combination by January 17, 2025, without approval of our public stockholders, we may, by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, extend the Termination Date and Liquidation Date up to five times, each by one additional month (or such shorter period as the Sponsor shall request) (for a total of up to six additional months to complete an initial business combination), provided that we draw down and deposit into the Trust Account, for each such extension, the Monthly Extension Payment under the Note, for an additional aggregate deposit of up to $150,000 (if all five additional extensions are exercised). If we complete an initial business combination, we will repay the amounts loaned under the Note. If we do not complete an initial business combination by the applicable Termination Date, such Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. If the Sponsor designates a third party as Lender, we may negotiate with the Lender and vary the terms of the Note, issue securities and pay certain fees to the Lender in connection with the Note.\n\nFor more information, please see “ _Proposal No. 1 — The Extension Amendment Proposal_.”\n\n**After careful consideration, the Board has unanimously determined that the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal are in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” or give instruction to vote “FOR” each of these proposals.**\n\nThe existence of financial and personal interests of our directors and officers may result in conflicts of interest, including a conflict between what may be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and what may be best for a director’s personal interests when determining to recommend that stockholders vote for the proposals. See the sections titled “ _Proposal No. 1 — The Extension Amendment Proposal — Interests of the Initial Stockholders_ ” and “ _Beneficial Ownership of Securities_ ” for a further discussion of these considerations.\n\n5  \n---  \n  \n**THE VOTE OF STOCKHOLDERS IS IMPORTANT. STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO SUBMIT THEIR PROXIES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER CAREFULLY REVIEWING THIS PROXY STATEMENT.**\n\n**Q:** | **Am I being asked to vote on a proposal to elect directors?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | No. Holders of Public Stock are not being asked to vote on the election of directors at this time.  \n**Q:** | **Are the proposals conditioned on one another?**  \n**A:** | Approval of both the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal is a condition to the implementation of the Charter Extension.  \n  \nThe Adjournment Proposal is conditioned on the Company not obtaining the necessary votes for approving the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal prior to the Stockholder Meeting in order to seek additional time to obtain sufficient votes in support of the Charter Extension. If the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved at the Stockholder Meeting, the Adjournment Proposal will not be presented.\n\n**Q:** | **Why is the Company proposing the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | Our Certificate of Incorporation and the Trust Agreement provide for the return of the IPO proceeds held in trust to the holders of Public Stock sold in the IPO if there is no qualifying initial business combination consummated on or before the Current Termination Date. The purpose of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal, and, if necessary, the Adjournment Proposal, is to allow the Company additional time to complete the Business Combination.  \n  \nAlthough we are using our best efforts to complete the Business Combination as contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement as soon as practicable, without the Charter Extension, we do not believe we will be able to complete an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) on or before the Current Termination Date. If that were to occur, we would be forced to liquidate.\n\nIf either the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal is not approved by our stockholders, we may put the Adjournment Proposal to a vote in order to seek additional time to obtain sufficient votes in support of the Charter Extension. If the Adjournment Proposal is not approved by our stockholders, the Board may not be able to adjourn the Stockholder Meeting to a later date or dates in the event that there are insufficient shares of Common Stock represented (either in person (including virtually) or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the Stockholder Meeting or at the time of the Stockholder Meeting to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal.\n\nWe reserve the right at any time to cancel the Stockholder Meeting and not to submit to our stockholders the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal and implement the Charter Extension and the Trust Amendment. In the event the Stockholder Meeting is cancelled, and the Business Combination is not consummated prior to the Current Termination Date, we will dissolve and liquidate in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation. If we liquidate, our public stockholders may only receive a return of a pro rata portion of the amounts remaining in the Trust Account, and our Warrants and Rights will expire worthless. This will also cause you to lose any potential investment opportunity in a target company (including Xtribe) and the chance of realizing future gains on your investment through any price appreciation in the combined company.\n\nIf we are unable to effect the Charter Extension, we will not be able to extend the Current Termination Date.\n\n6  \n---  \n  \n**Q:** | **What constitutes a quorum?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | A quorum of our stockholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. The presence, in person (including virtually) or by proxy, of stockholders holding a majority of the Common Stock entitled to vote at the Stockholder Meeting constitutes a quorum at the Stockholder Meeting. Abstentions will be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum. The Sponsor, our officers, our current and former directors and certain members of our advisory board (collectively, the “Initial Stockholders”) hold an aggregate of 2,875,000 shares of Common Stock issued prior to the IPO (the “Founder Shares”). Such Founder Shares, which represent an aggregate of 85.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the Record Date, will count towards this quorum. As a result, as of the Record Date, in addition to the Founder Shares, no shares of Public Stock would be required to be present at the Stockholder Meeting to achieve a quorum. Because the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal are “non-routine” matters, banks, brokers and other nominees will not have authority to vote on any proposals unless instructed. Therefore, such broker non-votes will not count towards quorum at the Stockholder Meeting. In the absence of a quorum, the chairman of the Stockholder Meeting has the power to adjourn the Stockholder Meeting.  \n**Q:** | **What vote is required to approve the proposals presented at the Stockholder Meeting?**  \n**A:** | Approval of each of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock.  \n  \nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock who are present in person (including virtually) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the Stockholder Meeting.\n\n**Q:** | **How will the Sponsor and WinVest’s directors and officers vote?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | The Initial Stockholders, including the Sponsor and WinVest’s directors and officers, intend to vote any shares of Common Stock over which they have voting control in favor of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.  \n  \nThe Initial Stockholders are not entitled to redeem any Common Stock held by them in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal. On the Record Date, the Initial Stockholders beneficially owned and were entitled to vote an aggregate of 2,875,000 shares of Common Stock, representing 85.4% of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock.\n\n**Q:** | **Who is WinVest’s Sponsor?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | WinVest’s sponsor is WinVest SPAC LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. The Sponsor currently owns 2,537,424 shares of Common Stock and 10,900,000 Private Placement Warrants. Jeff LeBlanc, the manager of the Sponsor, has voting and dispositive power over the Common Stock and Private Placement Warrants held by the Sponsor. The Sponsor is not “controlled” (as defined in 31 CFR 800.208) by a foreign person, such that the Sponsor’s involvement in an initial business combination would be a “covered transaction” (as defined in 31 CFR 800.213).  \n**Q:** | **Why should I vote “FOR” the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | We believe stockholders will benefit from the Company consummating the Business Combination and are proposing the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal to extend the date by which the Company has to complete an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) until the Charter Extension Date (or Additional Charter Extension Date, if applicable). Although we are using our best efforts to complete the Business Combination as contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement as soon as practicable, without the Charter Extension, we do not believe we will be able to complete an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) on or before the Current Termination Date. If that were to occur, the Company would be forced to liquidate.  \n  \n7  \n---  \n  \nThe Trust Agreement provides that if a business combination has not been consummated by July 17, 2024 (unless extended up to five months), the Trust Account is to be liquidated and its proceeds are to be distributed to the our public stockholders of record as of such date, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest that may be released to us to pay dissolution expenses). The purpose of the Trust Amendment is to amend the Trust Agreement to extend the Liquidation Date from December 17, 2024 to January 17, 2025, and to allow us, without another stockholder vote, to elect to further extend the Liquidation Date on a monthly basis for up to five times from January 17, 2025 to June 17, 2025 to match the Certificate of Incorporation if the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved and the Extension Amendment is filed.  \n---  \n**Q:** | **What if I do not want to vote “FOR” the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal?**  \n**A:** | If you do not want the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal to be approved, you may expressly “ABSTAIN,” not vote, or vote “AGAINST” such proposal.  \n  \nIf you attend the Stockholder Meeting virtually or by proxy, you may vote “AGAINST” the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, and your Common Stock will be counted for the purposes of determining whether the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal (as the case may be) are approved.\n\nHowever, if you fail to attend the Stockholder Meeting virtually or by proxy, or if you do attend the Stockholder Meeting virtually or by proxy but you “ABSTAIN” or otherwise fail to vote at the Stockholder Meeting, your Common Stock will not be counted for the purposes of determining whether the Adjournment Proposal is approved, and your Common Stock which is not voted at the Stockholder Meeting will have no effect on the outcome of such vote. If you “ABSTAIN” or otherwise fail to vote at the Stockholder Meeting, this will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal.\n\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved, the Adjournment Proposal will not be presented for a vote.\n\n**Q:** | **Will you seek any further extensions to liquidate the Trust Account?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | Other than as described in this proxy statement, we do not currently anticipate seeking any further extension to consummate an initial business combination (including the Business Combination), but may do so in the future.  \n**Q:** | **What happens if the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal are not approved?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | If there are insufficient votes to approve both the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal, we may put the Adjournment Proposal to a vote in order to seek additional time to obtain sufficient votes in support of the Charter Extension and the Trust Amendment.  \n  \nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are not both approved at the Stockholder Meeting or at any adjournment thereof and the Business Combination is not completed on or before the Current Termination Date, then as contemplated by and in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter redeem 100% of the Public Stock for cash for a redemption price per share as described below (which Redemption (as defined below) will completely extinguish such holders’ rights as stockholders, including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such Redemption, subject to approval of our then-stockholders and subject to the requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), including the adoption of a resolution by the Board pursuant to Section 275(a) of the DGCL finding the dissolution of the Company advisable and the provision of such notices as are required by said Section 275(a) of the DGCL, dissolve and liquidate the balance of the Company’s net assets to its remaining stockholders, as part of the Company’s plan of dissolution and liquidation, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to the Company’s obligations under the DGCL to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law. In such event, the per share redemption price shall be equal to a pro rata share of the Trust Account plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company or necessary to pay its taxes (less up to $100,000 of such interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the total number of shares of Public Stock then outstanding.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \nThe Initial Stockholders have waived their right to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to the 2,875,000 Founder Shares held by them. There will be no distribution from the Trust Account with respect to our Warrants or Rights, which will expire worthless in the event the Company dissolves and liquidates the Trust Account.\n\n**Q:** | **If the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved, what happens next?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | If the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved, we will file the Extension Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State, enter into the Trust Amendment with the Trustee and continue to attempt to consummate the Business Combination until the Charter Extension Date (or Additional Charter Extension Date, if applicable).  \n  \nThe Company’s Common Stock is listed on Nasdaq. Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2(b) requires that SPACs, such as the Company, complete one or more business combinations by the 36-month anniversary of the effectiveness of their initial public offering registration statement, which date, in the case of the Company, was September 14, 2024 (the “Nasdaq Deadline”). We did not complete an initial business combination prior to the Nasdaq Deadline. As a result, we are in violation of Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2.\n\nAs previously reported, on September 17, 2024, we received a written notice (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that we had failed to comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2. On September 24, 2024, we timely requested a hearing before The Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) to appeal the Notice and to request an additional six-month extension (the “Nasdaq Extension”) to close the Business Combination, which request stayed the suspension of trading on our securities. Our hearing before the Panel was held on November 12, 2024. Our securities will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market until the hearing process concludes and the Panel issues a written decision. However, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant our request for a suspension of delisting or continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. If the Panel does not grant our request, our securities will be delisted from Nasdaq. Additionally, even if the Panel grants our request, the proposed extension of the Termination Date to June 17, 2025 would exceed the Nasdaq Extension. As a result, if the Nasdaq Extension is granted and the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved but we do not complete an initial business combination prior to the expiration of the Nasdaq Extension, Nasdaq may commence proceedings to delist our Common Stock. The announcement of delisting proceedings may adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock and, if our Common Stock is delisted, there may no longer be an active trading market for such Common Stock. In addition, the potential or actual delisting of our Common Stock may also adversely affect our ability to consummate an initial business combination. For more information see “ _Risk Factors — We are required by the Nasdaq Listing Rules to consummate a Business Combination within 36 months of the effectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement. As a result of our failure to consummate an initial business combination within this time period, or securities could be subject to delisting.”_\n\nIf the Charter Extension and the Trust Amendment are implemented and one or more of our stockholders elect to redeem their Public Stock in exchange for their pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account (a “Redemption”), we will remove from the Trust Account and deliver to the holders of such redeemed Public Stock an amount equal to the pro rata portion of funds available in the Trust Account with respect to such redeemed Public Stock, and retain the remainder of the funds in the Trust Account for our use in connection with consummating an initial business combination, subject to the redemption rights of holders of Public Stock in connection with an initial business combination.\n\nThe removal from the Trust Account of such amounts will reduce the amount remaining in the Trust Account and increase the percentage interest of the Company held by the Sponsor.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \n**Q:** | **If I vote for or against the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal, do I need to request that my shares be redeemed?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | Yes. Whether you vote “for” or “against” the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal, or do not vote at all, you may elect to redeem your shares. However, you will need to submit a redemption request for your shares if you choose to redeem.  \n**Q:** | **What amount will holders receive upon consummation of an initial business combination or liquidation if the Extension Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | If the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved and the Company determines to effect the Charter Extension, prior to filing the Extension Amendment and entering into the Trust Amendment with Continental, the Lender shall lend the Company the Monthly Extension Payment, which the Company shall deposit into the Trust Account upon the Company’s first drawdown of the Note. In addition, if the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved and the Charter Extension and Trust Amendment become effective, in the event that we have not consummated an initial business combination by January 17, 2025, without approval of our public stockholders, we may, by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, extend the Termination Date up to five times, each by one additional month (or such shorter period as the Sponsor shall request) (for a total of up to six additional months to complete an initial business combination), provided that we draw down and deposit into the Trust Account, for each such extension, the Monthly Extension Payment under the Note, for an additional aggregate deposit of up to $150,000 (if all five additional extensions are exercised). If we complete an initial business combination, we will repay the amounts loaned under the Note. If we do not complete an initial business combination by the applicable Termination Date, such Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. If the Sponsor designates a third party as Lender, we may negotiate with the Lender and vary the terms of the Note, issue securities and pay certain fees to the Lender in connection with the Note.  \n**Q:** | **Am I being asked to vote on an initial business combination at this Stockholder Meeting?**  \n**A:** | No. You are not being asked to vote on an initial business combination, including the Business Combination, at this time. If the Charter Extension is implemented and you do not elect to redeem your shares of Public Stock, provided that you are a stockholder on the record date for the stockholder meeting to consider an initial business combination (including the Business Combination), you will be entitled to vote on such initial business combination when it is submitted to stockholders and will retain the right to redeem your shares of Public Stock for cash in connection with an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) or liquidation.  \n**Q:** | **Will how I vote affect my ability to exercise redemption rights?**  \n**A:** | No. You may exercise your redemption rights whether or not you are a holder of Public Stock on the Record Date (so long as you are a holder at the time of exercise), or whether you are a holder and vote your Public Stock on the Extension Amendment Proposal (for or against) or any other proposal described by this proxy statement. As a result, the Charter Extension can be approved by stockholders who will redeem their Public Stock and no longer remain stockholders, leaving stockholders who choose not to redeem their Public Stock holding shares in a company with a potentially less liquid trading market, fewer stockholders, potentially less cash and the potential inability to meet the listing standards of Nasdaq.  \n  \n10  \n---  \n  \n**Q:** | **Will the balance in the Trust Account be affected by the Excise Tax included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, imposes a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased by “covered corporations” beginning in 2023, with certain exceptions (the “Excise Tax”). The Excise Tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which the stock is repurchased. The amount of the Excise Tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the Excise Tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the Excise Tax. We will not use the proceeds placed in the Trust Account and the interest earned thereon to pay any excise taxes that may be imposed on us pursuant to any current, pending or future rules or laws, including without limitation the Excise Tax, on any redemptions or stock buybacks by the Company. In the event (i) an excise tax and/or any other similar fees or taxes in nature are levied or imposed on us pursuant to any current, pending or future rule(s) or law(s), including without limitation the Excise Tax, in relation to a redemption of securities as described herein or otherwise, and (ii) the holders of our shares of Common Stock approve the Extension Amendment Proposal, if such excise tax or fee has not been paid by us to the applicable regulatory authority on or prior to the due date for such a tax or fee, our Sponsor or a designee agrees to promptly (but in any event sufficiently prior to the due date for such tax or fee to assure timely payment thereof) either directly pay such tax or fee on behalf of us or advance to us such funds as necessary and appropriate to allow us to pay such tax or fee timely with respect to any future redemptions that occur prior to or in connection with an initial business combination or our liquidation. The Sponsor agrees not to seek recourse for such expenses from the Trust Account.  \n**Q:** | **May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | Yes. Stockholders may send a later-dated, signed proxy card to WinVest Acquisition Corp., at 125 Cambridgepark Drive, Suite 301, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02140, so that it is received by the Company prior to the vote at the Stockholder Meeting (which is scheduled to take place on December 10, 2024) or attend the virtual Stockholder Meeting and vote electronically. Stockholders also may revoke their proxy by sending a notice of revocation to our Chief Executive Officer, which must be received by our Chief Executive Officer prior to the vote at the Stockholder Meeting. However, if your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or another nominee, you must contact your broker, bank or other nominee to change your vote.  \n**Q:** | **How are votes counted?**  \n**A:** | Votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the Stockholder Meeting, who will separately count “FOR” and “AGAINST” votes and abstentions. Approval of each of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock who are present in person (including virtually) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the Stockholder Meeting.  \n  \nStockholders who attend the Stockholder Meeting, either virtually or by proxy, will be counted (and the number of Common Stock held by such stockholders will be counted) for the purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Stockholder Meeting. The presence, in person (including virtually) or by proxy, of stockholders holding a majority of the Common Stock entitled to vote at the Stockholder Meeting constitutes a quorum at the Stockholder Meeting.\n\nWith respect to the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal. As these proposals are not “routine” matters, brokers will not be permitted to exercise discretionary voting on these proposals.\n\nWith respect to the Adjournment Proposal, abstentions will have no effect on the approval of the proposal. As this proposal is not a “routine” matter, brokers will not be permitted to exercise discretionary voting on this proposal.\n\n11  \n---  \n  \n**Q:** | **If my shares are held in “street name,” will my broker, bank or nominee automatically vote my shares for me?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | If your shares are held in “street name” in a stock brokerage account or by a broker, bank or other nominee, you must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee. Please note that you may not vote shares held in “street name” by returning a proxy card directly to the Company or by voting online at the Stockholder Meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy,” which you must obtain from your broker, bank or other nominee.  \n  \nUnder the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, brokers who hold shares in “street name” for a beneficial owner of those shares typically have the authority to vote in their discretion on “routine” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, brokers are not permitted to exercise their voting discretion with respect to the approval of matters that the New York Stock Exchange determines to be “non-routine” without specific instructions from the beneficial owner. The Extension Amendment Proposal, Trust Amendment Proposal and Adjournment Proposal are all “non-routine” matters and therefore, brokers are not permitted to exercise their voting discretion with respect to these proposals.\n\nIf you are a WinVest stockholder holding your shares in “street name” and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares, your broker, bank or other nominee will not vote your shares on the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. Accordingly, your bank, broker, or other nominee can vote your shares on the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal at the Stockholder Meeting only if you provide instructions on how to vote. You should instruct your broker to vote your shares as soon as possible in accordance with directions you provide.\n\n**Q:** | **Does the Board recommend voting “FOR” the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | Yes. After careful consideration of the terms and conditions of each of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, the Board has determined that each of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Board recommends that the Company’s stockholders vote “FOR” each of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and, if presented, the Adjournment Proposal.  \n**Q:** | **What interests do WinVest’s directors and officers have in the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal?**  \n**A:** | WinVest’s directors and officers have interests in the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. These interests include, among others, ownership, directly or indirectly through the Sponsor, of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants. See the section titled “ _Proposal No. 1 — The Extension Amendment Proposal — Interests of the Initial Stockholders_ ” in this proxy statement.  \n**Q:** | **Do I have appraisal rights if I object to the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal?**  \n**A:** | No. There are no appraisal rights available to our stockholders in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal.  \n  \n12  \n---  \n  \n**Q:** | **If I am a Public Warrant or Right holder, can I exercise redemption rights with respect to my Public Warrants or Rights?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | No. The holders of Public Warrants and the holders of Rights have no redemption rights with respect to such Public Warrants or Rights.  \n**Q:** | **What do I need to do now?**  \n**A:** | You are urged to read carefully and consider the information contained in this proxy statement and to consider how the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal will affect you as a stockholder. You should then vote as soon as possible in accordance with the instructions provided in this proxy statement and on the enclosed proxy card or, if you hold your shares through a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee, on the voting instruction form provided by the broker, bank or nominee.  \n**Q:** | **How do I exercise my redemption rights?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | If you are a holder of Public Stock and wish to exercise your right to redeem your Common Stock, you must:  \nI. | (a) hold Common Stock or (b) hold Common Stock through Units and elect to separate your Units into the underlying Common Stock, Rights and Public Warrants prior to exercising your redemption rights with respect to the Common Stock;  \n---|---  \nII. | prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 6, 2024 (two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote at the Stockholder Meeting), (a) submit a written request to the Transfer Agent that the Company redeem all or a portion of your Common Stock for cash and (b) identify yourself as the beneficial holder of the Common Stock and provide your legal name, phone number and address; and  \nIII. | deliver your Common Stock to the Transfer Agent, physically or electronically through the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”).  \n  \nThe address of the Transfer Agent is listed under the question “ _Who can help answer my questions?_ ” below.\n\nHolders of Units must elect to separate the underlying Common Stock, Rights and Public Warrants prior to exercising redemption rights with respect to the Common Stock. If holders hold their Units in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, holders must notify their broker or bank that they elect to separate the Units into the underlying Common Stock, Rights and Public Warrants, or if a holder holds Units registered in its own name, the holder must contact the Transfer Agent directly and instruct it to do so.\n\nIn connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal, and contingent upon the effectiveness of the implementation of the Charter Extension, any holder of Public Stock will be entitled to request that their Public Stock be redeemed for a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the Stockholder Meeting, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its income or other tax obligations, divided by the number of then-outstanding shares of Public Stock. As of November 20, 2024, this would have amounted to approximately $11.90 per share of Public Stock.\n\nHowever, the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of our creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of our public stockholders. Therefore, the per share distribution from the Trust Account in such a situation may be less than originally anticipated due to such claims. We anticipate that the funds to be distributed to public stockholders electing to redeem their Common Stock will be distributed promptly after the Stockholder Meeting.\n\nAny request for redemption, once made by a holder of Common Stock, may be withdrawn at any time until the deadline for exercising redemption requests, unless approved by the Board. If you deliver your shares for redemption to the Transfer Agent and later decide prior to the deadline for exercising redemption requests not to elect redemption, you may request that the Company instruct the Transfer Agent to return the shares (physically or electronically). You may make such request by contacting the Transfer Agent at the phone number or address listed at the end of this section. We will be required to honor such request only if made prior to the deadline for exercising redemption requests.\n\n13  \n---  \n  \nNo request for redemption will be honored unless the holder’s shares have been delivered (either physically or electronically) to the Transfer Agent by 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 6, 2024 (two business days prior to the initially scheduled date of the Stockholder Meeting).\n\nIf a holder of Public Stock properly makes a request for redemption and the Public Stock is delivered as described above, we will redeem such holder’s Public Stock for a pro rata portion of funds deposited in the Trust Account, calculated as of two business days prior to the Stockholder Meeting. If you are a holder of Public Stock and you exercise your redemption rights, it will not result in the loss of any Public Warrants or Rights that you may hold.\n\nIf the Stockholder Meeting is abandoned for any reason, then holders of Public Stock shall not have the right to redeem their Public Stock at this time.\n\n**Q:** | **What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of exercising my redemption rights?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | The U.S. federal income tax consequences of exercising your redemption rights will depend on your particular facts and circumstances. Accordingly, you are urged to consult your tax advisor to determine your tax consequences from the exercise of your redemption rights, including the applicability and effect of U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income and other tax laws in light of your particular circumstances. For additional discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations with respect to the exercise of these redemption rights, see “ _Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for Stockholders Exercising Redemption Rights_.”  \n**Q:** | **What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials for the Stockholder Meeting?**  \n**A:** | You may receive more than one set of voting materials for the Stockholder Meeting, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a holder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive in order to cast your vote with respect to all of your shares.  \n**Q:** | **Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies for the Stockholder Meeting?**  \n**A:** | We will pay the cost of soliciting proxies for the Stockholder Meeting. We have engaged Sodali & Co (“Sodali”) to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Stockholder Meeting. We will also reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries representing beneficial owners of Common Stock for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to beneficial owners of Common Stock and in obtaining voting instructions from those owners. Our directors, officers, advisory board members and employees may also solicit proxies by telephone, by facsimile, by mail or on the Internet. They will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.  \n  \n14  \n---  \n  \n**Q:** | **Who can help answer my questions?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | If you have questions about the proposals or if you need additional copies of this proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card you should contact:  \n  \nSodali & Co\n\n333 Ludlow Street, 5th Floor, South Tower\n\nStamford, CT 06902\n\nIndividuals call toll-free (800) 662-5200\n\nBanks and brokers call (203) 658-9400\n\nEmail: WINV.info@investor.sodali.com\n\nYou also may obtain additional information about WinVest from documents filed with the SEC by following the instructions in the section titled “ _Where You Can Find More Information._ ” If you are a holder of Public Stock and you intend to seek redemption of your shares, you will need to deliver your Common Stock (either physically or electronically) to the Transfer Agent at the address below prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 6, 2024 (two business days prior to the date of the Stockholder Meeting). If you have questions regarding the certification of your position or delivery of your shares, please contact:\n\nContinental Stock Transfer & Trust Company\n\nOne State Street, 30th Floor\n\nNew York, New York 10004\n\nAttn: SPAC Redemption Team\n\nE-mail: spacredemptions@continentalstock.com\n\n15  \n---  \n  \n**RISK FACTORS**\n\n_In addition to the below risk factors, you should consider carefully all of the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024, in any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and in the other reports we file with the SEC before making a decision to invest in our securities. The risks and uncertainties described in the aforementioned filings and below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results or result in our liquidation._\n\n**_There are no assurances that the Charter Extension will enable us to complete the Business Combination._**\n\nApproving the Charter Extension involves a number of risks. Even if the Charter Extension is approved, we can provide no assurances that an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) will be consummated prior to June 17, 2025. Our ability to consummate any initial business combination is dependent on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. We are required to offer stockholders the opportunity to redeem shares in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal, and we will be required to offer stockholders redemption rights again in connection with any stockholder vote to approve an initial business combination (including the Business Combination). Even if the Charter Extension or an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) are approved by our stockholders, it is possible that redemptions will leave us with insufficient cash to consummate an initial business combination on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. The fact that we will have separate redemption periods in connection with the Charter Extension vote and the vote on an initial business combination could exacerbate these risks. Other than in connection with a redemption offer or liquidation, our stockholders may be unable to recover their investment except through sales of our Public Stock on the open market. The price of our Public Stock may be volatile, and there can be no assurance that stockholders will be able to dispose of their Public Stock at favorable prices, or at all.\n\n**_The SEC has adopted rules to regulate SPACs. Certain of the procedures that we, a potential initial business combination target (including Xtribe), or others may determine to undertake in connection with such rules may increase our costs and the time needed to complete an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete an initial business combination._**\n\nOn January 24, 2024, the SEC adopted final rules (the “SPAC Final Rules”) relating to, among other items, disclosures in SEC filings in connection with business combination transactions between SPACs such as us and private operating companies; the financial statement requirements applicable to transactions involving shell companies; the use of projections in SEC filings in connection with proposed business combination transactions; the potential liability of certain participants in proposed business combination transactions; and the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act. The SPAC Final Rules became effective on July 1, 2024. Certain of the procedures that we, a potential initial business combination target (including Xtribe), or others may determine to undertake in connection with the SPAC Final Rules, or pursuant to the SEC’s views expressed in the SPAC Final Rules, may increase the costs of negotiating and completing an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) and the time required to consummate a transaction, and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete an initial business combination.\n\n**_If we were deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we would be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities would be severely restricted. As a result, in such circumstances, unless we are able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we would expect to abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead to liquidate the Company._**\n\nIn the adopting release for the SPAC Final Rules, the SEC provided guidance that a SPAC’s potential status as an “investment company” depends on a variety of factors, such as a SPAC’s duration, asset composition, business purpose and activities, and “is a question of facts and circumstances” requiring individualized analysis. If we were deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities would be severely restricted. In addition, we would be subject to burdensome compliance requirements. Although we do not believe that our principal activities will subject us to regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, if we are deemed to be an investment company and subject to compliance with and regulation under the Investment Company Act, we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and expenses for which we have not allotted funds. As a result, unless we were able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we would expect to abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead to liquidate the Company.\n\n16  \n---  \n  \n**_We have in the past instructed the Trustee to liquidate the securities held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in cash, and we could do so again in the future. As a result of any such liquidation, we may receive less interest, if any, on the funds held in the Trust Account, which would reduce the dollar amount our public stockholders would receive upon any Redemption or the liquidation of the Company._**\n\nThe funds in the Trust Account have, since our IPO, been held only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. government treasury obligations and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act or in cash. To mitigate the risk of us being deemed to be an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act) and thus subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, prior to the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement pursuant to which the Company registered its securities offered in the IPO (the “IPO Registration Statement”), we instructed the Trustee to liquidate the U.S. government treasury obligations or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter to maintain all funds in the Trust Account in cash in an interest-bearing bank account. Although we subsequently reinvested such funds in marketable securities, we could instruct the Trustee to liquidate the securities held in the Trust Account again in the future. As a result of any such liquidation, we may receive less interest, if any, on the funds held in the Trust Account than if the assets in the Trust Account had remained in U.S. government securities or money market funds. However, interest previously earned on the funds held in the Trust Account still may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any, and certain other expenses as permitted. As a result, our liquidation of the securities held in the Trust Account and the holding of all funds in the Trust Account in cash could reduce the dollar amount our public stockholders would receive upon any Redemption or the liquidation of the Company.\n\n**_The Excise Tax included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 may decrease the value of our securities following an initial business combination, hinder our ability to consummate an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) and decrease the amount of funds available for distribution in connection with a liquidation._**\n\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, imposes a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased by “covered corporations” beginning on January 1, 2023, with certain exceptions. The Excise Tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which the stock is repurchased. The amount of the Excise Tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the Excise Tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury Department”) has authority to promulgate regulations and provide other guidance regarding the Excise Tax. In December 2022, the Treasury Department issued Notice 2023-2, indicating its intention to propose such regulations and issuing certain interim rules on which taxpayers may rely. Under the interim rules, liquidating distributions made by publicly traded domestic corporations are exempt from the Excise Tax. In addition, any redemptions that occur in the same taxable year in which a liquidation is completed will also be exempt from such tax. Redemptions of our Public Stock in connection with an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation or in connection with an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) may subject us to the Excise Tax unless one of the two exceptions above apply.\n\nAs described under “ _Proposal No. 1 — The Extension Amendment Proposal_ ,” if the Current Termination Date is extended, our public stockholders will have the right to require us to redeem their Public Stock. Any Redemption or other repurchase that we make may be subject to the Excise Tax to the extent we do not liquidate by December 31, 2024. Whether and to what extent we would be subject to the Excise Tax would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the Redemptions and repurchases in connection with our initial business combination, (ii) the structure of our initial business combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any “PIPE” or other equity issuances in connection with our initial business combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with our initial business combination but issued within the same taxable year of our initial business combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury. In addition, because the Excise Tax would be payable by us, and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the Excise Tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available to complete a business combination, and could have an adverse effect on our ability to complete an initial business combination, including the Business Combination.\n\n17  \n---  \n  \n**_We are required by the Nasdaq Listing Rules to consummate an initial business combination within 36 months of the effectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement. As a result of our failure to consummate an initial business combination within this time period, our securities could be subject to delisting._**\n\nPursuant to IM-5101-2(b) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we must consummate an initial business combination by the Nasdaq Deadline. We did not complete an initial business combination prior to the Nasdaq Deadline. As a result, we are in violation of Nasdaq IM-5101-2.\n\nAs previously reported, on September 17, 2024, we received the Notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that we had failed to comply with Nasdaq Listing Rules IM-5101-2. On September 24, 2024, we timely requested a hearing before the Panel to appeal the Notice and to request the Nasdaq Extension in order to close the Business Combination, which request stayed the suspension of trading on our securities. Our hearing before the Panel was held on November 12, 2024. Our securities will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market until the hearing process concludes and the Panel issues a written decision. However, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant our request for a suspension of delisting or continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. If the Panel does not grant our request, our securities will be delisted from Nasdaq. Additionally, even if the Panel grants our request, the proposed extension of the Termination Date to June 17, 2025 would exceed the Nasdaq Extension. As a result, if the Nasdaq Extension is granted and the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved but we do not complete an initial business combination prior to the expiration of the Nasdaq Extension, Nasdaq may issue a Staff Delisting Determination under Rule 5810 to delist our securities. If Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\n● | the price of our securities will likely decrease as a result of the loss of market efficiencies associated with being listed on Nasdaq;  \n---|---  \n● | holders may be unable to sell or purchase our securities when they wish to do so;  \n● | we may become subject to shareholder litigation;  \n● | we may lose the interest of institutional investors in our securities;  \n● | we may lose media and analyst coverage; and  \n● | we would likely lose any active trading market for our securities, as our securities may then only be traded on one of the over-the-counter markets, if at all.  \n  \n**_Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange following redemptions by our stockholders in connection with approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions._**\n\nOur Common Stock, Units, Warrants and Rights are listed on Nasdaq. After the Stockholder Meeting, we may be required to demonstrate compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements in order to maintain the listing of our securities on Nasdaq. Such continued listing requirements for our Common Stock include, among other things, the requirement to maintain at least 300 public holders, at least 500,000 publicly held shares and a market value of publicly held shares of $1.0 million. Pursuant to the terms of our Certificate of Incorporation, in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal, stockholders may elect to redeem their Public Stock and, as a result, we may not be in compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements.\n\nIf our securities do not meet Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements, Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange. If Nasdaq delists any of our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list such securities on another approved national securities exchange, we expect that such securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: (i) a limited availability of market quotations for our securities, (ii) reduced liquidity for our securities, (iii) a determination that our Public Stock is a “penny stock,” which will require brokers trading in our Public Stock to adhere to more stringent rules, including being subject to the depository requirements of Rule 419 of the Securities Act, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities, (iv) a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company, (v) a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future, and (vi) being a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business in connection with a business combination (including the Business Combination). The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as “covered securities.” Our Common Stock, Units, Warrants and Rights qualify as covered securities under such statute. If we were no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities would not qualify as covered securities under such statute and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\n\n18  \n---  \n  \n**SPECIAL MEETING OF WINVEST STOCKHOLDERS**\n\nThis proxy statement is being provided to WinVest stockholders as part of a solicitation of proxies by the Board for use at the special meeting of WinVest stockholders to be held on December 10, 2024, and at any adjournment thereof.

A copy of the proposed amendment is set forth in _Annex A_ to this proxy statement; and  \n---|---  \n  \n19  \n---  \n  \n2. | _Proposal No. 2 — Trust Amendment Proposal —_ To amend the Trust Agreement to extend the Liquidation Date from December 17, 2024 to January 17, 2025, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to further extend the Liquidation Date on a monthly basis for up to five times from January 17, 2025 to June 17, 2025. A copy of the proposed amendment is set forth in _Annex B_ to the accompanying proxy statement; and  \n---|---  \n3. | _Proposal No. 3 — Adjournment Proposal —_ To adjourn the Stockholder Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies if, based upon the tabulated vote at the time of the Stockholder Meeting, there are insufficient shares of Common Stock represented (either in person (including virtually) or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the Stockholder Meeting or at the time of the Stockholder Meeting to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal.  \n  \nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved and the Company determines to effect the Charter Extension, prior to filing the Extension Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State to effectuate the Charter Extension and entering into the Trust Amendment with Continental, the Lender shall lend the Company the Monthly Extension Payment, which the Company shall deposit into the Trust Account, upon the Company’s first drawdown of the Note. In addition, if the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved and the Charter Extension becomes effective, in the event that we have not consummated an initial business combination by January 17, 2025, without approval of our public stockholders, we may, by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, extend the Termination Date up to five times, each by one additional month (or such shorter period as the Sponsor shall request) (for a total of up to six additional months to complete an initial business combination), provided that we draw down and deposit into the Trust Account, for each such extension, the Monthly Extension Payment under the Note, for an additional aggregate deposit of up to $150,000. If we complete an initial business combination, we will repay the amounts loaned under the Note. If we do not complete an initial business combination by the applicable Termination Date, such Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. If the Sponsor designates a third party as Lender, we may negotiate with the Lender and vary the terms of the Note, issue securities and pay certain fees to the Lender in connection with the Note.\n\n**Voting Power; Record Date**\n\nAs a stockholder of the Company, you have a right to vote on certain matters affecting the Company. The proposals that will be presented at the Stockholder Meeting and upon which you are being asked to vote are summarized above and fully set forth in this proxy statement. You will be entitled to vote or direct votes to be cast at the Stockholder Meeting if you owned Common Stock at the close of business on November 5, 2024, which is the Record Date for the Stockholder Meeting. You are entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock that you owned as of the close of business on the Record Date. If your shares are held in “street name” or are in a margin or similar account, you should contact your broker, bank or other nominee to ensure that votes related to the shares you beneficially own are properly counted. On the Record Date, there were 3,367,333 issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, of which 492,333 shares are Public Stock held by public stockholders and 2,875,000 shares are Founder Shares held by the Initial Stockholders.\n\n**Recommendation of the Board**\n\n**THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS**\n\n**THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” EACH OF THE PROPOSALS**\n\n**Quorum**\n\nThe presence, in person (including virtually) or by proxy, of stockholders holding a majority of the Common Stock entitled to vote at the Stockholder Meeting constitutes a quorum at the Stockholder Meeting. Abstentions will be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum. The Initial Stockholders, who own approximately 85.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the Record Date, will count towards this quorum. As a result, as of the Record Date, no shares of Common Stock held by public stockholders would be required to be present at the Stockholder Meeting to achieve a quorum.\n\n20  \n---  \n  \n**Abstentions**\n\nAbstentions will be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum but will not constitute votes cast at the Stockholder Meeting and therefore will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal and no effect on the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.\n\n**Broker Non-Votes**\n\nUnder the New York Stock Exchange rules, if a stockholder holds their shares in “street” name through a bank, broker or other nominee and the stockholder does not instruct their broker, bank or other nominee how to vote their shares on a proposal, the broker, bank or other nominee has the authority to vote the shares in its discretion on certain “routine” matters. However, banks, brokers and other nominees are not authorized to exercise their voting discretion on any “non-routine” matters. This can result in a “broker non-vote,” which occurs on a proposal when (i) a bank, broker or other nominee has discretionary authority to vote on one or more “routine” proposals to be voted on at a meeting of stockholders, (ii) there are one or more “non-routine” proposals to be voted on at the meeting for which the bank, broker or other nominee does not have authority to vote without instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and (iii) the beneficial owner fails to provide the bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions on a “non-routine” matter.\n\nThe Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal are “non-routine” matters and therefore, brokers are not permitted to exercise their voting discretion with respect to these proposals. As a result, if you hold your shares in street name, your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee cannot vote your shares on any of these proposals at the Stockholder Meeting without your instruction.\n\n**Vote Required for Approval**\n\nApproval of each of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock.\n\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock who are present in person (including virtually) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the Stockholder Meeting.\n\nThe Initial Stockholders intend to vote all of their Common Stock in favor of the proposals being presented at the Stockholder Meeting. As of the date of this proxy statement, the Initial Stockholders own, in aggregate, 85.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock.\n\nThe following table reflects the number of additional shares of Public Stock required to approve each proposal:\n\n**Number of Additional Shares of** **Public Stock Required To Approve** **Proposal**  \n---  \nProposal | Approval Standard | **If Only** **Quorum is** **Present and All** **Present Shares** **Cast Votes** | **If All Shares Are** **Present and All** **Present Shares** **Cast Votes**  \nExtension Amendment Proposal | Majority of Issued and Outstanding Shares of Common Stock | 0 | 0  \nTrust Amendment Proposal | Majority of Issued and Outstanding Shares of Common Stock | 0 | 0  \nAdjournment Proposal | Majority of Voted Stock | 0 | 0  \n  \n21  \n---  \n  \n**Voting Your Shares**\n\nIf you were a holder of record of Common Stock as of the close of business on the Record Date for the Stockholder Meeting, you may vote with respect to the proposals electronically, or by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided. Your proxy card shows the number of shares of Common Stock that you own. If your shares are held in “street name” or are in a margin or similar account, you should contact your broker to ensure that votes related to the shares you beneficially own are properly counted.\n\nThere are two ways to vote your Common Stock at the Stockholder Meeting:\n\n**Voting by Mail**. By signing the proxy card and returning it in the enclosed prepaid and addressed envelope, you are authorizing the individuals named on the proxy card to vote your shares at the Stockholder Meeting in the manner you indicate. You are encouraged to sign and return the proxy card even if you plan to attend the Stockholder Meeting so that your shares will be voted if you are unable to attend the Stockholder Meeting. If you receive more than one proxy card, it is an indication that your shares are held in multiple accounts. Please sign and return all proxy cards to ensure that all of your shares are voted. Votes submitted by mail must be received by 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 9, 2024.\n\n**Voting Electronically**. You may virtually attend, vote and examine the list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Stockholder Meeting by visiting https://www.cstproxy.com/winvestacquisition/ext2024 and entering the control number found on your proxy card, voting instruction form or notice included in the proxy materials.\n\n**Revoking Your Proxy**\n\nIf you give a proxy, you may revoke it at any time before the Stockholder Meeting or at the Stockholder Meeting by doing any one of the following:\n\n● | you may send another proxy card with a later date;  \n---|---  \n● | you may notify our Chief Executive Officer in writing at WinVest Acquisition Corp., 125 Cambridgepark Drive, Suite 301, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02140, before the Stockholder Meeting that you have revoked your proxy; or  \n● | you may attend the virtual Stockholder Meeting, revoke your proxy, and vote electronically, as indicated above.  \n  \n**No Additional Matters**\n\nThe Stockholder Meeting has been called only to consider and vote on the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Under our Bylaws, other than procedural matters incident to the conduct of the Stockholder Meeting, no other matters may be considered at the Stockholder Meeting if they are not included in this proxy statement, which serves as the notice of the Stockholder Meeting.\n\n**Who Can Answer Your Questions about Voting**\n\nIf you are a WinVest stockholder and have any questions about how to vote or direct a vote in respect of your Common Stock, you may call Sodali, our proxy solicitor, by calling (800) 662-5200 (toll-free), or (203) 658-9400 (for banks and brokers), or by emailing WINV.info@investor.sodali.com.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \n**Redemption Rights**\n\nPursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, holders of Public Stock may seek to redeem their shares for cash, regardless of whether they vote for or against, or whether they abstain from voting on, the Extension Amendment Proposal. In connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal and contingent upon the effectiveness of the implementation of the Charter Extension, any stockholder holding shares of Public Stock may demand that we redeem such shares for a full pro rata portion of the Trust Account (which, for illustrative purposes, was $11.90 per share as of November 20, 2024), calculated as of two business days prior to the Stockholder Meeting. If a holder properly seeks redemption as described in this section, we will redeem these shares for a pro rata portion of funds deposited in the Trust Account and the holder will no longer own these shares following the Stockholder Meeting.\n\nAs a holder of Public Stock, you will be entitled to receive cash for any Public Stock to be redeemed only if you:\n\n(i) | (a) hold Public Stock or (b) hold Public Stock through Units and elect to separate your Units into the underlying Public Stock, Rights and Public Warrants prior to exercising your redemption rights with respect to the Public Stock;  \n---|---  \n(ii) | submit a written request to the Transfer Agent, in which you (a) request that the Company redeem all or a portion of your Public Stock for cash, and (b) identify yourself as the beneficial holder of the Public Stock and provide your legal name, phone number and address; and   \n(iii) | deliver your Public Stock to the Transfer Agent, physically or electronically through DTC.  \n  \n**Holders must complete the procedures for electing to redeem their Public Stock in the manner described above prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 6, 2024 (two business days prior to the initially scheduled Stockholder Meeting) (the “Redemption Deadline”) in order for their shares to be redeemed.**\n\nThe redemption rights include the requirement that a holder must identify itself in writing as a beneficial holder and provide its legal name, phone number and address to Continental in order to validly redeem its shares.\n\nIf you hold your shares in “street name,” you will have to coordinate with your broker to have your shares certificated or delivered electronically. Shares of WinVest that have not been tendered (either physically or electronically) in accordance with these procedures will not be redeemed for cash. There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through DTC’s DWAC system. The Transfer Agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming stockholder.\n\nAny request for redemption, once made by a holder of Public Stock, may not be withdrawn following the Redemption Deadline, unless approved by the Board. Any corrected or changed written exercise of redemption rights must be received by the Transfer Agent, by the Redemption Deadline.\n\nThe closing price of our Public Stock on November 20, 2024, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement, was $11.81 per share. The cash held in the Trust Account on such date was approximately $5,860,988.17 (including interest not previously released to the Company to pay its income or other tax obligations) ($11.90 per share of Public Stock). Prior to exercising redemption rights, stockholders should verify the market price of our Public Stock, as they may receive higher proceeds from the sale of their Public Stock in the public market than from exercising their redemption rights if the market price per share is higher than the redemption price. We cannot assure you that you will be able to sell your Public Stock in the open market, even if the market price per share is lower than the redemption price stated above, as there may not be sufficient liquidity in our securities when you wish to sell your shares.\n\nIf a holder of Public Stock exercises his, her or its redemption rights, then he, she or it will be exchanging its Public Stock for cash and will no longer own those shares. You will be entitled to receive cash for these shares only if you properly demand redemption by delivering your share certificate (either physically or electronically) to the Transfer Agent two business days prior to the vote at the Stockholder Meeting.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \nFor a discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations for stockholders with respect to the exercise of these redemption rights, see “ _Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for Stockholders Exercising Redemption Rights_.” The consequences of a redemption to any particular stockholder will depend on that stockholder’s particular facts and circumstances. Accordingly, you are urged to consult your tax advisor to determine your tax consequences from the exercise of your redemption rights, including the applicability and effect of U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income and other tax laws in light of your particular circumstances.\n\n**Appraisal Rights**\n\nThere are no appraisal rights available to our stockholders in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal.\n\n**Proxy Solicitation Costs**\n\nWe are soliciting proxies on behalf of the Board. This proxy solicitation is being made by mail, but also may be made by telephone or in person. We have engaged Sodali to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Stockholder Meeting. The Company and its directors, officers and advisory board members may also solicit proxies in person. We will ask banks, brokers and other institutions, nominees and fiduciaries to forward this proxy statement and the related proxy materials to their principals and to obtain their authority to execute proxies and voting instructions.\n\nThe Company will bear the entire cost of the proxy solicitation, including the preparation, assembly, printing, mailing and distribution of this proxy statement and the related proxy materials. We will pay Sodali a fee of $10,000, plus disbursements, reimburse Sodali for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and indemnify Sodali and its affiliates against certain claims, liabilities, losses, damages and expenses for its services as our proxy solicitor. We will reimburse brokerage firms and other custodians for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding this proxy statement and the related proxy materials to our stockholders. Directors, officers and advisory board members of the Company who solicit proxies will not be paid any additional compensation for soliciting.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \n**PROPOSAL NO. 1 — THE EXTENSION AMENDMENT PROPOSAL**\n\n**Overview**\n\nWinVest is proposing to amend its Certificate of Incorporation to extend the date by which it has to consummate an initial business combination to the Charter Extension Date so as to give it additional time to complete the Business Combination.\n\nWithout the Charter Extension, we do not believe the Company will be able to complete an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) on or before the Current Termination Date. If that were to occur, the Company would be forced to liquidate.\n\nAs contemplated by the Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of Public Stock may elect to redeem all or a portion of their Public Stock in exchange for their pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account if the Charter Extension is implemented.\n\nOn November 20, 2024, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement, the redemption price per share was approximately $11.90 (which is expected to be the same approximate amount two business days prior to the Stockholder Meeting), based on the aggregate amount on deposit in the Trust Account of approximately $5,860,988.17 as of November 20, 2024 (including interest not previously released to the Company to pay its income or other tax obligations), divided by the total number of then-outstanding shares of Public Stock. The redemption price per share will increase between November 20, 2024 and the date that is two business days prior to the Stockholder Meeting due to any interest that accrues on the amount on deposit in the Trust Account prior to such date (less any amounts released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations between such dates). The closing price of the Public Stock as reported on Nasdaq on November 20, 2024 was $11.81. Accordingly, if the market price of the Common Stock were to remain the same until the date of the Stockholder Meeting, exercising redemption rights would result in a public stockholder receiving approximately $0.09 more per share than if the shares were sold in the open market (based on the current per share redemption price and the closing price of our Public Stock as reported on Nasdaq on November 20, 2024). We cannot assure you that you will be able to sell your Common Stock in the open market, even if the market price per share is lower than the redemption price stated above, as there may not be sufficient liquidity in our securities when you wish to sell your shares. We believe that such redemption right enables our public stockholders to determine whether or not to sustain their investments for an additional period if we do not complete the Business Combination on or before the Current Termination Date.\n\n**Reasons for the Extension Amendment Proposal**\n\nOur Certificate of Incorporation currently provides that we have until December 17, 2024 to complete an initial business combination. The Company and its officers and directors agreed that they would not seek to amend the Certificate of Incorporation to allow for a longer period of time to complete an initial business combination unless the Company provided holders of its Public Stock with the right to seek redemption of their Public Stock in connection therewith. The Board believes that it is in the best interests of our stockholders that the Charter Extension be obtained so that we will have a limited additional amount of time to consummate the Business Combination. Without the Charter Extension, we believe we will not be able to complete an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) on or before December 17, 2024. If that were to occur, we would be forced to liquidate. We believe that given the Company’s expenditure of time, effort and money on pursuing the Business Combination, circumstances warrant providing our public stockholders an opportunity to consider the Business Combination.\n\nThe Extension Amendment Proposal is essential to allowing the Company additional time to consummate the Business Combination. Approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal is a condition to the implementation of the Charter Extension.\n\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved and the Company determines to effect the Charter Extension, prior to filing the Extension Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State to effectuate the Charter Extension, the Lender shall lend the Company the Monthly Extension Payment, which the Company shall deposit into the Trust Account, upon the Company’s first drawdown of the Note.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \nIn addition, if the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved and the Charter Extension becomes effective, in the event we have not consummated an initial business combination by January 17, 2025, without approval of our public stockholders, we may, by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, extend the Termination Date up to five times, each by one additional month (or such shorter period as the Sponsor shall request) (for a total of up to six additional months to complete an initial business combination), provided that we draw down and deposit into the Trust Account, for each such extension, the Monthly Extension Payment, for an additional aggregate deposit of up to $150,000. If we complete an initial business combination, we will repay the amounts loaned under the Note. If we do not complete an initial business combination by the applicable Termination Date, such Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. If the Sponsor designates a third party as Lender, we may negotiate with the Lender and vary the terms of the Note, issue securities and pay certain fees to the Lender in connection with the Note. For illustrative purposes, if the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved and the Charter Extension becomes effective and we take the maximum time to complete an initial business combination, the redemption price per share at the stockholder meeting to consider such initial business combination or our subsequent liquidation would be approximately $12.27 per share of Public Stock, based on the aggregate amount on deposit in the Trust Account of approximately $5,860,988.17 as of November 20, 2024, and an aggregate of $180,000 to be drawn down under the Note and deposited in the Trust Account, divided by the total number of then-outstanding shares of Public Stock (assuming no Public Stock is redeemed in connection with the Stockholder Meeting, and not giving effect to the accrual of any further interest or any interest to be released to the Company to pay its income or other tax obligations), in comparison to the redemption price as of November 20, 2024 of approximately $11.90 per share.\n\n**If the Extension Amendment Proposal is Not Approved**\n\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal is not approved and the Business Combination is not completed on or before the Current Termination Date, then, as contemplated by and in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter redeem 100% of the Public Stock for cash for a redemption price per share as described below (which redemption will completely extinguish such holders’ rights as stockholders, including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to approval of our then-stockholders and subject to the requirements of the DGCL, including the adoption of a resolution by the Board pursuant to Section 275(a) of the DGCL finding the dissolution of the Company advisable and the provision of such notices as are required by said Section 275(a) of the DGCL, dissolve and liquidate the balance of the Company’s net assets to its remaining stockholders, as part of the Company’s plan of dissolution and liquidation, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to the Company’s obligations under the DGCL to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law. In such event, the per share redemption price shall be equal to a pro rata share of the Trust Account plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company or necessary to pay its taxes (less up to $100,000 of such interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the total number of shares of Public Stock then outstanding. There will be no distribution from the Trust Account with respect to our Warrants or Rights, which may both expire worthless in the event the Company dissolves and liquidates the Trust Account. If we liquidate, our public stockholders may only receive $11.90 per share. This will also cause you to lose any potential investment opportunity in a target company (including Xtribe) and the chance of realizing future gains on your investment through any price appreciation in the combined company.\n\nThe Initial Stockholders have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to the 2,875,000 Founder Shares held by them.\n\n**If the Extension Amendment Proposal is Approved**\n\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved, assuming the Trust Amendment Proposal is also approved, the Company will make all filings required to be made with the Delaware Secretary of State in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal to extend the time it has to complete an initial business combination until the Charter Extension Date. We will then continue to attempt to consummate the Business Combination until the Charter Extension Date (or Additional Charter Extension Date, if applicable). WinVest will remain a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and its Common Stock, Rights and Public Warrants will remain publicly traded during this time.\n\n26  \n---  \n  \n**Interests of the Initial Stockholders**\n\nWhen considering the recommendation of the Board, you should be aware that aside from their interests as direct or indirect stockholders, the Initial Stockholders (including the Sponsor and our directors and officers) have interests that are different from, or in addition to, those of other stockholders generally. The Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in recommending to stockholders that they approve the Extension Amendment Proposal. You should take these interests into account in deciding whether to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal:\n\n● | the fact that the Sponsor paid $5,450,000 for 10,900,000 Private Placement Warrants, each of which is identical to the Public Warrants issued as part of the Units and entitles the holder thereof to purchase one-half (1/2) of a share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share. If the Extension Amendment Proposal is not approved and the Company does not consummate an initial business combination by December 17, 2024, then a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants will be part of the liquidating distribution to the public stockholders and the Private Placement Warrants held by our Sponsor will be worthless;  \n---|---  \n● | the fact that the Initial Stockholders have invested in the Company an aggregate of $5,475,000, comprised of the $25,000 purchase price for 2,875,000 Founder Shares and the $5,450,000 purchase price for 10,900,000 Private Placement Warrants. Assuming a trading price of $11.81 per share of Common Stock and $0.0136 per Public Warrant (based upon the respective closing prices of the Common Stock and the Public Warrants on Nasdaq on November 20, 2024, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement), the 2,875,000 Founder Shares and 10,900,000 Private Placement Warrants would have an implied aggregate market value of $34,101,990. Even if the trading price of the shares of Common Stock was as low as $1.90 per share, the aggregate market value of the Founder Shares alone (without taking into account the value of the Private Placement Warrants) would be approximately equal to the initial investment in the Company by the Initial Stockholders. As a result, if an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) is completed, the Initial Stockholders are likely to be able to make a substantial profit on their investment in the Company at a time when the Common Stock has lost significant value. On the other hand, if the Extension Amendment Proposal is not approved and the Company liquidates without completing an initial business combination before December 17, 2024, the Initial Stockholders will lose their entire investment in the Company;  \n● | the fact that the Company has issued unsecured promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,950,000 to the Sponsor, which notes will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any, in the event we do not consummate an initial business combination;  \n● | the fact that the Initial Stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares held by them if the Extension Amendment Proposal is not approved and we fail to complete an initial business combination by December 17, 2024;  \n---|---  \n● | the fact that certain of our Initial Stockholders may serve as directors or officers of any acquired business after the consummation of an initial business combination, and as such, would be entitled to receive any cash fees, stock options or stock awards that a post-business combination board of directors determines to pay to its directors and officers. For example, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, if the Business Combination is consummated, the Sponsor will be entitled to name two directors of the combined company;   \n● | the indemnification of our existing officers and directors and the liability insurance maintained by the Company;  \n---|---  \n● | the fact that the Initial Stockholders will lose their entire investment in the Company and will not be reimbursed for any loans extended, fees due or out-of-pocket expenses if the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are not approved and an initial business combination is not consummated by December 17, 2024; and  \n---|---  \n  \n27  \n---  \n  \n● | the fact that the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) $10.10 per share of Public Stock or (ii) such lesser amount per share of Public Stock held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the Trust Account assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account or any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Redemption Rights**\n\nPursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, holders of Public Stock may seek to redeem their shares for cash, regardless of whether they vote for or against, or whether they abstain from voting on, the Extension Amendment Proposal. In connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal and contingent upon the effectiveness of the implementation of the Charter Extension, any stockholder holding shares of Public Stock may demand that the Company redeem such shares for a full pro rata portion of the Trust Account (which, for illustrative purposes, was approximately $11.90 per share as of November 20, 2024), calculated as of two business days prior to the Stockholder Meeting. If a holder properly seeks redemption as described in this section, we will redeem these shares for a pro rata portion of funds deposited in the Trust Account and the holder will no longer own these shares following the Stockholder Meeting.\n\nAs a holder of Public Stock, you will be entitled to receive cash for any Public Stock to be redeemed only if you:\n\n(i) | (a) hold Public Stock or (b) hold Public Stock through Units and elect to separate your Units into the underlying Public Stock, Rights and Public Warrants prior to exercising your redemption rights with respect to the Public Stock;  \n---|---  \n(ii) | submit a written request to the Transfer Agent, in which you (a) request that we redeem all or a portion of your Public Stock for cash, and (b) identify yourself as the beneficial holder of the Public Stock and provide your legal name, phone number and address; and  \n(iii) | deliver your Public Stock to the Transfer Agent, physically or electronically through DTC.  \n  \n**Holders must complete the procedures for electing to redeem their Public Stock in the manner described above prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 6, 2024 (two business days prior to the initially scheduled Stockholder Meeting) in order for their shares to be redeemed.**\n\nThe redemption rights include the requirement that a holder must identify itself in writing as a beneficial holder and provide its legal name, phone number and address to Continental in order to validly redeem its shares.\n\nIf you hold the shares in “street name,” you will have to coordinate with your broker to have your shares certificated or delivered electronically. Shares of the Company that have not been tendered (either physically or electronically) in accordance with these procedures will not be redeemed for cash. There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through DTC’s DWAC system. The Transfer Agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming stockholder.\n\nAny request for redemption, once made by a holder of Public Stock, may not be withdrawn following the Redemption Deadline, unless approved by the Board. Any corrected or changed written exercise of redemption rights must be received by the Transfer Agent by the Redemption Deadline.\n\n28  \n---  \n  \nThe closing price of the Public Stock on November 20, 2024, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement, was $11.81 per share. The cash held in the Trust Account on November 20, 2024 was approximately $5,860,988.17 (including interest not previously released to the Company to pay its income or other tax obligations) ($11.90 per share of Public Stock). Prior to exercising redemption rights, stockholders should verify the market price of the Public Stock, as they may receive higher proceeds from the sale of their Public Stock in the public market than from exercising their redemption rights if the market price per share is higher than the redemption price. We cannot assure you that you will be able to sell your Public Stock in the open market, even if the market price per share is lower than the redemption price stated above, as there may not be sufficient liquidity in our securities when its stockholders wish to sell their shares.\n\nIf a holder of Public Stock exercises his, her or its redemption rights, then he, she or it will be exchanging its Public Stock for cash and will no longer own those shares. You will be entitled to receive cash for these shares only if you properly demand redemption by delivering your share certificate (either physically or electronically) to the Transfer Agent two business days prior to the vote at the Stockholder Meeting.\n\n**Vote Required for Approval**\n\nThe approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. Abstentions will be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum but will not constitute votes cast at the Stockholder Meeting and therefore will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Extension Amendment Proposal.\n\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, the Initial Stockholders intend to vote any shares of Common Stock owned by them in favor of the Extension Amendment Proposal. As of the date hereof, the Initial Stockholders own an aggregate of 85.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. As a result, approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal will not require the affirmative vote of any shares of Public Stock.\n\n**Recommendation of the Board**\n\n**THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE**\n\n**EXTENSION AMENDMENT PROPOSAL.**\n\n29  \n---  \n  \n**PROPOSAL NO. 2 — THE TRUST AMENDMENT PROPOSAL**\n\n**Overview**\n\nWe entered into the Trust Agreement in connection with the IPO and a potential initial business combination. The Trust Amendment would amend the Trust Agreement to authorize the Charter Extension as contemplated by the Extension Amendment Proposal.\n\n**Reasons for the Proposal**\n\nThe purpose of the Trust Amendment Proposal is to authorize the Charter Extension under the Trust Agreement, as the Charter Extension is not contemplated under the Trust Agreement’s current terms and such an amendment to the Trust Agreement requires the approval of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock. We believe that given the Company’s expenditure of time, effort and money on pursuing the Business Combination, circumstances warrant providing our public stockholders an opportunity to consider the Business Combination. For the Company to implement the Charter Extension, the Trust Agreement must be amended to authorize the Charter Extension.\n\n**If the Trust Amendment Proposal is Not Approved**\n\nIf the Trust Amendment Proposal is not approved, the Charter Extension cannot be effected. If the Charter Extension is not effected and we do not complete an initial business combination on or before the Current Termination Date, then, as contemplated by and in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter redeem 100% of the Public Stock for cash for a redemption price per share as described below (which redemption will completely extinguish such holders’ rights as stockholders, including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to approval of our then-stockholders and subject to the requirements of the DGCL, including the adoption of a resolution by the Board pursuant to Section 275(a) of the DGCL finding the dissolution of the Company advisable and the provision of such notices as are required by said Section 275(a) of the DGCL, dissolve and liquidate the balance of the Company’s net assets to its remaining stockholders, as part of the Company’s plan of dissolution and liquidation, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to the Company’s obligations under the DGCL to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law. In such event, the per share redemption price shall be equal to a pro rata share of the Trust Account plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company or necessary to pay its taxes (less up to $100,000 of such interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the total number of shares of Public Stock then outstanding. There will be no distribution from the Trust Account with respect to our Warrants or Rights, which may both expire worthless in the event the Company dissolves and liquidates the Trust Account.\n\n**If the Trust Amendment Proposal is Approved**\n\nIf the Trust Amendment Proposal is approved, assuming the Extension Amendment Proposal is also approved, the Company shall enter into the Trust Amendment with the Trustee to extend the Liquidation Date. We will then continue to attempt to consummate the Business Combination until the Charter Extension Date (or Additional Charter Extension Date, if applicable). WinVest will remain a reporting company under the Exchange Act and its Common Stock, Rights and Public Warrants will remain publicly traded during this time.\n\n**Interests of the Initial Stockholders**\n\nThe existence of financial and personal interests of our Initial Stockholders (including our Sponsor and our directors and officers) may result in a conflict of interest on the part of one or more of the Initial Stockholders between what he, she or it may believe is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and what he, she or it may believe is best for himself, herself or itself in determining to recommend that stockholders vote for the proposals. See the section entitled _Proposal No. 1 — The Extension Amendment Proposal — Interests of the Initial Stockholders_ ” for a further discussion.\n\n**Vote Required for Approval**\n\nThe approval of the Trust Amendment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. Abstentions will be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum but will not constitute votes cast at the Stockholder Meeting and therefore will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Trust Amendment Proposal.\n\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, the Initial Stockholders intend to vote all shares Common Stock owned by them in favor of the Trust Amendment Proposal. As of the date hereof, the Initial Stockholders own an aggregate of 85.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. As a result, approval of the Trust Amendment Proposal will not require the affirmative vote of any shares of Public Stock.\n\n**Recommendation of the Board**\n\n**THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE**\n\n**TRUST AMENDMENT PROPOSAL.**\n\n30  \n---  \n  \n**PROPOSAL NO. 3 — THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL**\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe Adjournment Proposal asks stockholders to approve the adjournment of the Stockholder Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies if, based upon the tabulated vote at the time of the Stockholder Meeting, there are insufficient shares of Common Stock represented (either in person (including virtually) or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the Stockholder Meeting or to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal.\n\n**If the Adjournment Proposal is Not Approved**\n\nIf the Adjournment Proposal is not approved by our stockholders, the Board may not be able to adjourn the Stockholder Meeting to a later date in the event that, based on the tabulated votes, there are insufficient shares of Common Stock represented (either in person (including virtually) or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the Stockholder Meeting or at the time of the Stockholder Meeting to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal. In such events, the Charter Extension and the Trust Amendment would not be implemented.\n\n**Vote Required for Approval**\n\nThe approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock who are present in person (including virtually) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the Stockholder Meeting. Abstentions will be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum but will not constitute votes cast at the Stockholder Meeting and therefore will have no effect on the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.\n\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, the Initial Stockholders intend to vote any shares of Common Stock owned by them in favor of the Adjournment Proposal. As of the date hereof, the Initial Stockholders own an aggregate of 85.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. As a result, approval of the Adjournment Proposal will not require the affirmative vote of any shares of Public Stock.\n\n**Recommendation of the Board**\n\n**THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR”**\n\n**THE APPROVAL OF THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL.**\n\n31  \n---  \n  \n**CERTAIN MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS FOR STOCKHOLDERS EXERCISING REDEMPTION RIGHTS**\n\nThe following discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations for U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of Public Stock that elect to have their Public Stock redeemed for cash if the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved. This section applies only to investors that hold Public Stock as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular stockholder in light of its particular circumstances or status, including:\n\n● | financial institutions or financial services entities;  \n---|---  \n● | broker-dealers;  \n● | S corporations;  \n● | taxpayers that are subject to the mark-to-market accounting rules;  \n● | tax-exempt entities;  \n● | governments or agencies or instrumentalities thereof;  \n● | tax-qualified retirement plans;  \n● | insurance companies;  \n● | regulated investment companies or real estate investment trusts;  \n● | expatriates or former long-term residents or citizens of the United States;  \n● | persons that directly, indirectly, or constructively own five percent or more of our voting shares or five percent or more of the total value of all classes of our shares;  \n● | persons that acquired our securities pursuant to an exercise of employee share options, in connection with employee share incentive plans or otherwise as compensation;  \n● | persons that hold our securities as part of a straddle, constructive sale, hedging, conversion, synthetic security or other integrated or similar transaction;  \n● | persons or corporations subject to the alternative minimum tax;  \n● | U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;  \n● | controlled foreign corporations;  \n● | corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;  \n● | “qualified foreign pension funds” (within the meaning of Section 897(l)(2) of the Code) and entities whose interests are held by qualified foreign pension funds;  \n● | accrual method taxpayers that file applicable financial statements as described in Section 451(b) of the Code; or  \n● | passive foreign investment companies or their stockholders.  \n  \n32  \n---  \n  \nThis discussion is based on current U.S. federal income tax laws as in effect on the date hereof, which is subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis, which may affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences described herein. Furthermore, this discussion does not address any aspect of U.S. federal non-income tax laws, such as gift, estate or Medicare net investment income tax laws, or state, local or non-U.S. laws. We have not sought, and we do not intend to seek, a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) as to any U.S. federal income tax considerations described herein. The IRS may disagree with the discussion herein, and its determination may be upheld by a court. Moreover, there can be no assurance that future legislation, regulations, administrative rulings or court decisions will not adversely affect the accuracy of the statements in this discussion.\n\nThis discussion does not consider the U.S. federal income tax treatment of entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or other pass-through entities (including branches) for U.S. federal income tax purposes (any such entity or arrangement, a “Flow-Through Entity”) or investors that hold our Public Stock through Flow-Through Entities. If a Flow-Through Entity is the beneficial owner of our Public Stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a redemption of such Public Stock generally will depend on the status of such investor and the activities of such investor and such Flow-Through Entity.\n\nIf you hold our Public Stock through a Flow-Through Entity, we urge you to consult your tax advisor.\n\n**THE FOLLOWING IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. EACH HOLDER IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO SUCH HOLDER OF EXERCISING REDEMPTION RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.**\n\nFor purposes of this discussion, because any Unit is separable at the option of the holder, we are treating each share of Public Stock, Public Warrant and Right held by a holder in the form of a single Unit as separate instruments and assuming that the Unit itself will not be treated as an integrated instrument. Accordingly, the cancellation or separation of the Units in connection with the exercise of redemption rights generally should not be a taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This position is not free from doubt, and no assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a contrary position.\n\n**_Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations to U.S. Stockholders_**\n\nThis section is addressed to Redeeming U.S. Holders (as defined below) of Public Stock that elect to have their Public Stock redeemed for cash as described in the section titled “ _Proposal No. 1 — The Extension Amendment Proposal — Redemption Rights_.” For purposes of this discussion, a “Redeeming U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner that so redeems its shares and is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\n● | an individual citizen or resident of the United States;  \n---|---  \n● | a corporation (or other entity that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is created or organized (or treated as created or organized) in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;  \n● | an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or  \n● | any trust if (1) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more United States persons (within the meaning of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in place to be treated as a United States person.  \n  \n33  \n---  \n  \n_Tax Treatment of the Redemption — In General_\n\nThe U.S. federal income tax consequences to a Redeeming U.S. Holder of Public Stock that exercises its redemption rights to receive cash in exchange for all or a portion of its Public Stock will depend on whether the redemption qualifies as a sale of the Public Stock redeemed under Section 302 of the Code or is treated as a distribution under Section 301 of the Code. If the redemption qualifies as a sale of such Redeeming U.S. Holder’s shares, such Redeeming U.S. Holder will generally be required to recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the tax basis of the shares redeemed. Such gain or loss should be treated as capital gain or loss if such shares were held as a capital asset on the date of the redemption. Any such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Redeeming U.S. Holder’s holding period for such shares exceeds one year at the time of the redemption. A Redeeming U.S. Holder’s tax basis in such Redeeming U.S. Holder’s shares generally will equal the cost of such shares.\n\nThe redemption generally will qualify as a sale of such shares if the redemption either (i) is “substantially disproportionate” with respect to the Redeeming U.S. Holder, (ii) results in a “complete redemption” of such Redeeming U.S. Holder’s interest in the Company or (iii) is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to such Redeeming U.S. Holder. These tests are explained more fully below.\n\nFor purposes of such tests, a Redeeming U.S. Holder takes into account not only shares directly owned by such Redeeming U.S. Holder, but also shares that are constructively owned by such Redeeming U.S. Holder. A Redeeming U.S. Holder may constructively own, in addition to Public Stock owned directly, Public Stock owned by certain related individuals and entities in which such Redeeming U.S. Holder has an interest or that have an interest in such Redeeming U.S. Holder, as well as any shares such Redeeming U.S. Holder has a right to acquire by exercise of an option, which would generally include shares which could be acquired pursuant to the exercise of the Public Warrants.\n\nThe redemption generally will be “substantially disproportionate” with respect to a Redeeming U.S. Holder if the percentage of the Company’s outstanding voting shares that such Redeeming U.S. Holder directly or constructively owns immediately after the redemption is less than 80 percent of the percentage of the Company’s outstanding voting shares that such Redeeming U.S. Holder directly or constructively owned immediately before the redemption, and such Redeeming U.S. Holder immediately after the redemption actually and constructively owns less than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of the Company. There will be a complete redemption of such Redeeming U.S. Holder’s interest if either (i) all of the shares directly or constructively owned by such Redeeming U.S. Holder are redeemed or (ii) all of the shares directly owned by such Redeeming U.S. Holder are redeemed and such Redeeming U.S. Holder is eligible to waive, and effectively waives in accordance with specific rules, the attribution of the shares owned by certain family members and such Redeeming U.S. Holder does not constructively own any other shares. The redemption will not be essentially equivalent to a dividend if it results in a “meaningful reduction” of such Redeeming U.S. Holder’s proportionate interest in the Company. Whether the redemption will result in a “meaningful reduction” in such Redeeming U.S. Holder’s proportionate interest will depend on the particular facts and circumstances applicable to it. The IRS has indicated in a published ruling that even a small reduction in the proportionate interest of a small minority Stockholder in a publicly held corporation that exercises no control over corporate affairs may constitute such a “meaningful reduction.”\n\nIf none of the above tests is satisfied, the redemption will be treated as a distribution with respect to the shares under Section 302 of the Code, in which case the Redeeming U.S. Holder will be treated as receiving a corporate distribution as discussed below.\n\n_Redemption of Public Stock Treated as Corporate Distribution_\n\nIf the redemption is treated as a corporate distribution, such distribution generally will constitute a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. If the redemption is treated as a corporate distribution treated as dividend, such dividends paid to a Redeeming U.S. Holder that is a taxable corporation generally will qualify for the dividends received deduction if the requisite holding period is satisfied. With certain exceptions (including, but not limited to, dividends treated as investment income for purposes of investment interest deduction limitations), and provided certain holding period requirements are met, dividends paid to a non-corporate Redeeming U.S. Holder generally will constitute “qualified dividends” that will be subject to tax at a preferable rate. It is unclear whether the redemption rights with respect to the Public Stock described in this proxy statement will prevent a U.S. Holder from satisfying the applicable holding period requirements with respect to the dividends received deduction or the preferential tax rate on qualified dividend income, as the case may be.\n\n34  \n---  \n  \nDistributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of capital that will be applied against and reduce (but not below zero) the Redeeming U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Redeeming U.S. Holder’s Public Stock. Any remaining excess will be treated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition of such Redeeming U.S. Holder’s Public Stock as discussed below. After the application of those rules, any remaining tax basis of the Redeeming U.S. Holder in the redeemed Public Stock will be added to the Redeeming U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its remaining Public Stock, or, if it has none, to the Redeeming U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Public Warrants or possibly in other shares constructively owned by it.\n\n_Redemption of Public Stock Treated as a Sale or Other Disposition_\n\nIf the redemption qualifies as a sale or other disposition of Public Stock, a Redeeming U.S. Holder will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the amount of cash received in such redemption and (ii) the Redeeming U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Public Stock so redeemed. A Redeeming U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Public Stock generally will equal the Redeeming U.S. Holder’s acquisition cost (that is, the portion of the purchase price of a Unit allocated to a share of Public Stock or the Redeeming U.S. Holder’s initial basis for Public Stock received upon exercise of a whole Warrant) less any prior distributions treated as a return of capital. Any such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Redeeming U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Public Stock so disposed of exceeds one year. Long-term capital gain realized by a non-corporate Redeeming U.S. Holder generally will be taxable at a reduced rate. The deduction of capital losses is subject to limitations. However, it is unclear whether the redemption rights with respect to the Public Stock described in this proxy statement may prevent a U.S. Holder from satisfying the applicable holding period requirements for long-term capital gain or loss.\n\nIf a Redeeming U.S. Holder holds different blocks of Public Stock (generally, shares of Public Stock purchased or acquired on different dates or at different prices), such Redeeming U.S. Holder is urged to consult its tax advisors to determine how the above rules apply to such Redeeming U.S. Holder.\n\n**ALL REDEEMING U.S. HOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF A REDEMPTION OF ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR PUBLIC STOCK PURSUANT TO AN EXERCISE OF REDEMPTION RIGHTS.**\n\n**_Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations to Non-U.S. Stockholders_**\n\nThis section is addressed to Redeeming Non-U.S. Holders (as defined below) of Public Stock that elect to have their shares redeemed for cash as described in the section titled “ _Proposal No. 1 — The Extension Amendment Proposal — Redemption Rights_.” For purposes of this discussion, a “Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner (other than a Flow-Through Entity) of our Public Stock that so redeems its Public Stock and is not a Redeeming U.S. Holder.\n\n_Tax Treatment of the Redemption — In General_\n\nExcept as otherwise discussed in this section, the characterization of a redemption for a Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder who elects to have its shares redeemed will generally be characterized in the same manner as a U.S. Stockholder for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See the discussion above under “ _Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations to U.S. Stockholders_.”\n\nRedeeming Non-U.S. Holders of shares considering exercising their redemption rights are urged to consult their tax advisors as to whether the redemption of their shares will be treated as a sale or as a distribution under the Code, and whether they will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized or dividends received as a result of the redemption based upon their particular circumstances.\n\n35  \n---  \n  \n_Redemption of Public Stock Treated as a Corporate Distribution_\n\nIf the redemption qualifies as a corporate distribution, such distribution generally will constitute a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles, and provided such dividends are not effectively connected with the Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States, we will be required to withhold tax from the gross amount of the dividend at a rate of 30%, unless such Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder is eligible for a reduced rate of withholding tax under an applicable income tax treaty and provides proper certification of its eligibility for such reduced rate (on IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E). Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of capital to the extent of the Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder’s Public Stock. Any remaining excess will be treated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition of such Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder’s Public Stock as discussed below. In addition, if we determine that we are likely to be classified as a “U.S. real property holding corporation” (see “—  _Redemption of Public Stock Treated as a Sale or Other Disposition_ ” below), we will withhold 15% of any distribution that exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits.\n\nThe withholding tax does not apply to dividends paid to a Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder who provides a Form W-8ECI, certifying that the dividends are effectively connected with the Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States. Instead, the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. resident, subject to an applicable income tax treaty providing otherwise. A Redeeming Non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” imposed at a rate of 30% (or a lower treaty rate) on its effectively connected earnings and profits that are not reinvested in the United States.\n\n_Redemption of Public Stock Treated as a Sale or Other Disposition_\n\nIf the redemption qualifies as a sale or other disposition, a Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax in respect of gain recognized on a sale or other disposition of Public Stock unless:\n\n● | the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business by the Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder within the United States;  \n---|---  \n● | the Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition and certain other conditions are met; or  \n● | we are or have been a “U.S. real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of disposition or the period that the Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder held Public Stock, and, in the case where the shares of Public Stock are regularly traded on an established securities market, the Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder has owned, directly or constructively (including through ownership of Warrants) more than 5% of the shares of Public Stock at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the disposition or such Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period for the shares of Public Stock.  \n  \nUnless an applicable treaty provides otherwise, gain described in the first bullet point above will be subject to tax at generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rates as if the Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. resident. Any gains described in the first bullet point above of a Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate (or lower treaty rate) on its effectively connected earnings and profits that are not reinvested in the United States. Gain described in the second bullet point above will be subject to a flat 30% U.S. federal income tax rate on the gain derived from the redemption, which gain may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses for the year.\n\nIf the third bullet point above applies to a Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder, gain recognized by such holder on the disposition of the Public Stock will be subject to tax at generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rates. We cannot determine whether we will be a U.S. real property holding corporation in the future until we complete an initial business combination. We will be classified as a U.S. real property holding corporation if the fair market value of our “U.S. real property interests” equals or exceeds 50 percent of the sum of the fair market value of our worldwide real property interests plus our other assets used or held for use in a trade or business, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\n36  \n---  \n  \nIf a Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder holds different blocks of Public Stock (generally, shares of Public Stock purchased or acquired on different dates or at different prices), such Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder is urged to consult its tax advisors to determine how the above rules apply to such Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder.\n\n**_Backup Withholding_**\n\nIn general, proceeds received from the exercise of redemption rights will be subject to backup withholding for a non-corporate Redeeming U.S. Holder that:\n\n● | fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number;  \n---|---  \n● | is notified by the IRS regarding a failure to report all interest or dividends required to be shown on his or her federal income tax returns; or  \n● | in certain circumstances, fails to comply with applicable certification requirements.  \n  \nA Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder generally may eliminate the requirement for information reporting and backup withholding by providing certification of its non-U.S. status, under penalties of perjury, on a duly executed applicable IRS Form W-8 or by otherwise establishing an exemption.\n\nAny amount withheld under these rules will be creditable against the Redeeming U.S. Holder’s or Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability or refundable to the extent that it exceeds this liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS and other applicable requirements are met.\n\n**As previously noted above, the foregoing discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences is included for general information purposes only and is not intended to be, and should not be construed as, legal or tax advice to any stockholder. We once again urge you to consult with your tax adviser to determine the particular tax consequences to you (including the application and effect of any U.S. federal, state, local or foreign income or other tax laws) of the receipt of cash in exchange for shares in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal and any redemption of your Public Stock.**\n\n37  \n---  \n  \n**BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF SECURITIES**\n\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our Common Stock as of November 20, 2024, based on information obtained from the persons named below, with respect to the beneficial ownership of shares of our Common Stock, by:\n\n● | each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock;  \n---|---  \n● | each of our officers and directors; and  \n● | all of our executive officers and directors as a group.  \n  \nBeneficial ownership is determined according to the rules of the SEC, which generally provide that a person has beneficial ownership of a security if such person possesses sole or shared voting or investment power over that security, including options and warrants that are currently exercisable or exercisable within sixty days.\n\nThe following table is based on 3,367,333 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of November 20, 2024. Common stockholders of record are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by stockholders. Unless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by them. The following table does not reflect record or beneficial ownership of our Warrants or Rights, as these Warrants and Rights are not exercisable within 60 days of November 20, 2024.\n\n**Name and Address of Beneficial Owner(1)** | Amount and Nature of Beneficial Ownership of Common Stock | Percentage of Outstanding Shares of Common Stock  \n---|---|---  \nDirectors and Named Executive Officers:  \nManish Jhunjhunwala | 53,576 | 1.6| %  \nMark H.

Jeff LeBlanc, one of our founders, is the sole manager of our Sponsor and may be deemed to have beneficial ownership of the shares of Common Stock held directly by our Sponsor. Mr. LeBlanc disclaims any beneficial ownership of the reported shares other than to the extent of any pecuniary interest he may have therein, directly or indirectly.  \n(3) | Consists of 2,537,424 shares owned by our Sponsor and 28,000 shares held directly by Mr. LeBlanc. Mr. LeBlanc is the sole manager of our Sponsor and may be deemed to have beneficial ownership of the shares of Common Stock held directly by our Sponsor. Mr. LeBlanc disclaims any beneficial ownership of the reported shares owned by our Sponsor other than to the extent of any pecuniary interest he may have therein, directly or indirectly.  \n  \n38  \n---  \n  \n**FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS**\n\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved and the Extension Amendment is filed, we anticipate that we will hold another special meeting before the Termination Date to consider and vote upon approval of our initial business combination and other related matters. If we consummate the initial business combination within the required timeframe, our first annual meeting of stockholders will be held at a future date to be determined by the post-business combination company. If either the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal are not approved and an initial business combination is not consummated, or if they are approved but we do not consummate an initial business combination prior to the applicable Termination Date, the Company will liquidate and dissolve and there will be no annual meetings of the Company. You should direct any proposals to our Chief Executive Officer at WinVest Acquisition Corp., 125 Cambridgepark Drive, Suite 301, Cambridge, MA 02140.\n\n39  \n---  \n  \n**HOUSEHOLDING INFORMATION**\n\nUnless we have received contrary instructions, we may send a single copy of this proxy statement to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if we believe the stockholders are members of the same family. This process, known as “householding,” reduces the volume of duplicate information received at any one household and helps to reduce our expenses. However, if stockholders prefer to receive multiple sets of our disclosure documents at the same address this year or in future years, the stockholders should follow the instructions described below. Similarly, if an address is shared with another stockholder and together both of the stockholders would like to receive only a single set of our disclosure documents, the stockholders should follow these instructions:\n\n● | If the shares are registered in the name of the stockholder, the stockholder should contact us at our offices at WinVest Acquisition Corp., 125 Cambridgepark Drive, Suite 301, Cambridge, MA 02140, to inform us of his or her request; or  \n---|---  \n● | If a bank, broker or other nominee holds the shares, the stockholder should contact the bank, broker or other nominee directly.  \n  \n40  \n---  \n  \n**WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION**\n\nWe file reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC as required by the Exchange Act.

Immediately after the IPO, a certain amount of the net offering proceeds received by the Corporation in the IPO (including the proceeds of any exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option) and certain other amounts specified in the Registration Statement shall be deposited in the Trust Fund. Except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes, none of the funds held in the Trust Fund (including the interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Fund) will be released from the Trust Fund until the earliest to occur of (i) the completion of the initial Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of 100% of the IPO Shares if the Corporation is unable to complete its initial Business Combination within 40 months from the closing of the IPO (or up to 45 months, if applicable under the provisions of paragraph (F) of this Article Sixth) and (iii) the redemption of shares in connection with a vote seeking to amend such provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation as described in this Section 6(A). Holders of IPO Shares (whether such IPO Shares were purchased in the IPO or in the secondary market following the IPO and whether or not such holders are officers or directors of the Corporation, or affiliates of any of the foregoing) are referred to herein as “**Public Stockholders**.” If, in accordance with Article Thirteenth, any amendment is made to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (a) to modify the substance or timing of the Corporation’s obligation to redeem 100% of the IPO Shares if the Corporation has not consummated an initial Business Combination within 40 months from the closing of the IPO (or up to 45 months, if applicable under the provisions of paragraph F of this Article Sixth) or (b) with respect to any other material provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity, the Public Stockholders shall be provided with the opportunity to redeem their IPO Shares upon the approval of any such amendment, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Fund, including interest not previously released to the Corporation to pay its taxes, divided by the number of then-outstanding IPO Shares.\n\n12. | The text of Paragraph F of Article Sixth is hereby amended and restated to read in full as follows:  \n---|---  \n  \nF. In the event that the Corporation does not consummate a Business Combination upon the date which is the later of (i) 40 months from the closing of the IPO (or up to 45 months from the closing date of the IPO, if applicable, under the provisions of this paragraph (F)) and (ii) such later date as may be approved by the Company’s stockholders in accordance with this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (in any case, such date being referred to as the “Termination Date”), the Corporation shall (a) cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up, (b) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter redeem 100% of the IPO Shares for cash for a redemption price per share as described below (which redemption will completely extinguish such holders’ rights as stockholders, including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (c) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to approval of the Corporation’s then-stockholders and subject to the requirements of the GCL, including the adoption of a resolution by the Board pursuant to Section 275(a) of the GCL finding the dissolution of the Corporation advisable and the provision of such notices as are required by said Section 275(a) of the GCL, dissolve and liquidate the balance of the Corporation’s net assets to its remaining stockholders, as part of the Corporation’s plan of dissolution and liquidation, subject (in the case of (b) and (c) above) to the Corporation’s obligations under the GCL to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law. In such event, the per share redemption price shall be equal to a pro rata share of the Trust Fund plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Fund (less any taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the total number of IPO Shares then outstanding.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing or any other provisions of the Articles of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in the event that the Corporation has not consummated an initial Business Combination within 40 months from the closing of the IPO, the Corporation may, without another stockholder vote, elect to extend the date to consummate the Business Combination on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one (1) month (or such shorter period as WinVest SPAC LLC (the “Sponsor”) shall request) each time after 40 months from the closing of the IPO, by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor), and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until 45 months from the closing of the Offering, provided that the Sponsor (or one or more of its affiliates, members or third-party designees, including, but not limited to, any parties to a business combination agreement or their affiliates) (the “Lender”) will lend the Company, and the Company will deposit into the Trust Fund: for each such extension, $30,000, for an aggregate deposit of up to $150,000 (if all five additional extensions are exercised), upon the Company’s drawdown of a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note issued by the Corporation to the Lender. If the Corporation completes a Business Combination, it will repay the amounts loaned under the promissory note.

(“WinVest,” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on March 1, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination (the “Initial Business Combination”) with one or more businesses or entities. On August 30, 2024, WinVest (BVI) LTD was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”) as a wholly owned subsidiary of WinVest. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.\n\nThroughout this report, the terms “our,” “we,” “us,” and the “Company” refer to WinVest Acquisition Corp.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had not commenced core operations. All activity for the period from March 1, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024 relates to the Company’s formation, raising funds through the initial public offering (“Initial Public Offering”), which is described below, identifying a target company for an Initial Business Combination and working to consummate an Initial Business Combination with Xtribe (as defined below). The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of an Initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operating income in the form of interest and dividend income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering.\n\nThe registration statement pursuant to which the Company registered its securities offered in the Initial Public Offering (the “IPO Registration Statement”) was declared effective on September 14, 2021. On September 17, 2021, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 10,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock of the Company, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”), one redeemable warrant (the “Public Warrants”), with each Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one-half (1/2) of one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustment, and one Right (the “Rights”), with each Right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-fifteenth (1/15) of one share of Common Stock upon the consummation by the Company of an Initial Business Combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses).\n\nSimultaneously with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the issuance and sale of the Units, the Company completed the private sale of 10,000,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $0.50 per Private Placement Warrant to our sponsor, WinVest SPAC LLC (the “Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds of $5,000,000 (such sale, the “Private Placement”).\n\nEach Private Placement Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one-half of one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustment. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants.\n\nOn September 23, 2021, the underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option and purchased an additional 1,500,000 Units (the “Over-Allotment Units”), generating gross proceeds of $15,000,000 on September 27, 2021. Accordingly, no Founder Shares (as defined below) were subject to forfeiture upon exercise of the full over-allotment. Simultaneously with the sale of Over-Allotment Units, the Company consummated a private sale of an additional 900,000 Private Placement Warrants (the “Additional Private Placement Warrants”, and together with the Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants, the “Warrants”) to the Sponsor at a purchase price of $0.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds of $450,000. As of September 27, 2021, a total of $116,150,000 of the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants and the Additional Private Placement Warrants were deposited in a Trust Account (as defined below) established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders.\n\nFollowing the closing of the Initial Public Offering on September 17, 2021, and the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full on September 23, 2021, an aggregate amount of $116,150,000 from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account in the United States maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (“Continental”), as trustee (the “Trust Account”). The funds held in the Trust Account are invested only in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”) having a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act and that invest solely in U.S. treasuries, so that the Company is not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to pay for the Company’s income or other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the Trust Account until the earlier of the completion of the Initial Business Combination or the redemption of 100% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock issued as part of the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering (the “Public Shares”) if an Initial Business Combination has not been completed in the required time period. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business.\n\n5  \n---  \n  \nThe Company initially had 15 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering on September 17, 2021 to consummate the Initial Business Combination. On November 30, 2022, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders, at which the stockholders approved an amendment (the “November 2022 Extension Amendment”) to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (as amended, the “Certificate of Incorporation”) to extend the date (the “Termination Date”) by which the Company must consummate an Initial Business Combination from December 17, 2022 (the “Original Termination Date”) to January 17, 2023, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after January 17, 2023, by resolution of the Company’s board of directors, if requested by its Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2023, or a total of up to six months after the Original Termination Date, unless the closing of the Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, subject to the deposit by the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, of $125,000, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each one-month extension. Any such payments would be made in the form of a non-interest-bearing loan and would be repaid, if at all, from funds released to us upon completion of our Initial Business Combination.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the November 2022 Extension Amendment, the holders of 9,606,887 Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.20 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $98.0 million. Following such redemptions, approximately $19.6 million was left in the Trust Account and 1,893,113 shares remained outstanding.\n\nFollowing the approval of the November 2022 Extension Amendment, on December 5, 2022, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $750,000 (the “First Extension Note”) to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company up to $750,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. Per the terms of the First Extension Note, funds available under such note are not restricted for use for extension payments. The First Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) the Company’s liquidation. In the event that the Company does not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the First Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. Upon the consummation of an Initial Business Combination, the Sponsor may elect to convert any portion or all of the amount outstanding under the First Extension Note into private warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.50 per private warrant. Such private warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants issued to the Sponsor at the time of the Initial Public Offering.\n\nOn June 12, 2023, the Company held a second special meeting of stockholders (the “June 2023 Extension Meeting”), at which the stockholders approved, among other things, (i) an amendment (the “June 2023 Extension Amendment”) to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to extend the Termination Date from June 17, 2023 to July 17, 2023, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month (or such shorter period as may be requested by the Sponsor) after July 17, 2023, by resolution of the Company’s board of directors, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until December 17, 2023, or a total of up to six months after June 17, 2023, unless the closing of the Company’s Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, and (ii) an amendment (the “Redemption Limitation Amendment”) to eliminate from the Certificate of Incorporation the limitation that the Company may not consummate any business combination unless it has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon consummation of such business combination. Following stockholder approval of the June 2023 Extension Amendment and the Redemption Limitation Amendment at the June 2023 Extension Meeting, on June 16, 2023, the Company filed the June 2023 Extension Amendment and the Redemption Limitation Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the June 2023 Extension Amendment, the holders of 627,684 Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.71 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of $6,721,795. Following such redemptions, $13,551,331 was left in Trust Account and 1,265,429 Public Shares remained outstanding.\n\n6  \n---  \n  \nFollowing the approval of the June 2023 Extension Amendment on June 12, 2023, on June 13, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $390,000 (the “Second Extension Note”) to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company up to $390,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The Second Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) the Company’s liquidation. In the event that the Company does not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Second Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. Upon the consummation of an Initial Business Combination, the Sponsor may elect to convert any portion or all of the amount outstanding under the Second Extension Note into private warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.50 per private warrant. Such private warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants issued to the Sponsor at the time of the Initial Public Offering.\n\nOn November 30, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders, at which the stockholders approved, among other things, an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation (the “November 2023 Extension Amendment”) to extend the Termination Date from December 17, 2023 to January 17, 2024, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after January 17, 2023, by resolution of the Company’s board of directors, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2024, or a total of up to six months after December 17, 2023, unless the closing of the Company’s Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, by causing $55,000 to be deposited into the Trust Account for each such extension.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the November 2023 Extension Amendment, the holders of 122,306 Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.81 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $1,322,518. Following such redemptions, 1,143,123 Public Shares remained outstanding.\n\nFollowing the approval of the November 2023 Extension Amendment on November 30, 2023, on December 13, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $330,000 (the “Third Extension Note”) to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company up to $330,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The Third Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) the Company’s liquidation. In the event that the Company does not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Third Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any.\n\nOn June 3, 2024, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders, at which the stockholders approved, among other things, an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation (the “June 2024 Extension Amendment”) to extend the Termination Date from June 17, 2024 to July 17, 2024, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after July 17, 2024, by resolution of the Company’s board of directors, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until December 17, 2024, or a total of up to six months after June 17, 2024, unless the closing of the Company’s Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, by causing $30,000 to be deposited into the Trust Account for each such extension.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the June 2024 Extension Amendment, the holders of 650,790 Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $11.32 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $7,367,204. Following such redemptions, 492,333 Public Shares remained outstanding.\n\nFollowing the approval of the June 2024 Extension Amendment on June 3, 2024, on June 12, 2024, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $180,000 (the “Fourth Extension Note”) to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company up to $180,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The Fourth Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) the Company’s liquidation. In the event that the Company does not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Fourth Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any.\n\n7  \n---  \n  \nThrough the date of this report, the Company has deposited $1,650,000 into the Trust Account in connection with six drawdowns under the First Extension Note, six drawdowns under Second Extension Note, six drawdowns under the Third Extension Notes, and six drawdowns under the Fourth Extension Note (collectively the “Extension Notes”) pursuant to the extension of the Termination Date to December 17, 2024. Such amounts will be distributed either to: (i) all the holders of Public Shares upon the Company’s liquidation or (ii) holders of such shares who elect to have their shares redeemed in connection with (a) the vote to approve the Charter Extension Amendment (as defined below) or (b) the consummation of an Initial Business Combination. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $1,590,000 and $1,195,000, respectively, was outstanding under the Extension Notes.\n\nIf the Company is unable to consummate an Initial Business Combination by the Termination Date, the Company will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay for dissolution expenses), and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. However, the Company may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of the public stockholders. In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, the Rights, Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants will expire and will be worthless.\n\nNo compensation of any kind (including finders’, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of the existing officers, directors, stockholders, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the Initial Business Combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on the Company’s behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations. Since the role of present management after the Initial Business Combination is uncertain, the Company has no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after the Initial Business Combination.\n\nManagement intends to use any funds available outside of the Trust Account for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist the Company with its search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company’s insiders, officers and directors in connection with activities as described below.\n\nThe allocation of the net proceeds available to the Company outside of the Trust Account, along with the interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account available to pay for the Company’s income and other tax liabilities, represents the best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event that the Company’s assumptions prove to be inaccurate, the Company may reallocate some of such proceeds within the above-described categories. If the estimate of the costs of undertaking due diligence and negotiating the Initial Business Combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of interest available to the Company from the Trust Account is insufficient, the Company may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. In this event, the Company could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from the Sponsor or third parties. The Sponsor and/or founding stockholders may, but are not obligated to, loan funds as may be required. Such loans would be evidenced by promissory notes that would either be paid upon consummation of the Initial Business Combination, or, with respect to certain of such notes, at such lender’s discretion, converted upon consummation of the Initial Business Combination into Private Placement Warrants at a price of $0.50 per Private Placement Warrant. However, the Sponsor and/or founding stockholders are under no obligation to loan the Company any funds or invest in the Company. If the Company is unable to obtain the necessary funds, the Company may be forced to cease searching for a target business and liquidate without completing our Initial Business Combination.\n\nThe Company will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, the Private Placement and the sale of the Additional Private Placement Warrants, including the funds held in the Trust Account, in connection with the Initial Business Combination and to pay for expenses relating thereto, including the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions payable to the underwriters in an amount equal to 3.5% of the total gross proceeds raised in the offering upon consummation of the Initial Business Combination. To the extent that the Company’s capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect the Initial Business Combination, the proceeds held in the Trust Account which are not used to consummate an Initial Business Combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations or for strategic acquisitions.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \nTo the extent the Company is unable to consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Company will pay the costs of liquidation from the remaining assets outside of the Trust Account and from up to $100,000 of interest income on the balance of the Trust Account (net of income and other tax obligations) that may be released to it to pay for dissolution expenses. If such funds are insufficient, the Sponsor has agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.\n\nOn May 9, 2024, the Company entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Original Business Combination Agreement”), by and among WinVest, WinVest Merger Sub I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of WinVest, WinVest Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of WinVest, Xtribe P.L.C., a public limited company incorporated and registered in England and Wales with number 07878011 (“Xtribe PLC”), and Xtribe Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Xtribe PLC. On September 16, 2024, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement (the “A&R Business Combination Agreement”), by and among WinVest, WinVest (BVI) Ltd., a British Virgin Islands business company registered with company number 2157117 and a wholly owned subsidiary of WinVest, Xtribe PLC and Xtribe (BVI) Ltd., a British Virgin Islands business company registered with company number 2157137 and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xtribe PLC (together with Xtribe PLC, “Xtribe”), which amends and restates the Original Business Combination Agreement in its entirety.\n\n_Risks and Uncertainties_\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IR Act”) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury Department”) has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. Any share redemption or other share repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a business combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a business combination, extension vote or otherwise will depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Initial Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a business combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any “PIPE” (Private Investment in Public Entity) or other equity issuances in connection with a business combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a business combination but issued within the same taxable year of a business combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury Department. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a business combination and in the Company’s ability to complete a business combination. The Company will not use the proceeds placed in the Trust Account and the interest earned thereon to pay any excise taxes that may be imposed on it pursuant to any current, pending or future rules or laws, including without limitation any excise tax imposed under the IR Act, on any redemptions or stock buybacks by the Company.\n\nIn June 2023, the Company’s stockholders redeemed 627,684 Public Shares for a total of $6,721,795. In November 2023, the Company’s stockholders redeemed 122,306 Public Shares for a total of $1,322,518. In June 2024, the Company’s stockholders redeemed 650,790 Public Shares for a total of $7,367,204. The Company evaluated the classification and accounting of the stock redemption under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 450, Contingencies (“ASC 450”). ASC 450 states that when a loss contingency exists the likelihood that the future event will confirm the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability can range from probable to remote. A contingent liability must be reviewed at each reporting period to determine appropriate treatment. The Company evaluated the current status and probability of completing a business combination as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and determined that a contingent liability should be calculated and recorded. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $154,115 and $80,443, respectively, of excise tax liability calculated as 1% of total shares redeemed.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the IRS issued final regulations with respect to the timing and payment of the excise tax. The Company is currently evaluating its options with respect to payment of this obligation.\n\n_Use of Funds Restricted for Payment of Taxes_\n\nIn February 2024, the Company withdrew $40,050 of interest and dividend income earned on the Trust Account and received a tax refund of $104,305 that was previously paid with the interest and dividend income earned on the Trust Account. Such amounts were restricted for payment of the Company’s tax liabilities as provided in the Company’s charter. During the first quarter of 2024, approximately $90,000 of these funds were inadvertently used for the payments of general operating expenses. The Sponsor replenished $90,000 to the Company’s operating account in the form of a working capital loan.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, approximately $174,000 of interest and dividend income earned on the Trust Account was withdrawn and inadvertently used for the payments of general operating expenses. The Company’s initial business combination target, Xtribe, has agreed to replenish the Company’s operating account for approximately $174,000.\n\n_Going Concern_\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $548 in its operating bank account and a working capital deficit of $4,928,551. The Company’s liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering have been satisfied through proceeds from advances from a related party, the Sponsor, and from the issuance of Common Stock. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, liquidity has been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the proceeds from the Sponsor’s purchase of Private Placement Warrants held outside of our Trust Account and loans from the Sponsor. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of $1,430,395 and expenses from operating activities were $1,724,753, mainly due to costs associated with professional services, including legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance expenses. The Company intends to use the funds held outside the Trust Account, in addition to additional funds that the Company may borrow under the October 2023 Promissory Note (as defined below), primarily to pay corporate filing and compliance expenses, evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses and structure, negotiate and complete an Initial Business Combination. Per the terms of the Extension Notes, funds available under such notes are not restricted for use for extension payments. The Company believes it will need to access additional liquidity in order to consummate an Initial Business Combination.\n\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern, which assumes the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from March 1, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024 relates to the Company’s formation, the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for an Initial Business Combination and working to consummate an Initial Business Combination with Xtribe. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of the Initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operating income in the form of interest and dividend income on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. The Company’s ability to commence operations is contingent upon consummating a business combination. Management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a business combination. Although management has been successful to date in raising necessary funding, there can be no assurance that any required future financing can be successfully completed. Additionally, the Company does not currently have sufficient working capital. Furthermore, the Company’s ability to consummate an Initial Business Combination within the contractual time period is uncertain. The Company currently has until December 17, 2024 to consummate the Initial Business Combination. The Company will not be able to consummate an Initial Business Combination by December 17, 2024. Based on these circumstances, management has determined that there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern due to the uncertainty of liquidity requirements and the mandatory liquidation date within one year.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \nManagement’s plan to address the December 17, 2024 liquidation is to seek stockholder approval for, and to file, an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation extending the Company’s current Termination Date, among other things. Pursuant to a preliminary proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on November 1, 2024, the Company is proposing to amend its Certificate of Incorporation to extend the Termination Date from December 17, 2024 to January 17, 2025 (the “Charter Extension Date”) upon the deposit into the Trust Account of $30,000, to be loaned to the Company by the Sponsor or one or more of its affiliates, members or third-party designees, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month period each after the Charter Extension Date (each, an “Additional Extension”), by resolution of the Company’s board of directors, if requested by the Company’s Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2025, or a total of up to six months after December 17, 2024, unless the closing of an Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, subject to the deposit of an additional $30,000 per Additional Extension into the Trust Account by the Sponsor or its affiliates, members or third-party designees.\n\n**NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS**\n\n_Basis of Presentation_\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of management, these unaudited condensed financial statements include all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company, and the adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature.\n\n_Unaudited Interim Financial Statements_\n\nIn the opinion of the Company, the unaudited financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of its financial position as of September 30, 2024, and its results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024, which contains the audited financial statements and notes thereto. The financial information as of December 31, 2023, is derived from the audited financial statements presented in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The interim results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024, or for any future interim periods.\n\n11  \n---  \n  \n_Emerging Growth Company_\n\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\n\n_Use of Estimates_\n\nThe preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n\nMaking estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\n\n_Cash and cash equivalents_\n\nThe Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\n_Cash Held in Trust Account_\n\nFollowing the closing of the Initial Public Offering on September 17, 2021, and the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full on September 23, 2021, an aggregate amount of $116,150,000 from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in the Trust Account and may be invested only in U.S. government securities with a maturity of 185 days or less, in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations or in cash. To mitigate the risk of the Company being deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act), prior to the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of the Company’s IPO Registration Statement, the Company instructed Continental to liquidate the U.S. government treasury obligations or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter to maintain all funds in the Trust Account in cash in an interest-bearing bank account. The funds were reinvested into money market funds in May 2024. The Trust Account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of: (i) the completion of the Initial Business Combination; (ii) the redemption of any Public Shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete the Initial Business Combination by the Termination Date or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-Initial Business Combination activity; or (iii) absent the consummation of an Initial Business Combination by the Termination Date, the return of the funds held in the Trust Account to the public stockholders as part of redemption of the Public Shares.\n\n12  \n---  \n  \n_Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption_\n\nThe Company accounts for its Common Stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Common Stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Common Stock (including Common Stock that features redemption rights that is either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Common Stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. The Company’s Common Stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, Common Stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of the Company’s balance sheet.\n\nThe Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable shares are effected by charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit.\n\n_Public and Private Warrants_\n\nThe Company accounts for the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants as equity-classified instruments, based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own Common Stock, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. In that respect, the Private Placement Warrants, as well as any warrants the Company issues to the Sponsor, officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates in payment of working capital loans made to the Company, were identical to the warrants underlying the Units offered in the Initial Public Offering.\n\n_Rights_\n\nThe Company accounts for its Rights as equity-classified instruments based on an assessment of the Rights’ specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether the Rights are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the Rights meet all the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the Rights are indexed to the Company’s own Common Stock, among other conditions for the equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgement, is conducted at the time of Rights issuance.\n\nEach Right may be traded separately. If the Company is unable to complete an Initial Business Combination within the required time period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of Rights will not receive any such funds for their Rights, and the Rights will expire worthless. The Company has not considered the effect of Rights sold in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement to purchase shares of Common Stock, since the exercise of the Rights are contingent upon the occurrence of future events.\n\n_Income Taxes_\n\nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\n\n13  \n---  \n  \nASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities.\n\nWhile ASC 740 identifies usage of an effective annual tax rate for purposes of an interim provision, it does allow for estimating individual elements in the current period if they are significant, unusual or infrequent. Computing the effective tax rate for the Company is complicated due to the potential impact of the timing of any Business Combination expenses and the actual interest income that will be recognized during the year. The Company has taken a position as to the calculation of income tax expense in a current period based on ASC 740-270-25-3 which states, “If an entity is unable to estimate a part of its ordinary income (or loss) or the related tax (benefit) but is otherwise able to make a reasonable estimate, the tax (or benefit) applicable to the item that cannot be estimated shall be reported in the interim period in which the item is reported.” The Company believes its calculation to be a reliable estimate and allows it to properly take into account the usual elements that can impact its annualized book income and its impact on the effective tax rate. As such, the Company is computing its taxable income (loss) and associated income tax provision based on actual results through September 30, 2024. The Company’s effective tax rate was (1.4)% and (15.6)% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate was (5.1)% and (11.0)% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of 21% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 due to non-deductible transaction costs and changes in the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets.\n\n_Franchise Taxes_\n\nThe Company is subject to franchise tax filing requirements in the State of Delaware.\n\n_Concentration of Credit Risk_\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash accounts in financial institutions, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Coverage of $250,000. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not experienced losses on these accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such accounts.\n\n_Fair Value of Financial Instruments_\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature.\n\n_Fair Value Measurements_\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. U.S. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include:\n\n● | Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets;  \n---|---  \n● | Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and  \n● | Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.  \n  \n14  \n---  \n  \nThe following table presents information about the Company’s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value:\n\nSCHEDULE OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT ON RECURRING BASIC\n\nFair value measurements at reporting date using:  \n---  \nDescription | Fair Value | Quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities (Level 1) | Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) | Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3)  \nAssets:  \nMarketable securities held in Trust Account at September 30, 2024 | $| 5,793,629 | $| 5,793,629 | $| - | $| -  \nCash held in Trust Account at December 31, 2023 | $| 12,453,412 | $| 12,453,412 | $| - | $| -  \n  \nIn some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n\n_Net Loss Per Common Share_\n\nNet loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share is computed like basic earnings per share, except the weighted average number of common shares outstanding are increased to include additional shares from the assumed exercise of share options, if dilutive.\n\nThe Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. The Statements of Operations include a presentation of loss per redeemable share and loss per non-redeemable share following the two-class method of income per share. In order to determine the net loss attributable to both the redeemable shares and non-redeemable shares, the Company first considered the total loss allocable to both sets of shares. This is calculated using the total net loss less any dividends paid. For purposes of calculating net loss per share, any remeasurement of the ordinary shares subject to possible redemption was considered to be dividends paid to the public stockholders. Subsequent to calculating the total loss allocable to both sets of shares, the Company split the amount to be allocated using a ratio of 0% for the redeemable Public Shares and 100% for the non-redeemable shares, reflective of the respective participation rights, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nThe loss per share presented in the statement of operations is based on the following:\n\nSCHEDULE OF EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\n**For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\n**Common shares** **subject to** **redemption** | **Non-redeemable** **Common Shares**  \n---|---  \nBasic and diluted net loss per share  \nNumerator:  \nAllocation of net loss | - | (883,742| )  \nDenominator:  \nWeighted-average shares outstanding | 492,333 | 2,875,000  \nBasic and diluted net loss per share | $| - | $| (0.31| )  \n  \n15  \n---  \n  \n**For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023**\n\n**Common shares** **subject to** **redemption** | **Non-redeemable** **Common Shares**  \n---|---  \nBasic and diluted net loss per share  \nNumerator:  \nAllocation of net loss | - | (103,638| )  \nDenominator:  \nWeighted-average shares outstanding | 1,265,429 | 2,875,000  \nBasic and diluted net loss per share | $| - | $| (0.04| )  \n  \n**For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\n**Common shares** **subject to** **redemption** | **Non-redeemable** **Common Shares**  \n---|---  \nBasic and diluted net loss per share  \nNumerator:  \nAllocation of net loss | - | (1,430,395| )  \nDenominator:  \nWeighted-average shares outstanding | 858,105 | 2,875,000  \nBasic and diluted net loss per share | $| - | $| (0.50| )  \n  \n**For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023**\n\n**Common shares** **subject to** **redemption** | **Non-redeemable** **Common Shares**  \n---|---  \nBasic and diluted net loss per share  \nNumerator:  \nAllocation of net loss | - | (966,681| )  \nDenominator:  \nWeighted-average shares outstanding | 1,639,715 | 2,875,000  \nBasic and diluted net loss per share | $| - | $| (0.34| )  \n  \nThe Company has not considered the effect of Warrants and Rights sold in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement to purchase 11,966,666 shares of Common Stock in the calculation of diluted loss per share, since the exercise of the Warrants and Rights are contingent upon the occurrence of future events. As a result, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic net loss per common share for the period presented.\n\n_Recent Accounting Pronouncements_\n\nIn June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) (“ASU 2022-03”). The amendments in ASU 2022-03 clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The amendments in this Update also require additional disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The provisions in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 for public business entities. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect to early adopt this ASU. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on the balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nASU 2023-09 requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The new standard is effective for public entities with annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted and should be applied prospectively with the option of retrospective application. The Company does not expect to early adopt this ASU. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on the balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nThe Company does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.\n\n16  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 3 - INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING**\n\nPursuant to the Initial Public Offering, on September 17, 2021, the Company sold 10,000,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit for a total of $100,000,000, which increased to 11,500,000 Units for a total of $115,000,000 when the over-allotment option was exercised in full on September 23, 2021. Each Unit consists of one share of Common Stock, one Right and one Public Warrant. Each Right entitles the holder thereof to receive one-fifteenth (1/15) of one share of Common Stock upon the consummation of an Initial Business Combination. Each redeemable Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one half (1/2) of one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per full share, subject to adjustment (see Note 7).\n\nIn connection with its Initial Public Offering, the Company incurred offering costs of $2,923,969, consisting of $2,400,000 of underwriting commissions and expenses and $523,969 of costs related to the Initial Public Offering. Additionally, the Company recorded deferred underwriting commissions of $4,025,000 payable only upon completion of the Initial Business Combination.\n\n**NOTE 4 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**\n\n_Sponsor Shares_\n\nOn March 16, 2021, the Sponsor purchased 2,875,000 shares (the “Founder Shares”) of the Company’s Common Stock for an aggregate price of $25,000.\n\nPrior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with the Initial Public Offering, the Company entered into agreements with its directors in connection with their board service and certain members of its advisory board in connection with their advisory board service for its Sponsor to transfer an aggregate of 277,576 of its Founder Shares to the Company’s directors for no cash consideration and an aggregate of 60,000 of its Founder Shares to certain members of the Company’s advisory board for no cash consideration, for a total of 337,576 shares, approximating the fair value of the shares on such date, or $34. The shares were subsequently transferred prior to the effectiveness of the Company’s registration statement. The Founder Shares do not have redemption rights and will be worthless unless the Company consummates its Initial Business Combination.\n\n_Private Placement Warrants_\n\nOur Sponsor purchased from us an aggregate of 10,900,000 Private Placement Warrants at a purchase price of $0.50 per warrant, or $5,450,000 in the aggregate, in a private placement that closed simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering. A portion of the proceeds received from the purchase equal to $3,450,000 was placed in the Trust Account so that at least $10.10 per share sold to the public in the Initial Public Offering is held in the Trust Account.\n\n_March 2021 Promissory Note – Related Party_\n\nOn March 16, 2021, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor (extended by amendment in March 2022 to the consummation of an Initial Business Combination) (the “March 2021 Promissory Note”), pursuant to which the Company could borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $300,000, of which $300,000 was outstanding under the March 2021 Promissory Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The March 2021 Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the date on which the Company consummates its Initial Business Combination. The Sponsor may elect to convert any portion or all of the amount outstanding under the March 2021 Promissory Note into Private Placement Warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company at a conversion price of $0.50 per warrant, and each warrant will entitle the holder to acquire one-half share of the Company’s Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, commencing on the date of the Initial Business Combination of the Company, and otherwise on the terms of the Private Placement Warrants.\n\nThe Company analyzed the conversion feature of the March 2021 Promissory Note into private warrants under ASC 815, _Derivatives and Hedging_ , ASC 450, _Contingencies_ , ASC 480, _Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity_ and ASU 2020-06, “ _Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)._ Prior to any Initial Business Combination, the outstanding amounts under the March 2021 Promissory Note are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. The conversion feature for any such outstanding amounts requires liability treatment on the balance sheet and should be recorded at fair value with changes to the fair value being recorded through the income statement. Once converted, the private warrants, being identical to the Public Warrants, will be classified under equity treatment. However, given that the fair value of such conversion feature is not material as of the latest drawdown date, and the reporting date, or September 30, 2024, management has not recorded any such adjustment to the Company’s financial statements.\n\n17  \n---  \n  \n_October 2023 Promissory Note – Related Party_\n\nOn October 31, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor (the “October 2023 Promissory Note”), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had effected drawdowns of $709,200 under the October 2023 Promissory Note. The October 2023 Promissory Note does not bear interest and matures upon the closing of the Initial Business Combination. In the event that the Company does not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the October 2023 Promissory Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any.\n\n_Extension Notes – Related Party_\n\nAs previously disclosed, on December 5, 2022, the Company issued the First Extension Note to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company up to $750,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The First Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) the Company’s liquidation. In the event that the Company does not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the First Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. Upon the consummation of an Initial Business Combination, the Sponsor may elect to convert any portion or all of the amount outstanding under the First Extension Note into private warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.50 per private warrant. Such private warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants issued to the Sponsor at the time of the Initial Public Offering. The balance on the First Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $750,000.\n\nAs previously disclosed, in connection with the approval of the June 2023 Extension Amendment on June 12, 2023, on June 13, 2023, the Company issued the Second Extension Note to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company up to $390,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The Second Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) the Company’s liquidation. In the event that the Company does not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Second Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. Upon the consummation of an Initial Business Combination, the Sponsor may elect to convert any portion or all of the amount outstanding under the Second Extension Note into private placement warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.50 per private placement warrant. Such private placement warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants issued to the Sponsor at the time of the Initial Public Offering. The balance on the Second Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $390,000.\n\nAs previously disclosed, in connection with the approval of the November 2023 Extension Amendment on November 30, 2023, on December 13, 2023, the Company issued the Third Extension Note to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company up to $330,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The Third Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) the Company’s liquidation. In the event that the Company does not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Third Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. The balance on the Third Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $330,000 and $55,000, respectively.\n\nAs previously disclosed, in connection with the approval of the June 2024 Extension Amendment on June 3, 2024, on June 12, 2024, the Company issued the Fourth Extension Note to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company up to $180,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The Fourth Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) the Company’s liquidation. In the event that the Company does not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Fourth Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. The balance on the Fourth Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $120,000 and $0, respectively.\n\n18  \n---  \n  \nThrough the date of this report, the Company has effected drawdowns of an aggregate of $1,650,000 under the Extension Notes and caused such sums to be deposited into the Trust Account in connection with the extension of the Termination Date from December 17, 2022 to December 17, 2024. Such amounts will be distributed either to: (i) all of the holders of Public Shares upon the Company’s liquidation or (ii) holders of Public Shares who elect to have their shares redeemed in connection with (a) the vote to approve the Charter Extension Amendment or (b) the consummation of an Initial Business Combination.\n\nThe Company analyzed the conversion feature of the First and Second Extension Notes into private warrants under ASC 815, _Derivatives and Hedging_ , ASC 450, _Contingencies_ , ASC 480, _Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity_ and ASU 2020-06, _Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)._ ” Prior to an Initial Business Combination, the outstanding amounts under the Extension Notes are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. The conversion feature for any such outstanding amounts requires liability treatment on the balance sheet and should be recorded at fair value with changes to the fair value being recorded through the income statement. Once converted, the private warrants, being identical to the Public Warrants, will be classified under equity treatment. However, given that the fair value of such conversion feature is not material as of the latest drawdown date of each of the Extension Notes, the reporting date, or September 30, 2024, management has not recorded any such adjustment to the Company’s financial statements.\n\n_Administrative Support Agreement_\n\nThe Company entered into an agreement to pay our Sponsor a monthly fee of $10,000 for office space, secretarial, and administrative support services provided to the Company beginning in September 2021 and continuing monthly until the earlier of the completion of an Initial Business Combination or the Company’s liquidation. As of September 30, 2024, $315,000 is owed to the Sponsor under this agreement.\n\n**NOTE 5 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**\n\n_Registration Rights_\n\nThe holders of the Founder Shares are entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement signed on the effective date of the Initial Public Offering. The holders of the majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands that the Company register such securities. The holders of the majority of the Founder Shares can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which the Founder Shares are to be released from escrow. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our consummation of our Initial Business Combination.\n\n_Underwriting Agreement_\n\nThe Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the date of its prospectus to purchase up to 1,500,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the Initial Public Offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. On September 23, 2021, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full and purchased an additional 1,500,000 Units (the “Over-Allotment Units”), generating gross proceeds of $15,000,000 on September 27, 2021.\n\nThe underwriters received a cash underwriting discount of $0.20 per Unit, or $2,300,000 in the aggregate, and were paid offering expenses of $100,000 upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering including the overallotment.\n\n_Finder’s Fee Agreement_\n\nOn July 12, 2022, the Company entered into a finder’s fee agreement with a third-party finder (“Finder”), payable only upon the successful consummation of an Initial Business Combination with a merger target company identified and introduced by the Finder and acknowledged by the Company in writing during the retention period, which shall be one year after origination and will continue for one year after such period, unless terminated earlier. For purposes of the agreement, the finder’s fee shall be calculated as 1% of the sum of any cash and noncash consideration actually delivered and paid in connection with an Initial Business Combination.\n\n19  \n---  \n  \n_Agent Agreement_\n\nOn July 19, 2022, the Company entered an agent agreement with a FINRA registered broker-dealer (“Agent”), by which the Company engaged the Agent as its non-exclusive agent to use commercially reasonable efforts to refer the Company to potential target companies for an Initial Business Combination. If the Company completes a transaction with any such target company referred to by the Agent within 18 months after such referral, the Agent shall be paid a success fee based upon the transaction value, which shall become due and payable concurrently with the Initial Business Combination.\n\n_Chardan Capital Markets, LLC M &A / Capital Markets Advisory Agreement_\n\nOn July 23, 2022, the Company entered a M&A/Capital Markets Advisory Agreement (“M&A Agreement”) with Chardan Capital Markets, LLC (“Chardan”), by which Chardan shall assist and advise the Company in completing an Initial Business Combination. In the event an Initial Business Combination is consummated during the term of the M&A Agreement, the Company shall pay to Chardan at the closing of the Initial Business Combination a fee (the “M&A Fee”) as described below. If the M&A Fee is to be based on the “Aggregate Value” of an Initial Business Combination, such term means, without duplication, an amount equal to the sum of the aggregate value of any securities issued, promissory notes delivered by the Company to a target company in connection with an Initial Business Combination, and any other cash and non-cash consideration (using such values as set forth in such Initial Business Combination’s definitive agreement) delivered and paid in connection with an Initial Business Combination, and the amount of all debt and debt-like instruments of the target company immediately prior to closing that (a) are assumed or acquired by the Company or (b) retired or defeased in connection with such business combination less any amounts of a financing relating to such Initial Business Combination (a “Financing”) that are the basis of a Financing Fee (as defined below). Even if an Initial Business Combination is not consummated prior to the expiration or termination of the M&A Agreement, Chardan shall be entitled to the full M&A Fee with respect to any transaction consummated involving a party introduced to the Company by Chardan (an “Introduced Party”) that occurs within 18 months of the expiration or termination of the M&A Agreement or within 12 months of the expiration or termination of the M&A Agreement for any party not deemed an Introduced Party.\n\nIn the event an Initial Business Combination is consummated involving a party other than an Introduced Party, the Company will pay to Chardan an M&A Fee equal to the greater of $800,000 or 1% of the Aggregate Value of the Initial Business Combination, paid at the close of the Initial Business Combination. In the event an Initial Business Combination is consummated with an Introduced Party as business combination target, the Company shall pay to Chardan an aggregate M&A Fee based on the Aggregate Value of the Initial Business Combination according to the following schedule:\n\n● | 3% of the first $100 million Aggregate Value;  \n---|---  \n● | 2% of the Aggregate Value greater than $100 million but less than $200 million;  \n● | 1% of the Aggregate Value greater than $200 million.  \n  \nThe M&A Fee will be paid either in cash out of the flow of funds from the Trust Account or in registered and free trading securities of the Company, as the parties may agree.\n\nThe Company will pay a cash fee equal to 5% of the aggregate sales price of securities sold in the financing to introduced parties and a cash fee equal to 1% of the aggregate sales price of public or private securities sold in a financing transaction to investors other than introduced parties (collectively, the “Financing Fee”). If such sale of securities occurs through multiple closings, then a pro rata portion of such fee shall be paid upon each closing. The Financing Fee will be paid in cash from the flow of funds from the Financing.\n\nThe Company will pay Chardan up to $150,000 in aggregate for reimbursable out of pocket expenses.\n\nOn April 24, 2024, Chardan resigned its role as M&A/Capital Markets Advisor and terminated the M&A Agreement solely with respect to the Company’s contemplated business combination with Xtribe.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded deferred underwriting commissions of $4,025,000 payable to Chardan only upon completion of its Initial Business Combination.\n\n20  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 6 – COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE REDEMPTION**\n\nThe Company’s Common Stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, Common Stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of the Company’s balance sheet.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of the Company’s Common Stock subject to possible redemption as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\nSCHEDULE OF COMMON STOCK REDEMPTION\n\n**Common Shares** **Subject to Possible Redemption**  \n---  \nBalance, December 31, 2022 | $| 19,571,562  \nDeposits to Trust Account | 1,070,000  \nRemeasurement of common stock subject to possible redemption | 755,103  \nTaxes withdrawn from Trust Account | (898,940| )  \nRedemption of common stock | (8,044,313| )  \nBalance, December 31, 2023 | 12,453,412  \nDeposits to Trust Account | 395,000  \nRedemption of common stock | (7,367,204| )  \nTaxes withdrawn from Trust Account | (40,050| )  \nRemeasurement of common stock subject to possible redemption | 352,471  \nBalance, September 30, 2024 | $| 5,793,629  \n  \n**NOTE 7 – STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT**\n\n_Common Stock_\n\nThe Company’s Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0001, and 1,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, par value $0.0001.\n\nIn March 2021, the Company issued 2,875,000 Founder Shares at a price of approximately $0.01 per share for total cash of $25,000. There are no shares of preferred stock outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December, 31, 2023.\n\n_Rights_\n\nThe registration statement pursuant to which the Company registered its securities offered in the Initial Public Offering was declared effective on September 14, 2021. On September 17, 2021, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 10,000,000 Units. Each Unit consists of one share of Common Stock of the Company, $0.0001 par value per share, one redeemable warrant, with each Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one-half (1/2) of one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustment, and one Right, with each Right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-fifteenth (1/15) of one share of Common Stock upon the consummation by the Company of an Initial Business Combination. Each Right may be traded separately. If the Company is unable to complete an Initial Business Combination within the required time period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of Rights will not receive any such funds for their Rights, and the Rights will expire worthless.\n\n_Public Warrants_\n\nEach redeemable warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one half of one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per full share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing on the later of the completion of an Initial Business Combination and 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. No warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective and current registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to such shares of Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective within 90 days from the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis. The warrants will expire five years from the consummation of an Initial Business Combination.\n\n21  \n---  \n  \nThe Company may call the outstanding warrants for redemption (excluding the Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans), in whole and not in part, at a price of $0.01 per warrant:\n\n● | at any time while the warrants are exercisable;  \n---|---  \n● | upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder;  \n● | if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the shares of Common Stock equals or exceeds $16.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations), for any 20 trading days within a 30-day trading period ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to warrant holders (the “Force-Call Provision”), and  \n● | if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying such warrants at the time of redemption and for the entire 30-day trading period referred to above and continuing each day thereafter until the date of redemption.  \n  \nThe right to exercise will be forfeited unless the warrants are exercised prior to the date specified in the notice of redemption. On and after the redemption date, a record holder of a warrant will have no further rights except to receive the redemption price for such holder’s warrant upon surrender of such warrant.\n\nThe redemption criteria for our warrants have been established at a price which is intended to provide warrant holders a reasonable premium to the initial exercise price and provide a sufficient differential between the then-prevailing share price and the warrant exercise price so that if the share price declines as a result of our redemption call, the redemption will not cause the share price to drop below the exercise price of the warrants.\n\nIf the Company calls the warrants for redemption as described above, management of the Company will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a “cashless basis.”\n\nIn addition, if (x) the Company issues additional shares of Common Stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of the Initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.50 per share of Common Stock (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company’s board of directors), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for funding the Initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Common Stock during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates the Initial Business Combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.50 per share, the Warrant Price shall be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the Market Value, and the last sales price of the Common Stock that triggers the Company’s right to redeem the Warrants pursuant to Section 6.1 below shall be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 165% of the Market Value.\n\nThe Private Placement Warrants, as well as any warrants the Company issues to the Sponsor, officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates in payment of working capital loans made to the Company, will be identical to the warrants underlying the Units offered in the Initial Public Offering.\n\n**NOTE 8 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**\n\nManagement evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date, up to the date that the financial statements were issued. Based upon this review, other than as set forth below, management did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.\n\n_October Extension_\n\nOn October 15, 2024, the Company effected the fifth drawdown of $30,000 under the Fourth Promissory Note and caused the Sponsor to deposit such sum into the Trust Account in connection with the extension of the Termination Date from October 17, 2024 to November 17, 2024. Such amounts will be distributed either to: (i) all of the holders of Public Shares upon the Company’s liquidation or (ii) holders of Public Shares who elect to have their shares redeemed in connection with (a) a vote to approve certain specified amendments to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or (b) the consummation of a Business Combination.\n\n_November Extension_\n\nOn November 14, 2024, the Company effected the sixth drawdown of $30,000 under the Fourth Promissory Note and caused the Sponsor to deposit such sum into the Trust Account in connection with the extension of the Termination Date from November 17, 2024 to December 17, 2024. Such amounts will be distributed either to: (i) all of the holders of Public Shares upon the Company’s liquidation or (ii) holders of Public Shares who elect to have their shares redeemed in connection with (a) a vote to approve certain specified amendments to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or (b) the consummation of a Business Combination.\n\n_Special Meeting of Stockholders_\n\nOn November 1, 2024, the Company filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC to amend its Certificate of Incorporation to extend the Termination Date from December 17, 2024 to the Charter Extension Date upon the deposit into the Trust Account of $30,000, to be loaned to the Company by the Sponsor or one or more of its affiliates, members or third-party designees, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date to for up to five Additional Extensions, by resolution of the Company’s board of directors, if requested by the Company’s Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2025, or a total of up to six months after December 17, 2024, unless the closing of an Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, subject to the deposit of an additional $30,000 per Additional Extension into the Trust Account by the Sponsor or its affiliates, members or third-party designees. If the proposal to extend the Termination Date is approved and effective, the Company’s stockholders may elect to redeem their shares of Common Stock. An electing stockholder will be entitled to receive a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then-outstanding shares of Common Stock issued as part of the units sold in the Initial Public Offering. This redemption right will apply to each public stockholder regardless of whether and how such holder votes on the proposal. The removal from the Trust Account of such amounts would reduce the amount remaining in the Trust Account and increase the percentage interest of the Company held by the Sponsor.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \n**Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.**\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the notes related thereto which are included in the section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including, without limitation, statements in the discussion and analysis set forth below may constitute “forward-looking statements” for purposes of federal securities laws. Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our or our management team’s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “would” and variations and similar words and expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated.

We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.\n\nReferences in this discussion and analysis to “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” refer to WinVest Acquisition Corp.\n\n_Overview_\n\nWe are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Initial Business Combination”). We intend to effectuate our Initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”), our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024 and the date of this filing, we had not commenced core operations. All activity for the period from March 1, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024 related to our formation, raising funds through our Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for an Initial Business Combination and working to consummate our Initial Business Combination with Xtribe (as defined below). We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of the Initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest and dividend income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering.\n\nThe stock exchange listing rules provide that the Initial Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the assets held in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) in the United States maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (“Continental”), as trustee (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable), at the time of the our signing a definitive agreement in connection with the Initial Business Combination. We will only complete an Initial Business Combination if the post-Initial Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target company or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target company sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully effect an Initial Business Combination.\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation (as amended, the “Certificate of Incorporation”) provided that we had until December 17, 2022 to complete an Initial Business Combination; provided, however, that if we anticipated we may not be able to consummate an Initial Business Combination by December 17, 2022, we, by resolution of the board of directors if requested by our sponsor, WinVest SPAC LLC (the “Sponsor”), could extend the period of time to consummate an Initial Business Combination up to two times, each by an additional three months (up until June 17, 2023), subject to the deposit of additional funds into the Trust Account by our Sponsor or its affiliates or designees. On November 30, 2022, we held a special meeting of stockholders (the “November 2022 Extension Meeting”) to, among other things, approve an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to extend the date by which we must consummate an Initial Business Combination (the “Termination Date”) from December 17, 2022 to January 17, 2023, and to allow us, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after January 17, 2023, by resolution of our board of directors, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2023, or a total of up to six months after the original Termination Date of December 17, 2022, unless the closing of the Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto (the “November 2022 Extension Amendment”). Our Sponsor agreed that if the November 2022 Extension Amendment was approved at the November 2022 Extension Meeting, it or one or more of its affiliates, members or third-party designees would lend to us up to $750,000 to be deposited into the Trust Account.\n\nThe stockholders approved the November 2022 Extension Amendment at the November 2022 Extension Meeting. Accordingly, on December 5, 2022, we issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $750,000 (the “First Extension Note”) to our Sponsor, pursuant to which our Sponsor agreed to loan to us up to $750,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The First Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of the Initial Business Combination and (b) our liquidation. In the event that we do not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the First Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. Upon the consummation of an Initial Business Combination, our Sponsor may elect to convert any portion or all of the amount outstanding under the First Extension Note into private warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), at a conversion price of $0.50 per private warrant. Such private warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants (as defined below) issued to our Sponsor at the time of our Initial Public Offering. The balance on the First Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $750,000.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the November 2022 Extension Amendment, the holders of 9,606,887 shares of Common Stock issued as part of the Units (as defined below) sold in our Initial Public Offering (“Public Shares”) properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.20 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $98.0 million.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \nOn June 12, 2023, we held a second special meeting of stockholders (the “June 2023 Extension Meeting”) at which the stockholders approved, among other things, (i) an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation (the “June 2023 Extension Amendment”) to extend the Termination Date from June 17, 2023 to July 17, 2023, and to allow us, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month (or such shorter period as may be requested by the Sponsor) after July 17, 2023, by resolution of our board of directors, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until December 17, 2023, or a total of up to six months after June 17, 2023, unless the closing of our Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, and (ii) an amendment (the “Redemption Limitation Amendment”) to eliminate from the Certificate of Incorporation the limitation that we may not consummate any business combination unless we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon consummation of such business combination. Following stockholder approval of the June 2023 Extension Amendment and the Redemption Limitation Amendment at the June 2023 Extension Meeting, on June 16, 2023, we filed the June 2023 Extension Amendment and the Redemption Limitation Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State.\n\nIn connection with the approval of the June 2023 Extension Amendment on June 12, 2023, on June 13, 2023, we issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $390,000 (the “Second Extension Note”) to our Sponsor, pursuant to which our Sponsor agreed to loan us up to $390,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The Second Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) our liquidation. In the event that we do not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Second Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. Upon the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, our Sponsor may elect to convert any portion or all of the amount outstanding under the Second Extension Note into private warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.50 per private warrant. Such private warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants issued to our Sponsor at the time of the Initial Public Offering. The balance on the Second Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $390,000.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the June 2023 Extension Amendment, the holders of 627,684 Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.71 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of $6,721,795. Following such redemptions, $13,551,331 was left in Trust Account and 1,265,429 Public Shares remained outstanding.\n\nOn November 30, 2023, we held a special meeting of stockholders, at which the stockholders approved, among other things, an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation (the “November 2023 Extension Amendment”) to extend the Termination Date from December 17, 2023 to January 17, 2024, and to allow us, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after January 17, 2023, by resolution of our board of directors, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2024, or a total of up to six months after December 17, 2023, unless the closing of our Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, by causing $55,000 to be deposited into the Trust Account for each such extension.\n\nIn connection with the approval of the November 2023 Extension Amendment on November 30, 2023, on December 13, 2023, we issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $330,000 (the “Third Extension Note”) to our Sponsor, pursuant to which our Sponsor agreed to loan us up to $330,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The Third Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) our liquidation. In the event that we do not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Third Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. The balance on the Third Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $330,000 and $55,000, respectively.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the November 2023 Extension Amendment, the holders of 122,306 Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.81 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $1,322,518. Following such redemptions, approximately $12,360,810 was left in the Trust Account and 1,143,123 shares of Public Shares remained outstanding.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \nOn May 9, 2024, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Original Business Combination Agreement”), by and among WinVest, WinVest Merger Sub I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of WinVest, WinVest Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of WinVest, Xtribe P.L.C., a public limited company incorporated and registered in England and Wales with number 07878011 (“Xtribe PLC”), and Xtribe Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Xtribe PLC. On September 16, 2024, we entered into an Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement (the “A&R Business Combination Agreement”), by and among WinVest, WinVest (BVI) Ltd., a British Virgin Islands business company registered with company number 2157117 and a wholly owned subsidiary of WinVest, Xtribe PLC and Xtribe (BVI) Ltd., a British Virgin Islands business company registered with company number 2157137 and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xtribe PLC (together with Xtribe PLC, “Xtribe”), which amends and restates the Original Business Combination Agreement in its entirety.\n\nOn June 3, 2024, we held a special meeting of stockholders, at which the stockholders approved, among other things, an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation (the “June 2024 Extension Amendment”) to extend the Termination Date from June 17, 2024 to July 17, 2024, and to allow us, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after July 17, 2024, by resolution of our board of directors, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until December 17, 2024, or a total of up to six months after June 17, 2024, unless the closing of our Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, by causing $30,000 to be deposited into the Trust Account for each such extension.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the June 2024 Extension Amendment, the holders of 650,790 Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $11.32 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $7,367,204. Following such redemptions, 492,333 Public Shares remained outstanding.\n\nFollowing the approval of the June 2024 Extension Amendment on June 3, 2024, on June 12, 2024, we issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $180,000 (the “Fourth Extension Note,” and collectively with the First Extension Note, the Second Extension Note and the Third Extension Note, the “Extension Notes”) to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan us up to $180,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The Fourth Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) our liquidation. In the event that we do not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Fourth Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. The balance on the Fourth Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $120,000 and $0, respectively.\n\nThrough the date of this report, we have effected drawdowns of $1,650,000 under the Extension Notes and caused such sums to be deposited into the Trust Account in connection with the extension of the Termination Date from December 17, 2022 to December 17, 2024. Such amounts will be distributed either to: (i) all of the holders of Public Shares upon our liquidation or (ii) holders of Public Shares who elect to have their shares redeemed in connection with (a) a vote to approve certain specified amendments to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or (b) the consummation of an Initial Business Combination.\n\nIf we are unable to consummate an Initial Business Combination within the allotted time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our outstanding Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay our dissolution expenses), and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders. In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, the Rights (as defined below) and Public and Private Placement Warrants will expire and will be worthless.\n\n_Results of Operations and Known Trends or Future Events_\n\nAll activities through September 30, 2024 were related to our organizational activities, preparation for our Initial Public Offering, and, after our Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for an Initial Business Combination and working to consummate our Initial Business Combination with Xtribe. We will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our Initial Business Combination. Subsequent to our Initial Public Offering on September 17, 2021, we generate non-operating income in the form of interest and dividends on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held in the Trust Account. There has been no significant change in our trading position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited financial statements. We incur ongoing expenses as a result of being a public company for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance, as well as for due diligence expenses.\n\n26  \n---  \n  \nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net loss was $1,430,395 and expenses from operating activities were $1,724,753, as compared to a net loss of $966,681 and expenses from operating activities of $1,476,911 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were mainly due to an increase in legal and professional fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to efforts being made to complete our Initial Business Combination with Xtribe. We intend to use our operating cash held outside the Trust Account primarily to evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete an Initial Business Combination.\n\n_Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern_\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $548 in our operating bank account and a working capital deficit of $4,928,551, as compared to $37,946 in our operating bank account and a working capital deficit of $2,717,064 as of December 31, 2023. Our liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering had been satisfied through proceeds from advances from a related party, our Sponsor, and from the issuance of Common Stock. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, liquidity has been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the proceeds from our Sponsor’s purchase of Private Placement Warrants held outside of our Trust Account and loans from the Sponsor. We believe we will need to access additional liquidity in order to consummate an Initial Business Combination.\n\nOn March 16, 2021, we issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor, which note was amended on March 27, 2022 (the “March 2021 Promissory Note”), pursuant to which we may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $300,000, of which $300,000 was outstanding under the March 2021 Promissory Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The March 2021 Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the date on which we consummate an Initial Business Combination. The Sponsor may elect to convert any portion or all of the amount outstanding under the March 2021 Promissory Note into warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.50 per warrant, with each warrant entitling the holder thereof to acquire one-half share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share, commencing on the date of our Initial Business Combination. No such conversions have yet occurred. During 2023, we effected drawdowns of $300,000 under the March 2021 Promissory Note. These amounts remain outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The purpose of each drawdown is for the payment of expenses associated with operations and those necessary to initiate an Initial Business Combination.\n\nOn September 17, 2021, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 10,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of Common Stock, one redeemable warrant (the “Public Warrant”), with each Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one-half (1/2) of one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustment, and one right (the “Right”), with each Right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-fifteenth (1/15) of one share of Common Stock upon the consummation by us of an Initial Business Combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses).\n\nSimultaneously with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the issuance and sale of the Units, we completed the private sale of 10,000,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants,” and collectively with the Public Warrants, the “Warrants”) at a price of $0.50 per Private Placement Warrant to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $5,000,000 (such sale, the “Private Placement”). Each Private Placement Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one-half of one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustment. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants.\n\nOn September 23, 2021, our underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option and purchased an additional 1,500,000 Units (the “Over-Allotment Units”), generating gross proceeds of $15,000,000 on September 27, 2021. Simultaneously with the sale of Over-Allotment Units, we consummated a private sale of an additional 900,000 Private Placement Warrants (the “Additional Private Placement Warrants”) to the Sponsor at a purchase price of $0.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds of $450,000.\n\n27  \n---  \n  \nWe paid a total of $2,400,000 in underwriting discounts, expenses and commissions (not including deferred underwriting commissions of $4,025,000 payable only upon completion of our Initial Business Combination) and $523,969 for other costs and expenses related to the Initial Public Offering, resulting in aggregate net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and overallotment of $112,076,031.\n\nAs of September 27, 2021, a total of $116,150,000 of the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants and the Additional Private Placement Warrants were deposited in the Trust Account, and we had $638,000 of cash held outside of the Trust Account, after payment of costs related to the Initial Public Offering.\n\nOn December 5, 2022, we issued the First Extension Note to our Sponsor in the principal amount of $750,000. On December 5, 2022, we effected the first drawdown of $125,000 under the First Extension Note and caused the Sponsor to deposit such sum into the Trust Account in connection with the extension of the Termination Date from December 17, 2022 to January 17, 2023. During 2023, we effected drawdowns of $625,000 under the First Extension Note and caused such sums to be deposited into the Trust Account in connection with the extension of the Termination Date from January 17, 2023 to June 17, 2023.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the November 2022 Extension Amendment, the holders of 9,606,887 shares of Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.20 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $98.0 million.\n\nOn June 13, 2023, we issued the Second Extension Note to our Sponsor in the principal amount of $390,000. During 2023, we effected drawdowns of $390,000 under the Second Extension Note and caused such sums to be deposited into the Trust Account in connection with the extension of the Termination Date from June 17, 2023 to December 17, 2023.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the June 2023 Extension Amendment, the holders of 627,684 shares of Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.71 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $6,721,795.\n\nOn October 31, 2023, we issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor (the “October 2023 Promissory Note”), pursuant to which we may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000. As of September 30, 2024, we had effected drawdowns of $709,200 under the October 2023 Promissory Note. The October 2023 Promissory Note does not bear interest and matures upon the closing of the Initial Business Combination. In the event that we do not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the October 2023 Promissory Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. The purpose of each drawdown is for the payment of expenses associated with operations and those necessary to initiate an Initial Business Combination.\n\nIn connection with the approval of the November 2023 Extension Amendment on November 30, 2023, on December 13, 2023, we issued the Third Extension Note to our Sponsor, pursuant to which our Sponsor agreed to loan us up to $330,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The balance on the Third Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 was $330,000.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the November 2023 Extension Amendment, the holders of 122,306 shares of Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.81 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $1,322,518. Following such redemptions, 1,143,123 shares of Public Shares remained outstanding.\n\nIn connection with the approval of the June 2024 Extension Amendment on June 3, 2024, on June 12, 2024, we issued the Fourth Extension Note to our Sponsor, pursuant to which our Sponsor agreed to loan us up to $180,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The balance on the Fourth Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 was $120,000.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the June 2024 Extension Amendment, the holders of 650,790 Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $11.32 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $7,367,204. Following such redemptions, 492,333 Public Shares remained outstanding.\n\n28  \n---  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash held in the Trust Account of approximately $5.8 million. We intend to use substantially all of the remaining funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account, which interest shall be net of taxes payable, to complete our Initial Business Combination. We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account to pay taxes and up to $100,000 of dissolution expenses, if any. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to consummate an Initial Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.\n\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis that we will continue as a going concern, which assumes the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2024, we had not commenced any operations. All activity for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relates to identifying a target company for an Initial Business Combination and working to consummate our Initial Business Combination with Xtribe. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of the Initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest and dividend income on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. Our ability to commence operations is contingent upon consummating an Initial Business Combination. We currently have until December 17, 2024 to consummate our Initial Business Combination, which is 39 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering. We will not be able to consummate our Initial Business Combination by December 17, 2024.\n\nManagement’s plan to address the December 17, 2024 liquidation is to seek stockholder approval for, and to file, an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation. Pursuant to a preliminary proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on November 1, 2024, we are proposing to amend our Certificate of Incorporation to extend the Termination Date from December 17, 2024 to January 17, 2025 (the “Charter Extension Date”) upon the deposit into the Trust Account of $30,000, to be loaned to us by our Sponsor or one or more of its affiliates, members or third-party designees, and to allow us, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after the Charter Extension Date (each, an “Additional Extension”), by resolution of our board of directors, if requested by our Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2025, or a total of up to six months after December 17, 2024, unless the closing of an Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, subject to the deposit an additional $30,000 per Additional Extension into the Trust Account by our Sponsor or its affiliates, members or third-party designees (the “Charter Extension Amendment”). If the Charter Extension Amendment is approved and effective, our public stockholders may elect to redeem their Public Shares. An electing stockholder will be entitled to receive a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then-outstanding Public Shares. This redemption right will apply to each holder of Public Shares regardless of whether and how such holder votes on the proposal. The removal from the Trust Account of such amounts would reduce the amount remaining in the Trust Account and increase the percentage interest of the Company held by our Sponsor. Due to the reasons stated above, we believe we may not have sufficient liquidity through the date of an Initial Business Combination, if extended through June 17, 2025.\n\nTo the extent we are unable to consummate an Initial Business Combination, we will need to pay the costs of liquidation from our current available funds outside the Trust Account, including the approximate amount of $290,800 still available to us under the October 2023 Promissory Note as of September 30, 2024, and from up to $100,000 of interest income on the balance of the Trust Account (net of income and other tax obligations) that may be released to us to pay for dissolution expenses. If such funds are insufficient, our Sponsor has agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses. Based on these circumstances, management has determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to insufficient liquidity, the uncertainty of liquidity requirements and the mandatory liquidation date within one year.\n\nAccordingly, the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\n29  \n---  \n  \nWe do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities as of September 30, 2024, other than an agreement to pay our Sponsor a monthly fee of $10,000 for office space, secretarial, and administrative support services provided to the Company. We began incurring these fees on September 14, 2021 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of an Initial Business Combination or the Company’s liquidation.\n\nDeferred underwriting discounts and commissions in an amount equal to 3.5% of the gross proceeds raised in the Initial Public Offering, or $4,025,000, will be payable to the underwriters upon the consummation of our Initial Business Combination and will be held in the Trust Account until the consummation of such Initial Business Combination.\n\n_Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements_\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.\n\n_Critical Accounting Estimates_\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Management has determined that the Company has no critical accounting estimates.\n\n_Recent Accounting Pronouncements_\n\nIn June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) (“ASU 2022-03”). The amendments in ASU 2022-03 clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The amendments in this Update also require additional disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The provisions in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 for public business entities. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect to early adopt this ASU. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on the balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nASU 2023-09 requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The new standard is effective for public entities with annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted and should be applied prospectively with the option of retrospective application. We do not expect to early adopt this ASU. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nWe do not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements.\n\n**ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK**\n\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and are not required to provide the information under this item.\n\n30  \n---  \n  \n**ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.**\n\n_Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures_\n\nDisclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our “Certifying Officer”), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the protection of funds permitted for withdrawal from the Trust Account, the Company’s non-compliance with the investment management trust agreement and incorrectly filing income taxes in the state of Delaware.\n\nWe do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\n\n_Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting_\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n**PART II - OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1. Legal Proceedings**\n\nNone.\n\n**Item 1A. Risk Factors**\n\nThere have been no material changes to the risk factors identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed on April 15, 2024, except as set forth below:\n\n**_There are no assurances that the Charter Extension Amendment will enable us to complete an Initial Business Combination._**\n\nApproving the Charter Extension Amendment involves a number of risks. Even if the Charter Extension Amendment is approved, we can provide no assurances that the Initial Business Combination will be consummated prior to June 17, 2025. Our ability to consummate any Initial Business Combination is dependent on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. We are required to offer stockholders the opportunity to redeem shares in connection with the vote to approve the Charter Extension Amendment, and we will be required to offer stockholders redemption rights again in connection with any stockholder vote to approve the Initial Business Combination. Even if the Charter Extension Amendment is approved by our stockholders, it is possible that redemptions will leave us with insufficient cash to consummate the Initial Business Combination on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. The fact that we will have separate redemption periods in connection with the Charter Extension Amendment vote and the Initial Business Combination vote could exacerbate these risks. Other than in connection with a redemption offer or liquidation, our stockholders may be unable to recover their investment except through sales of our Public Shares on the open market. The price of our Public Shares may be volatile, and there can be no assurance that stockholders will be able to dispose of their Public Shares at favorable prices, or at all.\n\n31  \n---  \n  \n**_The Excise Tax included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 may decrease the value of our securities following our Initial Business Combination, hinder our ability to consummate an Initial Business Combination and decrease the amount of funds available for distribution in connection with a liquidation._**\n\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, imposes a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased by “covered corporations” beginning on January 1, 2023, with certain exceptions (the “Excise Tax”). The Excise Tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which the stock is repurchased. The amount of the Excise Tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the Excise Tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year.\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury Department”) has authority to promulgate regulations and provide other guidance regarding the Excise Tax. In December 2022, the Treasury Department issued Notice 2023-2, indicating its intention to propose such regulations and issuing certain interim rules on which taxpayers may rely. Under the interim rules, liquidating distributions made by publicly traded domestic corporations are exempt from the Excise Tax. In addition, any redemptions that occur in the same taxable year in which a liquidation is completed will also be exempt from such tax. Redemptions of our Public Shares in connection with an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation or in connection with an Initial Business Combination may subject us to the Excise Tax unless one of the two exceptions above apply.\n\nIf the Charter Extension Amendment is approved, our public stockholders will have the right to require us to redeem their public stock. Any redemption or other repurchase that we make in connection with the Charter Extension Amendment may be subject to the Excise Tax. Consequently, the value of our stockholder’s investment in our securities may decrease and the amount our stockholders may receive upon redemption may be negatively impacted as a result of the Excise Tax to the extent we do not liquidate by December 31, 2024. Whether and to what extent we would be subject to the Excise Tax would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with our Initial Business Combination, (ii) the structure of an Initial Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any “PIPE” or other equity issuances in connection with an Initial Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with an Initial Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of an Initial Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury Department. In addition, because the Excise Tax would be payable by us, and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the Excise Tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available for a stockholder redemption, could cause a reduction in the cash available to complete an Initial Business Combination and could have an adverse effect on our ability to complete an Initial Business Combination.\n\n**_We are required by the Nasdaq Listing Rules to consummate an Initial Business Combination within 36 months of the effectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement. As a result of our failure to consummate an Initial Business Combination within this time period, our securities could be subject to delisting._**\n\nPursuant to IM-5101-2(b) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we must consummate an Initial Business Combination by the 36-month anniversary of the effectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement, or September 14, 2024 (the “Nasdaq Deadline”). We did not complete an Initial Business Combination prior to the Nasdaq Deadline. As a result, we are in violation of Nasdaq IM-5101-2.\n\n32  \n---  \n  \nAs previously reported, on September 17, 2024, we received a written notice (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Capital Market, LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that we had failed to comply with Nasdaq Listing Rules IM-5101-2. On September 24, 2024, we timely requested a hearing before The Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”), which was held on November 12, 2024. As of the date of this filing, we have not yet received a written decision from the Panel with the results of the hearing. Our securities will continue to trade on Nasdaq until the hearing process concludes and the Panel issues a written decision. However, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant our request for a suspension of delisting or continued listing on Nasdaq. If the Panel does not grant our request, our securities will be delisted from Nasdaq. Additionally, even if the Panel grants our request, the proposed extension of the Termination Date to June 17, 2025 would exceed the six-month extension the Company has requested from the Panel (the “Nasdaq Extension”). As a result, if the Nasdaq Extension is granted and the Charter Extension Amendment is approved but we do not complete an Initial Business Combination prior to the expiration of the Nasdaq Extension, Nasdaq may issue a Staff Delisting Determination under Rule 5810 to delist our securities. If Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\n● | the price of our securities will likely decrease as a result of the loss of market efficiencies associated with being listed on Nasdaq;  \n---|---  \n● | holders may be unable to sell or purchase our securities when they wish to do so;  \n● | we may become subject to shareholder litigation;  \n● | we may lose the interest of institutional investors in our securities;  \n● | we may lose media and analyst coverage; and  \n● | we would likely lose any active trading market for our securities, as our securities may then only be traded on one of the over-the-counter markets, if at all.  \n  \n**_Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange following redemptions by our stockholders in connection with approval of the Charter Extension Amendment, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions._**\n\nOur Common Stock, Units, Warrants and Rights are listed on Nasdaq. After the Stockholder Meeting, we may be required to demonstrate compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements in order to maintain the listing of our securities on Nasdaq. Such continued listing requirements for our Common Stock include, among other things, the requirement to maintain at least 300 public holders, at least 500,000 publicly held shares and a market value of publicly held shares of $1.0 million. Pursuant to the terms of our Certificate of Incorporation, in connection with the Charter Extension Amendment, stockholders may elect to redeem their Public Shares and, as a result, we may not be in compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements.\n\nIf our securities do not meet Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements, Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange. If Nasdaq delists any of our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list such securities on another approved national securities exchange, we expect that such securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: (i) a limited availability of market quotations for our securities, (ii) reduced liquidity for our securities, (iii) a determination that our Public Shares are a “penny stock,” which will require brokers trading in our Public Shares to adhere to more stringent rules, including being subject to the depository requirements of Rule 419 of the Securities Act, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities, (iv) a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company, (v) a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future, and (vi) a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business in connection with a business combination. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as “covered securities.” Our Common Stock, Units, Warrants and Rights qualify as covered securities under such statute. If we were no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities would not qualify as covered securities under such statute and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\n\n33  \n---  \n  \n**_The Company has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. If the Company is unable to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the Company may not be able to accurately report its financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in the Company and materially and adversely affect the Company’s business and operating results._**\n\nDuring the preparation of the Company’s financial statements as of and for the period ended September 30, 2023, the Company identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting related to incorrectly filing income taxes in the state of Delaware. The Company filed an amended return in Delaware and will file its income tax returns in the U.S., Massachusetts, and Florida jurisdictions.\n\nDuring the preparation of the Company’s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the period ended March 31, 2024, the Company identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting related to its Trust Account withdrawals. In 2023, the Company withdrew $898,940 of interest and dividend income earned in the Trust Account, which was restricted for payment of the Company’s tax liabilities as provided in the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation. In the period ended March 31, 2024, the Company withdrew $40,050 of interest and dividend income earned in the Trust Account and received a tax refund of $104,305 that was previously paid with the interest and dividend income earned on the Trust Account. During both the year ended December 31, 2023 and the periods ended June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, portions of these funds were inadvertently used for the payments of general operating expenses. Such amounts were disbursed without appropriate review and approval to ensure that the disbursements were made in accordance with the investment management trust agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company and the Company. As a result of this issue, management concluded that a material weakness exists in our internal control over financial reporting related to the review and approval of cash disbursements.\n\n**Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds**\n\nFor a description of the use of the proceeds generated in our Initial Public Offering, see Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q.\n\n**Item 3.

A copy of the proposed amendment is set forth in _Annex B_ to the accompanying proxy statement; and  \n3. | _Proposal No. 3 — Adjournment Proposal —_ To adjourn the Stockholder Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies if, based upon the tabulated vote at the time of the Stockholder Meeting, there are insufficient shares of our Common Stock represented (either in person (including virtually) or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the Stockholder Meeting or at the time of the Stockholder Meeting to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal.  \n  \nEach of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal is more fully described in the accompanying proxy statement. Please take the time to read carefully each of the proposals in the accompanying proxy statement before you vote.\n\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved and the Company determines to effect the Charter Extension, prior to filing an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State to effectuate the Charter Extension and entering into the Trust Amendment with Continental, the Sponsor (or one or more of its affiliates, members or third-party designees, including, but not limited to, any parties to a business combination agreement (including the Business Combination Agreement (as defined below)) or their affiliates) (the “Lender”) shall lend the Company $30,000 (the “Monthly Extension Payment”), which the Company shall deposit into the Trust Account, upon the Company’s first drawdown under a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note in the amount of up to $180,000 to be issued by the Company to the Lender (the “Note”). In addition, if the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved and the Charter Extension becomes effective, in the event that we have not consummated an initial business combination by January 17, 2025, without approval of our public stockholders, we may, by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, extend the Termination Date and Liquidation Date up to five times, each by one additional month (or such shorter period as the Sponsor shall request) (for a total of up to six additional months to complete an initial business combination), provided that we draw down and deposit into the Trust Account, for each such extension, the Monthly Extension Payment, for an additional aggregate deposit of up to $150,000 (if all five additional extensions are exercised). If we complete an initial business combination, we will repay the amounts loaned under the Note. If we do not complete an initial business combination by the applicable Termination Date, such Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. If the Sponsor designates a third party as Lender, we may negotiate with the Lender and vary the terms of the Note, issue securities and pay certain fees to the Lender in connection with the Note.\n\nThe purpose of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal is to allow the Company additional time to complete its previously announced Business Combination (as defined below) with Xtribe P.L.C., a public limited company incorporated and registered in England and Wales with number 07878011 (“Xtribe PLC”). On September 16, 2024, WinVest entered into an Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”), by and among WinVest, WinVest (BVI) Ltd., a British Virgin Islands business company registered with company number 2157117 and a wholly owned subsidiary of WinVest (“WinVest BVI”), Xtribe PLC and Xtribe (BVI) Ltd., a British Virgin Islands business company registered with company number 2157137 and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xtribe PLC (“Xtribe BVI”), which amended and restated a business combination agreement entered into by and among WinVest, Xtribe PLC and certain affiliates thereof on May 9, 2024 in its entirety. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement (and subject to the conditions and terms therein), a business combination between WinVest and Xtribe BVI will be effected through the following transactions: (i) Xtribe PLC will contribute substantially all of its assets and certain of its liabilities to Xtribe BVI and thereafter be dissolved, (ii) WinVest will merge with and into WinVest BVI, whereupon the separate existence of WinVest will cease and WinVest BVI will continue as the surviving entity incorporated under the BVI Business Companies Act (as revised) of the British Virgin Islands, as amended to date (the “BVI Companies Act”), and (iii) promptly thereafter, Xtribe BVI will merge with and into WinVest BVI, whereupon the separate existence of Xtribe BVI will cease and WinVest BVI will be the surviving entity incorporated under the BVI Companies Act (such transactions, collectively, the “Business Combination”). In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, WinVest BVI will be renamed “Xtribe Holding (BVI) Ltd.” **You are not being asked to vote on an initial business combination, including the Business Combination, at this time.**\n\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that we have until the Current Termination Date to complete an initial business combination. The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company to seek an extension of the Current Termination Date and the Liquidation Date and have the Company’s stockholders approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal to allow for a period of additional time to consummate the Business Combination. Although we are using our best efforts to complete the Business Combination as contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement as soon as practicable, without the Charter Extension, we do not believe we will be able to complete an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) on or before the Current Termination Date. If that were to occur, we would be precluded from completing the Business Combination or any other initial business combination and would be forced to liquidate. If we are unable to effect the Charter Extension, we will not be able to extend the Current Termination Date.\n\nThe Company’s Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (“Nasdaq”). Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2(b) requires that special purpose acquisition companies (“SPACs”), such as the Company, complete one or more business combinations by the 36-month anniversary of the effectiveness of their initial public offering registration statement, which date, in the case of the Company, was September 14, 2024 (the “Nasdaq Deadline”). We did not complete an initial business combination prior to the Nasdaq Deadline. As a result, we are in violation of Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2.\n\nAs previously reported, on September 17, 2024, we received a written notice (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that we had failed to comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2. On September 24, 2024, we timely requested a hearing before The Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) to appeal the Notice and to request an additional six-month extension (the “Nasdaq Extension”) to close the Business Combination, which request stayed the suspension of trading on our securities. Our hearing before the Panel is scheduled for November 12, 2024. Our securities will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market until the hearing process concludes and the Panel issues a written decision. However, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant our request for a suspension of delisting or continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. If the Panel does not grant our request, our securities will be delisted from Nasdaq. Additionally, even if the Panel grants our request, the proposed extension of the Termination Date to June 17, 2025 would exceed the Nasdaq Extension. As a result, if the Nasdaq Extension is granted and the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved but we do not complete an initial business combination prior to the expiration of the Nasdaq Extension, Nasdaq may commence proceedings to delist our Common Stock. The announcement of delisting proceedings may adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock and, if our Common Stock is delisted, there may no longer be an active trading market for such Common Stock. In addition, the potential or actual delisting of our Common Stock may also adversely affect our ability to consummate an initial business combination, including the Business Combination. For more information see “ _Risk Factors — We are required by the Nasdaq Listing Rules to consummate an initial business combination within 36 months of the effectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement. As a result of our failure to consummate an initial business combination within this time period, our securities could be subject to delisting.”_\n\nWe reserve the right at any time to cancel the Stockholder Meeting and not to submit to our stockholders the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal and implement the Charter Extension and the Trust Amendment. In the event the Stockholder Meeting is cancelled, and the Business Combination is not consummated prior to the Current Termination Date, we will dissolve and liquidate in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation.\n\nWe believe that it is in the best interests of our stockholders that we obtain the Charter Extension. After careful consideration of all relevant factors, the Board has determined that the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal are each in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, has declared it advisable and recommends that you vote or give instruction to vote “FOR” the Extension Amendment Proposal, “FOR” the Trust Amendment Proposal and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.\n\nAs contemplated by the Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of shares of Common Stock issued as part of the units sold in our IPO (the “Public Stock”) may elect to redeem all or a portion of their Public Stock in exchange for their pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account if the Charter Extension is implemented (the “Redemption”), regardless of how such public stockholders vote in regard to the Extension Amendment Proposal. **If the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved by the requisite vote of stockholders (and not abandoned), holders of Public Stock remaining after the Redemption will retain their right to redeem their Public Stock for their pro rata portion of the funds available in the Trust Account upon consummation of an initial business combination, or if we do not complete an initial business combination, by the applicable Termination Date.**\n\nWe will not use the proceeds placed in the Trust Account and the interest earned thereon to pay any excise taxes that may be imposed on us pursuant to any current, pending or future rules or laws, including without limitation any excise tax due imposed under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 on any redemptions or stock buybacks by the Company. In the event (i) an excise tax and/or any other similar fees or taxes in nature are levied or imposed on us pursuant to any current, pending or future rule(s) or law(s), including without limitation any excise tax imposed under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 in relation to a redemption of securities as described herein or otherwise, and (ii) the holders of our shares of Common Stock approve the Extension Amendment Proposal, if such excise tax or fee has not been paid by us to the applicable regulatory authority on or prior to the due date for such a tax or fee, our Sponsor or a designee agrees to promptly (but in any event sufficiently prior to the due date for such tax or fee to assure timely payment thereof) either directly pay such tax or fee on behalf of us or advance to us such funds as necessary and appropriate to allow us to pay such tax or fee timely with respect to any future redemptions that occur prior to or in connection with a business combination or our liquidation. The Sponsor agrees not to seek recourse for such expenses from the Trust Account.\n\nOn , 2024, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of the accompanying proxy statement, the redemption price per share was approximately $ (which is expected to be the same approximate amount two business days prior to the Stockholder Meeting), based on the aggregate amount on deposit in the Trust Account of approximately $ as of , 2024 (including interest not previously released to the Company to pay its income or other tax obligations), divided by the total number of then-outstanding shares of Public Stock. The redemption price per share will increase between , 2024 and the date that is two business days prior to the Stockholder Meeting due to any interest that accrues on the amount on deposit in the Trust Account prior to such date (less any amounts released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations between such dates). If the closing price of the Public Stock was to remain the same until the date of the Stockholder Meeting, exercising redemption rights would result in a public stockholder receiving approximately $ more per share than if the shares were sold in the open market (based on the current per share redemption price and the closing price of our Public Stock as reported on Nasdaq on , 2024). We cannot assure stockholders that they will be able to sell their Public Stock in the open market, even if the market price per share is lower than the redemption price stated above, as there may not be sufficient liquidity in our securities when such stockholders wish to sell their shares. We believe that such redemption right enables our public stockholders to determine whether or not to sustain their investments for an additional period if we do not complete the Business Combination on or before the Current Termination Date.\n\nApproval of both the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal is a condition to the implementation of the Charter Extension. If the Charter Extension is implemented, the amount held in the Trust Account will be reduced by withdrawals in connection with the Redemption. We cannot predict the amount that will remain in the Trust Account following the Redemption if the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved, and the amount remaining in the Trust Account may be only a small fraction of the $ that was in the Trust Account as of , 2024 (including interest not previously released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations).\n\nIf either the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal are not approved and the Business Combination is not completed on or before the Current Termination Date, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the Public Stock, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations, if any (less up to $100,000 of such interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the total number of the then-outstanding shares of Public Stock, which Redemption will completely extinguish our public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such Redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and the Board, in accordance with applicable law, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the each case to the Company’s obligations under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no distribution from the Trust Account with respect to our warrants or rights, which will expire worthless in the event of our winding up.\n\nIn the event of a liquidation, the Sponsor, our officers, our current and former directors and certain members of our advisory board (collectively, the “Initial Stockholders”) will not receive any monies held in the Trust Account as a result of their ownership of an aggregate of 2,875,000 shares of Common Stock issued prior to the IPO (the “Founder Shares”), and the Sponsor will not receive any monies held in the Trust Account as a result of its ownership of 10,900,000 Private Placement Warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 5,450,000 shares of Common Stock. As a consequence, a liquidating distribution will be made only with respect to the Public Stock.\n\nIf we liquidate, the Sponsor has agreed to indemnify us to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or any claims by a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement (including the Business Combination Agreement), reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) $10.10 per share of Public Stock or (ii) the actual amount per share of Public Stock held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.10 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable), nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We cannot assure you, however, that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Based upon the current amount in the Trust Account, the per-share price at which shares of Public Stock would be redeemed from cash held in the Trust Account would be approximately $ . Nevertheless, we cannot assure you that the per share distribution from the Trust Account, if we liquidate, will not be less than $ , plus interest, due to unforeseen claims of creditors.\n\nUnder the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. Because WinVest will not be complying with Section 280 of the DGCL, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires it to adopt a plan, based on facts known to it at such time, that will provide for the payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against WinVest within the subsequent 10 years. However, because WinVest is a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and its operations are limited to seeking to complete an initial business combination, the only likely claims to arise would be from vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.), prospective target businesses or potentially claims related to the excise tax under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.\n\nTO EXERCISE YOUR REDEMPTION RIGHTS, YOU MUST DEMAND IN WRITING THAT YOUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE REDEEMED FOR A PRO RATA PORTION OF THE FUNDS HELD IN THE TRUST ACCOUNT AND TENDER YOUR SHARES TO OUR TRANSFER AGENT AT LEAST TWO BUSINESS DAYS PRIOR TO THE VOTE AT THE STOCKHOLDER MEETING. IN ORDER TO EXERCISE YOUR REDEMPTION RIGHT, YOU NEED TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF AS A BENEFICIAL HOLDER AND PROVIDE YOUR LEGAL NAME, PHONE NUMBER AND ADDRESS IN YOUR WRITTEN DEMAND. YOU MAY TENDER YOUR SHARES BY EITHER DELIVERING YOUR SHARE CERTIFICATE TO THE TRANSFER AGENT OR BY DELIVERING YOUR SHARES ELECTRONICALLY USING THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY’S DWAC (DEPOSIT WITHDRAWAL AT CUSTODIAN) SYSTEM. IF YOU HOLD THE SHARES IN STREET NAME, YOU WILL NEED TO INSTRUCT THE ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE AT YOUR BANK OR BROKER TO WITHDRAW THE SHARES FROM YOUR ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO EXERCISE YOUR REDEMPTION RIGHTS.\n\nWith respect to the regulation of SPACs like the Company, on January 24, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) adopted final rules (the “SPAC Final Rules”) relating to, among other items, the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). The SPAC Final Rules became effective on July 1, 2024.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of the Company being deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act) and thus subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, prior to the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement pursuant to which the Company registered its securities offered in the IPO (the “IPO Registration Statement”), we instructed the Trustee to liquidate the U.S. government treasury obligations or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter to maintain all funds in the Trust Account in cash in an interest-bearing bank account until the earlier of the consummation of an initial business combination or our liquidation. Although we subsequently reinvested such funds in marketable securities, we could instruct the Trustee to liquidate the securities held in the Trust Account again in the future. As a result of any such liquidation, we may receive less interest, if any, on the funds held in the Trust Account than if the assets in the Trust Account had remained in U.S. government securities or money market funds. However, interest previously earned on the funds held in the Trust Account still may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any, and certain other expenses as permitted. As a result, our liquidation of the securities held in the Trust Account and the holding of all funds in the Trust Account in cash could reduce the dollar amount our public stockholders would receive upon any Redemption or the liquidation of the Company. See “ _Risk Factors — We have in the past instructed the Trustee to liquidate the securities held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in cash, and we could do so again in the future. As a result of any such liquidation, we may receive less interest, if any, on the funds held in the Trust Account, which would reduce the dollar amount our public stockholders would receive upon any Redemption or the liquidation of the Company._ ”\n\nApproval of each of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock.\n\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock who are present in person (including virtually) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the Stockholder Meeting. The Adjournment Proposal will only be put forth for a vote if there are insufficient shares of Common Stock present at the Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum or there are not sufficient votes to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal at the Stockholder Meeting.\n\nRecord holders of Common Stock at the close of business on November 5, 2024 (the “Record Date”) are entitled to vote or have their votes cast at the Stockholder Meeting. On the Record Date, there were 492,333 issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock held by public stockholders and 2,875,000 issued and outstanding Founder Shares held by the Initial Stockholders. Our warrants and rights do not have voting rights.\n\nOur Initial Stockholders intend to vote all of their Founder Shares in favor of the proposals being presented at the Stockholder Meeting and have, pursuant to a letter agreement, agreed to, among other things, waive their redemption rights with respect to any Common Stock held by them in connection with this Stockholder Meeting. The Founder Shares will be excluded from the pro rata calculation used to determine the per-share redemption price. As of the date of the accompanying proxy statement, the Initial Stockholders hold approximately 85.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, of which (i) approximately 75.4% is held by our Sponsor, (ii) approximately 7.4% is held by our officers and current and former directors and (iii) approximately 2.6% is held by certain members of our advisory board (in each of (ii) and (iii), excluding any securities indirectly owned by such officers, directors or advisory board members as a result of their membership interest in the Sponsor). As a result, approval of each of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal will not require the affirmative vote of any shares of Public Stock.\n\nThe accompanying proxy statement contains important information about the Stockholder Meeting, the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Whether or not you plan to attend the Stockholder Meeting, we urge you to read this material carefully and vote your shares.\n\nThe accompanying proxy statement is dated , 2024 and is first being mailed to stockholders on or about that date.\n\nBy Order of the Board of Directors of WinVest Acquisition Corp.  \n---  \nLawrence S.

Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements reflect the current views of WinVest Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (“WinVest,” or the “Company”), with respect to, among other things, the Company’s ability to complete an initial business combination. In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of terminology such as “outlook,” “believes,” “expects,” “potential,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “seeks,” “approximately,” “predicts,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “anticipates” or the negative version of these words or other comparable words or phrases.\n\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this proxy statement reflect the Company’s current views about future events and are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that may cause its actual results to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. The Company does not guarantee that the transactions and events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all). The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements:\n\n● | our ability to complete an initial business combination (including the Business Combination (as defined below));  \n---|---  \n● | the anticipated benefits of an initial business combination (including the Business Combination);  \n● | the issuance by the SEC of final rules to regulate special purpose acquisition companies (“SPACs”);  \n● | the risk of the Company being deemed an “investment company” for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”);  \n● | the volatility of the market price and liquidity of the Public Stock (as defined below) and other securities of the Company;  \n● | our liquidation of the securities held in the Trust Account (as defined below) to avoid being deemed an investment company;  \n● | the potential impact of the Excise Tax (as defined below);  \n● | the delisting of our securities from the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (“Nasdaq”) or an inability to have our securities listed on Nasdaq following an initial business combination; and  \n● | the use of funds not held in the Trust Account or available to the Company from interest income on the Trust Account balance.  \n  \nWhile forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future performance. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, data or methods, future events or other changes after the date of this proxy statement, except as required by applicable law. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could cause our future results, performance or transactions to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement, please see the section titled “ _Risk Factors_ ” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024, and in other reports we file with the SEC. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are based only on information currently available to us (or to third parties making the forward-looking statements).\n\n1  \n---  \n  \n**QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE STOCKHOLDER MEETING**\n\nThe questions and answers below highlight only selected information from this proxy statement and only briefly address some commonly asked questions about this special meeting of stockholders (the “Stockholder Meeting”) and the proposals to be presented at the Stockholder Meeting. The following questions and answers do not include all the information that is important to our stockholders. Stockholders are urged to read carefully this entire proxy statement, including the other documents referred to herein, to fully understand the proposals to be presented at the Stockholder Meeting and the voting procedures for the Stockholder Meeting, which will be held on , 2024, at a.m., Eastern Time, as a virtual meeting, or at such other time, on such other date and at such other place to which the meeting may be postponed or adjourned. You can participate in the meeting, vote, and submit questions via live webcast by visiting https://www.cstproxy.com/winvestacquisition/ext2024.\n\n**Q:** | **Why am I receiving this proxy statement?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.  \n  \nOn September 17, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (the “IPO”) of units (“Units”), each consisting of one share of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock,” and the Common Stock issued as part of the Units, the “Public Stock”), one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”) to purchase one-half of one share of Common Stock and one right (“Right”) to receive one-fifteenth of one share of Common Stock. Following the closing of the IPO, and the subsequent full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment on September 27, 2021, $116,150,000 ($10.10 per Unit) from the net proceeds of (i) the sale of the Units in the IPO and (ii) the concurrent sale of private warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants,” and, collectively with the Public Warrants, the “Warrants”) to WinVest SPAC LLC (the “Sponsor”) was placed in a trust account established at the consummation of the IPO that holds certain of the proceeds of the IPO and the Private Placement Warrants (the “Trust Account”).\n\nLike most blank check companies, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), initially provided for the return of the IPO proceeds held in the Trust Account to the holders of shares of our Public Stock if there was no qualifying initial business combination(s) consummated on or before December 17, 2022. On November 30, 2022, we held a special meeting of stockholders to approve an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to extend the date by which we have to consummate an initial business combination (the “Termination Date”) from December 17, 2022 to January 17, 2023, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after such date, by resolution of the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”), if requested by the Sponsor, upon the deposit of $125,000 per monthly extension into the Trust Account and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2023, or a total of up to six months after December 17, 2022, unless the closing of the Company’s initial business combination shall have occurred prior thereto. After exercising all five such monthly extensions and extending the Termination Date to June 17, 2023, on June 12, 2023, we held a second special meeting of stockholders to approve an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to extend the Termination Date from June 17, 2023 to July 17, 2023, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after such date, by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor, upon the deposit of $65,000 per monthly extension into the Trust Account and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until December 17, 2023, or a total of up to six months after June 17, 2023, unless the closing of the Company’s initial business combination shall have occurred prior thereto. After exercising all five such monthly extensions and extending the Termination Date to December 17, 2023, on November 30, 2023, we held a third special meeting of stockholders to approve an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to extend the Termination Date from December 17, 2023 to January 17, 2024, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after such date, by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor, upon the deposit of $55,000 per monthly extension into the Trust Account and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2024, or a total of up to six months after December 17, 2023, unless the closing of the Company’s initial business combination shall have occurred prior thereto. After exercising all five such monthly extensions and extending the Termination Date to June 17, 2024, on June 3, 2024, we held a fourth special meeting of stockholders to approve an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to extend the Termination Date from June 17, 2024 to July 17, 2024, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after such date, by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor, upon the deposit of $30,000 per monthly extension into the Trust Account and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until December 17, 2024 (the “Current Termination Date”), or a total of up to six months after June 17, 2024, unless the closing of the Company’s initial business combination shall have occurred prior thereto. We have since exercised four monthly extensions, extending the Termination Date to November 17, 2024, and we intend to extend the Termination Date to the Current Termination Date.\n\n2  \n---  \n  \nOn September 16, 2024, WinVest entered into an Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”), by and among WinVest, WinVest (BVI) Ltd., a British Virgin Islands business company registered with company number 2157117 and a wholly owned subsidiary of WinVest (“WinVest BVI”), Xtribe P.L.C., a public limited company incorporated and registered in England and Wales with number 07878011 (“Xtribe PLC”), and Xtribe (BVI) Ltd., a British Virgin Islands business company registered with company number 2157137 and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xtribe PLC (“Xtribe BVI,” and together with Xtribe PLC, “Xtribe”), which amended and restated a business combination agreement entered into by and among WinVest, Xtribe PLC and certain affiliates thereof on May 9, 2024 in its entirety. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement (and subject to the conditions and terms therein), a business combination between WinVest and Xtribe BVI will be effected through the following transactions: (i) Xtribe PLC will contribute substantially all of its assets and certain of its liabilities to Xtribe BVI and thereafter be dissolved, (ii) WinVest will merge with and into WinVest BVI, whereupon the separate existence of WinVest will cease and WinVest BVI will continue as the surviving entity incorporated under the BVI Business Companies Act (as revised) of the British Virgin Islands, as amended to date (the “BVI Companies Act”), and (iii) promptly thereafter, Xtribe BVI will merge with and into WinVest BVI, whereupon the separate existence of Xtribe BVI will cease and WinVest BVI will be the surviving entity incorporated under the BVI Companies Act (such transactions, collectively, the “Business Combination”). In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, WinVest BVI will be renamed “Xtribe Holding (BVI) Ltd.”\n\nAlthough we are using our best efforts to complete the Business Combination as contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement as soon as practicable, without the Charter Extension (as defined below), we do not believe we will be able to complete the Business Combination on or before December 17, 2024. We believe that it is in the best interests of our stockholders to continue the Company’s existence until June 17, 2025 in order to allow the Company additional time to complete the Business Combination, and we are therefore holding this Stockholder Meeting.\n\n**Q:** | **When and where will the Stockholder Meeting be held?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | The Stockholder Meeting will be held on , 2024, at a.m., Eastern Time, as a virtual meeting, or at such other time, on such other date and at such other place to which the meeting may be postponed or adjourned.  \n  \nWe encourage you to attend the Stockholder Meeting virtually.

A copy of the proposed amendment, which we refer to as the “Extension Amendment,” is set forth in _Annex A_ to this proxy statement;  \n---|---  \n  \n4  \n---  \n  \n2. | _Proposal No. 2 — Trust Amendment Proposal —_ To amend the Trust Agreement (such amendment, the “Trust Amendment”), dated September 14, 2021, by and between the Company and Continental, as amended, to extend the date (the “Liquidation Date”) on which the Trustee must liquidate the Trust Account from December 17, 2024 to January 17, 2025, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to further extend the Liquidation Date on a monthly basis for up to five times from January 17, 2025 to June 17, 2025 (the “Trust Amendment Proposal”). A copy of the proposed amendment is set forth in _Annex B_ to this proxy statement; and  \n---|---  \n3. | _Proposal No. 3 — Adjournment Proposal —_ To adjourn the Stockholder Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies if, based upon the tabulated vote at the time of the Stockholder Meeting, there are insufficient shares of Common Stock represented either in person (including virtually) or by proxy to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the Stockholder Meeting or at the time of the Stockholder Meeting to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal (the “Adjournment Proposal”).  \n  \nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved and the Company determines to effect the Charter Extension, prior to filing the Extension Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State to effectuate the Charter Extension and entering into the Trust Amendment with Continental, the Sponsor (or one or more of its affiliates, members or third-party designees, including, but not limited to, any parties to a business combination agreement (including the Business Combination Agreement) or their affiliates) (the “Lender”) shall lend the Company $30,000 (the “Monthly Extension Payment”), which the Company shall deposit into the Trust Account upon the Company’s first drawdown of a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note in the amount of up to $180,000 to be issued by the Company to the Lender (the “Note”). In addition, if the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved and the Charter Extension and Trust Amendment become effective, in the event that we have not consummated an initial business combination by January 17, 2025, without approval of our public stockholders, we may, by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, extend the Termination Date and Liquidation Date up to five times, each by one additional month (or such shorter period as the Sponsor shall request) (for a total of up to six additional months to complete an initial business combination), provided that we draw down and deposit into the Trust Account, for each such extension, the Monthly Extension Payment under the Note, for an additional aggregate deposit of up to $150,000 (if all five additional extensions are exercised). If we complete an initial business combination, we will repay the amounts loaned under the Note. If we do not complete an initial business combination by the applicable Termination Date, such Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. If the Sponsor designates a third party as Lender, we may negotiate with the Lender and vary the terms of the Note, issue securities and pay certain fees to the Lender in connection with the Note.\n\nFor more information, please see “ _Proposal No. 1 — The Extension Amendment Proposal_.”\n\n**After careful consideration, the Board has unanimously determined that the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal are in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” or give instruction to vote “FOR” each of these proposals.**\n\nThe existence of financial and personal interests of our directors and officers may result in conflicts of interest, including a conflict between what may be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and what may be best for a director’s personal interests when determining to recommend that stockholders vote for the proposals. See the sections titled “ _Proposal No. 1 — The Extension Amendment Proposal — Interests of the Initial Stockholders_ ” and “ _Beneficial Ownership of Securities_ ” for a further discussion of these considerations.\n\n5  \n---  \n  \n**THE VOTE OF STOCKHOLDERS IS IMPORTANT. STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO SUBMIT THEIR PROXIES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER CAREFULLY REVIEWING THIS PROXY STATEMENT.**\n\n**Q:** | **Am I being asked to vote on a proposal to elect directors?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | No. Holders of Public Stock are not being asked to vote on the election of directors at this time.  \n**Q:** | **Are the proposals conditioned on one another?**  \n**A:** | Approval of both the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal is a condition to the implementation of the Charter Extension.  \n  \nThe Adjournment Proposal is conditioned on the Company not obtaining the necessary votes for approving the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal prior to the Stockholder Meeting in order to seek additional time to obtain sufficient votes in support of the Charter Extension. If the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved at the Stockholder Meeting, the Adjournment Proposal will not be presented.\n\n**Q:** | **Why is the Company proposing the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | Our Certificate of Incorporation and the Trust Agreement provide for the return of the IPO proceeds held in trust to the holders of Public Stock sold in the IPO if there is no qualifying initial business combination consummated on or before the Current Termination Date. The purpose of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal, and, if necessary, the Adjournment Proposal, is to allow the Company additional time to complete the Business Combination.  \n  \nAlthough we are using our best efforts to complete the Business Combination as contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement as soon as practicable, without the Charter Extension, we do not believe we will be able to complete an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) on or before the Current Termination Date. If that were to occur, we would be forced to liquidate.\n\nIf either the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal is not approved by our stockholders, we may put the Adjournment Proposal to a vote in order to seek additional time to obtain sufficient votes in support of the Charter Extension. If the Adjournment Proposal is not approved by our stockholders, the Board may not be able to adjourn the Stockholder Meeting to a later date or dates in the event that there are insufficient shares of Common Stock represented (either in person (including virtually) or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the Stockholder Meeting or at the time of the Stockholder Meeting to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal.\n\nWe reserve the right at any time to cancel the Stockholder Meeting and not to submit to our stockholders the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal and implement the Charter Extension and the Trust Amendment. In the event the Stockholder Meeting is cancelled, and the Business Combination is not consummated prior to the Current Termination Date, we will dissolve and liquidate in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation. If we liquidate, our public stockholders may only receive a return of a pro rata portion of the amounts remaining in the Trust Account, and our Warrants and Rights will expire worthless. This will also cause you to lose any potential investment opportunity in a target company (including Xtribe) and the chance of realizing future gains on your investment through any price appreciation in the combined company.\n\nIf we are unable to effect the Charter Extension, we will not be able to extend the Current Termination Date.\n\n6  \n---  \n  \n**Q:** | **What constitutes a quorum?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | A quorum of our stockholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. The presence, in person (including virtually) or by proxy, of stockholders holding a majority of the Common Stock entitled to vote at the Stockholder Meeting constitutes a quorum at the Stockholder Meeting. Abstentions will be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum. The Sponsor, our officers, our current and former directors and certain members of our advisory board (collectively, the “Initial Stockholders”) hold an aggregate of 2,875,000 shares of Common Stock issued prior to the IPO (the “Founder Shares”). Such Founder Shares, which represent an aggregate of 85.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the Record Date, will count towards this quorum. As a result, as of the Record Date, in addition to the Founder Shares, no shares of Public Stock would be required to be present at the Stockholder Meeting to achieve a quorum. Because the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal are “non-routine” matters, banks, brokers and other nominees will not have authority to vote on any proposals unless instructed. Therefore, such broker non-votes will not count towards quorum at the Stockholder Meeting. In the absence of a quorum, the chairman of the Stockholder Meeting has the power to adjourn the Stockholder Meeting.  \n**Q:** | **What vote is required to approve the proposals presented at the Stockholder Meeting?**  \n**A:** | Approval of each of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock.  \n  \nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock who are present in person (including virtually) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the Stockholder Meeting.\n\n**Q:** | **How will the Sponsor and WinVest’s directors and officers vote?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | The Initial Stockholders, including the Sponsor and WinVest’s directors and officers, intend to vote any shares of Common Stock over which they have voting control in favor of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.  \n  \nThe Initial Stockholders are not entitled to redeem any Common Stock held by them in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal. On the Record Date, the Initial Stockholders beneficially owned and were entitled to vote an aggregate of 2,875,000 shares of Common Stock, representing 85.4% of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock.\n\n**Q:** | **Who is WinVest’s Sponsor?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | WinVest’s sponsor is WinVest SPAC LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. The Sponsor currently owns 2,537,424 shares of Common Stock and 10,900,000 Private Placement Warrants. Jeff LeBlanc, the manager of the Sponsor, has voting and dispositive power over the Common Stock and Private Placement Warrants held by the Sponsor. The Sponsor is not “controlled” (as defined in 31 CFR 800.208) by a foreign person, such that the Sponsor’s involvement in an initial business combination would be a “covered transaction” (as defined in 31 CFR 800.213).  \n**Q:** | **Why should I vote “FOR” the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | We believe stockholders will benefit from the Company consummating the Business Combination and are proposing the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal to extend the date by which the Company has to complete an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) until the Charter Extension Date (or Additional Charter Extension Date, if applicable). Although we are using our best efforts to complete the Business Combination as contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement as soon as practicable, without the Charter Extension, we do not believe we will be able to complete an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) on or before the Current Termination Date. If that were to occur, the Company would be forced to liquidate.  \n  \n7  \n---  \n  \nThe Trust Agreement provides that if a business combination has not been consummated by July 17, 2024 (unless extended up to five months), the Trust Account is to be liquidated and its proceeds are to be distributed to the our public stockholders of record as of such date, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest that may be released to us to pay dissolution expenses). The purpose of the Trust Amendment is to amend the Trust Agreement to extend the Liquidation Date from December 17, 2024 to January 17, 2025, and to allow us, without another stockholder vote, to elect to further extend the Liquidation Date on a monthly basis for up to five times from January 17, 2025 to June 17, 2025 to match the Certificate of Incorporation if the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved and the Extension Amendment is filed.  \n---  \n**Q:** | **What if I do not want to vote “FOR” the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal?**  \n**A:** | If you do not want the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal to be approved, you may expressly “ABSTAIN,” not vote, or vote “AGAINST” such proposal.  \n  \nIf you attend the Stockholder Meeting virtually or by proxy, you may vote “AGAINST” the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, and your Common Stock will be counted for the purposes of determining whether the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal (as the case may be) are approved.\n\nHowever, if you fail to attend the Stockholder Meeting virtually or by proxy, or if you do attend the Stockholder Meeting virtually or by proxy but you “ABSTAIN” or otherwise fail to vote at the Stockholder Meeting, your Common Stock will not be counted for the purposes of determining whether the Adjournment Proposal is approved, and your Common Stock which is not voted at the Stockholder Meeting will have no effect on the outcome of such vote. If you “ABSTAIN” or otherwise fail to vote at the Stockholder Meeting, this will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal.\n\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved, the Adjournment Proposal will not be presented for a vote.\n\n**Q:** | **Will you seek any further extensions to liquidate the Trust Account?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | Other than as described in this proxy statement, we do not currently anticipate seeking any further extension to consummate an initial business combination (including the Business Combination), but may do so in the future.  \n**Q:** | **What happens if the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal are not approved?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | If there are insufficient votes to approve both the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal, we may put the Adjournment Proposal to a vote in order to seek additional time to obtain sufficient votes in support of the Charter Extension and the Trust Amendment.  \n  \nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are not both approved at the Stockholder Meeting or at any adjournment thereof and the Business Combination is not completed on or before the Current Termination Date, then as contemplated by and in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter redeem 100% of the Public Stock for cash for a redemption price per share as described below (which Redemption (as defined below) will completely extinguish such holders’ rights as stockholders, including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such Redemption, subject to approval of our then-stockholders and subject to the requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), including the adoption of a resolution by the Board pursuant to Section 275(a) of the DGCL finding the dissolution of the Company advisable and the provision of such notices as are required by said Section 275(a) of the DGCL, dissolve and liquidate the balance of the Company’s net assets to its remaining stockholders, as part of the Company’s plan of dissolution and liquidation, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to the Company’s obligations under the DGCL to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law. In such event, the per share redemption price shall be equal to a pro rata share of the Trust Account plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company or necessary to pay its taxes (less up to $100,000 of such interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the total number of shares of Public Stock then outstanding.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \nThe Initial Stockholders have waived their right to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to the 2,875,000 Founder Shares held by them. There will be no distribution from the Trust Account with respect to our Warrants or Rights, which will expire worthless in the event the Company dissolves and liquidates the Trust Account.\n\n**Q:** | **If the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved, what happens next?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | If the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved, we will file the Extension Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State, enter into the Trust Amendment with the Trustee and continue to attempt to consummate the Business Combination until the Charter Extension Date (or Additional Charter Extension Date, if applicable).  \n  \nThe Company’s Common Stock is listed on Nasdaq. Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2(b) requires that SPACs, such as the Company, complete one or more business combinations by the 36-month anniversary of the effectiveness of their initial public offering registration statement, which date, in the case of the Company, was September 14, 2024 (the “Nasdaq Deadline”). We did not complete an initial business combination prior to the Nasdaq Deadline. As a result, we are in violation of Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2.\n\nAs previously reported, on September 17, 2024, we received a written notice (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that we had failed to comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2. On September 24, 2024, we timely requested a hearing before The Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) to appeal the Notice and to request an additional six-month extension (the “Nasdaq Extension”) to close the Business Combination, which request stayed the suspension of trading on our securities. Our hearing before the Panel is scheduled for November 12, 2024. Our securities will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market until the hearing process concludes and the Panel issues a written decision. However, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant our request for a suspension of delisting or continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. If the Panel does not grant our request, our securities will be delisted from Nasdaq. Additionally, even if the Panel grants our request, the proposed extension of the Termination Date to June 17, 2025 would exceed the Nasdaq Extension. As a result, if the Nasdaq Extension is granted and the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved but we do not complete an initial business combination prior to the expiration of the Nasdaq Extension, Nasdaq may commence proceedings to delist our Common Stock. The announcement of delisting proceedings may adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock and, if our Common Stock is delisted, there may no longer be an active trading market for such Common Stock. In addition, the potential or actual delisting of our Common Stock may also adversely affect our ability to consummate an initial business combination. For more information see “ _Risk Factors — We are required by the Nasdaq Listing Rules to consummate a Business Combination within 36 months of the effectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement. As a result of our failure to consummate an initial business combination within this time period, or securities could be subject to delisting.”_\n\nIf the Charter Extension and the Trust Amendment are implemented and one or more of our stockholders elect to redeem their Public Stock in exchange for their pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account (a “Redemption”), we will remove from the Trust Account and deliver to the holders of such redeemed Public Stock an amount equal to the pro rata portion of funds available in the Trust Account with respect to such redeemed Public Stock, and retain the remainder of the funds in the Trust Account for our use in connection with consummating an initial business combination, subject to the redemption rights of holders of Public Stock in connection with an initial business combination.\n\nThe removal from the Trust Account of such amounts will reduce the amount remaining in the Trust Account and increase the percentage interest of the Company held by the Sponsor.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \n**Q:** | **If I vote for or against the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal, do I need to request that my shares be redeemed?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | Yes. Whether you vote “for” or “against” the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal, or do not vote at all, you may elect to redeem your shares. However, you will need to submit a redemption request for your shares if you choose to redeem.  \n**Q:** | **What amount will holders receive upon consummation of an initial business combination or liquidation if the Extension Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | If the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved and the Company determines to effect the Charter Extension, prior to filing the Extension Amendment and entering into the Trust Amendment with Continental, the Lender shall lend the Company the Monthly Extension Payment, which the Company shall deposit into the Trust Account upon the Company’s first drawdown of the Note. In addition, if the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved and the Charter Extension and Trust Amendment become effective, in the event that we have not consummated an initial business combination by January 17, 2025, without approval of our public stockholders, we may, by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, extend the Termination Date up to five times, each by one additional month (or such shorter period as the Sponsor shall request) (for a total of up to six additional months to complete an initial business combination), provided that we draw down and deposit into the Trust Account, for each such extension, the Monthly Extension Payment under the Note, for an additional aggregate deposit of up to $150,000 (if all five additional extensions are exercised). If we complete an initial business combination, we will repay the amounts loaned under the Note. If we do not complete an initial business combination by the applicable Termination Date, such Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. If the Sponsor designates a third party as Lender, we may negotiate with the Lender and vary the terms of the Note, issue securities and pay certain fees to the Lender in connection with the Note.  \n**Q:** | **Am I being asked to vote on an initial business combination at this Stockholder Meeting?**  \n**A:** | No. You are not being asked to vote on an initial business combination, including the Business Combination, at this time. If the Charter Extension is implemented and you do not elect to redeem your shares of Public Stock, provided that you are a stockholder on the record date for the stockholder meeting to consider an initial business combination (including the Business Combination), you will be entitled to vote on such initial business combination when it is submitted to stockholders and will retain the right to redeem your shares of Public Stock for cash in connection with an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) or liquidation.  \n**Q:** | **Will how I vote affect my ability to exercise redemption rights?**  \n**A:** | No. You may exercise your redemption rights whether or not you are a holder of Public Stock on the Record Date (so long as you are a holder at the time of exercise), or whether you are a holder and vote your Public Stock on the Extension Amendment Proposal (for or against) or any other proposal described by this proxy statement. As a result, the Charter Extension can be approved by stockholders who will redeem their Public Stock and no longer remain stockholders, leaving stockholders who choose not to redeem their Public Stock holding shares in a company with a potentially less liquid trading market, fewer stockholders, potentially less cash and the potential inability to meet the listing standards of Nasdaq.  \n  \n10  \n---  \n  \n**Q:** | **Will the balance in the Trust Account be affected by the Excise Tax included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, imposes a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased by “covered corporations” beginning in 2023, with certain exceptions (the “Excise Tax”). The Excise Tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which the stock is repurchased. The amount of the Excise Tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the Excise Tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the Excise Tax. We will not use the proceeds placed in the Trust Account and the interest earned thereon to pay any excise taxes that may be imposed on us pursuant to any current, pending or future rules or laws, including without limitation the Excise Tax, on any redemptions or stock buybacks by the Company. In the event (i) an excise tax and/or any other similar fees or taxes in nature are levied or imposed on us pursuant to any current, pending or future rule(s) or law(s), including without limitation the Excise Tax, in relation to a redemption of securities as described herein or otherwise, and (ii) the holders of our shares of Common Stock approve the Extension Amendment Proposal, if such excise tax or fee has not been paid by us to the applicable regulatory authority on or prior to the due date for such a tax or fee, our Sponsor or a designee agrees to promptly (but in any event sufficiently prior to the due date for such tax or fee to assure timely payment thereof) either directly pay such tax or fee on behalf of us or advance to us such funds as necessary and appropriate to allow us to pay such tax or fee timely with respect to any future redemptions that occur prior to or in connection with an initial business combination or our liquidation. The Sponsor agrees not to seek recourse for such expenses from the Trust Account.  \n**Q:** | **May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | Yes. Stockholders may send a later-dated, signed proxy card to WinVest Acquisition Corp., at 125 Cambridgepark Drive, Suite 301, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02140, so that it is received by the Company prior to the vote at the Stockholder Meeting (which is scheduled to take place on , 2024) or attend the virtual Stockholder Meeting and vote electronically. Stockholders also may revoke their proxy by sending a notice of revocation to our Chief Executive Officer, which must be received by our Chief Executive Officer prior to the vote at the Stockholder Meeting. However, if your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or another nominee, you must contact your broker, bank or other nominee to change your vote.  \n**Q:** | **How are votes counted?**  \n**A:** | Votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the Stockholder Meeting, who will separately count “FOR” and “AGAINST” votes and abstentions. Approval of each of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock who are present in person (including virtually) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the Stockholder Meeting.  \n  \nStockholders who attend the Stockholder Meeting, either virtually or by proxy, will be counted (and the number of Common Stock held by such stockholders will be counted) for the purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Stockholder Meeting. The presence, in person (including virtually) or by proxy, of stockholders holding a majority of the Common Stock entitled to vote at the Stockholder Meeting constitutes a quorum at the Stockholder Meeting.\n\nWith respect to the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal. As these proposals are not “routine” matters, brokers will not be permitted to exercise discretionary voting on these proposals.\n\nWith respect to the Adjournment Proposal, abstentions will have no effect on the approval of the proposal. As this proposal is not a “routine” matter, brokers will not be permitted to exercise discretionary voting on this proposal.\n\n11  \n---  \n  \n**Q:** | **If my shares are held in “street name,” will my broker, bank or nominee automatically vote my shares for me?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | If your shares are held in “street name” in a stock brokerage account or by a broker, bank or other nominee, you must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee. Please note that you may not vote shares held in “street name” by returning a proxy card directly to the Company or by voting online at the Stockholder Meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy,” which you must obtain from your broker, bank or other nominee.  \n  \nUnder the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, brokers who hold shares in “street name” for a beneficial owner of those shares typically have the authority to vote in their discretion on “routine” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, brokers are not permitted to exercise their voting discretion with respect to the approval of matters that the New York Stock Exchange determines to be “non-routine” without specific instructions from the beneficial owner. The Extension Amendment Proposal, Trust Amendment Proposal and Adjournment Proposal are all “non-routine” matters and therefore, brokers are not permitted to exercise their voting discretion with respect to these proposals.\n\nIf you are a WinVest stockholder holding your shares in “street name” and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares, your broker, bank or other nominee will not vote your shares on the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. Accordingly, your bank, broker, or other nominee can vote your shares on the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal at the Stockholder Meeting only if you provide instructions on how to vote. You should instruct your broker to vote your shares as soon as possible in accordance with directions you provide.\n\n**Q:** | **Does the Board recommend voting “FOR” the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | Yes. After careful consideration of the terms and conditions of each of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, the Board has determined that each of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Board recommends that the Company’s stockholders vote “FOR” each of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and, if presented, the Adjournment Proposal.  \n**Q:** | **What interests do WinVest’s directors and officers have in the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal?**  \n**A:** | WinVest’s directors and officers have interests in the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. These interests include, among others, ownership, directly or indirectly through the Sponsor, of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants. See the section titled “ _Proposal No. 1 — The Extension Amendment Proposal — Interests of the Initial Stockholders_ ” in this proxy statement.  \n**Q:** | **Do I have appraisal rights if I object to the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal?**  \n**A:** | No. There are no appraisal rights available to our stockholders in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal.  \n  \n12  \n---  \n  \n**Q:** | **If I am a Public Warrant or Right holder, can I exercise redemption rights with respect to my Public Warrants or Rights?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | No. The holders of Public Warrants and the holders of Rights have no redemption rights with respect to such Public Warrants or Rights.  \n**Q:** | **What do I need to do now?**  \n**A:** | You are urged to read carefully and consider the information contained in this proxy statement and to consider how the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal will affect you as a stockholder. You should then vote as soon as possible in accordance with the instructions provided in this proxy statement and on the enclosed proxy card or, if you hold your shares through a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee, on the voting instruction form provided by the broker, bank or nominee.  \n**Q:** | **How do I exercise my redemption rights?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | If you are a holder of Public Stock and wish to exercise your right to redeem your Common Stock, you must:  \nI. | (a) hold Common Stock or (b) hold Common Stock through Units and elect to separate your Units into the underlying Common Stock, Rights and Public Warrants prior to exercising your redemption rights with respect to the Common Stock;  \n---|---  \nII. | prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on , 2024 (two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote at the Stockholder Meeting), (a) submit a written request to the Transfer Agent that the Company redeem all or a portion of your Common Stock for cash and (b) identify yourself as the beneficial holder of the Common Stock and provide your legal name, phone number and address; and  \nIII. | deliver your Common Stock to the Transfer Agent, physically or electronically through the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”).  \n  \nThe address of the Transfer Agent is listed under the question “ _Who can help answer my questions?_ ” below.\n\nHolders of Units must elect to separate the underlying Common Stock, Rights and Public Warrants prior to exercising redemption rights with respect to the Common Stock. If holders hold their Units in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, holders must notify their broker or bank that they elect to separate the Units into the underlying Common Stock, Rights and Public Warrants, or if a holder holds Units registered in its own name, the holder must contact the Transfer Agent directly and instruct it to do so.\n\nIn connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal, and contingent upon the effectiveness of the implementation of the Charter Extension, any holder of Public Stock will be entitled to request that their Public Stock be redeemed for a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the Stockholder Meeting, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its income or other tax obligations, divided by the number of then-outstanding shares of Public Stock. As of , 2024, this would have amounted to approximately $ per share of Public Stock.\n\nHowever, the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of our creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of our public stockholders. Therefore, the per share distribution from the Trust Account in such a situation may be less than originally anticipated due to such claims. We anticipate that the funds to be distributed to public stockholders electing to redeem their Common Stock will be distributed promptly after the Stockholder Meeting.\n\nAny request for redemption, once made by a holder of Common Stock, may be withdrawn at any time until the deadline for exercising redemption requests, unless approved by the Board. If you deliver your shares for redemption to the Transfer Agent and later decide prior to the deadline for exercising redemption requests not to elect redemption, you may request that the Company instruct the Transfer Agent to return the shares (physically or electronically). You may make such request by contacting the Transfer Agent at the phone number or address listed at the end of this section. We will be required to honor such request only if made prior to the deadline for exercising redemption requests.\n\n13  \n---  \n  \nNo request for redemption will be honored unless the holder’s shares have been delivered (either physically or electronically) to the Transfer Agent by 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on , 2024 (two business days prior to the initially scheduled date of the Stockholder Meeting).\n\nIf a holder of Public Stock properly makes a request for redemption and the Public Stock is delivered as described above, we will redeem such holder’s Public Stock for a pro rata portion of funds deposited in the Trust Account, calculated as of two business days prior to the Stockholder Meeting. If you are a holder of Public Stock and you exercise your redemption rights, it will not result in the loss of any Public Warrants or Rights that you may hold.\n\nIf the Stockholder Meeting is abandoned for any reason, then holders of Public Stock shall not have the right to redeem their Public Stock at this time.\n\n**Q:** | **What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of exercising my redemption rights?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | The U.S. federal income tax consequences of exercising your redemption rights will depend on your particular facts and circumstances. Accordingly, you are urged to consult your tax advisor to determine your tax consequences from the exercise of your redemption rights, including the applicability and effect of U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income and other tax laws in light of your particular circumstances. For additional discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations with respect to the exercise of these redemption rights, see “ _Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for Stockholders Exercising Redemption Rights_.”  \n**Q:** | **What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials for the Stockholder Meeting?**  \n**A:** | You may receive more than one set of voting materials for the Stockholder Meeting, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a holder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive in order to cast your vote with respect to all of your shares.  \n**Q:** | **Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies for the Stockholder Meeting?**  \n**A:** | We will pay the cost of soliciting proxies for the Stockholder Meeting. We have engaged Sodali & Co (“Sodali”) to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Stockholder Meeting. We will also reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries representing beneficial owners of Common Stock for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to beneficial owners of Common Stock and in obtaining voting instructions from those owners. Our directors, officers, advisory board members and employees may also solicit proxies by telephone, by facsimile, by mail or on the Internet. They will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.  \n  \n14  \n---  \n  \n**Q:** | **Who can help answer my questions?**  \n---|---  \n**A:** | If you have questions about the proposals or if you need additional copies of this proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card you should contact:  \n  \nSodali & Co\n\n333 Ludlow Street, 5th Floor, South Tower\n\nStamford, CT 06902\n\nIndividuals call toll-free (800) 662-5200\n\nBanks and brokers call (203) 658-9400\n\nEmail: WINV.info@investor.sodali.com\n\nYou also may obtain additional information about WinVest from documents filed with the SEC by following the instructions in the section titled “ _Where You Can Find More Information._ ” If you are a holder of Public Stock and you intend to seek redemption of your shares, you will need to deliver your Common Stock (either physically or electronically) to the Transfer Agent at the address below prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on , 2024 (two business days prior to the date of the Stockholder Meeting). If you have questions regarding the certification of your position or delivery of your shares, please contact:\n\nContinental Stock Transfer & Trust Company\n\nOne State Street, 30th Floor\n\nNew York, New York 10004\n\nAttn: SPAC Redemption Team\n\nE-mail: spacredemptions@continentalstock.com\n\n15  \n---  \n  \n**RISK FACTORS**\n\n_In addition to the below risk factors, you should consider carefully all of the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024, any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and in the other reports we file with the SEC before making a decision to invest in our securities. The risks and uncertainties described in the aforementioned filings and below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results or result in our liquidation._\n\n**_There are no assurances that the Charter Extension will enable us to complete the Business Combination._**\n\nApproving the Charter Extension involves a number of risks. Even if the Charter Extension is approved, we can provide no assurances that an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) will be consummated prior to June 17, 2025. Our ability to consummate any initial business combination is dependent on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. We are required to offer stockholders the opportunity to redeem shares in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal, and we will be required to offer stockholders redemption rights again in connection with any stockholder vote to approve an initial business combination (including the Business Combination). Even if the Charter Extension or an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) are approved by our stockholders, it is possible that redemptions will leave us with insufficient cash to consummate an initial business combination on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. The fact that we will have separate redemption periods in connection with the Charter Extension vote and the vote on an initial business combination could exacerbate these risks. Other than in connection with a redemption offer or liquidation, our stockholders may be unable to recover their investment except through sales of our Public Stock on the open market. The price of our Public Stock may be volatile, and there can be no assurance that stockholders will be able to dispose of their Public Stock at favorable prices, or at all.\n\n**_The SEC has adopted rules to regulate SPACs. Certain of the procedures that we, a potential initial business combination target (including Xtribe), or others may determine to undertake in connection with such rules may increase our costs and the time needed to complete an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete an initial business combination._**\n\nOn January 24, 2024, the SEC adopted final rules (the “SPAC Final Rules”) relating to, among other items, disclosures in SEC filings in connection with business combination transactions between SPACs such as us and private operating companies; the financial statement requirements applicable to transactions involving shell companies; the use of projections in SEC filings in connection with proposed business combination transactions; the potential liability of certain participants in proposed business combination transactions; and the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act. The SPAC Final Rules became effective on July 1, 2024. Certain of the procedures that we, a potential initial business combination target (including Xtribe), or others may determine to undertake in connection with the SPAC Final Rules, or pursuant to the SEC’s views expressed in the SPAC Final Rules, may increase the costs of negotiating and completing an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) and the time required to consummate a transaction, and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete an initial business combination.\n\n**_If we were deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we would be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities would be severely restricted. As a result, in such circumstances, unless we are able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we would expect to abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead to liquidate the Company._**\n\nIn the adopting release for the SPAC Final Rules, the SEC provided guidance that a SPAC’s potential status as an “investment company” depends on a variety of factors, such as a SPAC’s duration, asset composition, business purpose and activities, and “is a question of facts and circumstances” requiring individualized analysis. If we were deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities would be severely restricted. In addition, we would be subject to burdensome compliance requirements. Although we do not believe that our principal activities will subject us to regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, if we are deemed to be an investment company and subject to compliance with and regulation under the Investment Company Act, we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and expenses for which we have not allotted funds. As a result, unless we were able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we would expect to abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead to liquidate the Company.\n\n16  \n---  \n  \n**_We have in the past instructed the Trustee to liquidate the securities held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in cash, and we could do so again in the future. As a result of any such liquidation, we may receive less interest, if any, on the funds held in the Trust Account, which would reduce the dollar amount our public stockholders would receive upon any Redemption or the liquidation of the Company._**\n\nThe funds in the Trust Account have, since our IPO, been held only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. government treasury obligations and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act or in cash. To mitigate the risk of us being deemed to be an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act) and thus subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, prior to the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement pursuant to which the Company registered its securities offered in the IPO (the “IPO Registration Statement”), we instructed the Trustee to liquidate the U.S. government treasury obligations or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter to maintain all funds in the Trust Account in cash in an interest-bearing bank account. Although we subsequently reinvested such funds in marketable securities, we could instruct the Trustee to liquidate the securities held in the Trust Account again in the future. As a result of any such liquidation, we may receive less interest, if any, on the funds held in the Trust Account than if the assets in the Trust Account had remained in U.S. government securities or money market funds. However, interest previously earned on the funds held in the Trust Account still may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any, and certain other expenses as permitted. As a result, our liquidation of the securities held in the Trust Account and the holding of all funds in the Trust Account in cash could reduce the dollar amount our public stockholders would receive upon any Redemption or the liquidation of the Company.\n\n**_The Excise Tax included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 may decrease the value of our securities following an initial business combination, hinder our ability to consummate an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) and decrease the amount of funds available for distribution in connection with a liquidation._**\n\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, imposes a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased by “covered corporations” beginning on January 1, 2023, with certain exceptions. The Excise Tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which the stock is repurchased. The amount of the Excise Tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the Excise Tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury Department”) has authority to promulgate regulations and provide other guidance regarding the Excise Tax. In December 2022, the Treasury Department issued Notice 2023-2, indicating its intention to propose such regulations and issuing certain interim rules on which taxpayers may rely. Under the interim rules, liquidating distributions made by publicly traded domestic corporations are exempt from the Excise Tax. In addition, any redemptions that occur in the same taxable year in which a liquidation is completed will also be exempt from such tax. Redemptions of our Public Stock in connection with an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation or in connection with an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) may subject us to the Excise Tax unless one of the two exceptions above apply.\n\nAs described under “ _Proposal No. 1 — The Extension Amendment Proposal_ ,” if the Current Termination Date is extended, our public stockholders will have the right to require us to redeem their Public Stock. Any Redemption or other repurchase that we make may be subject to the Excise Tax to the extent we do not liquidate by December 31, 2024. Whether and to what extent we would be subject to the Excise Tax would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the Redemptions and repurchases in connection with our initial business combination, (ii) the structure of our initial business combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any “PIPE” or other equity issuances in connection with our initial business combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with our initial business combination but issued within the same taxable year of our initial business combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury. In addition, because the Excise Tax would be payable by us, and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the Excise Tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available to complete a business combination, and could have an adverse effect on our ability to complete an initial business combination, including the Business Combination.\n\n17  \n---  \n  \n**_We are required by the Nasdaq Listing Rules to consummate an initial business combination within 36 months of the effectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement. As a result of our failure to consummate an initial business combination within this time period, our securities could be subject to delisting._**\n\nPursuant to IM-5101-2(b) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we must consummate an initial business combination by the Nasdaq Deadline. We did not complete an initial business combination prior to the Nasdaq Deadline. As a result, we are in violation of Nasdaq IM-5101-2.\n\nAs previously reported, on September 17, 2024, we received the Notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that we had failed to comply with Nasdaq Listing Rules IM-5101-2. On September 24, 2024, we timely requested a hearing before the Panel to appeal the Notice and to request the Nasdaq Extension in order to close the Business Combination, which request stayed the suspension of trading on our securities. Our hearing before the Panel is scheduled for November 12, 2024. Our securities will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market until the hearing process concludes and the Panel issues a written decision. However, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant our request for a suspension of delisting or continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. If the Panel does not grant our request, our securities will be delisted from Nasdaq. Additionally, even if the Panel grants our request, the proposed extension of the Termination Date to June 17, 2025 would exceed the Nasdaq Extension. As a result, if the Nasdaq Extension is granted and the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved but we do not complete an initial business combination prior to the expiration of the Nasdaq Extension, Nasdaq may issue a Staff Delisting Determination under Rule 5810 to delist our securities. If Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\n● | the price of our securities will likely decrease as a result of the loss of market efficiencies associated with being listed on Nasdaq;  \n---|---  \n● | holders may be unable to sell or purchase our securities when they wish to do so;  \n● | we may become subject to shareholder litigation;  \n● | we may lose the interest of institutional investors in our securities;  \n● | we may lose media and analyst coverage; and  \n● | we would likely lose any active trading market for our securities, as our securities may then only be traded on one of the over-the-counter markets, if at all.  \n  \n**_Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange following redemptions by our stockholders in connection with approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions._**\n\nOur Common Stock, Units, Warrants and Rights are listed on Nasdaq. After the Stockholder Meeting, we may be required to demonstrate compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements in order to maintain the listing of our securities on Nasdaq. Such continued listing requirements for our Common Stock include, among other things, the requirement to maintain at least 300 public holders, at least 500,000 publicly held shares and a market value of publicly held shares of $1.0 million. Pursuant to the terms of our Certificate of Incorporation, in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal, stockholders may elect to redeem their Public Stock and, as a result, we may not be in compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements.\n\nIf our securities do not meet Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements, Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange. If Nasdaq delists any of our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list such securities on another approved national securities exchange, we expect that such securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: (i) a limited availability of market quotations for our securities, (ii) reduced liquidity for our securities, (iii) a determination that our Public Stock is a “penny stock,” which will require brokers trading in our Public Stock to adhere to more stringent rules, including being subject to the depository requirements of Rule 419 of the Securities Act, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities, (iv) a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company, (v) a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future, and (vi) being a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business in connection with a business combination (including the Business Combination). The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as “covered securities.” Our Common Stock, Units, Warrants and Rights qualify as covered securities under such statute. If we were no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities would not qualify as covered securities under such statute and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\n\n18  \n---  \n  \n**SPECIAL MEETING OF WINVEST STOCKHOLDERS**\n\nThis proxy statement is being provided to WinVest stockholders as part of a solicitation of proxies by the Board for use at the special meeting of WinVest stockholders to be held on , 2024, and at any adjournment thereof.

A copy of the proposed amendment is set forth in _Annex A_ to this proxy statement; and  \n---|---  \n  \n19  \n---  \n  \n2. | _Proposal No. 2 — Trust Amendment Proposal —_ To amend the Trust Agreement to extend the Liquidation Date from December 17, 2024 to January 17, 2025, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to further extend the Liquidation Date on a monthly basis for up to five times from January 17, 2025 to June 17, 2025. A copy of the proposed amendment is set forth in _Annex B_ to the accompanying proxy statement; and  \n---|---  \n3. | _Proposal No. 3 — Adjournment Proposal —_ To adjourn the Stockholder Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies if, based upon the tabulated vote at the time of the Stockholder Meeting, there are insufficient shares of Common Stock represented (either in person (including virtually) or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the Stockholder Meeting or at the time of the Stockholder Meeting to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal.  \n  \nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved and the Company determines to effect the Charter Extension, prior to filing the Extension Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State to effectuate the Charter Extension and entering into the Trust Amendment with Continental, the Lender shall lend the Company the Monthly Extension Payment, which the Company shall deposit into the Trust Account, upon the Company’s first drawdown of the Note. In addition, if the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved and the Charter Extension becomes effective, in the event that we have not consummated an initial business combination by January 17, 2025, without approval of our public stockholders, we may, by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, extend the Termination Date up to five times, each by one additional month (or such shorter period as the Sponsor shall request) (for a total of up to six additional months to complete an initial business combination), provided that we draw down and deposit into the Trust Account, for each such extension, the Monthly Extension Payment under the Note, for an additional aggregate deposit of up to $150,000. If we complete an initial business combination, we will repay the amounts loaned under the Note. If we do not complete an initial business combination by the applicable Termination Date, such Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. If the Sponsor designates a third party as Lender, we may negotiate with the Lender and vary the terms of the Note, issue securities and pay certain fees to the Lender in connection with the Note.\n\n**Voting Power; Record Date**\n\nAs a stockholder of the Company, you have a right to vote on certain matters affecting the Company. The proposals that will be presented at the Stockholder Meeting and upon which you are being asked to vote are summarized above and fully set forth in this proxy statement. You will be entitled to vote or direct votes to be cast at the Stockholder Meeting if you owned Common Stock at the close of business on , 2024, which is the Record Date for the Stockholder Meeting. You are entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock that you owned as of the close of business on the Record Date. If your shares are held in “street name” or are in a margin or similar account, you should contact your broker, bank or other nominee to ensure that votes related to the shares you beneficially own are properly counted. On the Record Date, there were 3,367,333 issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, of which 492,333 shares are Public Stock held by public stockholders and 2,875,000 shares are Founder Shares held by the Initial Stockholders.\n\n**Recommendation of the Board**\n\n**THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS**\n\n**THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” EACH OF THE PROPOSALS**\n\n**Quorum**\n\nThe presence, in person (including virtually) or by proxy, of stockholders holding a majority of the Common Stock entitled to vote at the Stockholder Meeting constitutes a quorum at the Stockholder Meeting. Abstentions will be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum. The Initial Stockholders, who own approximately 85.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the Record Date, will count towards this quorum. As a result, as of the Record Date, no shares of Common Stock held by public stockholders would be required to be present at the Stockholder Meeting to achieve a quorum.\n\n20  \n---  \n  \n**Abstentions**\n\nAbstentions will be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum but will not constitute votes cast at the Stockholder Meeting and therefore will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal and no effect on the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.\n\n**Broker Non-Votes**\n\nUnder the New York Stock Exchange rules, if a stockholder holds their shares in “street” name through a bank, broker or other nominee and the stockholder does not instruct their broker, bank or other nominee how to vote their shares on a proposal, the broker, bank or other nominee has the authority to vote the shares in its discretion on certain “routine” matters. However, banks, brokers and other nominees are not authorized to exercise their voting discretion on any “non-routine” matters. This can result in a “broker non-vote,” which occurs on a proposal when (i) a bank, broker or other nominee has discretionary authority to vote on one or more “routine” proposals to be voted on at a meeting of stockholders, (ii) there are one or more “non-routine” proposals to be voted on at the meeting for which the bank, broker or other nominee does not have authority to vote without instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and (iii) the beneficial owner fails to provide the bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions on a “non-routine” matter.\n\nThe Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal are “non-routine” matters and therefore, brokers are not permitted to exercise their voting discretion with respect to these proposals. As a result, if you hold your shares in street name, your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee cannot vote your shares on any of these proposals at the Stockholder Meeting without your instruction.\n\n**Vote Required for Approval**\n\nApproval of each of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock.\n\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock who are present in person (including virtually) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the Stockholder Meeting.\n\nThe Initial Stockholders intend to vote all of their Common Stock in favor of the proposals being presented at the Stockholder Meeting. As of the date of this proxy statement, the Initial Stockholders own, in aggregate, 85.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock.\n\nThe following table reflects the number of additional shares of Public Stock required to approve each proposal:\n\n**Number of Additional Shares of** **Public Stock Required To Approve** **Proposal**  \n---  \nProposal | Approval Standard | **If Only** **Quorum is** **Present and All** **Present Shares** **Cast Votes** | **If All Shares Are** **Present and All** **Present Shares** **Cast Votes**  \nExtension Amendment Proposal | Majority of Issued and Outstanding Shares of Common Stock | 0 | 0  \nTrust Amendment Proposal | Majority of Issued and Outstanding Shares of Common Stock | 0 | 0  \nAdjournment Proposal | Majority of Voted Stock | 0 | 0  \n  \n21  \n---  \n  \n**Voting Your Shares**\n\nIf you were a holder of record of Common Stock as of the close of business on the Record Date for the Stockholder Meeting, you may vote with respect to the proposals electronically, or by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided. Your proxy card shows the number of shares of Common Stock that you own. If your shares are held in “street name” or are in a margin or similar account, you should contact your broker to ensure that votes related to the shares you beneficially own are properly counted.\n\nThere are two ways to vote your Common Stock at the Stockholder Meeting:\n\n**Voting by Mail**. By signing the proxy card and returning it in the enclosed prepaid and addressed envelope, you are authorizing the individuals named on the proxy card to vote your shares at the Stockholder Meeting in the manner you indicate. You are encouraged to sign and return the proxy card even if you plan to attend the Stockholder Meeting so that your shares will be voted if you are unable to attend the Stockholder Meeting. If you receive more than one proxy card, it is an indication that your shares are held in multiple accounts. Please sign and return all proxy cards to ensure that all of your shares are voted. Votes submitted by mail must be received by 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on , 2024.\n\n**Voting Electronically**. You may virtually attend, vote and examine the list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Stockholder Meeting by visiting https://www.cstproxy.com/winvestacquisition/ext2024 and entering the control number found on your proxy card, voting instruction form or notice included in the proxy materials.\n\n**Revoking Your Proxy**\n\nIf you give a proxy, you may revoke it at any time before the Stockholder Meeting or at the Stockholder Meeting by doing any one of the following:\n\n● | you may send another proxy card with a later date;  \n---|---  \n● | you may notify our Chief Executive Officer in writing at WinVest Acquisition Corp., 125 Cambridgepark Drive, Suite 301, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02140, before the Stockholder Meeting that you have revoked your proxy; or  \n● | you may attend the virtual Stockholder Meeting, revoke your proxy, and vote electronically, as indicated above.  \n  \n**No Additional Matters**\n\nThe Stockholder Meeting has been called only to consider and vote on the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Under our Bylaws, other than procedural matters incident to the conduct of the Stockholder Meeting, no other matters may be considered at the Stockholder Meeting if they are not included in this proxy statement, which serves as the notice of the Stockholder Meeting.\n\n**Who Can Answer Your Questions about Voting**\n\nIf you are a WinVest stockholder and have any questions about how to vote or direct a vote in respect of your Common Stock, you may call Sodali, our proxy solicitor, by calling (800) 662-5200 (toll-free), or (203) 658-9400 (for banks and brokers), or by emailing WINV.info@investor.sodali.com.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \n**Redemption Rights**\n\nPursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, holders of Public Stock may seek to redeem their shares for cash, regardless of whether they vote for or against, or whether they abstain from voting on, the Extension Amendment Proposal. In connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal and contingent upon the effectiveness of the implementation of the Charter Extension, any stockholder holding shares of Public Stock may demand that we redeem such shares for a full pro rata portion of the Trust Account (which, for illustrative purposes, was $ per share as of , 2024), calculated as of two business days prior to the Stockholder Meeting. If a holder properly seeks redemption as described in this section, we will redeem these shares for a pro rata portion of funds deposited in the Trust Account and the holder will no longer own these shares following the Stockholder Meeting.\n\nAs a holder of Public Stock, you will be entitled to receive cash for any Public Stock to be redeemed only if you:\n\n(i) | (a) hold Public Stock or (b) hold Public Stock through Units and elect to separate your Units into the underlying Public Stock, Rights and Public Warrants prior to exercising your redemption rights with respect to the Public Stock;  \n---|---  \n(ii) | submit a written request to the Transfer Agent, in which you (a) request that the Company redeem all or a portion of your Public Stock for cash, and (b) identify yourself as the beneficial holder of the Public Stock and provide your legal name, phone number and address; and   \n(iii) | deliver your Public Stock to the Transfer Agent, physically or electronically through DTC.  \n  \n**Holders must complete the procedures for electing to redeem their Public Stock in the manner described above prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on , 2024 (two business days prior to the initially scheduled Stockholder Meeting) (the “Redemption Deadline”) in order for their shares to be redeemed.**\n\nThe redemption rights include the requirement that a holder must identify itself in writing as a beneficial holder and provide its legal name, phone number and address to Continental in order to validly redeem its shares.\n\nIf you hold your shares in “street name,” you will have to coordinate with your broker to have your shares certificated or delivered electronically. Shares of WinVest that have not been tendered (either physically or electronically) in accordance with these procedures will not be redeemed for cash. There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through DTC’s DWAC system. The Transfer Agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming stockholder.\n\nAny request for redemption, once made by a holder of Public Stock, may not be withdrawn following the Redemption Deadline, unless approved by the Board. Any corrected or changed written exercise of redemption rights must be received by the Transfer Agent, by the Redemption Deadline.\n\nThe closing price of our Public Stock on , 2024, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement, was $ per share. The cash held in the Trust Account on such date was approximately $ (including interest not previously released to the Company to pay its income or other tax obligations) ($ per share of Public Stock). Prior to exercising redemption rights, stockholders should verify the market price of the Public Stock, as they may receive higher proceeds from the sale of their Public Stock in the public market than from exercising their redemption rights if the market price per share is higher than the redemption price. We cannot assure you that you will be able to sell your Public Stock in the open market, even if the market price per share is lower than the redemption price stated above, as there may not be sufficient liquidity in our securities when you wish to sell your shares.\n\nIf a holder of Public Stock exercises his, her or its redemption rights, then he, she or it will be exchanging its Public Stock for cash and will no longer own those shares. You will be entitled to receive cash for these shares only if you properly demand redemption by delivering your share certificate (either physically or electronically) to the Transfer Agent two business days prior to the vote at the Stockholder Meeting.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \nFor a discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations for stockholders with respect to the exercise of these redemption rights, see “ _Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for Stockholders Exercising Redemption Rights_.” The consequences of a redemption to any particular stockholder will depend on that stockholder’s particular facts and circumstances. Accordingly, you are urged to consult your tax advisor to determine your tax consequences from the exercise of your redemption rights, including the applicability and effect of U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income and other tax laws in light of your particular circumstances.\n\n**Appraisal Rights**\n\nThere are no appraisal rights available to our stockholders in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal.\n\n**Proxy Solicitation Costs**\n\nWe are soliciting proxies on behalf of the Board. This proxy solicitation is being made by mail, but also may be made by telephone or in person. We have engaged Sodali to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Stockholder Meeting. The Company and its directors, officers and advisory board members may also solicit proxies in person. We will ask banks, brokers and other institutions, nominees and fiduciaries to forward this proxy statement and the related proxy materials to their principals and to obtain their authority to execute proxies and voting instructions.\n\nThe Company will bear the entire cost of the proxy solicitation, including the preparation, assembly, printing, mailing and distribution of this proxy statement and the related proxy materials. We will pay Sodali a fee of $10,000, plus disbursements, reimburse Sodali for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and indemnify Sodali and its affiliates against certain claims, liabilities, losses, damages and expenses for its services as our proxy solicitor. We will reimburse brokerage firms and other custodians for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding this proxy statement and the related proxy materials to our stockholders. Directors, officers and advisory board members of the Company who solicit proxies will not be paid any additional compensation for soliciting.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \n**PROPOSAL NO. 1 — THE EXTENSION AMENDMENT PROPOSAL**\n\n**Overview**\n\nWinVest is proposing to amend its Certificate of Incorporation to extend the date by which it has to consummate an initial business combination to the Charter Extension Date so as to give it additional time to complete the Business Combination.\n\nWithout the Charter Extension, we do not believe the Company will be able to complete an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) on or before the Current Termination Date. If that were to occur, the Company would be forced to liquidate.\n\nAs contemplated by the Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of Public Stock may elect to redeem all or a portion of their Public Stock in exchange for their pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account if the Charter Extension is implemented.\n\nOn , 2024, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement, the redemption price per share was approximately $ (which is expected to be the same approximate amount two business days prior to the Stockholder Meeting), based on the aggregate amount on deposit in the Trust Account of approximately $ as of , 2024 (including interest not previously released to the Company to pay its income or other tax obligations), divided by the total number of then-outstanding shares of Public Stock. The redemption price per share will increase between , 2024 and the date that is two business days prior to the Stockholder Meeting due to any interest that accrues on the amount on deposit in the Trust Account prior to such date (less any amounts released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations between such dates). The closing price of the Public Stock as reported on Nasdaq on , 2024 was $ . Accordingly, if the market price of the Common Stock were to remain the same until the date of the Stockholder Meeting, exercising redemption rights would result in a public stockholder receiving approximately $ more per share than if the shares were sold in the open market (based on the current per share redemption price and the closing price of our Public Stock as reported on Nasdaq on , 2024). We cannot assure you that you will be able to sell your Common Stock in the open market, even if the market price per share is lower than the redemption price stated above, as there may not be sufficient liquidity in our securities when you wish to sell your shares. We believe that such redemption right enables our public stockholders to determine whether or not to sustain their investments for an additional period if we do not complete the Business Combination on or before the Current Termination Date.\n\n**Reasons for the Extension Amendment Proposal**\n\nOur Certificate of Incorporation currently provides that we have until December 17, 2024 to complete an initial business combination. The Company and its officers and directors agreed that they would not seek to amend the Certificate of Incorporation to allow for a longer period of time to complete an initial business combination unless the Company provided holders of its Public Stock with the right to seek redemption of their Public Stock in connection therewith. The Board believes that it is in the best interests of our stockholders that the Charter Extension be obtained so that we will have a limited additional amount of time to consummate the Business Combination. Without the Charter Extension, we believe we will not be able to complete an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) on or before December 17, 2024. If that were to occur, we would be forced to liquidate. We believe that given the Company’s expenditure of time, effort and money on pursuing the Business Combination, circumstances warrant providing our public stockholders an opportunity to consider the Business Combination.\n\nThe Extension Amendment Proposal is essential to allowing the Company additional time to consummate the Business Combination. Approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal is a condition to the implementation of the Charter Extension.\n\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved and the Company determines to effect the Charter Extension, prior to filing the Extension Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State to effectuate the Charter Extension, the Lender shall lend the Company the Monthly Extension Payment, which the Company shall deposit into the Trust Account, upon the Company’s first drawdown of the Note.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \nIn addition, if the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved and the Charter Extension becomes effective, in the event we have not consummated an initial business combination by January 17, 2025, without approval of our public stockholders, we may, by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, extend the Termination Date up to five times, each by one additional month (or such shorter period as the Sponsor shall request) (for a total of up to six additional months to complete an initial business combination), provided that we draw down and deposit into the Trust Account, for each such extension, the Monthly Extension Payment, for an additional aggregate deposit of up to $150,000. If we complete an initial business combination, we will repay the amounts loaned under the Note. If we do not complete an initial business combination by the applicable Termination Date, such Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. If the Sponsor designates a third party as Lender, we may negotiate with the Lender and vary the terms of the Note, issue securities and pay certain fees to the Lender in connection with the Note. For illustrative purposes, if the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved and the Charter Extension becomes effective and we take the maximum time to complete an initial business combination, the redemption price per share at the stockholder meeting to consider such initial business combination or our subsequent liquidation would be approximately $ per share of Public Stock, based on the aggregate amount on deposit in the Trust Account of approximately $ as of , 2024 and an aggregate of $180,000 to be drawn down under the Note and deposited in the Trust Account, divided by the total number of then-outstanding shares of Public Stock (assuming no Public Stock is redeemed in connection with the Stockholder Meeting, and not giving effect to the accrual of any further interest or any interest to be released to the Company to pay its income or other tax obligations), in comparison to the redemption price as of , 2024 of approximately $ per share.\n\n**If the Extension Amendment Proposal is Not Approved**\n\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal is not approved and the Business Combination is not completed on or before the Current Termination Date, then, as contemplated by and in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter redeem 100% of the Public Stock for cash for a redemption price per share as described below (which redemption will completely extinguish such holders’ rights as stockholders, including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to approval of our then-stockholders and subject to the requirements of the DGCL, including the adoption of a resolution by the Board pursuant to Section 275(a) of the DGCL finding the dissolution of the Company advisable and the provision of such notices as are required by said Section 275(a) of the DGCL, dissolve and liquidate the balance of the Company’s net assets to its remaining stockholders, as part of the Company’s plan of dissolution and liquidation, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to the Company’s obligations under the DGCL to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law. In such event, the per share redemption price shall be equal to a pro rata share of the Trust Account plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company or necessary to pay its taxes (less up to $100,000 of such interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the total number of shares of Public Stock then outstanding. There will be no distribution from the Trust Account with respect to our Warrants or Rights, which may both expire worthless in the event the Company dissolves and liquidates the Trust Account. If we liquidate, our public stockholders may only receive $ per share. This will also cause you to lose any potential investment opportunity in a target company (including Xtribe) and the chance of realizing future gains on your investment through any price appreciation in the combined company.\n\nThe Initial Stockholders have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to the 2,875,000 Founder Shares held by them.\n\n**If the Extension Amendment Proposal is Approved**\n\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved, assuming the Trust Amendment Proposal is also approved, the Company will make all filings required to be made with the Delaware Secretary of State in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal to extend the time it has to complete an initial business combination until the Charter Extension Date. We will then continue to attempt to consummate the Business Combination until the Charter Extension Date (or Additional Charter Extension Date, if applicable). WinVest will remain a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and its Common Stock, Rights and Public Warrants will remain publicly traded during this time.\n\n26  \n---  \n  \n**Interests of the Initial Stockholders**\n\nWhen considering the recommendation of the Board, you should be aware that aside from their interests as direct or indirect stockholders, the Initial Stockholders (including the Sponsor and our directors and officers) have interests that are different from, or in addition to, those of other stockholders generally. The Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in recommending to stockholders that they approve the Extension Amendment Proposal. You should take these interests into account in deciding whether to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal:\n\n● | the fact that the Sponsor paid $5,450,000 for 10,900,000 Private Placement Warrants, each of which is identical to the Public Warrants issued as part of the Units and entitles the holder thereof to purchase one-half (1/2) of a share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share. If the Extension Amendment Proposal is not approved and the Company does not consummate an initial business combination by December 17, 2024, then a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants will be part of the liquidating distribution to the public stockholders and the Private Placement Warrants held by our Sponsor will be worthless;  \n---|---  \n● | the fact that the Initial Stockholders have invested in the Company an aggregate of $5,475,000, comprised of the $25,000 purchase price for 2,875,000 Founder Shares and the $5,450,000 purchase price for 10,900,000 Private Placement Warrants. Assuming a trading price of $ per share of Common Stock and $ per Public Warrant (based upon the respective closing prices of the Common Stock and the Public Warrants on Nasdaq on , 2024, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement), the 2,875,000 Founder Shares and 10,900,000 Private Placement Warrants would have an implied aggregate market value of $ . Even if the trading price of the shares of Common Stock was as low as $1.90 per share, the aggregate market value of the Founder Shares alone (without taking into account the value of the Private Placement Warrants) would be approximately equal to the initial investment in the Company by the Initial Stockholders. As a result, if an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) is completed, the Initial Stockholders are likely to be able to make a substantial profit on their investment in the Company at a time when the Common Stock has lost significant value. On the other hand, if the Extension Amendment Proposal is not approved and the Company liquidates without completing an initial business combination before December 17, 2024, the Initial Stockholders will lose their entire investment in the Company;  \n● | the fact that the Company has issued unsecured promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,950,000 to the Sponsor, which notes will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any, in the event we do not consummate an initial business combination;  \n● | the fact that the Initial Stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares held by them if the Extension Amendment Proposal is not approved and we fail to complete an initial business combination by December 17, 2024;  \n---|---  \n● | the fact that certain of our Initial Stockholders may serve as directors or officers of any acquired business after the consummation of an initial business combination, and as such, would be entitled to receive any cash fees, stock options or stock awards that a post-business combination board of directors determines to pay to its directors and officers. For example, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, if the Business Combination is consummated, the Sponsor will be entitled to name two directors of the combined company;   \n● | the indemnification of our existing officers and directors and the liability insurance maintained by the Company;  \n---|---  \n● | the fact that the Initial Stockholders will lose their entire investment in the Company and will not be reimbursed for any loans extended, fees due or out-of-pocket expenses if the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are not approved and an initial business combination is not consummated by December 17, 2024; and  \n---|---  \n  \n27  \n---  \n  \n● | the fact that the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) $10.10 per share of Public Stock or (ii) such lesser amount per share of Public Stock held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the Trust Account assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account or any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Redemption Rights**\n\nPursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, holders of Public Stock may seek to redeem their shares for cash, regardless of whether they vote for or against, or whether they abstain from voting on, the Extension Amendment Proposal. In connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal and contingent upon the effectiveness of the implementation of the Charter Extension, any stockholder holding shares of Public Stock may demand that the Company redeem such shares for a full pro rata portion of the Trust Account (which, for illustrative purposes, was approximately $ per share as of , 2024), calculated as of two business days prior to the Stockholder Meeting. If a holder properly seeks redemption as described in this section, we will redeem these shares for a pro rata portion of funds deposited in the Trust Account and the holder will no longer own these shares following the Stockholder Meeting.\n\nAs a holder of Public Stock, you will be entitled to receive cash for any Public Stock to be redeemed only if you:\n\n(i) | (a) hold Public Stock or (b) hold Public Stock through Units and elect to separate your Units into the underlying Public Stock, Rights and Public Warrants prior to exercising your redemption rights with respect to the Public Stock;  \n---|---  \n(ii) | submit a written request to the Transfer Agent, in which you (a) request that we redeem all or a portion of your Public Stock for cash, and (b) identify yourself as the beneficial holder of the Public Stock and provide your legal name, phone number and address; and  \n(iii) | deliver your Public Stock to the Transfer Agent, physically or electronically through DTC.  \n  \n**Holders must complete the procedures for electing to redeem their Public Stock in the manner described above prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on , 2024 (two business days prior to the initially scheduled Stockholder Meeting) in order for their shares to be redeemed.**\n\nThe redemption rights include the requirement that a holder must identify itself in writing as a beneficial holder and provide its legal name, phone number and address to Continental in order to validly redeem its shares.\n\nIf you hold the shares in “street name,” you will have to coordinate with your broker to have your shares certificated or delivered electronically. Shares of the Company that have not been tendered (either physically or electronically) in accordance with these procedures will not be redeemed for cash. There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through DTC’s DWAC system. The Transfer Agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming stockholder.\n\nAny request for redemption, once made by a holder of Public Stock, may not be withdrawn following the Redemption Deadline, unless approved by the Board. Any corrected or changed written exercise of redemption rights must be received by the Transfer Agent by the Redemption Deadline.\n\n28  \n---  \n  \nThe closing price of the Public Stock on , 2024, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement, was $ per share. The cash held in the Trust Account on , 2024 was approximately $ (including interest not previously released to the Company to pay its income or other tax obligations) ($ per share of Public Stock). Prior to exercising redemption rights, stockholders should verify the market price of the Public Stock, as they may receive higher proceeds from the sale of their Public Stock in the public market than from exercising their redemption rights if the market price per share is higher than the redemption price. We cannot assure you that you will be able to sell your Public Stock in the open market, even if the market price per share is lower than the redemption price stated above, as there may not be sufficient liquidity in our securities when its stockholders wish to sell their shares.\n\nIf a holder of Public Stock exercises his, her or its redemption rights, then he, she or it will be exchanging its Public Stock for cash and will no longer own those shares. You will be entitled to receive cash for these shares only if you properly demand redemption by delivering your share certificate (either physically or electronically) to the Transfer Agent two business days prior to the vote at the Stockholder Meeting.\n\n**Vote Required for Approval**\n\nThe approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. Abstentions will be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum but will not constitute votes cast at the Stockholder Meeting and therefore will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Extension Amendment Proposal.\n\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, the Initial Stockholders intend to vote any shares of Common Stock owned by them in favor of the Extension Amendment Proposal. As of the date hereof, the Initial Stockholders own an aggregate of 85.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. As a result, approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal will not require the affirmative vote of any shares of Public Stock.\n\n**Recommendation of the Board**\n\n**THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE**\n\n**EXTENSION AMENDMENT PROPOSAL.**\n\n29  \n---  \n  \n**PROPOSAL NO. 2 — THE TRUST AMENDMENT PROPOSAL**\n\n**Overview**\n\nWe entered into the Trust Agreement in connection with the IPO and a potential initial business combination. The Trust Amendment would amend the Trust Agreement to authorize the Charter Extension as contemplated by the Extension Amendment Proposal.\n\n**Reasons for the Proposal**\n\nThe purpose of the Trust Amendment Proposal is to authorize the Charter Extension under the Trust Agreement, as the Charter Extension is not contemplated under the Trust Agreement’s current terms and such an amendment to the Trust Agreement requires the approval of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock. We believe that given the Company’s expenditure of time, effort and money on pursuing the Business Combination, circumstances warrant providing our public stockholders an opportunity to consider the Business Combination. For the Company to implement the Charter Extension, the Trust Agreement must be amended to authorize the Charter Extension.\n\n**If the Trust Amendment Proposal is Not Approved**\n\nIf the Trust Amendment Proposal is not approved, the Charter Extension cannot be effected. If the Charter Extension is not effected and we do not complete an initial business combination on or before the Current Termination Date, then, as contemplated by and in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter redeem 100% of the Public Stock for cash for a redemption price per share as described below (which redemption will completely extinguish such holders’ rights as stockholders, including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to approval of our then-stockholders and subject to the requirements of the DGCL, including the adoption of a resolution by the Board pursuant to Section 275(a) of the DGCL finding the dissolution of the Company advisable and the provision of such notices as are required by said Section 275(a) of the DGCL, dissolve and liquidate the balance of the Company’s net assets to its remaining stockholders, as part of the Company’s plan of dissolution and liquidation, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to the Company’s obligations under the DGCL to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law. In such event, the per share redemption price shall be equal to a pro rata share of the Trust Account plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company or necessary to pay its taxes (less up to $100,000 of such interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the total number of shares of Public Stock then outstanding. There will be no distribution from the Trust Account with respect to our Warrants or Rights, which may both expire worthless in the event the Company dissolves and liquidates the Trust Account.\n\n**If the Trust Amendment Proposal is Approved**\n\nIf the Trust Amendment Proposal is approved, assuming the Extension Amendment Proposal is also approved, the Company shall enter into the Trust Amendment with the Trustee to extend the Liquidation Date. We will then continue to attempt to consummate the Business Combination until the Charter Extension Date (or Additional Charter Extension Date, if applicable). WinVest will remain a reporting company under the Exchange Act and its Common Stock, Rights and Public Warrants will remain publicly traded during this time.\n\n**Interests of the Initial Stockholders**\n\nThe existence of financial and personal interests of our Initial Stockholders (including our Sponsor and our directors and officers) may result in a conflict of interest on the part of one or more of the Initial Stockholders between what he, she or it may believe is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and what he, she or it may believe is best for himself, herself or itself in determining to recommend that stockholders vote for the proposals. See the section entitled _Proposal No. 1 — The Extension Amendment Proposal — Interests of the Initial Stockholders_ ” for a further discussion.\n\n**Vote Required for Approval**\n\nThe approval of the Trust Amendment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. Abstentions will be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum but will not constitute votes cast at the Stockholder Meeting and therefore will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Trust Amendment Proposal.\n\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, the Initial Stockholders intend to vote all shares Common Stock owned by them in favor of the Trust Amendment Proposal. As of the date hereof, the Initial Stockholders own an aggregate of 85.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. As a result, approval of the Trust Amendment Proposal will not require the affirmative vote of any shares of Public Stock.\n\n**Recommendation of the Board**\n\n**THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE**\n\n**TRUST AMENDMENT PROPOSAL.**\n\n30  \n---  \n  \n**PROPOSAL NO. 3 — THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL**\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe Adjournment Proposal asks stockholders to approve the adjournment of the Stockholder Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies if, based upon the tabulated vote at the time of the Stockholder Meeting, there are insufficient shares of Common Stock represented (either in person (including virtually) or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the Stockholder Meeting or to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal.\n\n**If the Adjournment Proposal is Not Approved**\n\nIf the Adjournment Proposal is not approved by our stockholders, the Board may not be able to adjourn the Stockholder Meeting to a later date in the event, that based on the tabulated votes, there are insufficient shares of Common Stock represented (either in person (including virtually) or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the Stockholder Meeting or at the time of the Stockholder Meeting to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal. In such events, the Charter Extension and the Trust Amendment would not be implemented.\n\n**Vote Required for Approval**\n\nThe approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock who are present in person (including virtually) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the Stockholder Meeting. Abstentions will be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum but will not constitute votes cast at the Stockholder Meeting and therefore will have no effect on the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.\n\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, the Initial Stockholders intend to vote any shares of Common Stock owned by them in favor of the Adjournment Proposal. As of the date hereof, the Initial Stockholders own an aggregate of 85.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. As a result, approval of the Adjournment Proposal will not require the affirmative vote of any shares of Public Stock.\n\n**Recommendation of the Board**\n\n**THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR”**\n\n**THE APPROVAL OF THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL.**\n\n31  \n---  \n  \n**CERTAIN MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS FOR STOCKHOLDERS EXERCISING REDEMPTION RIGHTS**\n\nThe following discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations for U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of Public Stock that elect to have their Public Stock redeemed for cash if the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved. This section applies only to investors that hold Public Stock as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular stockholder in light of its particular circumstances or status, including:\n\n● | financial institutions or financial services entities;  \n---|---  \n● | broker-dealers;  \n● | S corporations;  \n● | taxpayers that are subject to the mark-to-market accounting rules;  \n● | tax-exempt entities;  \n● | governments or agencies or instrumentalities thereof;  \n● | tax-qualified retirement plans;  \n● | insurance companies;  \n● | regulated investment companies or real estate investment trusts;  \n● | expatriates or former long-term residents or citizens of the United States;  \n● | persons that directly, indirectly, or constructively own five percent or more of our voting shares or five percent or more of the total value of all classes of our shares;  \n● | persons that acquired our securities pursuant to an exercise of employee share options, in connection with employee share incentive plans or otherwise as compensation;  \n● | persons that hold our securities as part of a straddle, constructive sale, hedging, conversion, synthetic security or other integrated or similar transaction;  \n● | persons or corporations subject to the alternative minimum tax;  \n● | U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;  \n● | controlled foreign corporations;  \n● | corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;  \n● | “qualified foreign pension funds” (within the meaning of Section 897(l)(2) of the Code) and entities whose interests are held by qualified foreign pension funds;  \n● | accrual method taxpayers that file applicable financial statements as described in Section 451(b) of the Code; or  \n● | passive foreign investment companies or their stockholders.  \n  \n32  \n---  \n  \nThis discussion is based on current U.S. federal income tax laws as in effect on the date hereof, which is subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis, which may affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences described herein. Furthermore, this discussion does not address any aspect of U.S. federal non-income tax laws, such as gift, estate or Medicare net investment income tax laws, or state, local or non-U.S. laws. We have not sought, and we do not intend to seek, a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) as to any U.S. federal income tax considerations described herein. The IRS may disagree with the discussion herein, and its determination may be upheld by a court. Moreover, there can be no assurance that future legislation, regulations, administrative rulings or court decisions will not adversely affect the accuracy of the statements in this discussion.\n\nThis discussion does not consider the U.S. federal income tax treatment of entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or other pass-through entities (including branches) for U.S. federal income tax purposes (any such entity or arrangement, a “Flow-Through Entity”) or investors that hold our Public Stock through Flow-Through Entities. If a Flow-Through Entity is the beneficial owner of our Public Stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a redemption of such Public Stock generally will depend on the status of such investor and the activities of such investor and such Flow-Through Entity.\n\nIf you hold our Public Stock through a Flow-Through Entity, we urge you to consult your tax advisor.\n\n**THE FOLLOWING IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. EACH HOLDER IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO SUCH HOLDER OF EXERCISING REDEMPTION RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.**\n\nFor purposes of this discussion, because any Unit is separable at the option of the holder, we are treating each share of Public Stock, Public Warrant and Right held by a holder in the form of a single Unit as separate instruments and assuming that the Unit itself will not be treated as an integrated instrument. Accordingly, the cancellation or separation of the Units in connection with the exercise of redemption rights generally should not be a taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This position is not free from doubt, and no assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a contrary position.\n\n**_Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations to U.S. Stockholders_**\n\nThis section is addressed to Redeeming U.S. Holders (as defined below) of Public Stock that elect to have their Public Stock redeemed for cash as described in the section titled “ _Proposal No. 1 — The Extension Amendment Proposal — Redemption Rights_.” For purposes of this discussion, a “Redeeming U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner that so redeems its shares and is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\n● | an individual citizen or resident of the United States;  \n---|---  \n● | a corporation (or other entity that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is created or organized (or treated as created or organized) in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;  \n● | an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or  \n● | any trust if (1) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more United States persons (within the meaning of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in place to be treated as a United States person.  \n  \n33  \n---  \n  \n_Tax Treatment of the Redemption — In General_\n\nThe U.S. federal income tax consequences to a Redeeming U.S. Holder of Public Stock that exercises its redemption rights to receive cash in exchange for all or a portion of its Public Stock will depend on whether the redemption qualifies as a sale of the Public Stock redeemed under Section 302 of the Code or is treated as a distribution under Section 301 of the Code. If the redemption qualifies as a sale of such Redeeming U.S. Holder’s shares, such Redeeming U.S. Holder will generally be required to recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the tax basis of the shares redeemed. Such gain or loss should be treated as capital gain or loss if such shares were held as a capital asset on the date of the redemption. Any such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Redeeming U.S. Holder’s holding period for such shares exceeds one year at the time of the redemption. A Redeeming U.S. Holder’s tax basis in such Redeeming U.S. Holder’s shares generally will equal the cost of such shares.\n\nThe redemption generally will qualify as a sale of such shares if the redemption either (i) is “substantially disproportionate” with respect to the Redeeming U.S. Holder, (ii) results in a “complete redemption” of such Redeeming U.S. Holder’s interest in the Company or (iii) is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to such Redeeming U.S. Holder. These tests are explained more fully below.\n\nFor purposes of such tests, a Redeeming U.S. Holder takes into account not only shares directly owned by such Redeeming U.S. Holder, but also shares that are constructively owned by such Redeeming U.S. Holder. A Redeeming U.S. Holder may constructively own, in addition to Public Stock owned directly, Public Stock owned by certain related individuals and entities in which such Redeeming U.S. Holder has an interest or that have an interest in such Redeeming U.S. Holder, as well as any shares such Redeeming U.S. Holder has a right to acquire by exercise of an option, which would generally include shares which could be acquired pursuant to the exercise of the Public Warrants.\n\nThe redemption generally will be “substantially disproportionate” with respect to a Redeeming U.S. Holder if the percentage of the Company’s outstanding voting shares that such Redeeming U.S. Holder directly or constructively owns immediately after the redemption is less than 80 percent of the percentage of the Company’s outstanding voting shares that such Redeeming U.S. Holder directly or constructively owned immediately before the redemption, and such Redeeming U.S. Holder immediately after the redemption actually and constructively owns less than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of the Company. There will be a complete redemption of such Redeeming U.S. Holder’s interest if either (i) all of the shares directly or constructively owned by such Redeeming U.S. Holder are redeemed or (ii) all of the shares directly owned by such Redeeming U.S. Holder are redeemed and such Redeeming U.S. Holder is eligible to waive, and effectively waives in accordance with specific rules, the attribution of the shares owned by certain family members and such Redeeming U.S. Holder does not constructively own any other shares. The redemption will not be essentially equivalent to a dividend if it results in a “meaningful reduction” of such Redeeming U.S. Holder’s proportionate interest in the Company. Whether the redemption will result in a “meaningful reduction” in such Redeeming U.S. Holder’s proportionate interest will depend on the particular facts and circumstances applicable to it. The IRS has indicated in a published ruling that even a small reduction in the proportionate interest of a small minority Stockholder in a publicly held corporation that exercises no control over corporate affairs may constitute such a “meaningful reduction.”\n\nIf none of the above tests is satisfied, the redemption will be treated as a distribution with respect to the shares under Section 302 of the Code, in which case the Redeeming U.S. Holder will be treated as receiving a corporate distribution as discussed below.\n\n_Redemption of Public Stock Treated as Corporate Distribution_\n\nIf the redemption is treated as a corporate distribution, such distribution generally will constitute a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. If the redemption is treated as a corporate distribution treated as dividend, such dividends paid to a Redeeming U.S. Holder that is a taxable corporation generally will qualify for the dividends received deduction if the requisite holding period is satisfied. With certain exceptions (including, but not limited to, dividends treated as investment income for purposes of investment interest deduction limitations), and provided certain holding period requirements are met, dividends paid to a non-corporate Redeeming U.S. Holder generally will constitute “qualified dividends” that will be subject to tax at a preferable rate. It is unclear whether the redemption rights with respect to the Public Stock described in this proxy statement will prevent a U.S. Holder from satisfying the applicable holding period requirements with respect to the dividends received deduction or the preferential tax rate on qualified dividend income, as the case may be.\n\n34  \n---  \n  \nDistributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of capital that will be applied against and reduce (but not below zero) the Redeeming U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Redeeming U.S. Holder’s Public Stock. Any remaining excess will be treated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition of such Redeeming U.S. Holder’s Public Stock as discussed below. After the application of those rules, any remaining tax basis of the Redeeming U.S. Holder in the redeemed Public Stock will be added to the Redeeming U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its remaining Public Stock, or, if it has none, to the Redeeming U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Public Warrants or possibly in other shares constructively owned by it.\n\n_Redemption of Public Stock Treated as a Sale or Other Disposition_\n\nIf the redemption qualifies as a sale or other disposition of Public Stock, a Redeeming U.S. Holder will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the amount of cash received in such redemption and (ii) the Redeeming U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Public Stock so redeemed. A Redeeming U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Public Stock generally will equal the Redeeming U.S. Holder’s acquisition cost (that is, the portion of the purchase price of a Unit allocated to a share of Public Stock or the Redeeming U.S. Holder’s initial basis for Public Stock received upon exercise of a whole Warrant) less any prior distributions treated as a return of capital. Any such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Redeeming U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Public Stock so disposed of exceeds one year. Long-term capital gain realized by a non-corporate Redeeming U.S. Holder generally will be taxable at a reduced rate. The deduction of capital losses is subject to limitations. However, it is unclear whether the redemption rights with respect to the Public Stock described in this proxy statement may prevent a U.S. Holder from satisfying the applicable holding period requirements for long-term capital gain or loss.\n\nIf a Redeeming U.S. Holder holds different blocks of Public Stock (generally, shares of Public Stock purchased or acquired on different dates or at different prices), such Redeeming U.S. Holder is urged to consult its tax advisors to determine how the above rules apply to such Redeeming U.S. Holder.\n\n**ALL REDEEMING U.S. HOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF A REDEMPTION OF ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR PUBLIC STOCK PURSUANT TO AN EXERCISE OF REDEMPTION RIGHTS.**\n\n**_Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations to Non-U.S. Stockholders_**\n\nThis section is addressed to Redeeming Non-U.S. Holders (as defined below) of Public Stock that elect to have their shares redeemed for cash as described in the section titled “ _Proposal No. 1 — The Extension Amendment Proposal — Redemption Rights_.” For purposes of this discussion, a “Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner (other than a Flow-Through Entity) of our Public Stock that so redeems its Public Stock and is not a Redeeming U.S. Holder.\n\n_Tax Treatment of the Redemption — In General_\n\nExcept as otherwise discussed in this section, the characterization of a redemption for a Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder who elects to have its shares redeemed will generally be characterized in the same manner as a U.S. Stockholder for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See the discussion above under “ _Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations to U.S. Stockholders_.”\n\nRedeeming Non-U.S. Holders of shares considering exercising their redemption rights are urged to consult their tax advisors as to whether the redemption of their shares will be treated as a sale or as a distribution under the Code, and whether they will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized or dividends received as a result of the redemption based upon their particular circumstances.\n\n35  \n---  \n  \n_Redemption of Public Stock Treated as a Corporate Distribution_\n\nIf the redemption qualifies as a corporate distribution, such distribution generally will constitute a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles, and provided such dividends are not effectively connected with the Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States, we will be required to withhold tax from the gross amount of the dividend at a rate of 30%, unless such Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder is eligible for a reduced rate of withholding tax under an applicable income tax treaty and provides proper certification of its eligibility for such reduced rate (on IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E). Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of capital to the extent of the Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder’s Public Stock. Any remaining excess will be treated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition of such Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder’s Public Stock as discussed below. In addition, if we determine that we are likely to be classified as a “U.S. real property holding corporation” (see “—  _Redemption of Public Stock Treated as a Sale or Other Disposition_ ” below), we will withhold 15% of any distribution that exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits.\n\nThe withholding tax does not apply to dividends paid to a Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder who provides a Form W-8ECI, certifying that the dividends are effectively connected with the Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States. Instead, the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. resident, subject to an applicable income tax treaty providing otherwise. A Redeeming Non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” imposed at a rate of 30% (or a lower treaty rate) on its effectively connected earnings and profits that are not reinvested in the United States.\n\n_Redemption of Public Stock Treated as a Sale or Other Disposition_\n\nIf the redemption qualifies as a sale or other disposition, a Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax in respect of gain recognized on a sale or other disposition of Public Stock unless:\n\n● | the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business by the Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder within the United States;  \n---|---  \n● | the Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition and certain other conditions are met; or  \n● | we are or have been a “U.S. real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of disposition or the period that the Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder held Public Stock, and, in the case where the shares of Public Stock are regularly traded on an established securities market, the Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder has owned, directly or constructively (including through ownership of Warrants) more than 5% of the shares of Public Stock at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the disposition or such Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period for the shares of Public Stock.  \n  \nUnless an applicable treaty provides otherwise, gain described in the first bullet point above will be subject to tax at generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rates as if the Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. resident. Any gains described in the first bullet point above of a Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate (or lower treaty rate) on its effectively connected earnings and profits that are not reinvested in the United States. Gain described in the second bullet point above will be subject to a flat 30% U.S. federal income tax rate on the gain derived from the redemption, which gain may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses for the year.\n\nIf the third bullet point above applies to a Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder, gain recognized by such holder on the disposition of the Public Stock will be subject to tax at generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rates. We cannot determine whether we will be a U.S. real property holding corporation in the future until we complete an initial business combination. We will be classified as a U.S. real property holding corporation if the fair market value of our “U.S. real property interests” equals or exceeds 50 percent of the sum of the fair market value of our worldwide real property interests plus our other assets used or held for use in a trade or business, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\n36  \n---  \n  \nIf a Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder holds different blocks of Public Stock (generally, shares of Public Stock purchased or acquired on different dates or at different prices), such Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder is urged to consult its tax advisors to determine how the above rules apply to such Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder.\n\n**_Backup Withholding_**\n\nIn general, proceeds received from the exercise of redemption rights will be subject to backup withholding for a non-corporate Redeeming U.S. Holder that:\n\n● | fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number;  \n---|---  \n● | is notified by the IRS regarding a failure to report all interest or dividends required to be shown on his or her federal income tax returns; or  \n● | in certain circumstances, fails to comply with applicable certification requirements.  \n  \nA Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder generally may eliminate the requirement for information reporting and backup withholding by providing certification of its non-U.S. status, under penalties of perjury, on a duly executed applicable IRS Form W-8 or by otherwise establishing an exemption.\n\nAny amount withheld under these rules will be creditable against the Redeeming U.S. Holder’s or Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability or refundable to the extent that it exceeds this liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS and other applicable requirements are met.\n\n**As previously noted above, the foregoing discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences is included for general information purposes only and is not intended to be, and should not be construed as, legal or tax advice to any stockholder. We once again urge you to consult with your tax adviser to determine the particular tax consequences to you (including the application and effect of any U.S. federal, state, local or foreign income or other tax laws) of the receipt of cash in exchange for shares in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal and any redemption of your Public Stock.**\n\n37  \n---  \n  \n**BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF SECURITIES**\n\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our Common Stock as of , 2024, based on information obtained from the persons named below, with respect to the beneficial ownership of shares of our Common Stock, by:\n\n● | each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock;  \n---|---  \n● | each of our officers and directors; and  \n● | all of our executive officers and directors as a group.  \n  \nBeneficial ownership is determined according to the rules of the SEC, which generally provide that a person has beneficial ownership of a security if such person possesses sole or shared voting or investment power over that security, including options and warrants that are currently exercisable or exercisable within sixty days.\n\nThe following table is based on 3,367,333 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of , 2024. Common stockholders of record are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by stockholders. Unless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by them. The following table does not reflect record or beneficial ownership of our Warrants or Rights, as these Warrants and Rights are not exercisable within 60 days of , 2024.\n\n**Name and Address of Beneficial Owner(1)** | Amount and Nature of Beneficial Ownership of Common Stock | Percentage of Outstanding Shares of Common Stock  \n---|---|---  \nDirectors and Named Executive Officers:  \nManish Jhunjhunwala | 53,576 | 1.6| %  \nMark H.

Jeff LeBlanc, one of our founders, is the sole manager of our Sponsor and may be deemed to have beneficial ownership of the shares of Common Stock held directly by our Sponsor.

Mr. LeBlanc disclaims any beneficial ownership of the reported shares owned by our Sponsor other than to the extent of any pecuniary interest he may have therein, directly or indirectly.  \n  \n38  \n---  \n  \n**FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS**\n\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal are approved and the Extension Amendment is filed, we anticipate that we will hold another special meeting before the Termination Date to consider and vote upon approval of our initial business combination and other related matters. If we consummate the initial business combination within the required timeframe, our first annual meeting of stockholders will be held at a future date to be determined by the post-business combination company. If either the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Amendment Proposal are not approved and an initial business combination is not consummated, or if they are approved but we do not consummate an initial business combination prior to the applicable Termination Date, the Company will liquidate and dissolve and there will be no annual meetings of the Company. You should direct any proposals to our Chief Executive Officer at WinVest Acquisition Corp., 125 Cambridgepark Drive, Suite 301, Cambridge, MA 02140.\n\n39  \n---  \n  \n**HOUSEHOLDING INFORMATION**\n\nUnless we have received contrary instructions, we may send a single copy of this proxy statement to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if we believe the stockholders are members of the same family. This process, known as “householding,” reduces the volume of duplicate information received at any one household and helps to reduce our expenses. However, if stockholders prefer to receive multiple sets of our disclosure documents at the same address this year or in future years, the stockholders should follow the instructions described below. Similarly, if an address is shared with another stockholder and together both of the stockholders would like to receive only a single set of our disclosure documents, the stockholders should follow these instructions:\n\n● | If the shares are registered in the name of the stockholder, the stockholder should contact us at our offices at WinVest Acquisition Corp., 125 Cambridgepark Drive, Suite 301, Cambridge, MA 02140, to inform us of his or her request; or  \n---|---  \n● | If a bank, broker or other nominee holds the shares, the stockholder should contact the bank, broker or other nominee directly.  \n  \n40  \n---  \n  \n**WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION**\n\nWe file reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC as required by the Exchange Act. You may access information on the Company at the SEC web site, which contains reports, proxy statements and other information, at: http://www.sec.gov.\n\nThis proxy statement is available without charge to our stockholders upon written or oral request. If you would like additional copies of this proxy statement or if you have questions about the proposals to be presented at the Stockholder Meeting, you should contact the Company in writing at WinVest Acquisition Corp., 125 Cambridgepark Drive, Suite 301, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02140 or by telephone at (617) 658-3094.\n\nIf you have questions about the proposals or this proxy statement, would like additional copies of this proxy statement, or need to obtain proxy cards or other information related to the proxy solicitation, please contact Sodali, our proxy solicitor, by calling (800) 662-5200 (toll-free), or collect at (203) 658-9400 (for banks and brokers, or by emailing WINV.info@investor.sodali.com.

Immediately after the IPO, a certain amount of the net offering proceeds received by the Corporation in the IPO (including the proceeds of any exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option) and certain other amounts specified in the Registration Statement shall be deposited in the Trust Fund. Except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes, none of the funds held in the Trust Fund (including the interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Fund) will be released from the Trust Fund until the earliest to occur of (i) the completion of the initial Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of 100% of the IPO Shares if the Corporation is unable to complete its initial Business Combination within 40 months from the closing of the IPO (or up to 45 months, if applicable under the provisions of paragraph (F) of this Article Sixth) and (iii) the redemption of shares in connection with a vote seeking to amend such provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation as described in this Section 6(A). Holders of IPO Shares (whether such IPO Shares were purchased in the IPO or in the secondary market following the IPO and whether or not such holders are officers or directors of the Corporation, or affiliates of any of the foregoing) are referred to herein as “**Public Stockholders**.” If, in accordance with Article Thirteenth, any amendment is made to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (a) to modify the substance or timing of the Corporation’s obligation to redeem 100% of the IPO Shares if the Corporation has not consummated an initial Business Combination within 40 months from the closing of the IPO (or up to 45 months, if applicable under the provisions of paragraph F of this Article Sixth) or (b) with respect to any other material provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity, the Public Stockholders shall be provided with the opportunity to redeem their IPO Shares upon the approval of any such amendment, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Fund, including interest not previously released to the Corporation to pay its taxes, divided by the number of then-outstanding IPO Shares.\n\n12. | The text of Paragraph F of Article Sixth is hereby amended and restated to read in full as follows:  \n---|---  \n  \nF. In the event that the Corporation does not consummate a Business Combination upon the date which is the later of (i) 40 months from the closing of the IPO (or up to 45 months from the closing date of the IPO, if applicable, under the provisions of this paragraph (F)) and (ii) such later date as may be approved by the Company’s stockholders in accordance with this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (in any case, such date being referred to as the “Termination Date”), the Corporation shall (a) cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up, (b) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter redeem 100% of the IPO Shares for cash for a redemption price per share as described below (which redemption will completely extinguish such holders’ rights as stockholders, including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (c) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to approval of the Corporation’s then-stockholders and subject to the requirements of the GCL, including the adoption of a resolution by the Board pursuant to Section 275(a) of the GCL finding the dissolution of the Corporation advisable and the provision of such notices as are required by said Section 275(a) of the GCL, dissolve and liquidate the balance of the Corporation’s net assets to its remaining stockholders, as part of the Corporation’s plan of dissolution and liquidation, subject (in the case of (b) and (c) above) to the Corporation’s obligations under the GCL to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law. In such event, the per share redemption price shall be equal to a pro rata share of the Trust Fund plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Fund (less any taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the total number of IPO Shares then outstanding.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing or any other provisions of the Articles of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in the event that the Corporation has not consummated an initial Business Combination within 40 months from the closing of the IPO, the Corporation may, without another stockholder vote, elect to extend the date to consummate the Business Combination on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one (1) month (or such shorter period as WinVest SPAC LLC (the “Sponsor”) shall request) each time after 40 months from the closing of the IPO, by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor), and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until 45 months from the closing of the Offering, provided that the Sponsor (or one or more of its affiliates, members or third-party designees, including, but not limited to, any parties to a business combination agreement or their affiliates) (the “**Lender** ”) will lend the Company, and the Company will deposit into the Trust Fund: for each such extension, $30,000, for an aggregate deposit of up to $150,000 (if all five additional extensions are exercised), upon the Company’s drawdown of a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note issued by the Corporation to the Lender. If the Corporation completes a Business Combination, it will repay the amounts loaned under the promissory note. If the Corporation does not complete a Business Combination by the deadline to consummate the Business Combination, such promissory note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Fund or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven.\n\nA-2  \n---  \n  \nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be signed by its Chief Executive Officer this day of , 2024.\n\n**WINVEST ACQUISITION CORP.**  \n---  \nBy:  \nName: | Manish Jhunjhunwala  \nTitle: | Chief Executive Officer  \n  \nA-3  \n---  \n  \n**_ANNEX B_**\n\n**PROPOSED AMENDMENT**\n\n**TO THE**\n\n**INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT TRUST AGREEMENT**\n\n**OF**\n\n**WINVEST ACQUISITION CORP.**\n\nThis Amendment No. 4 (this “**Amendment** ”), dated as of [●], 2024, to the Trust Agreement (as defined below), is made by and between WinVest Acquisition Corp, a Delaware corporation (the “**Company** ”), and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, a New York corporation, as trustee (the “**Trustee** ”).

(“WinVest,” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on March 1, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination (the “Initial Business Combination”) with one or more businesses or entities. On August 30, 2024, WinVest (BVI) LTD was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”) as a wholly owned subsidiary of WinVest. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.\n\nThroughout this report, the terms “our,” “we,” “us,” and the “Company” refer to WinVest Acquisition Corp.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had not commenced core operations. All activity for the period from March 1, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024 relates to the Company’s formation, raising funds through the initial public offering (“Initial Public Offering”), which is described below, identifying a target company for an Initial Business Combination and working to consummate an Initial Business Combination with Xtribe (as defined below). The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of an Initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operating income in the form of interest and dividend income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering.\n\nThe registration statement pursuant to which the Company registered its securities offered in the Initial Public Offering (the “IPO Registration Statement”) was declared effective on September 14, 2021. On September 17, 2021, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 10,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock of the Company, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”), one redeemable warrant (the “Public Warrants”), with each Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one-half (1/2) of one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustment, and one Right (the “Rights”), with each Right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-fifteenth (1/15) of one share of Common Stock upon the consummation by the Company of an Initial Business Combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses).\n\nSimultaneously with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the issuance and sale of the Units, the Company completed the private sale of 10,000,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $0.50 per Private Placement Warrant to our sponsor, WinVest SPAC LLC (the “Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds of $5,000,000 (such sale, the “Private Placement”).\n\nEach Private Placement Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one-half of one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustment. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants.\n\nOn September 23, 2021, the underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option and purchased an additional 1,500,000 Units (the “Over-Allotment Units”), generating gross proceeds of $15,000,000 on September 27, 2021. Accordingly, no Founder Shares (as defined below) were subject to forfeiture upon exercise of the full over-allotment. Simultaneously with the sale of Over-Allotment Units, the Company consummated a private sale of an additional 900,000 Private Placement Warrants (the “Additional Private Placement Warrants”, and together with the Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants, the “Warrants”) to the Sponsor at a purchase price of $0.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds of $450,000. As of September 27, 2021, a total of $116,150,000 of the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants and the Additional Private Placement Warrants were deposited in a Trust Account (as defined below) established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders.\n\nFollowing the closing of the Initial Public Offering on September 17, 2021, and the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full on September 23, 2021, an aggregate amount of $116,150,000 from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account in the United States maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (“Continental”), as trustee (the “Trust Account”). The funds held in the Trust Account are invested only in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”) having a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act and that invest solely in U.S. treasuries, so that the Company is not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to pay for the Company’s income or other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the Trust Account until the earlier of the completion of the Initial Business Combination or the redemption of 100% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock issued as part of the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering (the “Public Shares”) if an Initial Business Combination has not been completed in the required time period. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business.\n\n5  \n---  \n  \nThe Company initially had 15 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering on September 17, 2021 to consummate the Initial Business Combination. On November 30, 2022, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders, at which the stockholders approved an amendment (the “November 2022 Extension Amendment”) to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (as amended, the “Certificate of Incorporation”) to extend the date (the “Termination Date”) by which the Company must consummate an Initial Business Combination from December 17, 2022 (the “Original Termination Date”) to January 17, 2023, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after January 17, 2023, by resolution of the Company’s board of directors, if requested by its Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2023, or a total of up to six months after the Original Termination Date, unless the closing of the Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, subject to the deposit by the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, of $125,000, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each one-month extension. Any such payments would be made in the form of a non-interest-bearing loan and would be repaid, if at all, from funds released to us upon completion of our Initial Business Combination.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the November 2022 Extension Amendment, the holders of 9,606,887 Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.20 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $98.0 million. Following such redemptions, approximately $19.6 million was left in the Trust Account and 1,893,113 shares remained outstanding.\n\nFollowing the approval of the November 2022 Extension Amendment, on December 5, 2022, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $750,000 (the “First Extension Note”) to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company up to $750,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. Per the terms of the First Extension Note, funds available under such note are not restricted for use for extension payments. The First Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) the Company’s liquidation. In the event that the Company does not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the First Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. Upon the consummation of an Initial Business Combination, the Sponsor may elect to convert any portion or all of the amount outstanding under the First Extension Note into private warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.50 per private warrant. Such private warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants issued to the Sponsor at the time of the Initial Public Offering.\n\nOn June 12, 2023, the Company held a second special meeting of stockholders (the “June 2023 Extension Meeting”), at which the stockholders approved, among other things, (i) an amendment (the “June 2023 Extension Amendment”) to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to extend the Termination Date from June 17, 2023 to July 17, 2023, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month (or such shorter period as may be requested by the Sponsor) after July 17, 2023, by resolution of the Company’s board of directors, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until December 17, 2023, or a total of up to six months after June 17, 2023, unless the closing of the Company’s Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, and (ii) an amendment (the “Redemption Limitation Amendment”) to eliminate from the Certificate of Incorporation the limitation that the Company may not consummate any business combination unless it has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon consummation of such business combination. Following stockholder approval of the June 2023 Extension Amendment and the Redemption Limitation Amendment at the June 2023 Extension Meeting, on June 16, 2023, the Company filed the June 2023 Extension Amendment and the Redemption Limitation Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the June 2023 Extension Amendment, the holders of 627,684 Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.71 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of $6,721,795. Following such redemptions, $13,551,331 was left in Trust Account and 1,265,429 Public Shares remained outstanding.\n\n6  \n---  \n  \nFollowing the approval of the June 2023 Extension Amendment on June 12, 2023, on June 13, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $390,000 (the “Second Extension Note”) to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company up to $390,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The Second Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) the Company’s liquidation. In the event that the Company does not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Second Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. Upon the consummation of an Initial Business Combination, the Sponsor may elect to convert any portion or all of the amount outstanding under the Second Extension Note into private warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.50 per private warrant. Such private warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants issued to the Sponsor at the time of the Initial Public Offering.\n\nOn November 30, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders, at which the stockholders approved, among other things, an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation (the “November 2023 Extension Amendment”) to extend the Termination Date from December 17, 2023 to January 17, 2024, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after January 17, 2023, by resolution of the Company’s board of directors, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2024, or a total of up to six months after December 17, 2023, unless the closing of the Company’s Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, by causing $55,000 to be deposited into the Trust Account for each such extension.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the November 2023 Extension Amendment, the holders of 122,306 Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.81 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $1,322,518. Following such redemptions, 1,143,123 Public Shares remained outstanding.\n\nFollowing the approval of the November 2023 Extension Amendment on November 30, 2023, on December 13, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $330,000 (the “Third Extension Note”) to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company up to $330,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The Third Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) the Company’s liquidation. In the event that the Company does not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Third Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any.\n\nOn June 3, 2024, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders, at which the stockholders approved, among other things, an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation (the “June 2024 Extension Amendment”) to extend the Termination Date from June 17, 2024 to July 17, 2024, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after July 17, 2024, by resolution of the Company’s board of directors, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until December 17, 2024, or a total of up to six months after June 17, 2024, unless the closing of the Company’s Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, by causing $30,000 to be deposited into the Trust Account for each such extension.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the June 2024 Extension Amendment, the holders of 650,790 Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $11.32 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $7,367,204. Following such redemptions, 492,333 Public Shares remained outstanding.\n\nFollowing the approval of the June 2024 Extension Amendment on June 3, 2024, on June 12, 2024, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $180,000 (the “Fourth Extension Note”) to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company up to $180,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The Fourth Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) the Company’s liquidation. In the event that the Company does not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Fourth Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any.\n\n7  \n---  \n  \nThrough the date of this report, the Company has deposited $1,650,000 into the Trust Account in connection with six drawdowns under the First Extension Note, six drawdowns under Second Extension Note, six drawdowns under the Third Extension Notes, and six drawdowns under the Fourth Extension Note (collectively the “Extension Notes”) pursuant to the extension of the Termination Date to December 17, 2024. Such amounts will be distributed either to: (i) all the holders of Public Shares upon the Company’s liquidation or (ii) holders of such shares who elect to have their shares redeemed in connection with (a) the vote to approve the Charter Extension Amendment (as defined below) or (b) the consummation of an Initial Business Combination. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $1,590,000 and $1,195,000, respectively, was outstanding under the Extension Notes.\n\nIf the Company is unable to consummate an Initial Business Combination by the Termination Date, the Company will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay for dissolution expenses), and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. However, the Company may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of the public stockholders. In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, the Rights, Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants will expire and will be worthless.\n\nNo compensation of any kind (including finders’, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of the existing officers, directors, stockholders, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the Initial Business Combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on the Company’s behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations. Since the role of present management after the Initial Business Combination is uncertain, the Company has no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after the Initial Business Combination.\n\nManagement intends to use any funds available outside of the Trust Account for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist the Company with its search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company’s insiders, officers and directors in connection with activities as described below.\n\nThe allocation of the net proceeds available to the Company outside of the Trust Account, along with the interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account available to pay for the Company’s income and other tax liabilities, represents the best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event that the Company’s assumptions prove to be inaccurate, the Company may reallocate some of such proceeds within the above-described categories. If the estimate of the costs of undertaking due diligence and negotiating the Initial Business Combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of interest available to the Company from the Trust Account is insufficient, the Company may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. In this event, the Company could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from the Sponsor or third parties. The Sponsor and/or founding stockholders may, but are not obligated to, loan funds as may be required. Such loans would be evidenced by promissory notes that would either be paid upon consummation of the Initial Business Combination, or, with respect to certain of such notes, at such lender’s discretion, converted upon consummation of the Initial Business Combination into Private Placement Warrants at a price of $0.50 per Private Placement Warrant. However, the Sponsor and/or founding stockholders are under no obligation to loan the Company any funds or invest in the Company. If the Company is unable to obtain the necessary funds, the Company may be forced to cease searching for a target business and liquidate without completing our Initial Business Combination.\n\nThe Company will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, the Private Placement and the sale of the Additional Private Placement Warrants, including the funds held in the Trust Account, in connection with the Initial Business Combination and to pay for expenses relating thereto, including the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions payable to the underwriters in an amount equal to 3.5% of the total gross proceeds raised in the offering upon consummation of the Initial Business Combination. To the extent that the Company’s capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect the Initial Business Combination, the proceeds held in the Trust Account which are not used to consummate an Initial Business Combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations or for strategic acquisitions.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \nTo the extent the Company is unable to consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Company will pay the costs of liquidation from the remaining assets outside of the Trust Account and from up to $100,000 of interest income on the balance of the Trust Account (net of income and other tax obligations) that may be released to it to pay for dissolution expenses. If such funds are insufficient, the Sponsor has agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.\n\nOn May 9, 2024, the Company entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Original Business Combination Agreement”), by and among WinVest, WinVest Merger Sub I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of WinVest, WinVest Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of WinVest, Xtribe P.L.C., a public limited company incorporated and registered in England and Wales with number 07878011 (“Xtribe PLC”), and Xtribe Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Xtribe PLC. On September 16, 2024, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement (the “A&R Business Combination Agreement”), by and among WinVest, WinVest (BVI) Ltd., a British Virgin Islands business company registered with company number 2157117 and a wholly owned subsidiary of WinVest, Xtribe PLC and Xtribe (BVI) Ltd., a British Virgin Islands business company registered with company number 2157137 and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xtribe PLC (together with Xtribe PLC, “Xtribe”), which amends and restates the Original Business Combination Agreement in its entirety.\n\n_Risks and Uncertainties_\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IR Act”) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury Department”) has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. Any share redemption or other share repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a business combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a business combination, extension vote or otherwise will depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Initial Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a business combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any “PIPE” (Private Investment in Public Entity) or other equity issuances in connection with a business combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a business combination but issued within the same taxable year of a business combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury Department. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a business combination and in the Company’s ability to complete a business combination. The Company will not use the proceeds placed in the Trust Account and the interest earned thereon to pay any excise taxes that may be imposed on it pursuant to any current, pending or future rules or laws, including without limitation any excise tax imposed under the IR Act, on any redemptions or stock buybacks by the Company.\n\nIn June 2023, the Company’s stockholders redeemed 627,684 Public Shares for a total of $6,721,795. In November 2023, the Company’s stockholders redeemed 122,306 Public Shares for a total of $1,322,518. In June 2024, the Company’s stockholders redeemed 650,790 Public Shares for a total of $7,367,204. The Company evaluated the classification and accounting of the stock redemption under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 450, Contingencies (“ASC 450”). ASC 450 states that when a loss contingency exists the likelihood that the future event will confirm the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability can range from probable to remote. A contingent liability must be reviewed at each reporting period to determine appropriate treatment. The Company evaluated the current status and probability of completing a business combination as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and determined that a contingent liability should be calculated and recorded. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $154,115 and $80,443, respectively, of excise tax liability calculated as 1% of total shares redeemed.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the IRS issued final regulations with respect to the timing and payment of the excise tax. The Company is currently evaluating its options with respect to payment of this obligation.\n\n_Use of Funds Restricted for Payment of Taxes_\n\nIn February 2024, the Company withdrew $40,050 of interest and dividend income earned on the Trust Account and received a tax refund of $104,305 that was previously paid with the interest and dividend income earned on the Trust Account. Such amounts were restricted for payment of the Company’s tax liabilities as provided in the Company’s charter. During the first quarter of 2024, approximately $90,000 of these funds were inadvertently used for the payments of general operating expenses. The Sponsor replenished $90,000 to the Company’s operating account in the form of a working capital loan.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, approximately $174,000 of interest and dividend income earned on the Trust Account was withdrawn and inadvertently used for the payments of general operating expenses. The Company’s initial business combination target, Xtribe, has agreed to replenish the Company’s operating account for approximately $174,000.\n\n_Going Concern_\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $548 in its operating bank account and a working capital deficit of $4,928,551. The Company’s liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering have been satisfied through proceeds from advances from a related party, the Sponsor, and from the issuance of Common Stock. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, liquidity has been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the proceeds from the Sponsor’s purchase of Private Placement Warrants held outside of our Trust Account and loans from the Sponsor. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of $1,430,395 and expenses from operating activities were $1,724,753, mainly due to costs associated with professional services, including legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance expenses. The Company intends to use the funds held outside the Trust Account, in addition to additional funds that the Company may borrow under the October 2023 Promissory Note (as defined below), primarily to pay corporate filing and compliance expenses, evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses and structure, negotiate and complete an Initial Business Combination. Per the terms of the Extension Notes, funds available under such notes are not restricted for use for extension payments. The Company believes it will need to access additional liquidity in order to consummate an Initial Business Combination.\n\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern, which assumes the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from March 1, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024 relates to the Company’s formation, the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for an Initial Business Combination and working to consummate an Initial Business Combination with Xtribe. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of the Initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operating income in the form of interest and dividend income on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. The Company’s ability to commence operations is contingent upon consummating a business combination. Management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a business combination. Although management has been successful to date in raising necessary funding, there can be no assurance that any required future financing can be successfully completed. Additionally, the Company does not currently have sufficient working capital. Furthermore, the Company’s ability to consummate an Initial Business Combination within the contractual time period is uncertain. The Company currently has until December 17, 2024 to consummate the Initial Business Combination. The Company will not be able to consummate an Initial Business Combination by December 17, 2024. Based on these circumstances, management has determined that there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern due to the uncertainty of liquidity requirements and the mandatory liquidation date within one year.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \nManagement’s plan to address the December 17, 2024 liquidation is to seek stockholder approval for, and to file, an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation extending the Company’s current Termination Date, among other things. Pursuant to a preliminary proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on November 1, 2024, the Company is proposing to amend its Certificate of Incorporation to extend the Termination Date from December 17, 2024 to January 17, 2025 (the “Charter Extension Date”) upon the deposit into the Trust Account of $30,000, to be loaned to the Company by the Sponsor or one or more of its affiliates, members or third-party designees, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month period each after the Charter Extension Date (each, an “Additional Extension”), by resolution of the Company’s board of directors, if requested by the Company’s Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2025, or a total of up to six months after December 17, 2024, unless the closing of an Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, subject to the deposit of an additional $30,000 per Additional Extension into the Trust Account by the Sponsor or its affiliates, members or third-party designees.\n\n**NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS**\n\n_Basis of Presentation_\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of management, these unaudited condensed financial statements include all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company, and the adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature.\n\n_Unaudited Interim Financial Statements_\n\nIn the opinion of the Company, the unaudited financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of its financial position as of September 30, 2024, and its results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024, which contains the audited financial statements and notes thereto. The financial information as of December 31, 2023, is derived from the audited financial statements presented in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The interim results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024, or for any future interim periods.\n\n11  \n---  \n  \n_Emerging Growth Company_\n\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\n\n_Use of Estimates_\n\nThe preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n\nMaking estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\n\n_Cash and cash equivalents_\n\nThe Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\n_Cash Held in Trust Account_\n\nFollowing the closing of the Initial Public Offering on September 17, 2021, and the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full on September 23, 2021, an aggregate amount of $116,150,000 from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in the Trust Account and may be invested only in U.S. government securities with a maturity of 185 days or less, in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations or in cash. To mitigate the risk of the Company being deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act), prior to the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of the Company’s IPO Registration Statement, the Company instructed Continental to liquidate the U.S. government treasury obligations or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter to maintain all funds in the Trust Account in cash in an interest-bearing bank account. The funds were reinvested into money market funds in May 2024. The Trust Account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of: (i) the completion of the Initial Business Combination; (ii) the redemption of any Public Shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete the Initial Business Combination by the Termination Date or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-Initial Business Combination activity; or (iii) absent the consummation of an Initial Business Combination by the Termination Date, the return of the funds held in the Trust Account to the public stockholders as part of redemption of the Public Shares.\n\n12  \n---  \n  \n_Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption_\n\nThe Company accounts for its Common Stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Common Stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Common Stock (including Common Stock that features redemption rights that is either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Common Stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. The Company’s Common Stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, Common Stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of the Company’s balance sheet.\n\nThe Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable shares are effected by charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit.\n\n_Public and Private Warrants_\n\nThe Company accounts for the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants as equity-classified instruments, based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own Common Stock, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. In that respect, the Private Placement Warrants, as well as any warrants the Company issues to the Sponsor, officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates in payment of working capital loans made to the Company, were identical to the warrants underlying the Units offered in the Initial Public Offering.\n\n_Rights_\n\nThe Company accounts for its Rights as equity-classified instruments based on an assessment of the Rights’ specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether the Rights are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the Rights meet all the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the Rights are indexed to the Company’s own Common Stock, among other conditions for the equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgement, is conducted at the time of Rights issuance.\n\nEach Right may be traded separately. If the Company is unable to complete an Initial Business Combination within the required time period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of Rights will not receive any such funds for their Rights, and the Rights will expire worthless. The Company has not considered the effect of Rights sold in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement to purchase shares of Common Stock, since the exercise of the Rights are contingent upon the occurrence of future events.\n\n_Income Taxes_\n\nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\n\n13  \n---  \n  \nASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities.\n\nWhile ASC 740 identifies usage of an effective annual tax rate for purposes of an interim provision, it does allow for estimating individual elements in the current period if they are significant, unusual or infrequent. Computing the effective tax rate for the Company is complicated due to the potential impact of the timing of any Business Combination expenses and the actual interest income that will be recognized during the year. The Company has taken a position as to the calculation of income tax expense in a current period based on ASC 740-270-25-3 which states, “If an entity is unable to estimate a part of its ordinary income (or loss) or the related tax (benefit) but is otherwise able to make a reasonable estimate, the tax (or benefit) applicable to the item that cannot be estimated shall be reported in the interim period in which the item is reported.” The Company believes its calculation to be a reliable estimate and allows it to properly take into account the usual elements that can impact its annualized book income and its impact on the effective tax rate. As such, the Company is computing its taxable income (loss) and associated income tax provision based on actual results through September 30, 2024. The Company’s effective tax rate was (1.4)% and (15.6)% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate was (5.1)% and (11.0)% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of 21% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 due to non-deductible transaction costs and changes in the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets.\n\n_Franchise Taxes_\n\nThe Company is subject to franchise tax filing requirements in the State of Delaware.\n\n_Concentration of Credit Risk_\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash accounts in financial institutions, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Coverage of $250,000. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not experienced losses on these accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such accounts.\n\n_Fair Value of Financial Instruments_\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature.\n\n_Fair Value Measurements_\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. U.S. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include:\n\n● | Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets;  \n---|---  \n● | Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and  \n● | Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.  \n  \n14  \n---  \n  \nThe following table presents information about the Company’s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value:\n\nSCHEDULE OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT ON RECURRING BASIC\n\nFair value measurements at reporting date using:  \n---  \nDescription | Fair Value | Quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities (Level 1) | Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) | Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3)  \nAssets:  \nMarketable securities held in Trust Account at September 30, 2024 | $| 5,793,629 | $| 5,793,629 | $| - | $| -  \nCash held in Trust Account at December 31, 2023 | $| 12,453,412 | $| 12,453,412 | $| - | $| -  \n  \nIn some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n\n_Net Loss Per Common Share_\n\nNet loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share is computed like basic earnings per share, except the weighted average number of common shares outstanding are increased to include additional shares from the assumed exercise of share options, if dilutive.\n\nThe Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. The Statements of Operations include a presentation of loss per redeemable share and loss per non-redeemable share following the two-class method of income per share. In order to determine the net loss attributable to both the redeemable shares and non-redeemable shares, the Company first considered the total loss allocable to both sets of shares. This is calculated using the total net loss less any dividends paid. For purposes of calculating net loss per share, any remeasurement of the ordinary shares subject to possible redemption was considered to be dividends paid to the public stockholders. Subsequent to calculating the total loss allocable to both sets of shares, the Company split the amount to be allocated using a ratio of 0% for the redeemable Public Shares and 100% for the non-redeemable shares, reflective of the respective participation rights, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nThe loss per share presented in the statement of operations is based on the following:\n\nSCHEDULE OF EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\n**For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\n**Common shares** **subject to** **redemption** | **Non-redeemable** **Common Shares**  \n---|---  \nBasic and diluted net loss per share  \nNumerator:  \nAllocation of net loss | - | (883,742| )  \nDenominator:  \nWeighted-average shares outstanding | 492,333 | 2,875,000  \nBasic and diluted net loss per share | $| - | $| (0.31| )  \n  \n15  \n---  \n  \n**For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023**\n\n**Common shares** **subject to** **redemption** | **Non-redeemable** **Common Shares**  \n---|---  \nBasic and diluted net loss per share  \nNumerator:  \nAllocation of net loss | - | (103,638| )  \nDenominator:  \nWeighted-average shares outstanding | 1,265,429 | 2,875,000  \nBasic and diluted net loss per share | $| - | $| (0.04| )  \n  \n**For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\n**Common shares** **subject to** **redemption** | **Non-redeemable** **Common Shares**  \n---|---  \nBasic and diluted net loss per share  \nNumerator:  \nAllocation of net loss | - | (1,430,395| )  \nDenominator:  \nWeighted-average shares outstanding | 858,105 | 2,875,000  \nBasic and diluted net loss per share | $| - | $| (0.50| )  \n  \n**For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023**\n\n**Common shares** **subject to** **redemption** | **Non-redeemable** **Common Shares**  \n---|---  \nBasic and diluted net loss per share  \nNumerator:  \nAllocation of net loss | - | (966,681| )  \nDenominator:  \nWeighted-average shares outstanding | 1,639,715 | 2,875,000  \nBasic and diluted net loss per share | $| - | $| (0.34| )  \n  \nThe Company has not considered the effect of Warrants and Rights sold in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement to purchase 11,966,666 shares of Common Stock in the calculation of diluted loss per share, since the exercise of the Warrants and Rights are contingent upon the occurrence of future events. As a result, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic net loss per common share for the period presented.\n\n_Recent Accounting Pronouncements_\n\nIn June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) (“ASU 2022-03”). The amendments in ASU 2022-03 clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The amendments in this Update also require additional disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The provisions in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 for public business entities. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect to early adopt this ASU. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on the balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nASU 2023-09 requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The new standard is effective for public entities with annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted and should be applied prospectively with the option of retrospective application. The Company does not expect to early adopt this ASU. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on the balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nThe Company does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.\n\n16  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 3 - INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING**\n\nPursuant to the Initial Public Offering, on September 17, 2021, the Company sold 10,000,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit for a total of $100,000,000, which increased to 11,500,000 Units for a total of $115,000,000 when the over-allotment option was exercised in full on September 23, 2021. Each Unit consists of one share of Common Stock, one Right and one Public Warrant. Each Right entitles the holder thereof to receive one-fifteenth (1/15) of one share of Common Stock upon the consummation of an Initial Business Combination. Each redeemable Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one half (1/2) of one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per full share, subject to adjustment (see Note 7).\n\nIn connection with its Initial Public Offering, the Company incurred offering costs of $2,923,969, consisting of $2,400,000 of underwriting commissions and expenses and $523,969 of costs related to the Initial Public Offering. Additionally, the Company recorded deferred underwriting commissions of $4,025,000 payable only upon completion of the Initial Business Combination.\n\n**NOTE 4 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**\n\n_Sponsor Shares_\n\nOn March 16, 2021, the Sponsor purchased 2,875,000 shares (the “Founder Shares”) of the Company’s Common Stock for an aggregate price of $25,000.\n\nPrior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with the Initial Public Offering, the Company entered into agreements with its directors in connection with their board service and certain members of its advisory board in connection with their advisory board service for its Sponsor to transfer an aggregate of 277,576 of its Founder Shares to the Company’s directors for no cash consideration and an aggregate of 60,000 of its Founder Shares to certain members of the Company’s advisory board for no cash consideration, for a total of 337,576 shares, approximating the fair value of the shares on such date, or $34. The shares were subsequently transferred prior to the effectiveness of the Company’s registration statement. The Founder Shares do not have redemption rights and will be worthless unless the Company consummates its Initial Business Combination.\n\n_Private Placement Warrants_\n\nOur Sponsor purchased from us an aggregate of 10,900,000 Private Placement Warrants at a purchase price of $0.50 per warrant, or $5,450,000 in the aggregate, in a private placement that closed simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering. A portion of the proceeds received from the purchase equal to $3,450,000 was placed in the Trust Account so that at least $10.10 per share sold to the public in the Initial Public Offering is held in the Trust Account.\n\n_March 2021 Promissory Note – Related Party_\n\nOn March 16, 2021, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor (extended by amendment in March 2022 to the consummation of an Initial Business Combination) (the “March 2021 Promissory Note”), pursuant to which the Company could borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $300,000, of which $300,000 was outstanding under the March 2021 Promissory Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The March 2021 Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the date on which the Company consummates its Initial Business Combination. The Sponsor may elect to convert any portion or all of the amount outstanding under the March 2021 Promissory Note into Private Placement Warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company at a conversion price of $0.50 per warrant, and each warrant will entitle the holder to acquire one-half share of the Company’s Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, commencing on the date of the Initial Business Combination of the Company, and otherwise on the terms of the Private Placement Warrants.\n\nThe Company analyzed the conversion feature of the March 2021 Promissory Note into private warrants under ASC 815, _Derivatives and Hedging_ , ASC 450, _Contingencies_ , ASC 480, _Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity_ and ASU 2020-06, “ _Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)._ Prior to any Initial Business Combination, the outstanding amounts under the March 2021 Promissory Note are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. The conversion feature for any such outstanding amounts requires liability treatment on the balance sheet and should be recorded at fair value with changes to the fair value being recorded through the income statement. Once converted, the private warrants, being identical to the Public Warrants, will be classified under equity treatment. However, given that the fair value of such conversion feature is not material as of the latest drawdown date, and the reporting date, or September 30, 2024, management has not recorded any such adjustment to the Company’s financial statements.\n\n17  \n---  \n  \n_October 2023 Promissory Note – Related Party_\n\nOn October 31, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor (the “October 2023 Promissory Note”), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had effected drawdowns of $709,200 under the October 2023 Promissory Note. The October 2023 Promissory Note does not bear interest and matures upon the closing of the Initial Business Combination. In the event that the Company does not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the October 2023 Promissory Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any.\n\n_Extension Notes – Related Party_\n\nAs previously disclosed, on December 5, 2022, the Company issued the First Extension Note to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company up to $750,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The First Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) the Company’s liquidation. In the event that the Company does not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the First Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. Upon the consummation of an Initial Business Combination, the Sponsor may elect to convert any portion or all of the amount outstanding under the First Extension Note into private warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.50 per private warrant. Such private warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants issued to the Sponsor at the time of the Initial Public Offering. The balance on the First Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $750,000.\n\nAs previously disclosed, in connection with the approval of the June 2023 Extension Amendment on June 12, 2023, on June 13, 2023, the Company issued the Second Extension Note to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company up to $390,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The Second Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) the Company’s liquidation. In the event that the Company does not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Second Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. Upon the consummation of an Initial Business Combination, the Sponsor may elect to convert any portion or all of the amount outstanding under the Second Extension Note into private placement warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.50 per private placement warrant. Such private placement warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants issued to the Sponsor at the time of the Initial Public Offering. The balance on the Second Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $390,000.\n\nAs previously disclosed, in connection with the approval of the November 2023 Extension Amendment on November 30, 2023, on December 13, 2023, the Company issued the Third Extension Note to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company up to $330,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The Third Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) the Company’s liquidation. In the event that the Company does not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Third Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. The balance on the Third Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $330,000 and $55,000, respectively.\n\nAs previously disclosed, in connection with the approval of the June 2024 Extension Amendment on June 3, 2024, on June 12, 2024, the Company issued the Fourth Extension Note to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company up to $180,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The Fourth Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) the Company’s liquidation. In the event that the Company does not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Fourth Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. The balance on the Fourth Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $120,000 and $0, respectively.\n\n18  \n---  \n  \nThrough the date of this report, the Company has effected drawdowns of an aggregate of $1,650,000 under the Extension Notes and caused such sums to be deposited into the Trust Account in connection with the extension of the Termination Date from December 17, 2022 to December 17, 2024. Such amounts will be distributed either to: (i) all of the holders of Public Shares upon the Company’s liquidation or (ii) holders of Public Shares who elect to have their shares redeemed in connection with (a) the vote to approve the Charter Extension Amendment or (b) the consummation of an Initial Business Combination.\n\nThe Company analyzed the conversion feature of the First and Second Extension Notes into private warrants under ASC 815, _Derivatives and Hedging_ , ASC 450, _Contingencies_ , ASC 480, _Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity_ and ASU 2020-06, _Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)._ ” Prior to an Initial Business Combination, the outstanding amounts under the Extension Notes are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. The conversion feature for any such outstanding amounts requires liability treatment on the balance sheet and should be recorded at fair value with changes to the fair value being recorded through the income statement. Once converted, the private warrants, being identical to the Public Warrants, will be classified under equity treatment. However, given that the fair value of such conversion feature is not material as of the latest drawdown date of each of the Extension Notes, the reporting date, or September 30, 2024, management has not recorded any such adjustment to the Company’s financial statements.\n\n_Administrative Support Agreement_\n\nThe Company entered into an agreement to pay our Sponsor a monthly fee of $10,000 for office space, secretarial, and administrative support services provided to the Company beginning in September 2021 and continuing monthly until the earlier of the completion of an Initial Business Combination or the Company’s liquidation. As of September 30, 2024, $315,000 is owed to the Sponsor under this agreement.\n\n**NOTE 5 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**\n\n_Registration Rights_\n\nThe holders of the Founder Shares are entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement signed on the effective date of the Initial Public Offering. The holders of the majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands that the Company register such securities. The holders of the majority of the Founder Shares can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which the Founder Shares are to be released from escrow. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our consummation of our Initial Business Combination.\n\n_Underwriting Agreement_\n\nThe Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the date of its prospectus to purchase up to 1,500,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the Initial Public Offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. On September 23, 2021, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full and purchased an additional 1,500,000 Units (the “Over-Allotment Units”), generating gross proceeds of $15,000,000 on September 27, 2021.\n\nThe underwriters received a cash underwriting discount of $0.20 per Unit, or $2,300,000 in the aggregate, and were paid offering expenses of $100,000 upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering including the overallotment.\n\n_Finder’s Fee Agreement_\n\nOn July 12, 2022, the Company entered into a finder’s fee agreement with a third-party finder (“Finder”), payable only upon the successful consummation of an Initial Business Combination with a merger target company identified and introduced by the Finder and acknowledged by the Company in writing during the retention period, which shall be one year after origination and will continue for one year after such period, unless terminated earlier. For purposes of the agreement, the finder’s fee shall be calculated as 1% of the sum of any cash and noncash consideration actually delivered and paid in connection with an Initial Business Combination.\n\n19  \n---  \n  \n_Agent Agreement_\n\nOn July 19, 2022, the Company entered an agent agreement with a FINRA registered broker-dealer (“Agent”), by which the Company engaged the Agent as its non-exclusive agent to use commercially reasonable efforts to refer the Company to potential target companies for an Initial Business Combination. If the Company completes a transaction with any such target company referred to by the Agent within 18 months after such referral, the Agent shall be paid a success fee based upon the transaction value, which shall become due and payable concurrently with the Initial Business Combination.\n\n_Chardan Capital Markets, LLC M &A / Capital Markets Advisory Agreement_\n\nOn July 23, 2022, the Company entered a M&A/Capital Markets Advisory Agreement (“M&A Agreement”) with Chardan Capital Markets, LLC (“Chardan”), by which Chardan shall assist and advise the Company in completing an Initial Business Combination. In the event an Initial Business Combination is consummated during the term of the M&A Agreement, the Company shall pay to Chardan at the closing of the Initial Business Combination a fee (the “M&A Fee”) as described below. If the M&A Fee is to be based on the “Aggregate Value” of an Initial Business Combination, such term means, without duplication, an amount equal to the sum of the aggregate value of any securities issued, promissory notes delivered by the Company to a target company in connection with an Initial Business Combination, and any other cash and non-cash consideration (using such values as set forth in such Initial Business Combination’s definitive agreement) delivered and paid in connection with an Initial Business Combination, and the amount of all debt and debt-like instruments of the target company immediately prior to closing that (a) are assumed or acquired by the Company or (b) retired or defeased in connection with such business combination less any amounts of a financing relating to such Initial Business Combination (a “Financing”) that are the basis of a Financing Fee (as defined below). Even if an Initial Business Combination is not consummated prior to the expiration or termination of the M&A Agreement, Chardan shall be entitled to the full M&A Fee with respect to any transaction consummated involving a party introduced to the Company by Chardan (an “Introduced Party”) that occurs within 18 months of the expiration or termination of the M&A Agreement or within 12 months of the expiration or termination of the M&A Agreement for any party not deemed an Introduced Party.\n\nIn the event an Initial Business Combination is consummated involving a party other than an Introduced Party, the Company will pay to Chardan an M&A Fee equal to the greater of $800,000 or 1% of the Aggregate Value of the Initial Business Combination, paid at the close of the Initial Business Combination. In the event an Initial Business Combination is consummated with an Introduced Party as business combination target, the Company shall pay to Chardan an aggregate M&A Fee based on the Aggregate Value of the Initial Business Combination according to the following schedule:\n\n● | 3% of the first $100 million Aggregate Value;  \n---|---  \n● | 2% of the Aggregate Value greater than $100 million but less than $200 million;  \n● | 1% of the Aggregate Value greater than $200 million.  \n  \nThe M&A Fee will be paid either in cash out of the flow of funds from the Trust Account or in registered and free trading securities of the Company, as the parties may agree.\n\nThe Company will pay a cash fee equal to 5% of the aggregate sales price of securities sold in the financing to introduced parties and a cash fee equal to 1% of the aggregate sales price of public or private securities sold in a financing transaction to investors other than introduced parties (collectively, the “Financing Fee”). If such sale of securities occurs through multiple closings, then a pro rata portion of such fee shall be paid upon each closing. The Financing Fee will be paid in cash from the flow of funds from the Financing.\n\nThe Company will pay Chardan up to $150,000 in aggregate for reimbursable out of pocket expenses.\n\nOn April 24, 2024, Chardan resigned its role as M&A/Capital Markets Advisor and terminated the M&A Agreement solely with respect to the Company’s contemplated business combination with Xtribe.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded deferred underwriting commissions of $4,025,000 payable to Chardan only upon completion of its Initial Business Combination.\n\n20  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 6 – COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE REDEMPTION**\n\nThe Company’s Common Stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, Common Stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of the Company’s balance sheet.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of the Company’s Common Stock subject to possible redemption as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\nSCHEDULE OF COMMON STOCK REDEMPTION\n\n**Common Shares** **Subject to Possible Redemption**  \n---  \nBalance, December 31, 2022 | $| 19,571,562  \nDeposits to Trust Account | 1,070,000  \nRemeasurement of common stock subject to possible redemption | 755,103  \nTaxes withdrawn from Trust Account | (898,940| )  \nRedemption of common stock | (8,044,313| )  \nBalance, December 31, 2023 | 12,453,412  \nDeposits to Trust Account | 395,000  \nRedemption of common stock | (7,367,204| )  \nTaxes withdrawn from Trust Account | (40,050| )  \nRemeasurement of common stock subject to possible redemption | 352,471  \nBalance, September 30, 2024 | $| 5,793,629  \n  \n**NOTE 7 – STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT**\n\n_Common Stock_\n\nThe Company’s Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0001, and 1,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, par value $0.0001.\n\nIn March 2021, the Company issued 2,875,000 Founder Shares at a price of approximately $0.01 per share for total cash of $25,000. There are no shares of preferred stock outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December, 31, 2023.\n\n_Rights_\n\nThe registration statement pursuant to which the Company registered its securities offered in the Initial Public Offering was declared effective on September 14, 2021. On September 17, 2021, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 10,000,000 Units. Each Unit consists of one share of Common Stock of the Company, $0.0001 par value per share, one redeemable warrant, with each Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one-half (1/2) of one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustment, and one Right, with each Right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-fifteenth (1/15) of one share of Common Stock upon the consummation by the Company of an Initial Business Combination. Each Right may be traded separately. If the Company is unable to complete an Initial Business Combination within the required time period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of Rights will not receive any such funds for their Rights, and the Rights will expire worthless.\n\n_Public Warrants_\n\nEach redeemable warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one half of one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per full share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing on the later of the completion of an Initial Business Combination and 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. No warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective and current registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to such shares of Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective within 90 days from the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis. The warrants will expire five years from the consummation of an Initial Business Combination.\n\n21  \n---  \n  \nThe Company may call the outstanding warrants for redemption (excluding the Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans), in whole and not in part, at a price of $0.01 per warrant:\n\n● | at any time while the warrants are exercisable;  \n---|---  \n● | upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder;  \n● | if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the shares of Common Stock equals or exceeds $16.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations), for any 20 trading days within a 30-day trading period ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to warrant holders (the “Force-Call Provision”), and  \n● | if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying such warrants at the time of redemption and for the entire 30-day trading period referred to above and continuing each day thereafter until the date of redemption.  \n  \nThe right to exercise will be forfeited unless the warrants are exercised prior to the date specified in the notice of redemption. On and after the redemption date, a record holder of a warrant will have no further rights except to receive the redemption price for such holder’s warrant upon surrender of such warrant.\n\nThe redemption criteria for our warrants have been established at a price which is intended to provide warrant holders a reasonable premium to the initial exercise price and provide a sufficient differential between the then-prevailing share price and the warrant exercise price so that if the share price declines as a result of our redemption call, the redemption will not cause the share price to drop below the exercise price of the warrants.\n\nIf the Company calls the warrants for redemption as described above, management of the Company will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a “cashless basis.”\n\nIn addition, if (x) the Company issues additional shares of Common Stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of the Initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.50 per share of Common Stock (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company’s board of directors), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for funding the Initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Common Stock during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates the Initial Business Combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.50 per share, the Warrant Price shall be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the Market Value, and the last sales price of the Common Stock that triggers the Company’s right to redeem the Warrants pursuant to Section 6.1 below shall be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 165% of the Market Value.\n\nThe Private Placement Warrants, as well as any warrants the Company issues to the Sponsor, officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates in payment of working capital loans made to the Company, will be identical to the warrants underlying the Units offered in the Initial Public Offering.\n\n**NOTE 8 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**\n\nManagement evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date, up to the date that the financial statements were issued. Based upon this review, other than as set forth below, management did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.\n\n_October Extension_\n\nOn October 15, 2024, the Company effected the fifth drawdown of $30,000 under the Fourth Promissory Note and caused the Sponsor to deposit such sum into the Trust Account in connection with the extension of the Termination Date from October 17, 2024 to November 17, 2024. Such amounts will be distributed either to: (i) all of the holders of Public Shares upon the Company’s liquidation or (ii) holders of Public Shares who elect to have their shares redeemed in connection with (a) a vote to approve certain specified amendments to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or (b) the consummation of a Business Combination.\n\n_November Extension_\n\nOn November 14, 2024, the Company effected the sixth drawdown of $30,000 under the Fourth Promissory Note and caused the Sponsor to deposit such sum into the Trust Account in connection with the extension of the Termination Date from November 17, 2024 to December 17, 2024. Such amounts will be distributed either to: (i) all of the holders of Public Shares upon the Company’s liquidation or (ii) holders of Public Shares who elect to have their shares redeemed in connection with (a) a vote to approve certain specified amendments to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or (b) the consummation of a Business Combination.\n\n_Special Meeting of Stockholders_\n\nOn November 1, 2024, the Company filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC to amend its Certificate of Incorporation to extend the Termination Date from December 17, 2024 to the Charter Extension Date upon the deposit into the Trust Account of $30,000, to be loaned to the Company by the Sponsor or one or more of its affiliates, members or third-party designees, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date to for up to five Additional Extensions, by resolution of the Company’s board of directors, if requested by the Company’s Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2025, or a total of up to six months after December 17, 2024, unless the closing of an Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, subject to the deposit of an additional $30,000 per Additional Extension into the Trust Account by the Sponsor or its affiliates, members or third-party designees. If the proposal to extend the Termination Date is approved and effective, the Company’s stockholders may elect to redeem their shares of Common Stock. An electing stockholder will be entitled to receive a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then-outstanding shares of Common Stock issued as part of the units sold in the Initial Public Offering. This redemption right will apply to each public stockholder regardless of whether and how such holder votes on the proposal. The removal from the Trust Account of such amounts would reduce the amount remaining in the Trust Account and increase the percentage interest of the Company held by the Sponsor.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \n**Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.**\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the notes related thereto which are included in the section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including, without limitation, statements in the discussion and analysis set forth below may constitute “forward-looking statements” for purposes of federal securities laws. Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our or our management team’s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “would” and variations and similar words and expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, including but not limited to those factors set forth under the headings “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.\n\nReferences in this discussion and analysis to “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” refer to WinVest Acquisition Corp.\n\n_Overview_\n\nWe are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Initial Business Combination”). We intend to effectuate our Initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”), our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024 and the date of this filing, we had not commenced core operations. All activity for the period from March 1, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024 related to our formation, raising funds through our Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for an Initial Business Combination and working to consummate our Initial Business Combination with Xtribe (as defined below). We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of the Initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest and dividend income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering.\n\nThe stock exchange listing rules provide that the Initial Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the assets held in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) in the United States maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (“Continental”), as trustee (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable), at the time of the our signing a definitive agreement in connection with the Initial Business Combination. We will only complete an Initial Business Combination if the post-Initial Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target company or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target company sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully effect an Initial Business Combination.\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation (as amended, the “Certificate of Incorporation”) provided that we had until December 17, 2022 to complete an Initial Business Combination; provided, however, that if we anticipated we may not be able to consummate an Initial Business Combination by December 17, 2022, we, by resolution of the board of directors if requested by our sponsor, WinVest SPAC LLC (the “Sponsor”), could extend the period of time to consummate an Initial Business Combination up to two times, each by an additional three months (up until June 17, 2023), subject to the deposit of additional funds into the Trust Account by our Sponsor or its affiliates or designees. On November 30, 2022, we held a special meeting of stockholders (the “November 2022 Extension Meeting”) to, among other things, approve an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to extend the date by which we must consummate an Initial Business Combination (the “Termination Date”) from December 17, 2022 to January 17, 2023, and to allow us, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after January 17, 2023, by resolution of our board of directors, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2023, or a total of up to six months after the original Termination Date of December 17, 2022, unless the closing of the Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto (the “November 2022 Extension Amendment”). Our Sponsor agreed that if the November 2022 Extension Amendment was approved at the November 2022 Extension Meeting, it or one or more of its affiliates, members or third-party designees would lend to us up to $750,000 to be deposited into the Trust Account.\n\nThe stockholders approved the November 2022 Extension Amendment at the November 2022 Extension Meeting. Accordingly, on December 5, 2022, we issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $750,000 (the “First Extension Note”) to our Sponsor, pursuant to which our Sponsor agreed to loan to us up to $750,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The First Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of the Initial Business Combination and (b) our liquidation. In the event that we do not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the First Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. Upon the consummation of an Initial Business Combination, our Sponsor may elect to convert any portion or all of the amount outstanding under the First Extension Note into private warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), at a conversion price of $0.50 per private warrant. Such private warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants (as defined below) issued to our Sponsor at the time of our Initial Public Offering. The balance on the First Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $750,000.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the November 2022 Extension Amendment, the holders of 9,606,887 shares of Common Stock issued as part of the Units (as defined below) sold in our Initial Public Offering (“Public Shares”) properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.20 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $98.0 million.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \nOn June 12, 2023, we held a second special meeting of stockholders (the “June 2023 Extension Meeting”) at which the stockholders approved, among other things, (i) an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation (the “June 2023 Extension Amendment”) to extend the Termination Date from June 17, 2023 to July 17, 2023, and to allow us, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month (or such shorter period as may be requested by the Sponsor) after July 17, 2023, by resolution of our board of directors, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until December 17, 2023, or a total of up to six months after June 17, 2023, unless the closing of our Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, and (ii) an amendment (the “Redemption Limitation Amendment”) to eliminate from the Certificate of Incorporation the limitation that we may not consummate any business combination unless we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon consummation of such business combination. Following stockholder approval of the June 2023 Extension Amendment and the Redemption Limitation Amendment at the June 2023 Extension Meeting, on June 16, 2023, we filed the June 2023 Extension Amendment and the Redemption Limitation Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State.\n\nIn connection with the approval of the June 2023 Extension Amendment on June 12, 2023, on June 13, 2023, we issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $390,000 (the “Second Extension Note”) to our Sponsor, pursuant to which our Sponsor agreed to loan us up to $390,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The Second Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) our liquidation. In the event that we do not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Second Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. Upon the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, our Sponsor may elect to convert any portion or all of the amount outstanding under the Second Extension Note into private warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.50 per private warrant. Such private warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants issued to our Sponsor at the time of the Initial Public Offering. The balance on the Second Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $390,000.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the June 2023 Extension Amendment, the holders of 627,684 Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.71 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of $6,721,795. Following such redemptions, $13,551,331 was left in Trust Account and 1,265,429 Public Shares remained outstanding.\n\nOn November 30, 2023, we held a special meeting of stockholders, at which the stockholders approved, among other things, an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation (the “November 2023 Extension Amendment”) to extend the Termination Date from December 17, 2023 to January 17, 2024, and to allow us, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after January 17, 2023, by resolution of our board of directors, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2024, or a total of up to six months after December 17, 2023, unless the closing of our Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, by causing $55,000 to be deposited into the Trust Account for each such extension.\n\nIn connection with the approval of the November 2023 Extension Amendment on November 30, 2023, on December 13, 2023, we issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $330,000 (the “Third Extension Note”) to our Sponsor, pursuant to which our Sponsor agreed to loan us up to $330,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The Third Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) our liquidation. In the event that we do not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Third Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. The balance on the Third Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $330,000 and $55,000, respectively.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the November 2023 Extension Amendment, the holders of 122,306 Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.81 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $1,322,518. Following such redemptions, approximately $12,360,810 was left in the Trust Account and 1,143,123 shares of Public Shares remained outstanding.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \nOn May 9, 2024, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Original Business Combination Agreement”), by and among WinVest, WinVest Merger Sub I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of WinVest, WinVest Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of WinVest, Xtribe P.L.C., a public limited company incorporated and registered in England and Wales with number 07878011 (“Xtribe PLC”), and Xtribe Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Xtribe PLC. On September 16, 2024, we entered into an Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement (the “A&R Business Combination Agreement”), by and among WinVest, WinVest (BVI) Ltd., a British Virgin Islands business company registered with company number 2157117 and a wholly owned subsidiary of WinVest, Xtribe PLC and Xtribe (BVI) Ltd., a British Virgin Islands business company registered with company number 2157137 and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xtribe PLC (together with Xtribe PLC, “Xtribe”), which amends and restates the Original Business Combination Agreement in its entirety.\n\nOn June 3, 2024, we held a special meeting of stockholders, at which the stockholders approved, among other things, an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation (the “June 2024 Extension Amendment”) to extend the Termination Date from June 17, 2024 to July 17, 2024, and to allow us, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after July 17, 2024, by resolution of our board of directors, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until December 17, 2024, or a total of up to six months after June 17, 2024, unless the closing of our Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, by causing $30,000 to be deposited into the Trust Account for each such extension.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the June 2024 Extension Amendment, the holders of 650,790 Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $11.32 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $7,367,204. Following such redemptions, 492,333 Public Shares remained outstanding.\n\nFollowing the approval of the June 2024 Extension Amendment on June 3, 2024, on June 12, 2024, we issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $180,000 (the “Fourth Extension Note,” and collectively with the First Extension Note, the Second Extension Note and the Third Extension Note, the “Extension Notes”) to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan us up to $180,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The Fourth Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) our liquidation. In the event that we do not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Fourth Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. The balance on the Fourth Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $120,000 and $0, respectively.\n\nThrough the date of this report, we have effected drawdowns of $1,650,000 under the Extension Notes and caused such sums to be deposited into the Trust Account in connection with the extension of the Termination Date from December 17, 2022 to December 17, 2024. Such amounts will be distributed either to: (i) all of the holders of Public Shares upon our liquidation or (ii) holders of Public Shares who elect to have their shares redeemed in connection with (a) a vote to approve certain specified amendments to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or (b) the consummation of an Initial Business Combination.\n\nIf we are unable to consummate an Initial Business Combination within the allotted time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our outstanding Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay our dissolution expenses), and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders. In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, the Rights (as defined below) and Public and Private Placement Warrants will expire and will be worthless.\n\n_Results of Operations and Known Trends or Future Events_\n\nAll activities through September 30, 2024 were related to our organizational activities, preparation for our Initial Public Offering, and, after our Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for an Initial Business Combination and working to consummate our Initial Business Combination with Xtribe. We will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our Initial Business Combination. Subsequent to our Initial Public Offering on September 17, 2021, we generate non-operating income in the form of interest and dividends on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held in the Trust Account. There has been no significant change in our trading position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited financial statements. We incur ongoing expenses as a result of being a public company for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance, as well as for due diligence expenses.\n\n26  \n---  \n  \nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net loss was $1,430,395 and expenses from operating activities were $1,724,753, as compared to a net loss of $966,681 and expenses from operating activities of $1,476,911 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were mainly due to an increase in legal and professional fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to efforts being made to complete our Initial Business Combination with Xtribe. We intend to use our operating cash held outside the Trust Account primarily to evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete an Initial Business Combination.\n\n_Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern_\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $548 in our operating bank account and a working capital deficit of $4,928,551, as compared to $37,946 in our operating bank account and a working capital deficit of $2,717,064 as of December 31, 2023. Our liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering had been satisfied through proceeds from advances from a related party, our Sponsor, and from the issuance of Common Stock. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, liquidity has been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the proceeds from our Sponsor’s purchase of Private Placement Warrants held outside of our Trust Account and loans from the Sponsor. We believe we will need to access additional liquidity in order to consummate an Initial Business Combination.\n\nOn March 16, 2021, we issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor, which note was amended on March 27, 2022 (the “March 2021 Promissory Note”), pursuant to which we may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $300,000, of which $300,000 was outstanding under the March 2021 Promissory Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The March 2021 Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the date on which we consummate an Initial Business Combination. The Sponsor may elect to convert any portion or all of the amount outstanding under the March 2021 Promissory Note into warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.50 per warrant, with each warrant entitling the holder thereof to acquire one-half share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share, commencing on the date of our Initial Business Combination. No such conversions have yet occurred. During 2023, we effected drawdowns of $300,000 under the March 2021 Promissory Note. These amounts remain outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The purpose of each drawdown is for the payment of expenses associated with operations and those necessary to initiate an Initial Business Combination.\n\nOn September 17, 2021, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 10,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of Common Stock, one redeemable warrant (the “Public Warrant”), with each Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one-half (1/2) of one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustment, and one right (the “Right”), with each Right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-fifteenth (1/15) of one share of Common Stock upon the consummation by us of an Initial Business Combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses).\n\nSimultaneously with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the issuance and sale of the Units, we completed the private sale of 10,000,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants,” and collectively with the Public Warrants, the “Warrants”) at a price of $0.50 per Private Placement Warrant to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $5,000,000 (such sale, the “Private Placement”). Each Private Placement Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one-half of one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustment. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants.\n\nOn September 23, 2021, our underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option and purchased an additional 1,500,000 Units (the “Over-Allotment Units”), generating gross proceeds of $15,000,000 on September 27, 2021. Simultaneously with the sale of Over-Allotment Units, we consummated a private sale of an additional 900,000 Private Placement Warrants (the “Additional Private Placement Warrants”) to the Sponsor at a purchase price of $0.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds of $450,000.\n\n27  \n---  \n  \nWe paid a total of $2,400,000 in underwriting discounts, expenses and commissions (not including deferred underwriting commissions of $4,025,000 payable only upon completion of our Initial Business Combination) and $523,969 for other costs and expenses related to the Initial Public Offering, resulting in aggregate net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and overallotment of $112,076,031.\n\nAs of September 27, 2021, a total of $116,150,000 of the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants and the Additional Private Placement Warrants were deposited in the Trust Account, and we had $638,000 of cash held outside of the Trust Account, after payment of costs related to the Initial Public Offering.\n\nOn December 5, 2022, we issued the First Extension Note to our Sponsor in the principal amount of $750,000. On December 5, 2022, we effected the first drawdown of $125,000 under the First Extension Note and caused the Sponsor to deposit such sum into the Trust Account in connection with the extension of the Termination Date from December 17, 2022 to January 17, 2023. During 2023, we effected drawdowns of $625,000 under the First Extension Note and caused such sums to be deposited into the Trust Account in connection with the extension of the Termination Date from January 17, 2023 to June 17, 2023.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the November 2022 Extension Amendment, the holders of 9,606,887 shares of Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.20 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $98.0 million.\n\nOn June 13, 2023, we issued the Second Extension Note to our Sponsor in the principal amount of $390,000. During 2023, we effected drawdowns of $390,000 under the Second Extension Note and caused such sums to be deposited into the Trust Account in connection with the extension of the Termination Date from June 17, 2023 to December 17, 2023.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the June 2023 Extension Amendment, the holders of 627,684 shares of Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.71 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $6,721,795.\n\nOn October 31, 2023, we issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor (the “October 2023 Promissory Note”), pursuant to which we may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000. As of September 30, 2024, we had effected drawdowns of $709,200 under the October 2023 Promissory Note. The October 2023 Promissory Note does not bear interest and matures upon the closing of the Initial Business Combination. In the event that we do not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the October 2023 Promissory Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. The purpose of each drawdown is for the payment of expenses associated with operations and those necessary to initiate an Initial Business Combination.\n\nIn connection with the approval of the November 2023 Extension Amendment on November 30, 2023, on December 13, 2023, we issued the Third Extension Note to our Sponsor, pursuant to which our Sponsor agreed to loan us up to $330,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The balance on the Third Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 was $330,000.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the November 2023 Extension Amendment, the holders of 122,306 shares of Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.81 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $1,322,518. Following such redemptions, 1,143,123 shares of Public Shares remained outstanding.\n\nIn connection with the approval of the June 2024 Extension Amendment on June 3, 2024, on June 12, 2024, we issued the Fourth Extension Note to our Sponsor, pursuant to which our Sponsor agreed to loan us up to $180,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The balance on the Fourth Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 was $120,000.\n\nIn connection with the vote to approve the June 2024 Extension Amendment, the holders of 650,790 Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $11.32 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $7,367,204. Following such redemptions, 492,333 Public Shares remained outstanding.\n\n28  \n---  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash held in the Trust Account of approximately $5.8 million. We intend to use substantially all of the remaining funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account, which interest shall be net of taxes payable, to complete our Initial Business Combination. We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account to pay taxes and up to $100,000 of dissolution expenses, if any. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to consummate an Initial Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.\n\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis that we will continue as a going concern, which assumes the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2024, we had not commenced any operations. All activity for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relates to identifying a target company for an Initial Business Combination and working to consummate our Initial Business Combination with Xtribe. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of the Initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest and dividend income on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. Our ability to commence operations is contingent upon consummating an Initial Business Combination. We currently have until December 17, 2024 to consummate our Initial Business Combination, which is 39 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering. We will not be able to consummate our Initial Business Combination by December 17, 2024.\n\nManagement’s plan to address the December 17, 2024 liquidation is to seek stockholder approval for, and to file, an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation. Pursuant to a preliminary proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on November 1, 2024, we are proposing to amend our Certificate of Incorporation to extend the Termination Date from December 17, 2024 to January 17, 2025 (the “Charter Extension Date”) upon the deposit into the Trust Account of $30,000, to be loaned to us by our Sponsor or one or more of its affiliates, members or third-party designees, and to allow us, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after the Charter Extension Date (each, an “Additional Extension”), by resolution of our board of directors, if requested by our Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2025, or a total of up to six months after December 17, 2024, unless the closing of an Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, subject to the deposit an additional $30,000 per Additional Extension into the Trust Account by our Sponsor or its affiliates, members or third-party designees (the “Charter Extension Amendment”). If the Charter Extension Amendment is approved and effective, our public stockholders may elect to redeem their Public Shares. An electing stockholder will be entitled to receive a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then-outstanding Public Shares. This redemption right will apply to each holder of Public Shares regardless of whether and how such holder votes on the proposal. The removal from the Trust Account of such amounts would reduce the amount remaining in the Trust Account and increase the percentage interest of the Company held by our Sponsor. Due to the reasons stated above, we believe we may not have sufficient liquidity through the date of an Initial Business Combination, if extended through June 17, 2025.\n\nTo the extent we are unable to consummate an Initial Business Combination, we will need to pay the costs of liquidation from our current available funds outside the Trust Account, including the approximate amount of $290,800 still available to us under the October 2023 Promissory Note as of September 30, 2024, and from up to $100,000 of interest income on the balance of the Trust Account (net of income and other tax obligations) that may be released to us to pay for dissolution expenses. If such funds are insufficient, our Sponsor has agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses. Based on these circumstances, management has determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to insufficient liquidity, the uncertainty of liquidity requirements and the mandatory liquidation date within one year.\n\nAccordingly, the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\n29  \n---  \n  \nWe do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities as of September 30, 2024, other than an agreement to pay our Sponsor a monthly fee of $10,000 for office space, secretarial, and administrative support services provided to the Company. We began incurring these fees on September 14, 2021 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of an Initial Business Combination or the Company’s liquidation.\n\nDeferred underwriting discounts and commissions in an amount equal to 3.5% of the gross proceeds raised in the Initial Public Offering, or $4,025,000, will be payable to the underwriters upon the consummation of our Initial Business Combination and will be held in the Trust Account until the consummation of such Initial Business Combination.\n\n_Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements_\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.\n\n_Critical Accounting Estimates_\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Management has determined that the Company has no critical accounting estimates.\n\n_Recent Accounting Pronouncements_\n\nIn June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) (“ASU 2022-03”). The amendments in ASU 2022-03 clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The amendments in this Update also require additional disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The provisions in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 for public business entities. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect to early adopt this ASU. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on the balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nASU 2023-09 requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The new standard is effective for public entities with annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted and should be applied prospectively with the option of retrospective application. We do not expect to early adopt this ASU. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nWe do not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements.\n\n**ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK**\n\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and are not required to provide the information under this item.\n\n30  \n---  \n  \n**ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.**\n\n_Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures_\n\nDisclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our “Certifying Officer”), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the protection of funds permitted for withdrawal from the Trust Account, the Company’s non-compliance with the investment management trust agreement and incorrectly filing income taxes in the state of Delaware.\n\nWe do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\n\n_Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting_\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n**PART II - OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1. Legal Proceedings**\n\nNone.\n\n**Item 1A. Risk Factors**\n\nThere have been no material changes to the risk factors identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed on April 15, 2024, except as set forth below:\n\n**_There are no assurances that the Charter Extension Amendment will enable us to complete an Initial Business Combination._**\n\nApproving the Charter Extension Amendment involves a number of risks. Even if the Charter Extension Amendment is approved, we can provide no assurances that the Initial Business Combination will be consummated prior to June 17, 2025. Our ability to consummate any Initial Business Combination is dependent on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. We are required to offer stockholders the opportunity to redeem shares in connection with the vote to approve the Charter Extension Amendment, and we will be required to offer stockholders redemption rights again in connection with any stockholder vote to approve the Initial Business Combination. Even if the Charter Extension Amendment is approved by our stockholders, it is possible that redemptions will leave us with insufficient cash to consummate the Initial Business Combination on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. The fact that we will have separate redemption periods in connection with the Charter Extension Amendment vote and the Initial Business Combination vote could exacerbate these risks. Other than in connection with a redemption offer or liquidation, our stockholders may be unable to recover their investment except through sales of our Public Shares on the open market. The price of our Public Shares may be volatile, and there can be no assurance that stockholders will be able to dispose of their Public Shares at favorable prices, or at all.\n\n31  \n---  \n  \n**_The Excise Tax included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 may decrease the value of our securities following our Initial Business Combination, hinder our ability to consummate an Initial Business Combination and decrease the amount of funds available for distribution in connection with a liquidation._**\n\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, imposes a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased by “covered corporations” beginning on January 1, 2023, with certain exceptions (the “Excise Tax”). The Excise Tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which the stock is repurchased. The amount of the Excise Tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the Excise Tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year.\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury Department”) has authority to promulgate regulations and provide other guidance regarding the Excise Tax. In December 2022, the Treasury Department issued Notice 2023-2, indicating its intention to propose such regulations and issuing certain interim rules on which taxpayers may rely. Under the interim rules, liquidating distributions made by publicly traded domestic corporations are exempt from the Excise Tax. In addition, any redemptions that occur in the same taxable year in which a liquidation is completed will also be exempt from such tax. Redemptions of our Public Shares in connection with an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation or in connection with an Initial Business Combination may subject us to the Excise Tax unless one of the two exceptions above apply.\n\nIf the Charter Extension Amendment is approved, our public stockholders will have the right to require us to redeem their public stock. Any redemption or other repurchase that we make in connection with the Charter Extension Amendment may be subject to the Excise Tax. Consequently, the value of our stockholder’s investment in our securities may decrease and the amount our stockholders may receive upon redemption may be negatively impacted as a result of the Excise Tax to the extent we do not liquidate by December 31, 2024. Whether and to what extent we would be subject to the Excise Tax would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with our Initial Business Combination, (ii) the structure of an Initial Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any “PIPE” or other equity issuances in connection with an Initial Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with an Initial Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of an Initial Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury Department. In addition, because the Excise Tax would be payable by us, and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the Excise Tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available for a stockholder redemption, could cause a reduction in the cash available to complete an Initial Business Combination and could have an adverse effect on our ability to complete an Initial Business Combination.\n\n**_We are required by the Nasdaq Listing Rules to consummate an Initial Business Combination within 36 months of the effectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement. As a result of our failure to consummate an Initial Business Combination within this time period, our securities could be subject to delisting._**\n\nPursuant to IM-5101-2(b) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we must consummate an Initial Business Combination by the 36-month anniversary of the effectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement, or September 14, 2024 (the “Nasdaq Deadline”). We did not complete an Initial Business Combination prior to the Nasdaq Deadline. As a result, we are in violation of Nasdaq IM-5101-2.\n\n32  \n---  \n  \nAs previously reported, on September 17, 2024, we received a written notice (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Capital Market, LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that we had failed to comply with Nasdaq Listing Rules IM-5101-2. On September 24, 2024, we timely requested a hearing before The Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”), which was held on November 12, 2024. As of the date of this filing, we have not yet received a written decision from the Panel with the results of the hearing. Our securities will continue to trade on Nasdaq until the hearing process concludes and the Panel issues a written decision. However, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant our request for a suspension of delisting or continued listing on Nasdaq. If the Panel does not grant our request, our securities will be delisted from Nasdaq. Additionally, even if the Panel grants our request, the proposed extension of the Termination Date to June 17, 2025 would exceed the six-month extension the Company has requested from the Panel (the “Nasdaq Extension”). As a result, if the Nasdaq Extension is granted and the Charter Extension Amendment is approved but we do not complete an Initial Business Combination prior to the expiration of the Nasdaq Extension, Nasdaq may issue a Staff Delisting Determination under Rule 5810 to delist our securities. If Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\n● | the price of our securities will likely decrease as a result of the loss of market efficiencies associated with being listed on Nasdaq;  \n---|---  \n● | holders may be unable to sell or purchase our securities when they wish to do so;  \n● | we may become subject to shareholder litigation;  \n● | we may lose the interest of institutional investors in our securities;  \n● | we may lose media and analyst coverage; and  \n● | we would likely lose any active trading market for our securities, as our securities may then only be traded on one of the over-the-counter markets, if at all.  \n  \n**_Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange following redemptions by our stockholders in connection with approval of the Charter Extension Amendment, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions._**\n\nOur Common Stock, Units, Warrants and Rights are listed on Nasdaq. After the Stockholder Meeting, we may be required to demonstrate compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements in order to maintain the listing of our securities on Nasdaq. Such continued listing requirements for our Common Stock include, among other things, the requirement to maintain at least 300 public holders, at least 500,000 publicly held shares and a market value of publicly held shares of $1.0 million. Pursuant to the terms of our Certificate of Incorporation, in connection with the Charter Extension Amendment, stockholders may elect to redeem their Public Shares and, as a result, we may not be in compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements.\n\nIf our securities do not meet Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements, Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange. If Nasdaq delists any of our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list such securities on another approved national securities exchange, we expect that such securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: (i) a limited availability of market quotations for our securities, (ii) reduced liquidity for our securities, (iii) a determination that our Public Shares are a “penny stock,” which will require brokers trading in our Public Shares to adhere to more stringent rules, including being subject to the depository requirements of Rule 419 of the Securities Act, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities, (iv) a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company, (v) a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future, and (vi) a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business in connection with a business combination. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as “covered securities.” Our Common Stock, Units, Warrants and Rights qualify as covered securities under such statute. If we were no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities would not qualify as covered securities under such statute and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\n\n33  \n---  \n  \n**_The Company has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. If the Company is unable to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the Company may not be able to accurately report its financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in the Company and materially and adversely affect the Company’s business and operating results._**\n\nDuring the preparation of the Company’s financial statements as of and for the period ended September 30, 2023, the Company identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting related to incorrectly filing income taxes in the state of Delaware. The Company filed an amended return in Delaware and will file its income tax returns in the U.S., Massachusetts, and Florida jurisdictions.\n\nDuring the preparation of the Company’s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the period ended March 31, 2024, the Company identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting related to its Trust Account withdrawals. In 2023, the Company withdrew $898,940 of interest and dividend income earned in the Trust Account, which was restricted for payment of the Company’s tax liabilities as provided in the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation. In the period ended March 31, 2024, the Company withdrew $40,050 of interest and dividend income earned in the Trust Account and received a tax refund of $104,305 that was previously paid with the interest and dividend income earned on the Trust Account. During both the year ended December 31, 2023 and the periods ended June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, portions of these funds were inadvertently used for the payments of general operating expenses. Such amounts were disbursed without appropriate review and approval to ensure that the disbursements were made in accordance with the investment management trust agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company and the Company. As a result of this issue, management concluded that a material weakness exists in our internal control over financial reporting related to the review and approval of cash disbursements.\n\n**Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds**\n\nFor a description of the use of the proceeds generated in our Initial Public Offering, see Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q.\n\n**Item 3.
