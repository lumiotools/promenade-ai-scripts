MIPLYFFA™ is indicated for use in combination with miglustat for the treatment of neurological manifestations of NPC in adult and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older.  \nRezolute | Announced the sunRIZE Phase 3 clinical trial investigating ersodetug (RZ358) in patients with congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) will begin enrolling patients in the U.S. in early 2025¹.Received FDA clearance to initiate Phase 3 registrational study for ersodetug for the treatment of hypoglycemia due to tumor hyperinsulinism².  \nJohnson & Johnson | Presented neoadjuvant TAR-200 plus cetrelimab Phase 2 data in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) who are ineligible or refuse neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy and are scheduled for radical cystectomy at the European Society of Medical Oncology 2024 Congress³.  \n  \n**Subsequent Events**\n\nPartner | Event  \n---|---  \nTwist Bioscience | XOMA Royalty completed a $15 million royalty monetization agreement with Twist, acquiring 50% of the future milestones and royalties and adding 60-plus partnered early-stage programs across 30 companies enabled by Twist Bioscience’s Biopharma Solutions business unit to the XOMA Royalty portfolio.  \nJohnson & Johnson | Announced one of two Phase 3 clinical trials in difficult to treat muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) that included treatment with cetrelimab was being discontinued for not showing superiority to chemoradiation during a scheduled interim analysis⁴. Cetrelimab continues to be investigated in multiple other clinical trials.  \n  \n**Anticipated 2024 Events of Note**\n\nPartner | Event  \n---|---  \nTakeda | On December 12, 2024, Takeda will be hosting an R&D Day: Focus on Late-State Pipeline and Market Opportunity and has commented publicly mezagitamab will be discussed during this investor event.  \n  \n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nXOMA Royalty recorded total income and revenues of $7.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, which included $6.5 million in estimated income associated with two commercial products in our portfolio. In the third quarter of 2023, XOMA Royalty reported total income and revenue of $0.8 million. \n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $0.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting transitory clinical trial costs related to KIN-3248, an asset acquired in the Kinnate acquisition, which the Company currently is winding down. R&D expenses in the third quarter of 2023 were $25,000.\n\nGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expenses were $8.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared with $6.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase of $1.6 million was primarily comprised of $1.4 million in total costs incurred after our acquisition of Kinnate, which included $1.1 million in legal and consulting costs, $0.1 million in information technology costs, and $0.1 million in insurance costs. The remainder of the increased G&A expense reflects an increase of $0.2 million for salaries and related costs.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, as a result of communications with Agenus, XOMA Royalty evaluated the status of the partnered programs underlying the Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement for potential impairment and recorded a one-time, non-cash impairment charge of $14.0 million and a reduction of royalty receivables of $14.0 million associated with Agenus.\n\nIn the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, G&A expenses included $2.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively, in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nTotal interest expense in the third quarter of 2024 was $3.5 million, representing interest and costs related to the Blue Owl Loan established in December 2023.\n\nThe Company reported total other income, net, of $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to total other income, net, of $0.3 million in the corresponding period of 2023. The $1.6 million increase reflects a $1.3 million increase in investment income due to higher balances on our investments and the change in the market price for XOMA Royalty’s shares of Rezolute common stock.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $17.2 million, compared to a net loss of $5.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily resulting from the $14.0 million non-cash impairment related to the Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement.\n\nOn September 30, 2024, XOMA Royalty had cash and cash equivalents of $146.8 million (including $4.8 million in restricted cash). On December 31, 2023, XOMA Royalty had cash and cash equivalents of $159.6 million (including $6.3 million in restricted cash). During the third quarter of 2024, XOMA Royalty received $9.9 million in cash from royalty and commercial payments. Net cash used in operating activities during the quarter was $8.6 million. On October 15, 2024, the Company paid a total of $1.4 million in cash dividends on the 8.625% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Nasdaq: XOMAP) and the 8.375% Series B Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Nasdaq: XOMAO).\n\n**About XOMA Royalty Corporation**\n\nXOMA Royalty is a biotechnology royalty aggregator playing a distinctive role in helping biotech companies achieve their goal of improving human health.

In some cases, you can identify such forward-looking statements by terminology such as “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “seek,” “project,” “expect,” “may,” “will”, “would,” “could” or “should,” the negative of these terms or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of XOMA Royalty’s performance, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements. These statements are based on assumptions that may not prove accurate, and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated due to certain risks inherent in the biotechnology industry, including those related to the fact that our product candidates subject to out-license agreements are still being developed, and our licensees may require substantial funds to continue development which may not be available; we do not know whether there will be, or will continue to be, a viable market for the products in which we have an ownership or royalty interest; and if the therapeutic product candidates to which we have a royalty interest do not receive regulatory approval, our third-party licensees will not be able to market them. Other potential risks to XOMA Royalty meeting these expectations are described in more detail in XOMA Royalty's most recent filing on Form 10-Q and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consider such risks carefully when considering XOMA Royalty's prospects. Any forward-looking statement in this press release represents XOMA Royalty's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press release and should not be relied upon as representing its views as of any subsequent date. XOMA Royalty disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required by applicable law.\n\nEXPLANATORY NOTE: Any references to “portfolio” in this press release refer strictly to milestone and/or royalty rights associated with a basket of drug products in development. Any references to “assets” in this press release refer strictly to milestone and/or royalty rights associated with individual drug products in development.\n\nAs of the date of this press release, the commercial assets in XOMA Royalty’s milestone and royalty portfolio are VABYSMO® (faricimab-svoa), OJEMDA™ (tovorafenib), MIPLYFFA™ (arimoclomol), XACIATO™ (clindamycin phosphate) vaginal gel 2%, IXINITY® [coagulation factor IX (recombinant)], and DSUVIA® (sufentanil sublingual tablet).

          "url": "https://xoma.com/2024-letter-to-shareholders/",
          "content": "[Skip to content](#content \"Skip to content\")\n\n# 2024 Letter to Shareholders\n\n![](https://xoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/owen1.jpg)\n\n![](https://xoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/owen1.jpg)\n\n# DEAR XOMA STOCKHOLDERS, \n\nWe made good progress over the course of 2023 towards advancing the company’s differentiated royalty business model. \n\nAs is the case with any emerging biotech portfolio, there were both positive and negative developments, although many of our key near-term drivers of value remain intact. Most importantly, in late December, we fundamentally changed the composition of our balance sheet, adding up to $140 million in non-dilutive capital by partially monetizing our VABYSMO® (faricimab) royalties, economics that we purchased in 2021 for $14 million. Interestingly, XOMA now has more cash on its balance sheet than at any point in its 43-year history. \n\nUpon joining the firm in early 2023, Brad Sitko, our Chief Investment Officer, and I made it clear that our intent was to maintain a disciplined approach to our capital allocation by (1) focusing on business development, which is paramount to our long-term prospects, and (2) returning capital to our stockholders upon success. In that vein, in January 2024, subsequent to our $140 million VABYSMO® transaction, we announced a stock repurchase program for up to $50 million. Growing royalty receipts coupled with a relatively static expense base and a diminished share count should lever future returns to the benefit of our long-term stockholders. \n\n### **2024 Top Priorities**\n\nXOMA occupies a unique position in the royalty monetization space, one that is distinct from the vast majority of our competitors. We focus our efforts across the lifecycle of drug development, from early stage assets entering the clinic to commercially available programs. The underlying premise is to balance, over time, revenue generating assets that support our notional value with the high-risk, yet high-reward, early stage programs that have the potential to generate significant technology value for XOMA prior to commercialization.\n\nToday, XOMA has five cash flow generating assets, up from one just over a year ago, including the recently approved OJEMDA™ (tovorafenib), Day One’s type II RAF inhibitor for relapsed or refractory BRAF-altered Pediatric Low-Grade Glioma (pLGG), the most common form of childhood brain cancer. In addition, in a deal announced in late April, we acquired a royalty stream derived from the end user sales of XACIATO™ (clindamycin phosphate) vaginal gel 2%, which is marketed by Organon, one of the premier women’s health companies. And by the end of 2024, assuming regulatory success, we anticipate having six cash flow generating assets, as Zevra Therapeutics’ arimoclomol for Niemann-Pick Type C disease has a PDUFA date in late September. These assets either address a critical unmet need or possess a best-in-class profile that should generate significant cashflows for XOMA over time.\n\n### **Capital Deployment**\n\nRelative to years past, the quantity, breadth, and attractiveness of the Company’s business development pipeline for royalty acquisitions is quite robust, likely a function of the external funding market, which has been subdued of late for early stage companies, and an increasingly proactive business development effort. While we reviewed a number of interesting opportunities in 2023, our acquisition activity was limited by the lack of capital on our balance sheet. The VABYSMO® financing transaction significantly enhances our cash position and provides us with the opportunity to fulfill our objective of being a trusted partner and royalty capital solutions provider within the biotech ecosystem.\n\nMuch of our royalty portfolio is a legacy of XOMA’s BCE technology and Phage display libraries, although many of our most important and most valuable assets are a result of acquisitions completed in recent years. Most of these acquisitions were sourced through our network of partners, including shareholders, investment banks, lawyers, and industry contacts. And while we will look to continue to broaden our network, especially in emerging markets and Europe, we intend to take a more proactive approach in identifying potential opportunities for capital deployment. With the pace of scientific achievement showing no signs of decelerating, we believe it will be increasingly important to identify and allocate capital to potentially game-changing therapies as a means to drive total shareholder return for XOMA stakeholders.\n\n### **Capitalize on Our Value Proposition**\n\nThe biotech funding market has certainly improved off the lows of 2022 and 2023, evidenced by the strength of the XBI (Nasdaq Biotechnology Index) in 4Q 2023 (+26%), and more recently, the reemergence of the biotech IPO and secondary equity offerings. With that said, the market remains bifurcated, as the majority of the recent financings involve companies with late-stage compounds. For earlier-stage companies or those still in search of proof-of-concept, a group that commands much of our interest, capital remains elusive, especially at a reasonable cost of capital.\n\nHistorically speaking, royalty and milestone monetizations were utilized as a financing of last resort. Today, the virtues of this financing type are increasingly appreciated, not only by the management and Boards of our partners, but also by their shareholders. Royalty financings provide risk-based capital, limit equity dilution, and often unlock hidden value to the benefit of all parties.\n\nXOMA prides itself on providing bespoke royalty capital solutions, tailored to address the financial needs of our partners. In 2024, in addition to being more proactive, we intend to use the assets within XOMA, namely our people, permanent capital structure, creativity, structuring experience, and patience, to capitalize on the current opportunities arising from the have and have nots.\n\n### **Identify Opportunities to Unlock Value for Stockholders**\n\nThere are multiple avenues by which we can build XOMA’s royalty portfolio, as well as build XOMA’s balance sheet. We think creatively to identify the appropriate risk-adjusted opportunities that deliver cash to XOMA today and/or have the potential to generate cash for XOMA in the future. This February, we announced the acquisition of Kinnate Biopharma. While returning the majority of Kinnate’s cash to its stockholders, we expect we’ll add over $9.5 million, net, in non-dilutive cash to our balance sheet, as well as several precision oncology programs that we are actively seeking to monetize through sale or out-licensing. This acquisition reflects one creative approach that unlocks value for both our stockholders and Kinnate’s investors – today and into the future.\n\n### **Drive Total Shareholder Return**\n\nXOMA is unique among its peers, having only recently transitioned into the royalty space as of 2017. At the end of 2023, we had approximately $160 million in cash and no corporate debt1. We have a small, but growing number of products that are generating royalties, followed by a visible pipeline that continues to mature with the passage of time. Investors have an opportunity to participate in two separate publicly traded classes of stock (common – XOMA – and preferred – XOMAP and XOMAO) catering to different return objectives.\n\nOur recently announced $50 million share buyback fulfills one of the key tenets that we outlined last year: returning capital to shareholders upon success. We believe a balanced approach to capital allocation is important in both theory and practice. In addition, in an effort to further align the interests of XOMA employees and our shareholders, we changed the equity compensation for every employee in the company, moving from options to performance stock units (PSUs) with strike prices significantly ahead of the prevailing stock price.\n\nWith a sizable portfolio that is diversified across therapeutic areas, mechanisms, modalities, stages of development, and partners, we are building the foundation for a company that has the potential to drive long-term shareholder value. We believe our actions in 2023 support that assertion, and we hope our efforts in 2024 solidify that thinking. \n\nAs I close this letter, there is a collective excitement within XOMA – work from years past is starting to pay off. Our business model is more relevant than ever, and market dynamics provide ample opportunity to further build XOMA’s royalty and milestone portfolio.

MIPLYFFA™ is indicated for use in combination with miglustat for the treatment of neurological manifestations of NPC in adult and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older.  \nRezolute | Announced the sunRIZE Phase 3 clinical trial investigating ersodetug (RZ358) in patients with congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) will begin enrolling patients in the U.S. in early 2025¹.Received FDA clearance to initiate Phase 3 registrational study for ersodetug for the treatment of hypoglycemia due to tumor hyperinsulinism².  \nJohnson & Johnson | Presented neoadjuvant TAR-200 plus cetrelimab Phase 2 data in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) who are ineligible or refuse neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy and are scheduled for radical cystectomy at the European Society of Medical Oncology 2024 Congress³.  \n  \n**Subsequent Events**\n\nPartner | Event  \n---|---  \nTwist Bioscience | XOMA Royalty completed a $15 million royalty monetization agreement with Twist, acquiring 50% of the future milestones and royalties and adding 60-plus partnered early-stage programs across 30 companies enabled by Twist Bioscience’s Biopharma Solutions business unit to the XOMA Royalty portfolio.  \nJohnson & Johnson | Announced one of two Phase 3 clinical trials in difficult to treat muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) that included treatment with cetrelimab was being discontinued for not showing superiority to chemoradiation during a scheduled interim analysis⁴. Cetrelimab continues to be investigated in multiple other clinical trials.  \n  \n**Anticipated 2024 Events of Note**\n\nPartner | Event  \n---|---  \nTakeda | On December 12, 2024, Takeda will be hosting an R&D Day: Focus on Late-State Pipeline and Market Opportunity and has commented publicly mezagitamab will be discussed during this investor event.  \n  \n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nXOMA Royalty recorded total income and revenues of $7.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, which included $6.5 million in estimated income associated with two commercial products in our portfolio. In the third quarter of 2023, XOMA Royalty reported total income and revenue of $0.8 million. \n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $0.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting transitory clinical trial costs related to KIN-3248, an asset acquired in the Kinnate acquisition, which the Company currently is winding down. R&D expenses in the third quarter of 2023 were $25,000.\n\nGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expenses were $8.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared with $6.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase of $1.6 million was primarily comprised of $1.4 million in total costs incurred after our acquisition of Kinnate, which included $1.1 million in legal and consulting costs, $0.1 million in information technology costs, and $0.1 million in insurance costs. The remainder of the increased G&A expense reflects an increase of $0.2 million for salaries and related costs.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, as a result of communications with Agenus, XOMA Royalty evaluated the status of the partnered programs underlying the Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement for potential impairment and recorded a one-time, non-cash impairment charge of $14.0 million and a reduction of royalty receivables of $14.0 million associated with Agenus.\n\nIn the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, G&A expenses included $2.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively, in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nTotal interest expense in the third quarter of 2024 was $3.5 million, representing interest and costs related to the Blue Owl Loan established in December 2023.\n\nThe Company reported total other income, net, of $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to total other income, net, of $0.3 million in the corresponding period of 2023. The $1.6 million increase reflects a $1.3 million increase in investment income due to higher balances on our investments and the change in the market price for XOMA Royalty’s shares of Rezolute common stock.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $17.2 million, compared to a net loss of $5.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily resulting from the $14.0 million non-cash impairment related to the Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement.\n\nOn September 30, 2024, XOMA Royalty had cash and cash equivalents of $146.8 million (including $4.8 million in restricted cash). On December 31, 2023, XOMA Royalty had cash and cash equivalents of $159.6 million (including $6.3 million in restricted cash). During the third quarter of 2024, XOMA Royalty received $9.9 million in cash from royalty and commercial payments. Net cash used in operating activities during the quarter was $8.6 million. On October 15, 2024, the Company paid a total of $1.4 million in cash dividends on the 8.625% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Nasdaq: XOMAP) and the 8.375% Series B Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Nasdaq: XOMAO).\n\n**About XOMA Royalty Corporation**\n\nXOMA Royalty is a biotechnology royalty aggregator playing a distinctive role in helping biotech companies achieve their goal of improving human health.
