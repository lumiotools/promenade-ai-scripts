Since their inception, CPI has sold more than 100 million eco-focused cards. However, the birth of these solutions didn’t come without challenges. \n\nWhen CPI chose to work with a high-density ocean-bound plastic, Michieli and his team engineered a way to incorporate the new material, which traditionally didn’t bond with inks and colorants, into its manufacturing process. At the same time, they saw an opportunity to create a new market.\n\nIn the past, waste collectors didn’t pick up the high-density material since recycling companies wouldn’t pay as much money for it. Now that CPI found value in the material, recycling has expanded income opportunities for waste-picker communities and benefits CPI and its customers upstream with more eco-conscious card solutions. \n\nAs CPI’s eco-focused product lines have expanded, its vendors are offering more recycled products to fulfill not just CPI’s orders but also cater to the entire payment card industry.\n\n“We’re proud of the work our team has done to innovate and create better, more tailored solutions for our customers.” Michieli added. “We look forward to expanding our suite of card options with new eco-focused materials to address a variety of design and price needs. Whatever type of card you want, CPI can meet your needs.”\n\nCPI was one of 10 Colorado companies honored this year as part of Denver Business Journal’s Inno Awards, which recognizes companies creating revolutionary solutions that are changing their respective industries.

REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2024 RESULTS**\n\n_Net Sales Increased 18% to $125 Million and Full Year Sales Outlook Increased_\n\n_Growth Across Portfolio, Led by Strong Sales of Debit and Credit Cards_\n\n_Net Income Decreased 66% to $1 Million, Impacted by Debt Refinancing Costs; Adjusted EBITDA Increased 18% to $25 Million_\n\n_Full Year Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow Outlooks Increased_\n\nCPI Card Group Inc. (Nasdaq: PMTS) (“CPI” or the “Company”), a payments technology company providing a comprehensive range of payment card and digital solutions, including Software-as-a-Service-based instant issuance, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and updated its financial outlook for 2024. \n\nThird quarter net sales increased 18% to $124.8 million compared to the prior year period, with strong growth in both the Debit and Credit and Prepaid segments. Net income decreased 66% to $1.3 million, reflecting the impact of $8.8 million of pre-tax debt refinancing costs, and Adjusted EBITDA increased 18% to $25.1 million, driven by net sales growth. \n\nSales performance in the quarter was driven by strong growth in debit and credit card sales, as well as continued growth from Prepaid, instant issuance solutions and other card personalization services. Product sales increased 25% in the third quarter, led by sales of contactless cards, while services sales increased 10%. For the first nine months of the year total net sales increased 4%. \n\n“We are very pleased to deliver strong growth in the quarter, including 19% growth in our Debit and Credit segment, even as channel inventories continue to be worked down,” said John Lowe, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We are maintaining momentum with our solutions across the CPI portfolio and believe we are winning business in the market.” \n\nLowe added, “We are advancing CPI’s growth strategies and continue to offer our customers additional products and services as we gain more traction with our digital solutions and in adjacent markets.” \n\nThe Company updated its financial outlook for 2024, increasing its full-year expectations for net sales to mid-to-high single-digit growth and for Adjusted EBITDA to low single-digit growth. The previous outlook was a mid-single digit net sales increase and a slight increase in Adjusted EBITDA. The Company also increased its Free Cash Flow outlook for the year. \n\nCPI is a top payment solutions provider in the U.S. serving thousands of banks, credit unions and fintechs, as well as major bank platforms and prepaid program managers. The Company is a leader in the U.S. markets for eco-focused payment cards, personalization and Software-as-a-Service-based instant issuance solutions for small and medium U.S. financial institutions and retail prepaid debit card solutions. \n\nThe Company believes long-term growth trends for the U.S. card market remain strong, led by consumer card growth, widespread adoption of eco-focused cards and the ongoing conversion to contactless cards. Based on figures released by the networks, Visa and Mastercard ®  U.S. debit and credit cards in circulation increased at a compound annual growth rate of 9% for the three-year period ending June 30, 2024. \n\n**2024 Business Highlights**\n\n  * CPI continues to be a leading provider of eco-focused payment card solutions in the U.S. market, with more than 100 million eco-focused debit and credit cards sold since launch. \n  * CPI continues to be a leading provider of Software-as-a-Service-based instant issuance solutions in the U.S., with more than 16,000 Card@Once ® installations across more than 2,000 financial institutions. \n  * The Company continued to advance its market expansion strategies, adding new digital solutions offerings for its customers including push provisioning capabilities for mobile wallets. \n  * The Company executed $9 million of share repurchases through the third quarter of 2024. \n  * CPI completed a debt refinancing in the third quarter, issuing $285 million aggregate principal amount of 10.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 and entering into a new $75 million ABL revolving credit facility, while redeeming the $268 million aggregate principal amount of 8.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2026. \n  * The Company completed a secondary offering of 1.38 million shares of common stock sold by its majority stockholder group, reducing the stockholder group’s ownership position from 56% of shares outstanding to 43%. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\nNet sales increased 18% year-over-year to $124.8 million in the third quarter of 2024. \n\n  * Debit and Credit segment net sales increased 19% to $99.8 million, driven by strong contactless card sales led by eco-focused cards, as well as continued growth in Card@Once ® instant issuance solutions and other card personalization services. \n  * Prepaid Debit segment net sales increased 13% to $25.2 million, reflecting strong sales to existing customers. \n\n\n\nThird quarter gross profit increased 24% to $44.7 million and gross profit margin of 35.8% increased from 34.1% in the prior year third quarter, driven by operating leverage from sales growth. \n\nThird quarter income from operations increased 37% to $17.8 million, driven by strong sales growth and gross margin improvement. Net income decreased 66% to $1.3 million, or $0.11 diluted earnings per share, due to pre-tax debt refinancing costs of $8.8 million, or approximately $0.55 per share after-tax, including interest expense related to a call premium on the $268 million of 8.625% Senior Notes due 2026 redeemed in the third quarter, partially offset by a tax benefit recorded in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased 18% to $25.1 million. \n\n**Year-to-date 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\nNet sales increased 4% year-over-year to $355.5 million in the first nine months of 2024. \n\n  * Debit and Credit segment net sales increased 2% to $283.3 million, driven by increased sales of contactless cards, led by eco-focused cards, and growth in Card@Once ® instant issuance solutions and other card personalization services, partially offset by lower sales of other cards. \n  * Prepaid Debit segment net sales increased 16% to $73.2 million, reflecting strong sales to existing customers. \n\n\n\nYear-to-date gross profit increased 7% to $128.6 million and gross profit margin increased from 35.1% in the prior year to 36.2%. \n\nYear-to-date income from operations decreased 8% to $46.9 million due to increased compensation expenses, including CEO transition-related expenses and increased performance-based employee incentive compensation expense. Net income decreased 40% to $12.7 million, or $1.08 diluted earnings per share, primarily due to debt refinancing costs. Adjusted EBITDA increased 1% to $70.0 million. \n\n**Balance Sheet, Liquidity and Cash Flow**\n\nThe Company generated cash from operating activities of $16.7 million in the first nine months of 2024, which compared to $22.3 million in the 2023 period, and Free Cash Flow of $12.5 million, which compared to $16.2 million in the prior year. The decrease in cash generation compared to the prior year was primarily driven by increased working capital usage, including increased inventory purchases of contactless chips, partially offset by lower capital expenditures. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents was $14.7 million. There were $285 million of 10% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 and no borrowings from the ABL revolving credit facility outstanding at quarter-end. \n\nIn the third quarter, the Company completed a refinancing of its debt, issuing $285 million of new 10% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 and entering into a new $75 million ABL revolving credit facility. The Company used the proceeds from the notes offering to redeem the remaining $267.9 million principal balance of its 8.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 and to pay related fees and expenses. Refinancing costs recorded in the third quarter totaled $8.8 million, including $5.8 million of interest expense related to the 2.156% early redemption premium on the Company’s retired 8.625% Senior Notes due 2026 and a $3 million loss on debt extinguishment related to unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with the redemption of the notes and the termination of the prior ABL revolving credit facility. \n\nAlso in the third quarter, the Company spent $2.2 million to purchase 120,534 shares of its common stock from its majority stockholder group pursuant to a Stock Repurchase Agreement announced in March, which committed the Company to purchase shares from its majority stockholder group at a 3 to 1 ratio to the number of shares repurchased in the open market in the second quarter. \n\nThe Company continues to focus its capital structure and allocation priorities on investing in the business, including strategic acquisitions; deleveraging the balance sheet; and returning funds to stockholders. \n\nOn September 30th, the Company announced a secondary public offering of shares of its common stock to be sold by its majority stockholder group. The 1.38 million share offering closed on October 2, 2024. The Company did not offer any shares of common stock in the offering and did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling stockholders. \n\n“We delivered strong third quarter sales and profit growth, while continuing to invest in our expansion strategies,” said Jeff Hochstadt, Chief Financial Officer of CPI. “We also effectively extended maturities on our debt and completed a secondary offering of common stock, which should benefit trading liquidity over time.” \n\n**Outlook for 2024**\n\nThe Company updated its outlook for 2024 to mid-to-high single-digit net sales growth and low single-digit Adjusted EBITDA growth. The prior outlook was a mid-single digit net sales increase and a slight increase in Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in the net sales outlook was driven by strength across CPI’s portfolio. \n\nThe Free Cash Flow outlook was updated to be slightly below the 2023 level, compared to the previous outlook of approximately half of the 2023 level, primarily due to working capital improvements, lower expected capital spending, and a lower tax rate relative to the previous outlook. \n\nThe Company now expects its year-end 2024 Net Leverage Ratio to be similar to the 2023 year-end level, compared to a previous outlook of between 3.0x and 3.5x. \n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nCPI Card Group Inc. will hold a conference call on November 5, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) to review its third quarter results.

These non-GAAP financial measures are utilized by management in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis between fiscal periods. We believe that these financial measures are appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of our underlying operating performance trends compared to historical and prospective periods and our peers. Management also believes that these measures are useful to investors in their analysis of our results of operations and provide improved comparability between fiscal periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP measures may be different from similarly titled measures of other companies. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these historical non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in Exhibit E to this press release. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA \n\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented on a continuing operations basis and is defined as EBITDA (which represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) adjusted for litigation; stock-based compensation expense; estimated sales tax expense; restructuring and other charges, including executive retention and severance; costs related to production facility modernization efforts; loss on debt extinguishment; foreign currency gain or loss; and other items that are unusual in nature, infrequently occurring or not considered part of our core operations, as set forth in the reconciliation in Exhibit E. Adjusted EBITDA is intended to show our unleveraged, pre-tax operating results and therefore reflects our financial performance based on operational factors, excluding non-operational, unusual or non-recurring losses or gains. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: (a) our capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (b) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (c) the significant interest expenses or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; (d) tax payments that represent a reduction in cash available to us; (e) any cash requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; (f) the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters that we and the lenders under our credit agreement may not consider indicative of our ongoing operations; or (g) the impact of any discontinued operations. In particular, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA allows us to add back certain non-operating, unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net income, even though these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict and can represent the effect of long-term strategies as opposed to short-term results. In addition, certain of these expenses represent the reduction of cash that could be used for other purposes. Adjusted EBITDA margin percentage as shown in Exhibit E is computed as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total net sales. \n\nWe define LTM Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA (defined previously) for the last twelve months. LTM Adjusted EBITDA is used in the computation of Net Leverage Ratio, and is reconciled in Exhibit E. \n\nFree Cash Flow \n\nWe define Free Cash Flow as cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. We use this metric in analyzing our ability to service and repay our debt. However, this measure does not represent funds available for investment or other discretionary uses since it does not deduct cash used to make principal payments on outstanding debt and financing lease liabilities. Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, cash (used in) provided by operating activities or any other measures of liquidity derived in accordance with GAAP. \n\nFinancial Expectations for 2024 \n\nWe have provided Adjusted EBITDA expectations for 2024 on a non-GAAP basis because certain reconciling items are dependent on future events that either cannot be controlled or cannot be reliably predicted because they are not part of the Company’s routine activities, any of which could be significant. \n\nNet Leverage Ratio \n\nManagement and various investors use the ratio of debt principal outstanding, plus finance lease obligations, less cash, divided by LTM Adjusted EBITDA, or “Net Leverage Ratio”, as a measure of our financial strength when making key investment decisions and evaluating us against peers. \n\n**About CPI Card Group Inc.**\n\nCPI Card Group is a payments technology company providing a comprehensive range of payment card and digital solutions, including Software-as-a-Service-based instant issuance.

(Nasdaq: PMTS) (“CPI” or the “Company”), a payments technology company providing a comprehensive range of payment card and digital solutions, including Software-as-a-Service-based instant issuance, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and updated its financial outlook for 2024. \n\nThird quarter net sales increased 18% to $124.8 million compared to the prior year period, with strong growth in both the Debit and Credit and Prepaid segments. Net income decreased 66% to $1.3 million, reflecting the impact of $8.8 million of pre-tax debt refinancing costs, and Adjusted EBITDA increased 18% to $25.1 million, driven by net sales growth. \n\nSales performance in the quarter was driven by strong growth in debit and credit card sales, as well as continued growth from Prepaid, instant issuance solutions and other card personalization services. Product sales increased 25% in the third quarter, led by sales of contactless cards, while services sales increased 10%. For the first nine months of the year total net sales increased 4%. \n\n“We are very pleased to deliver strong growth in the quarter, including 19% growth in our Debit and Credit segment, even as channel inventories continue to be worked down,” said John Lowe, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We are maintaining momentum with our solutions across the CPI portfolio and believe we are winning business in the market.” \n\nLowe added, “We are advancing CPI’s growth strategies and continue to offer our customers additional products and services as we gain more traction with our digital solutions and in adjacent markets.” \n\nThe Company updated its financial outlook for 2024, increasing its full-year expectations for net sales to mid-to-high single-digit growth and for Adjusted EBITDA to low single-digit growth. The previous outlook was a mid-single digit net sales increase and a slight increase in Adjusted EBITDA. The Company also increased its Free Cash Flow outlook for the year. \n\nCPI is a top payment solutions provider in the U.S. serving thousands of banks, credit unions and fintechs, as well as major bank platforms and prepaid program managers. The Company is a leader in the U.S. markets for eco-focused payment cards, personalization and Software-as-a-Service-based instant issuance solutions for small and medium U.S. financial institutions and retail prepaid debit card solutions. \n\nThe Company believes long-term growth trends for the U.S. card market remain strong, led by consumer card growth, widespread adoption of eco-focused cards and the ongoing conversion to contactless cards. Based on figures released by the networks, Visa and Mastercard ®  U.S. debit and credit cards in circulation increased at a compound annual growth rate of 9% for the three-year period ending June 30, 2024. \n\n**2024 Business Highlights**\n\n  * CPI continues to be a leading provider of eco-focused payment card solutions in the U.S. market, with more than 100 million eco-focused debit and credit cards sold since launch. \n  * CPI continues to be a leading provider of Software-as-a-Service-based instant issuance solutions in the U.S., with more than 16,000 Card@Once ® installations across more than 2,000 financial institutions. \n  * The Company continued to advance its market expansion strategies, adding new digital solutions offerings for its customers including push provisioning capabilities for mobile wallets. \n  * The Company executed $9 million of share repurchases through the third quarter of 2024. \n  * CPI completed a debt refinancing in the third quarter, issuing $285 million aggregate principal amount of 10.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 and entering into a new $75 million ABL revolving credit facility, while redeeming the $268 million aggregate principal amount of 8.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2026. \n  * The Company completed a secondary offering of 1.38 million shares of common stock sold by its majority stockholder group, reducing the stockholder group’s ownership position from 56% of shares outstanding to 43%. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\nNet sales increased 18% year-over-year to $124.8 million in the third quarter of 2024. \n\n  * Debit and Credit segment net sales increased 19% to $99.8 million, driven by strong contactless card sales led by eco-focused cards, as well as continued growth in Card@Once ® instant issuance solutions and other card personalization services. \n  * Prepaid Debit segment net sales increased 13% to $25.2 million, reflecting strong sales to existing customers. \n\n\n\nThird quarter gross profit increased 24% to $44.7 million and gross profit margin of 35.8% increased from 34.1% in the prior year third quarter, driven by operating leverage from sales growth. \n\nThird quarter income from operations increased 37% to $17.8 million, driven by strong sales growth and gross margin improvement. Net income decreased 66% to $1.3 million, or $0.11 diluted earnings per share, due to pre-tax debt refinancing costs of $8.8 million, or approximately $0.55 per share after-tax, including interest expense related to a call premium on the $268 million of 8.625% Senior Notes due 2026 redeemed in the third quarter, partially offset by a tax benefit recorded in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased 18% to $25.1 million. \n\n**Year-to-date 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\nNet sales increased 4% year-over-year to $355.5 million in the first nine months of 2024. \n\n  * Debit and Credit segment net sales increased 2% to $283.3 million, driven by increased sales of contactless cards, led by eco-focused cards, and growth in Card@Once ® instant issuance solutions and other card personalization services, partially offset by lower sales of other cards. \n  * Prepaid Debit segment net sales increased 16% to $73.2 million, reflecting strong sales to existing customers. \n\n\n\nYear-to-date gross profit increased 7% to $128.6 million and gross profit margin increased from 35.1% in the prior year to 36.2%. \n\nYear-to-date income from operations decreased 8% to $46.9 million due to increased compensation expenses, including CEO transition-related expenses and increased performance-based employee incentive compensation expense. Net income decreased 40% to $12.7 million, or $1.08 diluted earnings per share, primarily due to debt refinancing costs. Adjusted EBITDA increased 1% to $70.0 million. \n\n**Balance Sheet, Liquidity and Cash Flow**\n\nThe Company generated cash from operating activities of $16.7 million in the first nine months of 2024, which compared to $22.3 million in the 2023 period, and Free Cash Flow of $12.5 million, which compared to $16.2 million in the prior year. The decrease in cash generation compared to the prior year was primarily driven by increased working capital usage, including increased inventory purchases of contactless chips, partially offset by lower capital expenditures. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents was $14.7 million. There were $285 million of 10% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 and no borrowings from the ABL revolving credit facility outstanding at quarter-end. \n\nIn the third quarter, the Company completed a refinancing of its debt, issuing $285 million of new 10% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 and entering into a new $75 million ABL revolving credit facility. The Company used the proceeds from the notes offering to redeem the remaining $267.9 million principal balance of its 8.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 and to pay related fees and expenses. Refinancing costs recorded in the third quarter totaled $8.8 million, including $5.8 million of interest expense related to the 2.156% early redemption premium on the Company’s retired 8.625% Senior Notes due 2026 and a $3 million loss on debt extinguishment related to unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with the redemption of the notes and the termination of the prior ABL revolving credit facility. \n\nAlso in the third quarter, the Company spent $2.2 million to purchase 120,534 shares of its common stock from its majority stockholder group pursuant to a Stock Repurchase Agreement announced in March, which committed the Company to purchase shares from its majority stockholder group at a 3 to 1 ratio to the number of shares repurchased in the open market in the second quarter. \n\nThe Company continues to focus its capital structure and allocation priorities on investing in the business, including strategic acquisitions; deleveraging the balance sheet; and returning funds to stockholders. \n\nOn September 30th, the Company announced a secondary public offering of shares of its common stock to be sold by its majority stockholder group. The 1.38 million share offering closed on October 2, 2024. The Company did not offer any shares of common stock in the offering and did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling stockholders. \n\n“We delivered strong third quarter sales and profit growth, while continuing to invest in our expansion strategies,” said Jeff Hochstadt, Chief Financial Officer of CPI. “We also effectively extended maturities on our debt and completed a secondary offering of common stock, which should benefit trading liquidity over time.” \n\n**Outlook for 2024**\n\nThe Company updated its outlook for 2024 to mid-to-high single-digit net sales growth and low single-digit Adjusted EBITDA growth. The prior outlook was a mid-single digit net sales increase and a slight increase in Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in the net sales outlook was driven by strength across CPI’s portfolio. \n\nThe Free Cash Flow outlook was updated to be slightly below the 2023 level, compared to the previous outlook of approximately half of the 2023 level, primarily due to working capital improvements, lower expected capital spending, and a lower tax rate relative to the previous outlook. \n\nThe Company now expects its year-end 2024 Net Leverage Ratio to be similar to the 2023 year-end level, compared to a previous outlook of between 3.0x and 3.5x. \n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nCPI Card Group Inc. will hold a conference call on November 5, 2024 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) to review its third quarter results.

These non-GAAP financial measures are utilized by management in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis between fiscal periods. We believe that these financial measures are appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of our underlying operating performance trends compared to historical and prospective periods and our peers. Management also believes that these measures are useful to investors in their analysis of our results of operations and provide improved comparability between fiscal periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP measures may be different from similarly titled measures of other companies. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these historical non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in Exhibit E to this press release. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA \n\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented on a continuing operations basis and is defined as EBITDA (which represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) adjusted for litigation; stock-based compensation expense; estimated sales tax expense; restructuring and other charges, including executive retention and severance; costs related to production facility modernization efforts; loss on debt extinguishment; foreign currency gain or loss; and other items that are unusual in nature, infrequently occurring or not considered part of our core operations, as set forth in the reconciliation in Exhibit E. Adjusted EBITDA is intended to show our unleveraged, pre-tax operating results and therefore reflects our financial performance based on operational factors, excluding non-operational, unusual or non-recurring losses or gains. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: (a) our capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (b) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (c) the significant interest expenses or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; (d) tax payments that represent a reduction in cash available to us; (e) any cash requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; (f) the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters that we and the lenders under our credit agreement may not consider indicative of our ongoing operations; or (g) the impact of any discontinued operations. In particular, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA allows us to add back certain non-operating, unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net income, even though these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict and can represent the effect of long-term strategies as opposed to short-term results. In addition, certain of these expenses represent the reduction of cash that could be used for other purposes. Adjusted EBITDA margin percentage as shown in Exhibit E is computed as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total net sales. \n\nWe define LTM Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA (defined previously) for the last twelve months. LTM Adjusted EBITDA is used in the computation of Net Leverage Ratio, and is reconciled in Exhibit E. \n\nFree Cash Flow \n\nWe define Free Cash Flow as cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. We use this metric in analyzing our ability to service and repay our debt. However, this measure does not represent funds available for investment or other discretionary uses since it does not deduct cash used to make principal payments on outstanding debt and financing lease liabilities. Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, cash (used in) provided by operating activities or any other measures of liquidity derived in accordance with GAAP. \n\nFinancial Expectations for 2024 \n\nWe have provided Adjusted EBITDA expectations for 2024 on a non-GAAP basis because certain reconciling items are dependent on future events that either cannot be controlled or cannot be reliably predicted because they are not part of the Company’s routine activities, any of which could be significant. \n\nNet Leverage Ratio \n\nManagement and various investors use the ratio of debt principal outstanding, plus finance lease obligations, less cash, divided by LTM Adjusted EBITDA, or “Net Leverage Ratio”, as a measure of our financial strength when making key investment decisions and evaluating us against peers. \n\n**About CPI Card Group Inc.**\n\nCPI Card Group is a payments technology company providing a comprehensive range of payment card and digital solutions, including Software-as-a-Service-based instant issuance.

These forward-looking statements, including statements about our strategic initiatives and market opportunities, are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect on us and other information currently available. Such forward-looking statements, because they relate to future events, are by their very nature subject to many important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or other events to differ materially from those contemplated. \n\nThese risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: a deterioration in general economic conditions, including inflationary conditions and resulting in reduced consumer confidence and business spending, and a decline in consumer credit worthiness impacting demand for our products; the unpredictability of our operating results, including an inability to anticipate changes in customer inventory management practices and its impact on our business; a disruption or other failure in our supply chain, including as a result of foreign conflicts and with respect to single source suppliers, or the failure or inability of suppliers to comply with our code of conduct or contractual requirements, or political unrest in countries in which our suppliers operate, or inflationary pressures, resulting in increased costs and inability to pass those costs on to our customers and extended production lead times and difficulty meeting customers’ delivery expectations; our failure to retain our existing customers or identify and attract new customers; our inability to recruit, retain and develop qualified personnel, including key personnel, and implement effective succession processes; adverse conditions in the banking system and financial markets, including the failure of banks and financial institutions; system security risks, data protection breaches and cyber-attacks; interruptions in our operations, including our information technology systems, or in the operations of the third parties that operate computing infrastructure on which we rely;

our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting; disruptions in production at one or more of our facilities; problems in production quality, materials and process and costs relating to product defects and any related product liability and/or warranty claims; environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) preferences and demands of various stakeholders and our ability to conform to such preferences and demands and to comply with any related regulatory requirements; the effects of climate change, negative perceptions of our products due to the impact of our products and production processes on the environment and other ESG-related risks; damage to our reputation or brand image; disruptions in production due to weather conditions, climate change, political instability or social unrest; our inability to adequately protect our trade secrets and intellectual property rights from misappropriation, infringement claims brought against us and risks related to open source software; defects in our software and computing systems; our limited ability to raise capital; costs and impacts to our financial results relating to the obligatory collection of sales tax and claims for uncollected sales tax in states that impose sales tax collection requirements on out-of-state businesses or unclaimed property, as well as potential new U.S. tax legislation increasing the corporate income tax rate and challenges to our income tax positions; our inability to successfully execute on our divestitures or acquisitions; our inability to realize the full value of our long-lived assets; our inability to renew licenses with key technology licensors; the highly competitive, saturated and consolidated nature of our marketplace; costs and potential liabilities associated with compliance or failure to comply with regulations, customer contractual requirements and evolving industry standards regarding consumer privacy and data use and security; new and developing technologies that make our existing technology solutions and products obsolete or less relevant or our failure to introduce new products and services in a timely manner; our failure to operate our business in accordance with the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council security standards or other industry standards; the effects of restrictions, delays or interruptions in our ability to source raw materials and components used in our products from foreign countries; the effects on the global economy of ongoing foreign conflicts; our failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our products and the raw materials we use in our production processes; risks associated with our significant stockholder group’s ownership of our stock; potential conflicts of interest that may arise due to our board of directors being comprised in part of directors who are principals of our significant stockholder group; the influence of securities analysts over the trading market for and price of our common stock; failure to meet the continued listing standards of the Nasdaq Global Market; the impact of stockholder activism or securities litigation on the trading price and volatility of our common stock; our inability to fully execute on our share repurchase program strategy; certain provisions of our organizational documents and other contractual provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control and make it difficult for stockholders other than our significant stockholder group to change the composition of our board of directors; our ability to comply with a wide variety of complex laws and regulations and the exposure to liability for any failure to comply; the effect of legal and regulatory proceedings; and other risks that are described in Part I, Item 1A – _Risk Factors_ in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 7, 2024 in Part II, Item 1A – _Risk Factors_ of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other reports filed from time to time with the SEC. \n\nWe caution and advise readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.

The Company did not offer any shares of common stock in the offering and\ndid not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling stockholders.\n“We delivered strong third quarter sales and profit growth, while continuing to invest in our\nexpansion strategies,” said Jeff Hochstadt, Chief Financial Officer of CPI. “We also effectively\nextended maturities on our debt and completed a secondary offering of common stock, which\nshould benefit trading liquidity over time.”\nOutlook for 2024\nThe Company updated its outlook for 2024 to mid-to-high single-digit net sales growth and low\nsingle-digit Adjusted EBITDA growth. The prior outlook was a mid-single digit net sales increase\nand a slight increase in Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in the net sales outlook was driven by\nstrength across CPI’s portfolio.\nThe Free Cash Flow outlook was updated to be slightly below the 2023 level, compared to the\nprevious outlook of approximately half of the 2023 level, primarily due to working capital\nimprovements, lower expected capital spending, and a lower tax rate relative to the previous\noutlook.\nThe Company now expects its year-end 2024 Net Leverage Ratio to be similar to the 2023 year-\nend level, compared to a previous outlook of between 3.0x and 3.5x.\nConference Call and Webcast\nCPI Card Group Inc. will hold a conference call on November 5, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time\n(ET) to review its third quarter results.

These non-GAAP financial\nmeasures are utilized by management in comparing our operating performance on a consistent\nbasis between fiscal periods. We believe that these financial measures are appropriate to enhance\nan overall understanding of our underlying operating performance trends compared to historical and\nprospective periods and our peers. Management also believes that these measures are useful to\ninvestors in their analysis of our results of operations and provide improved comparability between\nfiscal periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a\nsubstitute for, financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP measures\nmay be different from similarly titled measures of other companies. Investors are encouraged to\nreview the reconciliation of these historical non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable\nGAAP financial measures included in Exhibit E to this press release.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented on a continuing operations basis and is defined as EBITDA (which\nrepresents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) adjusted for litigation;\nstock-based compensation expense; estimated sales tax expense; restructuring and other charges,\nincluding executive retention and severance; costs related to production facility modernization\nefforts; loss on debt extinguishment; foreign currency gain or loss; and other items that are unusual\nin nature, infrequently occurring or not considered part of our core operations, as set forth in the\nreconciliation in Exhibit E. Adjusted EBITDA is intended to show our unleveraged, pre-tax operating\nresults and therefore reflects our financial performance based on operational factors, excluding\nnon-operational, unusual or non-recurring losses or gains. Adjusted EBITDA has important\nlimitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for,\nanalysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect:\n(a) our capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual\ncommitments; (b) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (c) the\nsignificant interest expenses or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal\npayments on our debt; (d) tax payments that represent a reduction in cash available to us; (e) any\ncash requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in\nthe future; (f) the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters that we and the lenders\nunder our credit agreement may not consider indicative of our ongoing operations; or (g) the impact\nof any discontinued operations. In particular, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA allows us to add\nback certain non-operating, unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net\nincome, even though these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict and\ncan represent the effect of long-term strategies as opposed to short-term results. In addition, certain\nof these expenses represent the reduction of cash that could be used for other purposes. Adjusted\nEBITDA margin percentage as shown in Exhibit E is computed as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total\nnet sales.\nWe define LTM Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA (defined previously) for the last twelve\nmonths. LTM Adjusted EBITDA is used in the computation of Net Leverage Ratio, and is reconciled\nin Exhibit E.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe define Free Cash Flow as cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities less capital\nexpenditures. We use this metric in analyzing our ability to service and repay our debt. However,\nthis measure does not represent funds available for investment or other discretionary uses since it\ndoes not deduct cash used to make principal payments on outstanding debt and financing lease\nliabilities. Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, cash (used\nin) provided by operating activities or any other measures of liquidity derived in accordance with\nGAAP.\nFinancial Expectations for 2024\nWe have provided Adjusted EBITDA expectations for 2024 on a non-GAAP basis because certain\nreconciling items are dependent on future events that either cannot be controlled or cannot be\nreliably predicted because they are not part of the Company’s routine activities, any of which could\nbe significant.\nNet Leverage Ratio\nManagement and various investors use the ratio of debt principal outstanding, plus finance lease\nobligations, less cash, divided by LTM Adjusted EBITDA, or “Net Leverage Ratio”, as a measure of\nour financial strength when making key investment decisions and evaluating us against peers.\nAbout CPI Card Group Inc.\nCPI Card Group is a payments technology company providing a comprehensive range of payment\ncard and digital solutions, including Software-as-a-Service-based instant issuance.

These non-GAAP financial measures are utilized by management in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis between fiscal\nperiods. We believe that these financial measures are appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of our underlying operating performance trends compared to historical and prospective periods and our peers. Management also believes that these\nmeasures are useful to investors in their analysis of our results of operations and provide improved comparability between fiscal periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information\ncalculated in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP measures may be different from similarly titled measures of other companies. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these historical non-GAAP measures to their most directly\ncomparable GAAP financial measures included in the appendix to this presentation.\n2\nAgenda\nOverview and Strategy\n1\n2 Q3 Financial Review\n3 2024 Outlook\nSummary\n4\n3\nCPI Confidential and Proprietary | Not for distribution\nOverview\nAccelerated growth in Q3 as expected\n▪ Strong growth in debit and credit card sales\n▪ Continued solid growth in Prepaid solutions, Card@Once® instant\nissuance and other card personalization services\n2024 full-year outlook updated\n▪ Mid-to-high single-digit increase in net sales (previously mid-single\ndigit)\n▪ Low single-digit increase in Adjusted EBITDA (previously slight\nincrease)\nCapital structure strengthened; capital allocation priorities\nadvanced\n▪ Debt refinancing extended maturities to 2029\n▪ Repurchase of common stock\n▪ Secondary offering reduced majority stockholder group ownership\n▪ Investment in the business\nLong-term growth trends remain intact\n▪ U.S. Cards in circulation growth\n▪ Focus on gaining share and expanding into adjacent markets\n4\nStrategy Review\nBuild from Strong Foundation\n▪ A leader in the U.S. payments market with portfolio that includes\nSecure Card, Personalization, Instant Issuance and Prepaid\n▪ Strong value proposition from our focus on customer service,\nquality and innovation\n▪ Strong and long-standing customer relationships\nExpand Addressable Markets\n▪ Leverage technology connections with the U.S. payments eco-\nsystem to offer additional payment solutions, including digital\nsolutions, for existing base of thousands of SME financial\ninstitution customers\n▪ Provide existing solutions to new customer verticals\nThe Contactless Indicator mark, consisting of four graduating arcs, is a trademark 5\nowned by and used with permission of EMVCo, LLC.\nVisa and Mastercard U.S. Cards in Circulation\nCards in circulation have grown at a 9% CAGR over the last three years to 2.1 billion, up from 1.6 billion\n2,094 2,115\n2,056\n2,008\n1,978\n1,914\n1,885\n1,829\n1,758 1,783\n1,714\n1,679\n1,627 763 767\n753\n725 739\n679 693\n674\n645 656\n616 636\n606\n1,206 1,221 1,253 1,269 1,303 1,331 1,348\n1,021 1,063 1,078 1,113 1,127 1,155\nQ2'21 Q3'21 Q4'21 Q1'22 Q2'22 Q3'22 Q4'22 Q1'23 Q2'23 Q3'23 Q4'23 Q1'24 Q2'24\nCards in Millions\nDebit Credit\nSources: Visa and Mastercard Quarterly Operational Performance Data\n6\n2024 Q3\nFinancial Review\n7\nCPI Confidential and Proprietary | Not for distribution\nQ3 Highlights\nStrong growth in debit and credit card sales; gross\nmargin expansion; net income impacted by debt\nrefinancing costs\n▪ Net sales increased 18% to $124.8 million\n▪ Gross margin increased from 34.1% to 35.8%\n▪ Net income decreased 66% to $1.3 million due to debt refinancing\ncosts; net income margin decreased from 3.6% to 1.0%\n▪ Adjusted EBITDA¹ increased 18% to $25.1 million; Adjusted\nEBITDA margin¹ remained at 20.1%\n▪ Cash provided by operating activities of $16.7 million in the first\nnine months compared to $22.3 million in the prior year\n▪ Free Cash Flow¹ generation of $12.5 million in the first nine\nmonths compared to $16.2 million in the prior year\n▪ New $285 million 10% Senior Notes due 2029 issued; new $75\nmillion ABL credit facility.

Adjusted EBITDA is\npresented on a continuing operations basis and is defined as EBITDA (which\nrepresents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization)\nadjusted for litigation; stock-based compensation expense; estimated sales tax\nexpense, restructuring and other charges, including executive retention and\nseverance; costs related to production facility modernization efforts; loss on\ndebt extinguishment; foreign currency gain or loss; and other items that are\nunusual in nature, infrequently occurring or not considered part of our core\noperations. Adjusted EBITDA is intended to show our unleveraged, pre-tax\noperating results and therefore reflects our financial performance based on\noperational factors, excluding non-operational, unusual or non-recurring losses\nor gains. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, and\nyou should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for, analysis of our\nresults as reported under GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA does not\nreflect: (a) our capital expenditures, future requirements for capital\nexpenditures or contractual commitments; (b) changes in, or cash\nrequirements for, our working capital needs; (c) the significant interest\nexpenses or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal\npayments on our debt; (d) tax payments that represent a reduction in cash\navailable to us; (e) any cash requirements for the assets being depreciated\n(1) The 2024 balance includes payment of an early redemption premium of $5.8 million related to the redemption of the 8.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2026.\nand amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; (f) the impact of (2) Represents estimated sales tax expense relating to a contingent liability due to historical activity in certain states whereit is probable that the Company will be subject to\nsales tax plus interest and penalties.\nearnings or charges resulting from matters that we and the lender under our\n(3) Represents executive retention and severance costs, as well as costs related to production facility modernization efforts.

My name is Rob, and I will be your\noperator today. [Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Salop, CPI's Head of\nInvestor Relations.\nMichael A. Salop\nHead of Investor Relations\nThanks, operator. Welcome to the CPI Card Group's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Webcast and Conference\nCall. Today's date is November 5, 2024, and on the call today from CPI Card Group are John Lowe,\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Hochstadt, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this call may contain forward-looking statements, as\nthey are defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject\nto certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed\nin the forward-looking statements.\nFor a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, please see CPI Card Group's most recent filings with\nthe SEC. All forward-looking statements made today reflect our current expectations only, and we\nundertake no obligation to update any statement to reflect the events that occur after this call. Also during\nthe course of today's call, the company will be discussing one or more non-GAAP financial measures,\nincluding, but not limited to, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, net leverage ratio, and\nfree cash flow. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable\nGAAP measures are included in the press release and slide presentation we issued this morning.\nCopies of today's press release as well as the presentation that accompanies this conference call are\naccessible on CPI's Investor Relations website, investor.cpicardgroup.com. In addition, CPI's Form 10-Q for\nthe quarter ended September 30, 2024, will be available in CPI's Investor Relations website. On today's\ncall, all growth rates refer to comparisons with the prior year period, unless otherwise noted.\nThe agenda for today's call is on Slide 3. John will give a brief overview of the third quarter and our\nstrategies, and Jeff will provide more detail on the results and our financial outlook, and then we'll open\nthe call for questions.\nAnd now we can move to Slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to John.\nJohn D. Lowe\nPresident, CEO & Director\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We are excited to share our strong third quarter results and\nincreased outlook this morning. We delivered the second largest sales quarter in the company's history\nand generated nearly 20% growth in both net sales and adjusted EBITDA. We also continue to make\nadvances with our adjacent market strategies and are seeing growing interest in our expanding set of\ndigital solutions.\nAs we highlighted at the beginning of the year, we expected the first half to be challenging as channel\ninventories continue to be worked down and expected to see good growth in the second half, and the third\nquarter reflects that.\nNet sales increased 18% in the quarter, with product sales, which primarily represent debit and credit\ncards, growing 25%, led by strong sales of eco-focused contactless cards. While channel inventory levels\nare still elevated, they are improving, and we believe we are winning business in the market.\nIn addition to our card performance, we continue to grow our Card@Once instant issuance solutions and\nour personalization businesses, and our prepaid business remains strong, delivering 13% growth in the\nquarter. We also made great progress improving our profitability with gross margins increasing 170 basis\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 05, 2024\npoints compared to prior year and adjusted EBITDA increasing 18%, and we completed some significant\nfinancing and capital strategy items, issuing new Senior Notes extending maturities out to 2029, and\nsupporting a secondary offering by our majority stockholder group, which should aid trading liquidity for\nour stock over time.\nBased on our results and current expectations for the fourth quarter, we have updated our full year\noutlook for 2024, increasing our net sales range due to strength across our portfolio and also increasing\nour adjusted EBITDA and cash flow expectations.\nJeff will provide you more detail on our results and outlook in a few minutes, but I will first review our\nstrategic progress on Slide 5. Our strategies remain focused on the customer, innovation, and high quality\nto grow and gain share in our traditional businesses while enhancing growth by expanding into adjacent\nmarkets, including digital solutions over the long term. One innovation example is our recently announced\nability to produce cards with a new advanced contactless chip that integrates the antenna within the chip\nitself. This feature allows for more flexibility on card design and reduces carbon footprint as it eliminates\nthe need for separate layers within the card for the antenna. Although there are generally long adoption\ncycles for changes in chip technology, we are now ready to initiate pilots with customers, positioning CPI\nas a potential early adopter of an important new technology.\nIn addition to driving growth in our traditional core businesses, we are advancing our efforts to capitalize\non new opportunities by adjacent markets, including offering more products and digital solutions to\nexisting customers and expanding to new customer verticals.\nDuring the quarter, we announced another digital solution offering when we signed an agreement with\nRippleshot to offer their fraud prevention tools to our customer base. Rippleshot's tools generate predictive\nanalytics, leveraging data from thousands of financial institutions generating millions of transactions each\nday. We believe these tools will help our small and medium-sized financial institution customers reduce\nlosses by identifying fraud patterns to block attacks before they strike, detecting compromised merchants\nand high-risk cards.\nIn addition to this offering, we also continue to see growing interest in our broader digital solutions,\nincluding push provisioning. These are just a few examples of our progress, and we believe these\nopportunities will supplement our growth over the coming years.\nTurning to Slide 6. We continue to expect our core markets to provide solid long-term growth. On this\nslide, you can see the latest U.S. cards in circulation trends from Visa and Mastercard. For the 3 years\nending June 30, cards in circulation in the U.S. increased at a 9% CAGR and reports from large issuers\nalso indicate a healthy card market. As an example, JPMorgan Chase reported an 11% year-over-year\nincrease in cards outstanding and Bank of America noted the addition of 1 million credit card accounts.\nThe issuance trends are strong, channel inventory is being worked down, and we believe we can continue\nto win in the marketplace with both our traditional businesses and as we expand into adjacent markets,\nincluding digital solutions.\nI would like to now turn the call over to Jeff to discuss our third quarter financial results and 2024 outlook\nin more detail. Jeff?\nJeffrey A. Hochstadt\nChief Financial Officer\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I will begin my overview on Slide 8. As John mentioned, we\ndelivered very strong sales growth in the quarter with increases across our portfolio. The sales growth\ndrove gross margin expansion, and we also delivered a strong increase in adjusted EBITDA despite\nincreased performance-based employee incentive compensation expenses.\nNet income declined in the quarter due to the impact of debt refinancing costs as we completed the\nretirement of our previous Senior Notes and the issuance of new notes due in 2029. Free cash flow\ngeneration was healthy, and our net leverage ratio of 3.2x at quarter end improved slightly compared to\nthe second quarter despite the cash outflows associated with debt refinancing costs.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 4\nCPI CARD GROUP INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 05, 2024\nTurning to the detailed third quarter results on Slide 9. The overall 18% sales increase reflected a\n19% increase in our Debit and Credit segment and a 13% increase in our Prepaid segment. Debit and\nCredit segment growth was led by unit volume increases from our card business, driven by eco-focused\ncontactless cards and continued growth from Card@Once instant issuance solutions and other card\npersonalization services.\nPrepaid segment growth continues to reflect demand for higher-priced fraud-focused packaging solutions\nas we discussed last quarter. Gross profit increased 24% in the quarter as gross margins increased from\n34.1% in the prior year quarter to 35.8%, driven by operating leverage. SG&A, including depreciation and\namortization, increased $3.7 million from the prior year, primarily due to increased performance-based\nemployee incentive compensation expense as accruals in the third quarter of last year were minimal.\nInterest expense increased $6.7 million in the quarter, primarily due to payment of a 2.156% call premium\nor $5.8 million to redeem the $268 million outstanding of our Senior Notes due 2026. We also recorded a\n$3 million loss on debt extinguishment and other expense, which reflects the write-down of unamortized\ndeferred financing costs on our retired debt and credit facilities.\nWe recorded an income tax benefit in the quarter, which brought our year-to-date tax rate to 24%. The\nbenefit reflects increased deductibility of stock compensation primarily related to certain option exercises,\nwhich triggered recognition of updated values of the option expense for tax purposes.\nNet income in the third quarter decreased 66% or $2.6 million due to the $8.8 million of pretax debt\nrefinancing costs. Adjusted EBITDA increased 18% to $25.1 million and adjusted EBITDA margins were\nconsistent with prior year at 20.1% as the improvement in gross margin was offset by the increased\nincentive compensation expenses in SG&A.\nTurning now to our year-to-date results on Slide 10. For the first 9 months of the year, net sales increased\n4% with the Debit and Credit segment increasing 2% and Prepaid increasing 16%. Within debit and credit,\nthe year-to-date sales increase can be attributed to growth in contactless card sales led by eco-focused\ncards and consistent growth from Instant Issuance and other card personalization services, partially offset\nby declines in contact card sales.\nYear-to-date gross profit increased 7% as gross margin increased from 35.1% to 36.2%. SG&A increased\n$12.7 million from the prior year period, driven primarily by an increase in CEO transition-related\ncosts and increased performance-based employee incentive compensation compared to 2023. The\nCEO transition-related costs increased approximately $4 million from prior year due to increased stock\ncompensation expense from special key employee grants issued in the second half of last year and\nexecutive severance expenses, partially offset by reduced impact from the CEO retention award, which\nwas completed in the first quarter.\nThe year-to-date tax rate of 24%, declined versus last years of 30.5% as this year's rate reflects increased\nstock compensation deductibility and last year's rate reflected limitations on deductibility of executive\ncompensation expense.\nNet income in the first 9 months decreased 40% to $12.7 million, affected by the debt refinancing costs\nand CEO transition-related costs, and adjusted EBITDA increased 1% to $70 million. Adjusted EBITDA\nmargin of 19.7% was down from 20.4% in the prior year, primarily due to the increase in performance-\nbased incentive compensation expense, partially offset by improved gross margins.\nTurning now to our segments on Slide 11. I discussed the segment sales drivers earlier, so I will highlight\nsegment profitability on this slide. Income from operations for the Debit and Credit segment increased\n30% to $27 million in the third quarter, driven by the sales increase and strong gross margin expansion\nand declined 1% year-to-date due to the impact of increased compensation-related expenses. Prepaid\ndebit segment income from operations increased 7% to $7.1 million in the third quarter and 27% year-\nto-date, driven by sales growth with the year-to-date increase also driven by strong gross margin\nimprovement.\nTurning to the balance sheet, liquidity, and cash flow on Slide 12. For the first 9 months of the year, we\ngenerated $16.7 million of cash from operating activities and invested $4.2 million in capital expenditures,\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5\nCPI CARD GROUP INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 05, 2024\nwhich resulted in free cash flow of $12.5 million. This compared to operating cash flow of $22.3 million\nand free cash flow of $16.2 million in the prior year. The lower generation in this year's period was\nprimarily driven by increased working capital usage, partially offset by lower capital spending. Working\ncapital usage reflects an increase in inventory driven by purchase commitments for contactless chips.\nAs mentioned previously, we are carrying more contactless chip inventory than normal this year due to our\nagreement with our main supplier, but we expect to be able to use these chips going forward.\nFree cash flow through the first 9 months of 2024 was also affected by incentives related to the customer\ncontract signed in the first quarter and the payment of former CEO's retention award, partially offset by\nlower short-term employee incentive payments based on 2023 performance.\nCapital spending is down just under $2 million from our prior year, but we expect spending to increase in\nthe fourth quarter as we advance the build-out of our new secure card production facility in Indiana.\nOn the balance sheet at quarter end, we had $14.7 million of cash, no borrowings on our ABL revolver and\n$285 million of senior secured notes outstanding at quarter end. Our net leverage ratio was 3.2x, down\nslightly from the second quarter despite payment of the $5.8 million call premium on our retired Senior\nNotes and approximately $6.5 million of other cash outflows related to our debt refinancing. Our capital\nstructure and allocation priorities remain focused on investing in the business, including possible strategic\nacquisitions, deleveraging the balance sheet and returning funds to stockholders.\nAs mentioned last quarter, in July, we completed the refinancing of our debt, issuing $285 million of 10%\ncoupon senior secured notes due in 2029 and entering into a new $75 million ABL revolving facility while\nretiring our Senior Notes that were due in 2026. With our share repurchase program, we have bought\nback approximately $9 million since inception in the fourth quarter of last year.\nIn the third quarter, we completed the purchase of 121,000 shares for $2.2 million from our majority\nstockholder group, funds affiliated with Parallel49 Equity pursuant to the stock purchase agreement\nannounced in March. Under that agreement, we continue to repurchase shares from Parallel49 at a ratio\nof 3:1 to the number of shares we repurchased in the open market from April to June at a price of 98%\nof the average open market repurchase price over that period. We did not execute any open market\nrepurchases in the third quarter.\nAlso on September 30, we announced a secondary offering of shares of common stock from funds\naffiliated with the majority stockholder group. On October 2, the offering closed and 1.38 million shares\nwere sold in a public offering. CPI did not sell any shares or receive any proceeds from the offering.\nWe believe this offering will be beneficial for shareholders as more shares will move to the public float\nand majority ownership was decreased, as the transaction resulted in the majority stockholder group\nownership decreasing from 56% of shares outstanding to 43%. This transaction was structured and\nexecuted by Parallel49 Equity, and it will be their decision if they pursue additional offerings in the future.\nWe cannot speak on their behalf, but we will say they are very constructive and long-term focused. They\nhave been in this investment for many years and believe that increasing the public float could be beneficial\nfor both the company and the economics of potential future offerings. We also note that a controlling\nperson of our majority stockholder group purchased 250,000 shares in the offering through his family\noffice, which indicates strong belief in the Company's future.\nTurning to our 2024 financial outlook on Slide 13. As John mentioned, we have updated our financial\noutlook for 2024. We have increased our net sales range to mid to high single-digit growth, up from mid-\nsingle digit previously due to strength across our portfolio, and we have increased our adjusted EBITDA\noutlook to low single-digit growth, up from slight growth in our previous outlook.\nWe have also increased our full year free cash flow outlook to be slightly below the 2023 level compared\nto approximately half the prior year level in our previous outlook, primarily reflecting working capital\nimprovements, lower expected capital spending and a lower tax rate. We now expect our year-end net\nleverage ratio to be similar to the 2023 year-end level compared to our previous outlook of between 3.0x\nand 3.5x.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6\nCPI CARD GROUP INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 05, 2024\nNet leverage was 3.1x at year-end 2023. Improvement this year was negatively impacted by the cash\noutflows associated with the debt refinancing, but our goal is to continue to work it down over time.\nI will now pass the call back to John for some closing remarks on Slide 14. John?\nJohn D. Lowe\nPresident, CEO & Director\nThanks, Jeff. To summarize, we are very pleased with the third quarter performance. Our Debit and Credit\ncard business provided strong growth, while we continue to also drive growth in prepaid, instant issuance,\nand our other card personalization services. Based on the strength of our portfolio, we updated our full\nyear expectations, increasing our net sales, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow outlooks.\nWe continue to advance our strategies to gain share by leading in customer service, quality, and\ninnovation and increasing our addressable market through expansion into adjacencies, including digital\nsolutions over time. We are pleased with our positioning and progress and look forward to continuing to\ndrive performance for our shareholders.\nOperator, we will now open the call up for any questions.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 05, 2024\nQuestion and Answer\n....................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jaeson Schmidt from Lake Street Capital\nMarkets.\nJaeson Allen Min Schmidt\nLake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division\nCongrats on the nice results. Just want to start with sort of the revenue momentum. I know the excess\ninventory was creating some headwinds earlier this year. But is it fair to say that is completely behind you\nnow?\nJohn D. Lowe\nPresident, CEO & Director\nJaeson, so I would say not necessarily behind us. I mean, things are improving, not over, but the market\nis strong. Cards in circulation are still growing at a 9% CAGR over the last 3 years. And if you go back in\ntime to the beginning of this year, we did expect growth in the second half after kind of a down -- a little\nbit of downside in the first half. And the third quarter reflects that. We had a strong third quarter with\nperformance across the card side, including eco-focused, Prepaid had a good quarter. And our Software-\nas-a-Service digital solution, Card@Once had a great quarter, and our personalization business has had\na great quarter. So overall, market momentum is still there, but channel inventories are still working\nthemselves down, but we do believe we're winning business in the market.\nJaeson Allen Min Schmidt\nLake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division\nAnd then just as a follow-up, your commentary about news on the integration of the chip and antenna\ndesign. Maybe it's a bit too early, but can you help us think about how we -- how that will impact either\nASPs or gross margins longer term?\nJohn D. Lowe\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes. I mean, look, we're excited about the, what we call the all-in-one chip that creates a chip where the\nantenna is essentially put within the chip itself versus adding card layers within the card. So it helps our\ncustomers expand their design options, reduces carbon footprint. But we're in early stages, right? It will\ntake years to really ramp up. So we don't necessarily know the pace. So I wouldn't want to speak to the\nfinancial impact quite yet. But we're excited to be an early adopter. And hopefully, we'll see adoption faster\nthan slower.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Andrew Scutt from ROTH Capital Partners.\nAndrew Scutt\nROTH MKM Partners, LLC, Research Division\nFirst one for me, you guys have kind of spoken to strength in some of the ancillary businesses like\nCard@Once and push provisioning. Can you kind of -- as far as push provisioning goes, you've been a\ncouple of months into the MEA partnership. Can you kind of talk about momentum that you're seeing\nthere?\nJohn D. Lowe\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes. I mean momentum is strong. I'd say it's still a very minor impact to our financials at this point in\ntime. But just, Andrew, to your question, MEA, as a reminder, they probably have 300 FIs that they work\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8\nCPI CARD GROUP INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 05, 2024\nwith. We're now able to work with their FIs, providing them push provisioning. There is a pipeline that\nwe're kind of working with. And push has been successful so far, but it's kind of slowly ramping, right,\nbanks are always slow to adopt and ramp things up. But there's definitely strong interest, which is great.\nAnd if you think about our Card@Once solution, right, our Software-as-a-Service solution, we've been in\nthat business for more than 10 years. That's a business where we're in more than 16,000 branches across\nthe United States. And that's been a strong growth business for us. It's a high-margin business, similar\nto what our broader digital solutions are as well. So we'll share more on push prospectively from a metric\nperspective. But what I can say is there's a strong momentum, but it's still early days.\nAndrew Scutt\nROTH MKM Partners, LLC, Research Division\nAwesome. No, great to hear. And second one from me. You kind of spoke on the revenue momentum in\nDebit and Credit. We also saw a nice bump up in Prepaid in the quarter. Can you just kind of speak to what\nyou saw in that business over the last few months?\nJohn D. Lowe\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes. I mean Prepaid is having a great year. I've got to thank the team up in Minnesota because they're\njust doing a great job. 13% year-over-year growth is a really strong quarter for the prepaid side. And\nit's really driven by 2 sides. I'd say one side is the kind of increase in fraud protection demand by our\ncustomers. We're constantly innovating with our partners in terms of putting more fraud protections into\nthe package. That creates a higher value package, which is great for us, but also protects our customers'\ncustomers, if you will. And then the other side is there's a number of prepaid areas we're moving into from\nan adjacency perspective into the healthcare side, and that's benefiting our Prepaid business. So strong\nquarter for the Prepaid team, and we're hoping for a strong growth for the remainder of the year.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann from D.A. Davidson.\nPeter James Heckmann\nD.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division\nFollowing on that last question, your -- the raise in your full year guidance does imply another strong\nquarter for the fourth. And just trying to think about in terms of thinking about seasonality in Debit and\nCredit versus Prepaid debit, I guess, could you give a little bit of thoughts in terms of the relative strength\nof those 2? It certainly looks like Prepaid is on track to have a really great year and Debit and Credit a\ngood year. But I guess that's dependent upon my forecast. So in terms of how you're thinking about the\nfourth quarter, would you expect it to -- in terms of the relative growth rates of the 2 segments, would you\nexpect it to be about the same? Or would you expect there to be a significant variance?\nJeffrey A. Hochstadt\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. Actually, I mean, a good question. We really, over the years, we haven't been as fluctuating as\nseasonally as we had in the past. So we feel like both businesses will have a good continuation in Q4. I\ndon't think there's really a significant seasonality in either of these businesses at this point.\nPeter James Heckmann\nD.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division\nAnd then just in terms of your new production facility in Indiana, can you talk a little bit about how that\nprocess is coming and when you would expect to go live? And then if you could, I don't think you've done\nthis in the past, but if it's possible, if you could maybe quantify a little bit about that additional volume\ncommitment you received from that customer and when we might see that start to hit in results?\nJohn D. Lowe\nPresident, CEO & Director\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9\nCPI CARD GROUP INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 05, 2024\nHello, Pete, good to talk to you. I'll let Jeff talk about kind of Indiana and capacity. And on the customer\ncontract side, the one we locked into in Q1, just as a reminder, that's a 6-year deal, commitments that\nreally ramp in '25 and the outer years. This year was kind of the start to it. So we continue to strengthen\nour relationship with that customer, and it's a good way for us to win share, and we're excited about it.\nBut I don't really want to comment on the performance quite yet, given it's a 6-year deal. That said,\nIndiana, we're excited about it. I think as I understand it, we've got walls up and a roof on. So we're\nslowly getting it up and running. I think it's mid next year before it's starting to be operational. But Jeff,\ndo you want to comment?\nJeffrey A. Hochstadt\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, Pete, it will be -- like John said, we broke ground and walls are up. We should be in by the end of\n2025. We did say previously that the cost of -- the whole cost of the facility will be about $20 million. We\nthink that will be a cash flow impact for the first 2 years of about $13 million, $12 million to $13 million.\nSo that has increased our CapEx this year. We are increasing our footprint in Indiana. We're doubling our\nfootprint in Indiana. And that overall is about a 10% increase in our overall footprint company-wide. So it\ndoes -- it will increase capacity over time.\nAnd another note is we're buying new equipment. We're investing in automation. So not only do we have\nmore capacity, but our throughput should be more efficient with new equipment and automation. So we're\nreally excited to get that up and running next year.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Hal Goetsch from B. Riley Securities.\nHarold Lee Goetsch\nB. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division\nOn the sales growth, you were lapping you had 25% growth in product sales, lapping a minus 22%. So\nreally just kind of getting back to where you were maybe at 2022 levels. Could you give us a little color\non how much of that is normalization of existing customers and how much of that is potentially new\nprograms? Kind of what's the composition of the growth kind of year-over-year?\nJohn D. Lowe\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes. I'll give you a high level, Hal, and good to talk to you, and then pass it off to Jeff. But if you go back\nto 2022, I mean, that was a record year. That was predominantly driven by payment card sales, right? I\nmean that was when the market had extremely high demand and drove our Secure Card business to have\nsignificant growth. And ultimately, we had a nearly 30% year-over-year growth in that year. If you look at\nthis year, while year-over-year in Q3, card sales were strong, right, and our volumes have been increasing\nprogressively through the year, we're still not necessarily at the levels that we were in '22 and still have\nenough of ways to go, if you will, from an inventory rebalancing perspective. So I think the other areas of\nour business, think of our Instant Issuance business, it's grown since '22. Our Personalization businesses\nare performing strong. And if you think about our Prepaid business, that's performing really well in 2024\nabout that as well. But Jeff, do you want to?\nJeffrey A. Hochstadt\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. I think you're right in the sense that it's coming back. But also we've seen some really strong\nsequential growth from Q1 to Q2, Q2 to Q3. So as John mentioned at the outset of the call, our second\nhighest quarter ever. So we're -- like John mentioned earlier, the rebalancing is still going through the\nsystem, but we feel like the other parts of our portfolio are also performing at high levels. So we feel some\ngood momentum.\nHarold Lee Goetsch\nB. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 10\nCPI CARD GROUP INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 05, 2024\nSo what to say, would you say it's mostly existing customers or some new -- a mix of both?\nJohn D. Lowe\nPresident, CEO & Director\nHal, it's a great question. No, we are winning new customers in the market across the portfolio.\nOperator\nAs there are no further questions in queue, I would now like to turn the call back over to John Lowe for\nclosing remarks.\nJohn D. Lowe\nPresident, CEO & Director\nOkay. Well, thanks, operator. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call. I want to again acknowledge and\nthank all of our CPI employees for everything they do for our company and our customers as they execute\non our vision, values, and strategies every day and continue to drive our business forward.

Business Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBusiness Overview\nCPI Card Group Inc. (which, together with its subsidiary companies, is referred to herein as “CPI” or the\n“Company”) is a payments technology company and leading provider of comprehensive Financial Payment Card\nsolutions in the United States. CPI is engaged in the design, production, data personalization, packaging and fulfillment\nof Financial Payment Cards, which the Company defines as credit, debit and Prepaid Debit Cards (defined below) issued\non the networks of the Payment Card Brands (Visa, Mastercard®, American Express® and Discover®). CPI defines\n“Prepaid Debit Cards” as debit cards issued on the networks of the Payment Card Brands, but not linked to a traditional\nbank account. CPI also offers an instant card issuance solution, which provides customers the ability to issue a\npersonalized debit or credit card within the bank branch to individual cardholders.\nCPI serves its customers through a network of high-security production and card services facilities in the United\nStates, each of which is audited for compliance with the standards of the Payment Card Industry Security Standards\nCouncil (“PCI Security Standards Council”) by one or more of the Payment Card Brands. CPI’s network of high-\nsecurity production facilities allows the Company to optimize its solutions offerings and serve its customers.\nThe Company’s business consists of the following reportable segments: Debit and Credit, Prepaid Debit and\nOther. The Debit and Credit segment primarily produces Financial Payment Cards and provides integrated card services\nto card-issuing financial institutions primarily in the United States. The Prepaid Debit segment primarily provides\nintegrated card services to Prepaid Debit Card program managers primarily in the United States. The Company’s\n“Other” segment includes corporate expenses.\nBasis of Presentation\nCertain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) have been condensed or\nomitted pursuant to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, these financial\nstatements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for the fair\nstatement of the results of the interim periods presented. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,\n2023 is derived from the audited financial statements as of that date. The accompanying condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included\nin the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nUse of Estimates\nManagement uses estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements, the reported revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period, and certain financial\nstatement disclosures in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements. Significant items subject to\nsuch estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets,\nleases, valuation allowances for inventories and deferred taxes, revenue recognized for work performed but not\ncompleted and uncertain tax positions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n7\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280):\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which will require enhanced segment disclosures. Adoption of this\naccounting standard is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The application of\nASU 2023-07 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of\noperations, or cash flows.\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic\n740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures which will require a disaggregated rate reconciliation disclosure as well\nas additional information regarding taxes paid. Adoption of this accounting standard is effective for the Company for\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard and\ndoes not anticipate that the application of ASU 2023-09 will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n2. Net Sales\nThe Company disaggregates its net sales by major source as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nProducts Services Total\nDebit and Credit $ 69,803 $ 29,952 $ 99,755\nPrepaid Debit — 25,173 25,173\nIntersegment eliminations (155) (22) (177)\nTotal $ 69,648 $ 55,103 $ 124,751\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nProducts Services Total\nDebit and Credit $ 192,635 $ 90,713 $ 283,348\nPrepaid Debit — 73,186 73,186\nIntersegment eliminations (985) (44) (1,029)\nTotal $ 191,650 $ 163,855 $ 355,505\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nProducts Services Total\nDebit and Credit $ 55,934 $ 27,846 $ 83,780\nPrepaid Debit — 22,335 22,335\nIntersegment eliminations (245) (7) (252)\nTotal $ 55,689 $ 50,174 $ 105,863\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nProducts Services Total\nDebit and Credit $ 195,967 $ 82,992 $ 278,959\nPrepaid Debit — 63,286 63,286\nIntersegment eliminations (542) (28) (570)\nTotal $ 195,425 $ 146,250 $ 341,675\nProducts Net Sales\n“Products” net sales are recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied.\nIn most instances, this occurs over time as cards are produced for specific customers and have no alternative use and the\nCompany has an enforceable right to payment for work performed. For work performed but not completed and unbilled,\nthe Company estimates revenue by taking actual costs incurred and applying historical margins for similar types of\ncontracts. Items included in “Products” net sales are the design and production of Financial Payment Cards, including\n8\ncontact-EMV®(1), contactless dual-interface EMV, contactless and magnetic stripe cards, CPI’s eco-focused solutions,\nincluding Second Wave® and Earthwise® cards made with upcycled plastic, metal cards, private label credit cards and\nretail gift cards. Card@Once® printers and consumables are also included in “Products” net sales, and their associated\nrevenues are recognized at the time of shipping. The Company includes gross shipping and handling revenue in net\nsales, and shipping and handling costs in cost of sales.\n(1) Europay, Mastercard and Visa (“EMV®”) is a global technical standard maintained by EMV Co, LLC. EMV® is a registered trademark in\nthe U.S. and other countries and an unregistered trademark elsewhere. The EMV trademark is owned by EMV Co, LLC.\nServices Net Sales\nNet sales are recognized for “Services” as the services are performed. Items included in “Services” net sales\ninclude the personalization and fulfillment of Financial Payment Cards, providing tamper-evident secure packaging and\nfulfillment services to Prepaid Debit Card program managers, and software-as-a-service personalization of instant\nissuance debit cards. As applicable, for work performed but not completed and unbilled, the Company estimates revenue\nby taking actual costs incurred and applying historical margins for similar types of contracts.\nCustomer Contracts\nThe Company often enters into Master Services Agreements (“MSAs”) with its customers. Generally,\nenforceable rights and obligations for goods and services occur only when a customer places a purchase order or\nstatement of work to obtain goods or services under an MSA. The contract term as defined by ASC 606, Revenue from\nContracts with Customers, is the length of time it takes to deliver the goods or services promised under the purchase\norder or statement of work. As such, the Company's contracts are generally short term in nature.\nCosts to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\nCosts to obtain a contract (“contract costs”) include only those costs incurred to obtain a contract that the\nCompany would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. For contracts where the term is greater than one\nyear, these costs are recorded as an asset and amortized consistent with the timing of the related revenue over the life of\nthe contract. The current portion of the asset is included in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and the\nnoncurrent portion is included in “Other assets” on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets. Contract costs\nincurred but unpaid are included in “Accrued expenses” on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nContract costs are expensed as incurred when the amortization period is one year or less.\n3. Accounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nTrade accounts receivable $ 71,670 $ 69,245\nUnbilled accounts receivable 8,157 4,725\n79,827 73,970\nLess allowance for credit losses (244) (246)\n$ 79,583 $ 73,724\n9\n4. Inventories\nInventories consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nRaw materials $ 87,942 $ 66,210\nFinished goods 7,394 7,162\nInventory reserve (3,050) (2,778)\n$ 92,286 $ 70,594\n5\n5. Plant, Equipment, Leasehold Improvements and Operating Lease Right-of-Use Assets\nPlant, equipment, leasehold improvements and operating lease right-of-use assets consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nMachinery and equipment $ 69,955 $ 67,506\nMachinery and equipment under financing leases 29,464 23,774\nFurniture, fixtures and computer equipment 632 107\nLeasehold improvements 18,586 16,335\nConstruction in progress 2,092 1,778\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 15,995 19,989\n136,724 129,489\nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization (72,651) (66,436)\n$ 64,073 $ 63,053\n6. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). In determining fair value, the\nCompany utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into\nthree broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:\n• Level 1—Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\naccessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date.\n• Level 2— Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets\nand liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be\ncorroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term for the assets or liabilities.\n• Level 3— Valuations based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the\nextent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any,\nmarket activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.\n10\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are not required to be re-measured at fair value in the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets were as follows:\nCarrying Estimated\nValue as of Fair Value as of Fair Value Measurement at September 30, 2024\nSeptember 30, September 30, (Using Fair Value Hierarchy)\n2024 2024 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nLiabilities:\n2029 Senior Notes $ 285,000 $ 300,518 $ — $ 300,518 $ —\nCarrying Estimated\nValue as of Fair Value as of Fair Value Measurement at December 31, 2023\nDecember 31, December 31, (Using Fair Value Hierarchy)\n2023 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nLiabilities:\n2026 Senior Notes $ 267,897 $ 261,834 $ — $ 261,834 $ —\nThe aggregate fair value of the Company’s 2029 Senior Notes and 2026 Senior Notes (each defined in Note 8,\n“Long-Term Debt”) was based on quoted prices for identical or similar liabilities in markets that are not active and, as a\nresult, they are classified as Level 2 inputs.\nThe carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable each\napproximate fair value due to their short-term nature.\n7. Accrued Expenses\nAccrued expenses consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nAccrued payroll and related employee expenses $ 8,993 $ 11,431\nAccrued employee performance-based incentive compensation 4,590 667\nEmployer payroll taxes 1,591 298\nAccrued rebates 3,613 2,919\nCapitalized contract costs payable 10,000 —\nAccrued interest 6,402 6,830\nCurrent operating and financing lease liabilities 8,303 7,318\nAccrued share repurchases — 733\nOther 8,615 5,607\nTotal accrued expenses $ 52,107 $ 35,803\nOther accrued expenses as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, consisted primarily of executive\nretention and severance, miscellaneous accruals for invoices not yet received, and self-insurance claims incurred but yet\nto be recorded.\n11\n8. Long-Term Debt\nAs of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, long-term debt consisted of the following:\nSe ptember 30, D ecember 31,\n2024 2023\n2029 Senior Notes $ 285,000 $ —\n2026 Senior Notes — 267,897\nUnamortized deferred financing costs (4,848) (2,900)\nTotal long-term debt 280,152 264,997\nLess current maturities — —\nLong-term debt, net of current maturities $ 280,152 $ 264,997\n2029 Senior Notes\nOn July 11, 2024 (the “Closing Date”), the Company completed a private offering by its wholly-owned\nsubsidiary, CPI CG Inc. (the “Issuer”), of $285.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.000% Senior Secured Notes\ndue 2029 (the “2029 Senior Notes”) and related guarantees at an issue price of 100%. The notes and related guarantees\nwere offered and sold in a private transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the\nSecurities Act and outside the United States to certain non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S under the\nSecurities Act.\nNet proceeds from the 2029 Senior Notes, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem the entire principal\nbalance of $267.9 million of 8.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Senior Notes”) as of the Closing Date,\nand to pay related fees, an early redemption premium of 2.156%, and other expenses. The early redemption premium\npaid is recorded in “Interest, net” on the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe 2029 Senior Notes mature on July 15, 2029. Interest is payable on the 2029 Senior Notes on January 15\nand July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2025. The 2029 Senior Notes are guaranteed by the Company and its\ndomestic subsidiaries (other than the Issuer), and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the\nguarantors, subject to customary exceptions. The Company may be required to make an offer to repurchase the 2029\nSenior Notes, upon the occurrence of certain events including a change of control or certain asset sales. The 2029 Senior\nNotes also require the Company to comply with certain covenants limiting the ability of the Company and the\nCompany’s restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock\nor certain preferred stock; create or incur liens; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; make certain\ninvestments; create restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Company or make\nother intercompany transfers; transfer or sell assets; merge or consolidate; and enter into certain transactions with\naffiliates.\n2029 ABL Revolver\nOn the Closing Date, the Company and CPI CG Inc. as borrower (the “Borrower”), entered into a credit\nagreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as lender, administrative agent and\ncollateral agent, providing for an asset-based, senior secured revolving credit facility (the “2029 ABL Revolver”) of up\nto $75.0 million (the “Maximum Revolver Amount”). The 2029 ABL Revolver is guaranteed by the Company and its\nsubsidiaries (other than certain excluded subsidiaries), and is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company,\nthe Borrower and the subsidiary guarantors, subject to customary exceptions.\nThe 2029 ABL Revolver consists of revolving loans, letters of credit and swing line loans provided by lenders,\nwith a sublimit on letters of credit outstanding at any time of $10.0 million. The 2029 ABL Revolver also includes an\nuncommitted accordion feature whereby the Borrower may increase the 2029 ABL Revolver commitment by an\naggregate amount not to exceed $25.0 million, subject to certain conditions. The 2029 ABL Revolver matures on the\nearliest to occur of July 11, 2029 and the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity of the 2029 Senior Notes.\nAs of the Closing Date, the Borrower had $4.0 million of outstanding borrowings under a prior Credit\nAgreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. entered into in March 2021 (the “2026 ABL Revolver”). The Company used\n12\ninitial borrowings under the 2029 ABL Revolver, together with cash on hand and proceeds under the notes, to repay in\nfull and terminate the 2026 ABL Revolver and to pay related fees and expenses, and will use future borrowings for\ngeneral corporate purposes.\nBorrowings under the 2029 ABL Revolver bear interest at a rate per annum that ranges based on the applicable\nterm secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus 1.50%\nto 1.75%, (subject, in each case, to a credit spread adjustment of 0.10%) based on the average daily borrowing capacity\nunder the 2029 ABL Revolver over the most recently completed month. The unused portion of the 2029 ABL Revolver\ncommitment accrues a commitment fee, which ranges from 0.375% to 0.50% per annum, based on the average daily\nexcess availability under the 2029 ABL Revolver over the immediately preceding month.\nThe 2029 ABL Revolver includes limitations on the Borrower’s ability to borrow in certain situations,\nincluding limitations based on the calculation of borrowing capacity and further limitations that are triggered if the\namount available to borrow under the ABL Revolver is less than the greater of $7.5 million and 10% of the Maximum\nRevolver Amount. The borrowing capacity represents the net availability under the ABL Revolver and is calculated as\nthe lesser of a) the total of certain eligible assets, including cash, accounts receivable and inventories, further reduced by\nstated contribution percentages and adjustments (the “Borrowing Base”) and b) the Maximum Revolver Amount. The\nBorrowing Base is further reduced by credit line reserves and letters of credit, as well as the loan ledger balance\noutstanding on the ABL Revolver. Additionally, commencing with the month immediately following a date on which\nborrowing capacity is below the greater of $7.5 million and 10% of the Maximum Revolver Amount and until such time\nthat borrowing capacity equals or exceeds the greater of $7.5 million and 10% of the Maximum Revolver Amount for 30\nconsecutive days, the Company must maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement for the\nABL Revolver) of at least 1.00 to 1.00, calculated for the trailing 12 months, in order to borrow under the ABL\nRevolver.\nThe 2029 ABL Revolver contains covenants limiting the ability of the Company, the Borrower and the\nCompany’s restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock\nor certain preferred stock; create or incur liens; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; make certain\ninvestments; create restrictions on the ability of the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to the\nCompany or make other intercompany transfers; transfer or sell assets; merge or consolidate; and enter into certain\ntransactions with affiliates, subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications as set forth in the respective\nagreements.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nCertain costs incurred with borrowings are reflected as a reduction to the long-term debt balance. These costs\nare amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the borrowing using the effective-interest rate method.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs recorded on the 2029 Senior Notes were $4.8\nmillion and are reported as a reduction to the long-term debt balance. The remaining unamortized debt issuance costs on\nthe 2029 ABL Revolver were $1.5 million and are recorded as other assets (current and long-term) on the consolidated\nbalance sheet as of September 30, 2024.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a $3.0 million loss on debt\nextinguishment relating to the unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with the redemption of the 2026\nSenior Notes and the termination of the 2026 ABL Revolver.\n9. Income Taxes\nThe Company’s effective tax rates on pre-tax income were (57.9)% and 37.7% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 24.0% and 30.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. The benefit recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the decrease in the\neffective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to increased deductibility of stock compensation\nrealized upon certain stock option exercises and restricted stock unit vesting. The effective tax rate for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 was impacted by the limitation of executive compensation deductibility related to the\nformer CEO’s retention agreement.\n13\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal\nstatutory income tax rate as follows:\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nTax at federal statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState taxes, net 5.6 5.3\nValuation allowance — (1.1)\nPermanent items (1) 2.1 6.0\nOther (2) (4.7) (0.7)\nEffective income tax rate 24.0 % 30.5 %\n(1) Includes the deductibility limitations on excess compensation.\n(2) The 2024 amount primarily relates to increased deductibility of stock compensation realized upon certain stock option exercises and\nrestricted stock unit vesting.\n10. Stockholders’ Deficit\nShare Repurchases\nOn November 2, 2023, the Company's board of directors approved a share repurchase plan authorizing the\nCompany to repurchase up to $20.0 million of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share. This\nauthorization expires on December 31, 2024.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 473,284 shares of its common\nstock at an average price of $18.16 per share, excluding commissions, or $8.6 million in aggregate, on a trade date basis.\nThis amount includes 364,848 shares purchased from a stockholder that was part of our majority stockholder group at an\naverage price of $18.09 per share, in accordance with the Stock Repurchase Agreements entered into with Tricor Pacific\nCapital Partners (Fund IV) US, LP (“Parallel49”). As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an authorized amount of\n$11.2 million remaining under the share repurchase plan.\nSecondary Offering\nOn September 30, 2024, the majority stockholder group members Tricor Pacific Capital Partners (Fund IV), LP\nand Tricor Pacific Capital Partners (Fund IV) US, LP entered into an underwriting agreement for the sale of an aggregate\nof 1,380,000 shares of CPI common stock in a public offering. In conjunction with the Company’s initial public offering\nin October 2015, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with its majority stockholder group whereby\nthe Company is required to pay expenses incurred in an offering of shares of CPI common stock by the Company’s\nmajority stockholder group other than underwriters’ fees, discounts, commissions, and certain transfer taxes.\nThe offering contemplated in the underwriting agreement closed on October 2, 2024, and total expenses to be\npaid by the Company on behalf of the majority stockholder group pursuant to the registration rights agreement for the\noffering were approximately $0.5 million. The Company did not sell any securities in the offering and did not receive\nany proceeds from the sale of the shares offered by the majority stockholder group.\n11. Earnings per Share\nBasic and diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of\ncommon shares outstanding during the period. Shares excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share\nbecause their inclusion would be anti-dilutive were 5,728 and 160,384 for the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively, and 24,298 and 210,457 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n14\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:\nTh ree Months En ded S eptember 30, N ine Months En ded S eptember 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 1,293 $ 3,857 $ 12,749 $ 21,253\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted-average common shares outstanding 11,107,126 11,432,794 11,141,264 11,418,372\nDilutive shares 765,657 395,022 715,140 443,496\nDiluted weighted-average common shares\noutstanding 11,872,783 11,827,816 11,856,404 11,861,868\nBasic earnings per share $ 0.12 $ 0.34 $ 1.14 $ 1.86\nDiluted earnings per share $ 0.11 $ 0.33 $ 1.08 $ 1.79\n12. Commitments and Contingencies\nContingencies\nIn accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrued expense when loss\ncontingencies are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts\naccrued. As a matter develops, the Company, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates on\nan ongoing basis whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable. Once the loss\ncontingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Company will establish an accrued expense and record a\ncorresponding amount of expense. The Company expenses professional fees associated with litigation claims and\nassessments as incurred. The Company is subject to routine legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. The\nCompany believes that the ultimate resolution of any such matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\nVoluntary Disclosure Program\nThe Company is subject to unclaimed or abandoned property (escheat) laws which require it to turn over to\nstate governmental authorities the property of others held by the Company that has been unclaimed for specified periods\nof time. Property subject to escheat laws generally relates to uncashed checks, trade accounts receivable credits and\nunpaid payable balances. During the second quarter of 2022, the Company received a letter from the Delaware Secretary\nof State inviting the Company to participate in the Delaware Secretary of State’s Abandoned or Unclaimed Property\nVoluntary Disclosure Agreement Program to avoid being sent an audit notice by the Delaware Department of Finance.\nOn August 31, 2022, the Company entered into Delaware’s Voluntary Disclosure Agreement Program in order to\nvoluntarily comply with Delaware’s abandoned property law in exchange for certain protections and benefits. The\nCompany intends to work in good faith to complete a review of its books and records related to unclaimed or abandoned\nproperty during the periods required under the program. Any potential loss, or range of loss, that may result from this\nmatter is not currently reasonably estimable.\n13. Stock-Based Compensation\nIn October 2015, the Company adopted the CPI Card Group Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (as amended and\nsupplemented, the “Omnibus Plan”) pursuant to which cash and equity-based incentives may be granted to participating\nemployees, advisors, and directors. Effective January 30, 2024, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to\nthe Omnibus Plan to increase the total number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock reserved and available for\nissuance thereunder by 1,000,000 shares, resulting in a total of 3,200,000 shares issuable under the Omnibus Plan. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, there were 935,337 shares of Common Stock available for grant under the Omnibus Plan.\nIn June 2023, the Company announced an award comprised of 25% nonqualified stock options and 75%\nrestricted stock units to its CEO at the time as an incentive to remain employed by the Company through February 28,\n15\n2024. The first one-third of the awards was granted in June 2023, the second one-third was granted in August 2023, and\nthe remainder was granted in November 2023. All of these awards will vest ratably over a two-year period irrespective\nof employment status with expense related to these awards to be recognized by the Company through February 28, 2024.\nAs part of the CEO’s incentive package, the requisite service and exercise periods for his awards granted in 2023 prior to\nJune 2023 were also modified with expense related to the modification being recognized in June 2023 through February\n2024.\nDuring 2024, executives receive a quarterly restricted stock unit grant comprising one-fourth of the annual\nequity-based incentive component of their total compensation. The number of shares awarded will be determined based\non a value tied to the monthly average closing price of the Company’s common stock.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were 795,128 options outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of\n$20.62. No options were granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Options have 7-year terms and are\nissued with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the grant date.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted 157,966 restricted stock units at a\nweighted average grant date fair value of $22.17, and as of September 30, 2024, there were 635,312 outstanding\nrestricted stock units at a weighted average grant date fair value of $20.82.\nIn January 2024, the Company granted 60,000 performance stock units (PSU) in connection with the\nappointment of its CEO, with a grant date fair value of $0.9 million using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The PSU\naward will vest, subject to continuous employment, in equal one-third increments upon the attainment of the rolling\nweighted average closing price of the Company’s common stock equaling or exceeding each of $35.00, $50.00, and\n$65.00, in each case, for at least 90 consecutive trading days during the five-year performance period commencing on\nthe grant date.\nAll equity awards are contingent and issued only upon approval by the compensation committee of the\nCompany’s board of directors, or as otherwise permitted under the Omnibus Plan. The Company accounts for stock-\nbased compensation pursuant to ASC 718, Share-Based Payments. All stock-based compensation is required to be\nmeasured at fair value and expensed over the requisite service period, generally defined as the applicable vesting period.\nThe Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur and reverses previously recognized expense for the unvested portion\nof the forfeited shares. Upon the exercise of stock options, shares of common stock are issued from authorized common\nshares.\n14. Segment Reporting\nThe Company has identified reportable segments that represent 10% or more of its net sales, EBITDA (as\ndefined below) or total assets, or when the Company believes information about the segment would be useful to the\nreaders of the financial statements. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer, who is\ncharged with management of the Company and is responsible for the evaluation of operating performance and decision\nmaking about the allocation of resources to operating segments based on measures, such as net sales and EBITDA.\nEBITDA is the primary measure used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment\noperating performance. As the Company uses the term, “EBITDA” is defined as income before interest expense, income\ntaxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company’s chief operating decision maker believes EBITDA is a meaningful\nmeasure and is useful as a supplement to GAAP measures as it represents a transparent view of the Company’s operating\nperformance that is unaffected by fluctuations in property, equipment and leasehold improvement additions. The\nCompany’s chief operating decision maker uses EBITDA to perform periodic reviews and comparison of operating\ntrends and to identify strategies to improve the allocation of resources amongst segments.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s reportable segments were as follows:\n• Debit and Credit\n• Prepaid Debit\n• Other\n16\nDebit and Credit Segment\nThe Debit and Credit segment primarily produces Financial Payment Cards and provides integrated card\nservices, including digital services, for card-issuing financial institutions primarily in the United States.

Many of our customers require\nus to comply with PCI Security Standards Council requirements that relate to the provision of our products and services.\nOur network of high-security production facilities allows us to optimize our solutions offerings and to serve the needs of\nour diverse customer base.\n20\nDriven by a combination of our strong relationships, quality, technology, innovation, and supply-chain\nmanagement, we believe we have strong positions in the following markets:\n• the U.S. prepaid debit market, including the largest U.S. Prepaid Debit Card program managers;\n• the U.S. small-to mid-sized financial institutions market, which includes independent community\nbanks and credit unions;\n• the U.S. large issuer market, serving some of the largest U.S. debit and credit card issuers; and\n• the U.S. fintech market, where we produce and personalize Financial Payment Cards for financial\ntechnology companies.\nOur business consists of the following reportable segments:\n• Debit and Credit, which primarily produces Financial Payment Cards and provides integrated card\nservices, including digital services, to card-issuing financial institutions primarily in the United States;\n• Prepaid Debit, which primarily provides integrated prepaid card services to Prepaid Debit Card\nprogram managers primarily in the United States; and\n• “Other,” which includes corporate expenses.\nTrends and Uncertainties That May Affect our Financial Performance\nWe experienced reduced demand from some of our customers for certain products and services during 2023 and\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024, which impacted our financial and operating results. We believe the reduced\ndemand was the result of economic and supply chain-related concerns, whereby certain customers increased their\ninventory of our products during 2022 and then focused on reducing their inventory levels in subsequent periods and\nmay continue to further reduce their inventory levels before returning to normalized purchasing behavior.\nAdditionally, liquidity concerns in the banking and financial services industry led to takeover of some banking\nand financial institutions by industry regulators during this period, which also affected demand.\nAlthough we believe the environment is improving and we experienced increased card volume sales and results\nin our Debit and Credit segment during the third quarter of 2024, we may experience reduced demand if any of the\nforegoing events continue or reoccur in the future.\n21\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents the components of our condensed consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive income for each of the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nNet sales: (1)\nProducts $ 69,648 $ 55,689 $ 13,959 25.1 % $ 191,650 $ 195,425 $ (3,775) (1.9) %\nServices 55,103 50,174 4,929 9.8 % 163,855 146,250 17,605 12.0 %\nTotal net sales 124,751 105,863 18,888 17.8 % 355,505 341,675 13,830 4.0 %\nCost of sales (1) 80,053 69,711 10,342 14.8 % 226,901 221,604 5,297 2.4 %\nGross profit 44,698 36,152 8,546 23.6 % 128,604 120,071 8,533 7.1 %\nOperating expenses 26,900 23,191 3,709 16.0 % 81,752 69,020 12,732 18.4 %\nIncome from operations 17,798 12,961 4,837 37.3 % 46,852 51,051 (4,199) (8.2) %\nOther expense, net:\nInterest, net (13,458) (6,714) (6,744) 100.4 % (26,413) (20,235) (6,178) 30.5 %\nLoss on debt\nextinguishment (2,987) (25) (2,962) * % (2,987) (243) (2,744) * %\nOther expense, net (534) (28) (506) * % (677) (2) (675) * %\nIncome before taxes 819 6,194 (5,375) (86.8) % 16,775 30,571 (13,796) (45.1) %\nIncome tax benefit (expense) 474 (2,337) 2,811 (120.3) % (4,026) (9,318) 5,292 (56.8) %\nNet income $ 1,293 $ 3,857 $ (2,564) (66.5) % $ 12,749 $ 21,253 $ (8,504) (40.0) %\nGross profit margin 35.8% 34.1% 36.2% 35.1%\n* Calculation not meaningful\n(1) For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net sales and cost of sales each include $0.2 million and $0.3 million of\nintersegment eliminations, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net sales and cost of sales each include\n$1.0 million and $0.6 million of intersegment eliminations, respectively.\nThe following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and segment results refers to the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The results of\noperations should be read in conjunction with the discussion of our segment results of operations, which provide more\ndetailed discussions concerning certain components of the condensed consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive income.\nNet Sales:\nNet sales increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increased Products net\nsales driven by higher card volumes in our Debit and Credit segment, as well as higher Services net sales in both our\nDebit and Credit and Prepaid Debit segments.\nNet sales increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher Services net sales in\nour Prepaid Debit segment and higher personalization services net sales in our Debit and Credit segment, partially offset\nby decreased Products net sales driven by lower card volumes in our Debit and Credit segment.\nGross Profit and Gross Profit Margin:\nGross profit and gross profit margin increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nprimarily due to operating leverage from sales growth described above.\n22\nOperating Expenses:\nOperating expenses increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increased\ncompensation-related expenses, including increased employee performance-based incentive compensation and executive\nseverance, partially offset by decreased impacts from an executive retention agreement entered into with our former\nCEO in 2023.\nOperating expenses increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increased\ncompensation-related expenses, including increased employee performance-based incentive compensation, stock\ncompensation, salary expense, and executive severance, partially offset by decreased impacts from an executive\nretention agreement entered into with our former CEO in 2023.\nInterest, net:\nInterest expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to payment\nof an early redemption premium of $5.8 million related to the redemption of the $267.9 million 8.625% Senior Secured\nNotes due 2026 (the “2026 Senior Notes”). Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 also\nincreased due to the impact of the higher interest rates on the $285.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.000%\nSenior Secured Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Senior Notes”) issued in July 2024 compared to the 2026 Senior Notes.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment:\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a $3.0 million loss on debt\nextinguishment relating to the unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with the redemption of the 2026\nSenior Notes and the refinancing of our ABL Revolver Credit Agreement in July 2024.\nOther Expense, net:\nOther expense, net increased for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to\nexpenses incurred related to a secondary offering of our common shares. See Note 10, “Stockholders’ Deficit” of the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements for further information.\nIncome Tax Expense:\nOur effective tax rates on pre-tax income were (57.9)% and 37.7% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 24.0% and 30.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. The benefit recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the decrease in the\neffective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to increased deductibility of stock compensation\nrealized upon certain stock option exercises and restricted stock unit vesting. The effective tax rate for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 was impacted by limitation of executive compensation deductibility related to the\nformer CEO’s retention agreement.\n23\nSegment Discussion\nDebit and Credit:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nNet sales $ 99,755 $ 83,780 $ 15,975 19.1 % $ 283,348 $ 278,959 $ 4,389 1.6 %\nGross profit $ 36,131 $ 28,381 $ 7,750 27.3 % $ 101,790 $ 99,603 $ 2,187 2.2 %\nIncome from operations $ 27,035 $ 20,791 $ 6,244 30.0 % $ 75,178 $ 75,898 $ (720) (0.9) %\nGross profit margin 36.2% 33.9% 35.9% 35.7%\nNet Sales:\nNet sales for Debit and Credit increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to\nhigher volume of contactless cards, including eco-focused cards.\nNet sales for Debit and Credit increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to\nincreased Services net sales, partially offset by a decrease in Products net sales. The increase in Services net sales was\ndriven by higher personalization and Card@Once services. The decrease in Products net sales was driven by volume\ndeclines in contact-only EMV cards, partially offset by higher volumes of contactless cards and increased Card@Once\nprinter sales.\nGross Profit and Gross Profit Margin:\nGross profit and gross profit margin for Debit and Credit increased for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, primarily due to operating leverage from sales growth described above.\nIncome from Operations:\nIncome from operations for Debit and Credit increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024,\nprimarily due to the factors discussed in “Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin” above, partially offset by increased\ncompensation-related operating expenses. Income from operations for Debit and Credit was relatively consistent for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024.\nPrepaid Debit:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nNet sales $ 25,173 $ 22,335 $ 2,838 12.7 % $ 73,186 $ 63,286 $ 9,900 15.6 %\nGross profit $ 8,567 $ 7,771 $ 796 10.2 % $ 26,814 $ 20,468 $ 6,346 31.0 %\nIncome from operations $ 7,111 $ 6,631 $ 480 7.2 % $ 22,765 $ 17,936 $ 4,829 26.9 %\nGross profit margin 34.0% 34.8% 36.6% 32.3%\nNet Sales:\nNet sales for Prepaid Debit increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to\nincreased sales to existing customers of higher-priced packaging solutions.\nGross Profit and Gross Profit Margin:\nGross profit for Prepaid Debit increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to\nhigher net sales. Gross profit margin was relatively consistent compared to the prior year period.\n24\nGross profit and gross profit margin for Prepaid Debit increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nprimarily due to higher net sales. Gross profit and gross profit margin in the prior year period were negatively impacted\nby expenses related to the implementation of a change in our production staffing model as we completed the transition of\ntemporary worker positions to permanent employee positions.\nIncome from Operations:\nIncome from operations for Prepaid Debit increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nprimarily due to the factors discussed in “Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin” above.\nOther:\nAs the Other segment is comprised entirely of corporate expenses, income from operations for Other consists of\noperating expenses shown below.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nOperating expenses $ 16,348 $ 14,461 $ 1,887 13.0 % $ 51,091 $ 42,783 $ 8,308 19.4 %\nOperating Expenses:\nOther operating expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to\nan increase in compensation-related expenses, including the factors discussed in consolidated “Operating Expenses”\nabove.\n25\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt September 30, 2024, we had $14.7 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our primary source of liquidity has\nbeen cash generated from our operating activities, which has been driven from net income and fluctuations in working\ncapital. Our working capital fluctuates primarily due to the timing of tax payments, timing of receipts from customers,\ninventory purchases, share repurchases (including the repurchase of incremental shares from Parallel49), payments of\nemployee incentive programs and interest payments on our outstanding Senior Notes, with the interest payments being\ndue in the first and third quarters of the year.\nOur ability to make investments in and grow our business, service our debt and improve our debt leverage\nratios, while maintaining strong liquidity, depends on our ability to generate excess operating cash flows through our\noperating subsidiaries. Although we can provide no assurances, we believe that our cash flows from operations,\ncombined with our current cash levels, and our senior secured revolving credit facility (the “2029 ABL Revolver”) with\navailable borrowing capacity of $72.7 million as of September 30, 2024, will be adequate to fund debt service\nrequirements and provide cash, as required, to support our ongoing operations, capital expenditures, lease obligations,\nshare repurchases and working capital needs. Our future cash flows could be impacted by a variety of factors, some of\nwhich are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in economic conditions, especially\nthose impacting our customers, and the pricing, terms and availability of goods and services that we purchase, and\nfinancings that we enter into.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to $16.7 million\nfrom $22.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to changes in working capital. Working\ncapital changes included increased inventory purchases related to the capacity reservation agreement we entered into\nwith one of our suppliers in 2022, incentives related to a customer contract entered into in the first quarter of 2024, and a\n$5.0 million payment pursuant to an agreement entered into on June 2, 2023 with the Company’s prior Chief Executive\nOfficer, who departed in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by lower employee performance-based incentive\ncompensation payments in 2024 related to 2023 performance as compared to those made in 2023 related to 2022\nperformance. Additionally, we anticipate cash flows from operating activities to be negatively impacted in the fourth\nquarter of 2024 due to incentives related to the customer contract as described above.\nFinancing\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had the following outstanding borrowings:\nSe ptember 30, D ecember 31,\n2024 2023\n(dollars in thousands)\n2029 Senior Notes $ 285,000 $ —\n2026 Senior Notes — 267,897\nUnamortized deferred financing costs (4,848) (2,900)\nTotal long-term debt $ 280,152 $ 264,997\n2029 Senior Notes\nOn July 11, 2024 (the “Closing Date”), we completed a private offering by our wholly-owned subsidiary, CPI\nCG Inc. (the “Issuer”), of $285.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 and\nrelated guarantees at an issue price of 100%. The notes and related guarantees were offered and sold in a private\ntransaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to persons reasonably\nbelieved to be qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the\nUnited States to certain non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nNet proceeds from the 2029 Senior Notes, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem the entire principal\nbalance of $267.9 million of 8.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Senior Notes”) as of the Closing Date,\nand to pay related fees, an early redemption premium of 2.156%, and other expenses. The early redemption premium\npaid is recorded in “Interest, net” on the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n26\nThe 2029 Senior Notes mature on July 15, 2029. Interest is payable on the 2029 Senior Notes on January 15\nand July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2025. The 2029 Senior Notes are guaranteed by us and our domestic\nsubsidiaries (other than the Issuer), and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the guarantors,\nsubject to customary exceptions. We may be required to make an offer to repurchase the 2029 Senior Notes, upon the\noccurrence of certain events including a change of control or certain asset sales.\n2029 ABL Revolver\nOn the Closing Date, we and CPI CG Inc. as borrower (the “Borrower”), entered into a credit agreement (the\n“ABL Credit Agreement”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as lender, administrative agent and collateral agent,\nproviding for an asset-based, senior secured revolving credit facility (the “2029 ABL Revolver”) of up to $75.0 million\n(the “Maximum Revolver Amount”). The 2029 ABL Revolver is guaranteed by us and our subsidiaries (other than\ncertain excluded subsidiaries), and is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company, the Borrower and the\nsubsidiary guarantors, subject to customary exceptions.\nThe 2029 ABL Revolver consists of revolving loans, letters of credit and swing line loans provided by lenders,\nwith a sublimit on letters of credit outstanding at any time of $10.0 million. The 2029 ABL Revolver also includes an\nuncommitted accordion feature whereby the Borrower may increase the 2029 ABL Revolver commitment by an\naggregate amount not to exceed $25.0 million, subject to certain conditions. The 2029 ABL Revolver matures on the\nearliest to occur of July 11, 2029 and the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity of the 2029 Senior Notes.\nAs of the Closing Date, we had $4.0 million of outstanding borrowings under a prior Credit Agreement with\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A. entered into in March 2021 (the “2026 ABL Revolver”). We used initial borrowings under the\n2029 ABL Revolver, together with cash on hand and proceeds under the notes, to repay in full and terminate the 2026\nABL Revolver and to pay related fees and expenses, and will use future borrowings for general corporate purposes.\nBorrowings under the 2029 ABL Revolver bear interest at a rate per annum that ranges based on the applicable\nterm secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus 1.50%\nto 1.75%, (subject, in each case, to a credit spread adjustment of 0.10%) based on the average daily borrowing capacity\nunder the 2029 ABL Revolver over the most recently completed month. The unused portion of the 2029 ABL Revolver\ncommitment accrues a commitment fee, which ranges from 0.375% to 0.50% per annum, based on the average daily\nexcess availability under the 2029 ABL Revolver over the immediately preceding month.\nThe 2029 ABL Revolver includes limitations on the Borrower’s ability to borrow in certain situations,\nincluding limitations based on the calculation of borrowing capacity and further limitations that are triggered if the\namount available to borrow under the ABL Revolver is less than the greater of $7.5 million and 10% of the Maximum\nRevolver Amount. The borrowing capacity represents the net availability under the ABL Revolver and is calculated as\nthe lesser of a) the total of certain eligible assets, including cash, accounts receivable and inventories, further reduced by\nstated contribution percentages and adjustments (“Borrowing Base”) and b) the Maximum Revolver Amount. The\nBorrowing Base is further reduced by credit line reserves, letters of credit, as well as the loan ledger balance outstanding\non the ABL Revolver. Additionally, commencing with the month immediately following a date on which borrowing\ncapacity is below the greater of $7.5 million and 10% of the Maximum Revolver Amount and until such time that\nborrowing capacity equals or exceeds the greater of $7.5 million and 10% of the Maximum Revolver Amount for 30\nconsecutive days, the Company must maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement for the\nABL Revolver) of at least 1.00 to 1.00, calculated for the trailing 12 months, in order to borrow under the ABL\nRevolver.\nCash Priorities\nCapital Expenditures\nWe primarily use cash in investing activities for capital expenditures. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, capital expenditures, including investments to support the business, such as machinery and\ninformation technology equipment, totaled $4.2 million.\nDuring 2023, we commenced work on relocating and modernizing our production facility in Indiana. We\nanticipate this project will extend into 2025. Total capital expenditures, net for this project are anticipated to increase\ncash used in investing activities and assets acquired under lease arrangements in 2025.\n27\nShare Repurchase Authorization and Activity\nOn November 2, 2023, our board of directors approved a share repurchase plan authorizing us to repurchase up\nto $20.0 million of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share. This authorization expires on December 31, 2024.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 473,284 shares of its common stock at an\naverage price of $18.16 per share, excluding commissions, or $8.6 million in aggregate, on a trade date basis. This\namount includes 364,848 shares purchased from a stockholder that was part of our majority stockholder group at an\naverage price of $18.09 per share, in accordance with the Stock Repurchase Agreements entered into with Tricor Pacific\nCapital Partners (Fund IV) US, LP (“Parallel49”).\nWe had $11.2 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization as of September 30, 2024. We may\npurchase shares through open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions, the extent and timing of\nwhich will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate\nconsiderations, as determined by us.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nOur material cash requirements include interest payments on our long-term debt, operating and finance lease\npayments, and purchase obligations to support our operations.\nDebt Service Requirements\nAs of September 30, 2024, the total projected principal and interest payments on our borrowings are $429.7\nmillion, primarily related to the 2029 Senior Notes, of which $29.2 million of interest is expected to be paid in the next\n12 months.\nThe remaining interest payments are expected to be paid over the remaining term of the 2029 Senior Notes,\nwhich mature in 2029, and the principal is due upon maturity. We have estimated our future interest payments assuming\nno additional borrowings under the 2029 ABL Revolver, no early redemptions of principal on the 2029 Senior Notes,\nand no debt issuances or renewals upon the maturity dates of our notes. However, we may borrow additional amounts\nunder the 2029 ABL Revolver, redeem principal on the 2029 Senior Notes early or refinance all or a portion of our\nborrowings in future periods.\nLeases\nWe lease equipment and real property for production and services. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements\nand Supplementary Data, Note 9, Financing and Operating Leases, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023 for details on our leasing arrangements, including future maturities of our operating lease\nliabilities.\nIn February 2024, we entered into a build-to-suit lease agreement to relocate and modernize our operations at\nour Fort Wayne, Indiana production facility, which is set to commence the later of: (i) the landlord’s delivery of\nexclusive possession of the premises and (ii) March 1, 2025. Under this lease agreement, we will pay an annual base rent\nof $0.9 million subject to an annual rent increase of 2.0%. The lease is for ten years and includes two consecutive\noptions to extend the term of the lease by five years for each such option.\nPurchase Obligations\nA purchase obligation is an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable, legally binding, and\nspecifies all significant terms. As of September 30, 2024, there have not been any material changes to the purchase\nobligations disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures in the\nfinancial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our Critical Accounting\n28\nPolicies and Estimates disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for which\nthere were no material changes as of September 30, 2024, included:\n• Revenue recognition, including estimates of work performed but not completed, and\n• Income taxes, including estimates regarding future compensation for covered individuals, valuation allowances\nand uncertain tax positions.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nNot required due to smaller reporting company status.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our controls and procedures related to our reporting and disclosure\nobligations (as defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) within the Exchange Act of 1934) as of September 30, 2024,\nwhich is the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, the Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the disclosure controls\nand procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit\nunder the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, as applicable, within the time periods\nspecified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and are designed to ensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit is accumulated and communicated to our management,\nincluding our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nthat have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n29\nPART II – Other Information\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nRefer to Note 12, “Commitments and Contingencies” of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in\nthis report for information regarding legal proceedings.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023 set forth information relating to various risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely\naffect our business, financial condition and operating results. Such risk factors continue to be relevant to an\nunderstanding of our business, financial condition and operating results. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q, there have been no material changes with respect to such risk factors.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nOn November 2, 2023, the Company's board of directors approved a share repurchase plan authorizing the\nCompany to repurchase up to $20.0 million of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share. This\nauthorization expires on December 31, 2024. Under the share repurchase plan, the Company may purchase shares\nthrough privately negotiated transactions or through open market purchases, including through plans complying with\nRule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.

These non-GAAP financial\nmeasuresareutilizedbymanagementincomparingouroperatingperformanceonaconsistentbasisbetweenfiscalperiods.Webelievethatthesefinancialmeasuresareappropriatetoenhance\nanoverallunderstandingofourunderlyingoperatingperformancetrendscomparedtohistoricalandprospectiveperiodsandourpeers.Managementalsobelieves thatthesemeasuresareuseful\nto investors in their analysis of our results of operations and provide improved comparability between fiscal periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or\nas a substitute for, financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP measures maybe differentfrom similarlytitled measures of other companies. Additional information\nrelatingtocertainfinancialmeasures,includingournon-GAAPfinancialmeasures,isavailableinourmostrecentearningsreleaseandintheappendixtothispresentation.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nEBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, all on a continuing operations basis. AdjustedEBITDA is presented on a continuing operations basis and is\ndefined as EBITDA (which represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) adjusted for litigation; impairment of intangible assets; stock-based compensation expense;\nestimated sales tax expense, restructuring and other charges; including severance and executive retention; loss on debt extinguishment; foreign currency gain or loss; litigation settlement gain;\nand other items that are unusual in nature, infrequently occurring or not considered part of our core operations, as set forth in the reconciliation. Adjusted EBITDA is intended to show our\nunleveraged, pre-tax operating results and therefore reflects our financial performance based on operational factors, excluding non-operational, unusual or non-recurring losses or gains. Adjusted\nEBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, Adjusted\nEBITDA does not reflect: (a) our capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (b) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital\nneeds; (c) the significant interest expenses or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on ourdebt; (d) tax payments that represent a reduction in cash available\nto us; (e) any cash requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; (f) the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters that we and\nthe lender under our credit agreement may not consider indicative of our ongoing operations; or (g) the impact of any discontinued operations. In particular, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA\nallows us to add back certain non-operating, unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net income, even though these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are\ndifficult to predict and can represent the effect of long-term strategies as opposed to short-term results. In addition, certainof these expenses represent the reduction of cash that could be used for\nother purposes. Adjusted EBITDA margin percentage is computed as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total net sales.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\nWe define Adjusted Free Cash Flow as cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities (continuing operations) less capital expenditures adjusted for cash received from a litigation settlement\ngain in the second quarter of 2019.We use this metric in analyzing our ability to service and repay our debt. However, this measure does not represent funds available for investment or other\ndiscretionary uses since it does not deduct cash used to service our debt, nor does it reflect the cash impacts of our discontinued operations. Adjusted Free Cash Flow should not be considered in\nisolation, or as a substitute for, cash (used in) provided by operating activities or any other measures of liquidity derived inaccordance with GAAP.\nNet Leverage Ratio\nManagement and various investors use the ratio of debt principal outstanding, plus finance lease obligations, less cash divided by Adjusted EBITDA, or “Net Leverage Ratio,” as a measure of our\nfinancial strength when making key investment decisions and evaluating us against peers.\n21"
