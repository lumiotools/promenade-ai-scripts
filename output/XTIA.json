(Nasdaq: XTIA) (\"XTI Aerospace\" or the \"Company\") today provided a business update and announced the scheduled filing of its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n[ ![XTI Aerospace Logo \\(PRNewsfoto/XTI Aerospace, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2361954/XTI_Aerospace_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2361954/XTI_Aerospace_Logo.html \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\"We are making steady progress as it relates to the development of the TriFan 600, a fixed-wing, vertical lift crossover airplane uniquely designed to meet the needs of the evolving aviation industry and its customers,\" commented Scott Pomeroy, CEO of XTI Aerospace. \"We are nearing the completion of our conceptual design review phase, which will represent a significant milestone in our journey toward commercialization. This progress underscores our commitment to thorough planning and innovation. Importantly, we anticipate transitioning into the preliminary design review stage in early 2025, where we will refine our designs and further develop our engineering solutions.\n\n\"Supporting this progress, we have successfully launched Version 1.9 of our Flight Transition Simulator (FTS). This advanced simulator is important for optimizing the transition between vertical lift and wing-borne flight, a key feature of the TriFan 600. The recent update includes One-Engine-Inop (OEI) capabilities, which enables realistic simulations of engine-out scenarios during critical flight phases. We believe such enhancements will significantly bolster the simulator's accuracy and reliability, ensuring that our future operators are well-prepared for any operational challenge.\n\n\"In addition, the Federal Aviation Administration recently published its Special Federal Aviation Regulation, establishing a regulatory framework for powered-lift operations. We believe this ruling represents a critical milestone for the aviation industry's evolution toward safer, more efficient vertical takeoff and landing operations. We look forward to the transformative impact we expect this framework will bring to urban mobility and regional transportation including the TriFan 600.\n\n\"Moreover, we have made significant strides in enhancing our leadership team. First, we formed a Corporate Advisory Board comprised of industry veterans and thought leaders, bringing on Michael Tapp as Chairman, and adding Javier de la Peña, Strategy and Operations Executive at Woven by Toyota, a Toyota Motor Corporation Group Company, as well as others to the group. These members will provide invaluable insights and guidance on the Company's growth strategy, which we expect to help us capitalize on emerging trends and opportunities in the aerospace sector. Additionally, Tobin Arthur has joined the team as Chief Strategy Officer. Tobin has a proven track record in strategic planning and business development, and is focusing on refining our strategic initiatives, expanding market reach, and fostering relationships with key stakeholders. Overall, we are very proud of the progress we have made and look forward to reporting on additional developments in the near-term.\"\n\nThe Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024, is scheduled to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023\nNote 1 - Organization and Nature of Business\nOn March 12, 2024 (the \"Closing Date\"), XTI Aerospace, Inc., the \"Company\", formerly known as Inpixon (“Legacy Inpixon”), Superfly Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware\ncorporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Legacy Inpixon (“Merger Sub”), and XTI Aircraft Company, a Delaware corporation (“Legacy XTI”), completed their previously\nannounced merger transaction pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 24, 2023 and amended on December 30, 2023 and March 12, 2024 (the\n“XTI Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Legacy XTI merged in a reverse triangular merger with Merger Sub with Legacy XTI surviving the merger as a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of the Company (the “XTI Merger”). In connection with the closing of the XTI Merger, our corporate name changed from Inpixon to “XTI Aerospace, Inc.” and the\ncombined company opened for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on March 13, 2024 under the new ticker symbol “XTIA.”\nThe Company determined the XTI Merger should be accounted for as a reverse acquisition with Legacy XTI being considered the accounting acquirer. Therefore, the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements included in this report represent a continuation of the financial statements of Legacy XTI and the results of operations of the\naccounting acquired entity, Legacy Inpixon, are included in the condensed consolidated financial statements as of the Closing Date and through the September 30, 2024\nreporting date.\nFollowing the closing of the XTI Merger, the Company is primarily an aircraft development company. The Company also provides real-time location systems (“RTLS”) for the\nindustrial sector, which was Legacy Inpixon's focus prior to the closing of the XTI Merger. Headquartered in Englewood, Colorado, the Company is developing a vertical\ntakeoff and landing (\"VTOL\") aircraft that is designed to take off and land like a helicopter and cruise like a fixed-wing business aircraft. Since 2013, the Company has been\nengaged primarily in developing the design and engineering concepts for the TriFan 600, building and testing a two-thirds scale unmanned version of the TriFan 600,\ngenerating pre-orders for the TriFan 600, and seeking funds from investors to enable the Company to build full-scale piloted prototypes of the TriFan 600, and to eventually\nengage in commercial production and sale of TriFan 600.\nOur RTLS solution leverages cutting-edge technologies such as IoT, AI, and big data analytics to provide real-time tracking and monitoring of assets, machines, and people\nwithin industrial environments. With our RTLS, businesses can achieve improved operational efficiency, enhanced safety and reduced costs. By having real-time visibility into\noperations, industrial organizations can make informed, data-driven decisions, minimize downtime, and ensure compliance with industry regulations.\nNote 2 - Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in\nthe United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Accordingly, they\ndo not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal\nrecurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Interim results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily\nindicative of the results for the full year ending December 31, 2024. These interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with\nLegacy Inpixon's audited financial statements and notes for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included in the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024. These interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should also be read in conjunction with Legacy\nXTI's audited financial statements and notes for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included in the Form 8-K/A filed with the SEC on May 28, 2024.\n9\nTable of Contents\nXTI AEROSPACE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023\nNote 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe Company's complete accounting policies are described in Note 2 to Legacy Inpixon's audited consolidated financial statements and notes for the year ended December 31,\n2023, except for Legacy XTI's accounting policies which have been incorporated into this Note 3.\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company has a working capital deficit of approximately $11.9 million, and cash of approximately $0.5 million. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of approximately $21.7 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used approximately $14.3\nmillion of cash for operating activities.\nThere can be no assurances that the Company will ever earn revenues sufficient to support its operations, or that it will ever be profitable. In order to continue its operations, the\nCompany has supplemented the revenues it earned with proceeds from the sale of its equity and debt securities and proceeds from loans and bank credit lines.\nThe Company's recurring losses and utilization of cash in its operations are indicators of going concern. The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will continue as a going\nconcern for the next twelve months from the date the financial statements are issued. Management’s plans and assessment of the probability that such plans will mitigate and\nalleviate any substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company's ability to obtain additional equity or debt\nfinancing, and attain further operating efficiency, which is uncertain, which together represent the principal conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue\nas a going concern. The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 do not include\nany adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nConsolidations\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the accounting records of Legacy XTI and as of March 12, 2024 and forward (the effective date of the XTI\nMerger) the accounting records of XTI Aerospace, Inc. (formerly known as Inpixon), Inpixon GmbH (formerly known as Nanotron Technologies GmbH), Inpixon Holding UK\nLimited, and Intranav GmbH. All material inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each of the\nreporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s significant estimates consist of:\n• the valuation of stock-based compensation;\n• the valuation of the Company’s common stock issued and assets acquired in transactions, including acquisitions;\n• the valuation of equity securities;\n• the valuation of notes receivable;\n• the valuation of warrant liabilities and assets;\n• the valuation of convertible notes, at fair value;\n• the valuation of loan conversion derivatives; and\n• the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.\n10\nTable of Contents\nXTI AEROSPACE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash consists primarily of demand deposit bank accounts, which, from time to time, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company considers all highly liquid investments\nwith an original maturity from date of purchase of three months or less, or that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash, to be cash equivalents.\nCredit Risk and Concentrations\nFinancial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents. The Company performs certain\ncredit evaluation procedures and does not require collateral for financial instruments subject to credit risk. The Company believes that credit risk is limited because the\nCompany routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and, based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of its customers, establishes an allowance for credit\nlosses.\nThe customers who account for 10% or more of the Company's revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 10% or more of the Company's outstanding\nreceivable balance as of September 30, 2024 are presented as follows:\nPercentage of accounts\nPercentage of revenues receivable\nFor the Three Months For the Nine Months Ended\nCustomer Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 As of September 30, 2024\nA 25% 23% **\nB ** 17% **\nC 25% 16% 29%\nD 13% 12% 10%\nE ** ** 10%\nF ** ** 24%\n**Represents less than 10% of the total for the respective period\nThe Company did not have revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, “Business\nCombinations” using the acquisition method of accounting, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their fair values at the date of\nacquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value is recorded as goodwill. All acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development (“IPR&D”)\nIn accordance with authoritative guidance, the Company recognizes IPR&D at fair value as of the acquisition date, and subsequently accounts for it as an indefinite-lived\nintangible asset until completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. Once an IPR&D project has been completed, the useful life of the IPR&D\nasset is determined and amortized accordingly. If the IPR&D asset is abandoned, the remaining carrying value is written off. During fiscal year 2024, the Company acquired\nIPR&D through the XTI Merger.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\nIntangible assets primarily consist of developed technology, patents, customer relationships, and trade names/trademarks. They are amortized ratably over a range of 5 to 15\nyears, which approximates customer attrition rate and technology obsolescence.\nThe Company tests goodwill for potential impairment at least annually as of October 1, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be\nimpaired. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount and the Company recognizes an impairment charge, if\nany, for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.\nBased on its assessments, the Company does not believe it has a goodwill impairment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets, inclusive of its right-of-use assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an\nasset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows\nexpected to be generated from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an\nimpairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company determined none of its long-lived assets were impaired.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), the Company recognizes revenue when the customer obtains control of promised\ngoods, in an amount that reflects the consideration that it expects to receive in exchange for those goods. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company\ndetermines are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations\nin the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration, if any, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and\n(v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that it will\ncollect the consideration to which it is entitled in exchange for the goods it transfers to a customer.\n12\nTable of Contents\nXTI AEROSPACE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023\nHardware and Software Revenue Recognition\nFor sales of hardware and software products, the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time when they are shipped to the customer, at which control is\ndeemed transferred to the customer, and has title of the product and holds the risks and rewards of ownership.\nThe Company leverages drop-ship arrangements with many of its vendors and suppliers to deliver products to customers without having to physically hold the inventory at its\nwarehouse. In such arrangements, the Company negotiates the sale price with the customer, pays the supplier directly for the product shipped, bears credit risk of collecting\npayment from its customers and is ultimately responsible for the acceptability of the product and ensuring that such product meets the standards and requirements of the\ncustomer. Accordingly, the Company concluded it is the principal in the transaction with the customer and records revenue on a gross basis. The Company receives fixed\nconsideration for sales of hardware and software products. The Company’s customers generally pay within 30 to 60 days from the receipt of a customer approved invoice. The\nCompany has elected the practical expedient to expense the costs of obtaining a contract when they are incurred because the amortization period of the asset that otherwise\nwould have been recognized is less than a year.\nSoftware As A Service Revenue Recognition\nWith respect to sales of the Company’s maintenance, consulting and other service agreements, customers pay fixed monthly fees in exchange for the Company’s service. The\nCompany’s performance obligation is satisfied over time as the digital advertising and electronic services are provided continuously throughout the service period. The\nCompany recognizes revenue evenly over the service period using a time-based measure because the Company is providing continuous access to its service.\nProfessional Services Revenue Recognition\nThe Company’s professional services include milestone, fixed fee and time and materials contracts.\nProfessional services under milestone contracts are accounted for using the percentage of completion method. As soon as the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably,\ncontract revenue is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract. Contract costs are expensed as incurred.\nContract costs include all amounts that relate directly to the specific contract, are attributable to contract activity, and are specifically chargeable to the customer under the terms\nof the contract.\nProfessional services are also contracted on the fixed fee and time and materials basis. Fixed fees are paid monthly, in phases, or upon acceptance of deliverables. The\nCompany’s time and materials contracts are paid weekly or monthly based on hours worked. Revenue on time and material contracts is recognized based on a fixed hourly rate\nas direct labor hours are expended. Materials, or other specified direct costs, are reimbursed as actual costs and may include markup. The Company has elected the practical\nexpedient to recognize revenue for the right to invoice because the Company’s right to consideration corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the performance\ncompleted to date. For fixed fee contracts including maintenance service provided by in house personnel, the Company recognizes revenue evenly over the service period using\na time-based measure because the Company is providing continuous service. Because the Company’s contracts have an expected duration of one year or less, the Company has\nelected the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14(a) to not disclose information about its remaining performance obligations. Anticipated losses are recognized as soon as\nthey become known. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not incur any such losses. These amounts are based on known and estimated\nfactors.\nLicense Revenue Recognition\nThe Company enters into contracts with its customers whereby it grants a non-exclusive on-premise license for the use of its proprietary software. The contracts provide for a\nstated term with a one year or multiple year renewal option. The contracts may also provide for yearly on-going maintenance services for a specified price, which includes\nmaintenance services, designated support, and enhancements, upgrades and improvements to the software (the “Maintenance Services”), depending on the contract. Licenses\nfor on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. All software provides customers with the same\nfunctionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software.\n13\nTable of Contents\nXTI AEROSPACE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023\nThe timing of the Company's revenue recognition related to the licensing revenue stream is dependent on whether the software licensing agreement entered into represents a\ngood or service. Software that relies on an entity’s IP and is delivered only through a hosting arrangement, where the customer cannot take possession of the software, is a\nservice. A software arrangement that is provided through an access code or key represents the transfer of a good. Licenses for on-premises software represents a good and\nprovide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses,\nwhich provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises\nlicenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer.\nRenewals or extensions of licenses are evaluated as distinct licenses (i.e., a distinct good or service), and revenue attributed to the distinct good or service cannot be recognized\nuntil (1) the entity provides the distinct license (or makes the license available) to the customer and (2) the customer is able to use and benefit from the distinct license. Renewal\ncontracts are not combined with original contracts, and, as a result, the renewal right is evaluated in the same manner as all other additional rights granted after the initial\ncontract. The revenue is not recognized until the customer can begin to use and benefit from the license, which is typically at the beginning of the license renewal period.\nTherefore, the Company recognizes revenue resulting from renewal of licensed software at a point in time, specifically, at the beginning of the license renewal period.\nThe Company recognizes revenue related to Maintenance Services evenly over the service period using a time-based measure because the Company is providing continuous\nservice and the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company’s performance as the services are performed.\nContract Balances\nThe timing of the Company’s revenue recognition may differ from the timing of payment by its customers. The Company records a receivable when revenue is recognized prior\nto payment and the Company has an unconditional right to payment. Alternatively, when payment precedes the provision of the related services, the Company records deferred\nrevenue until the performance obligations are satisfied, principally within one year.\nCustomer Deposits\nThe Company periodically enters into aircraft reservation agreements that include a deposit placed by a potential customer. The deposits serve to prioritize orders when the\naircraft becomes available for delivery. Customers making deposits are not obligated to purchase aircraft until they execute a definitive purchase agreement. Customers may\nrequest return of their deposit any time up until the execution of a purchase agreement. The Company records such advance deposits as a liability and defers the related revenue\nrecognition until delivery of an aircraft occurs, if any.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company’s stock-based compensation relates to stock options granted to employees and non-employees. The Company recognizes the cost of share-based awards granted\nto employees and non-employees based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the awards. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur, which may result in negative expense\nwhen forfeitures exceed the expense recorded within the period.\nThe Company recognizes expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally equal to the vesting period of the award.\nThe Company estimates the grant-date fair value of the stock option awards with service only vesting conditions using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model utilizes inputs and assumptions which involve inherent uncertainties and generally require significant judgment. As a result, if factors\nor expected outcomes change and significantly different assumptions or estimates are used, the Company’s stock-based compensation could be materially different. Significant\ninputs and assumptions include:\nFair value of Common Stock – As there was no public market for Legacy XTI’s common stock prior to the XTI Merger, the fair value of the shares of common stock\nunderlying the stock-based awards on the grant-date has historically been\n14\nTable of Contents\nXTI AEROSPACE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023\ndetermined by Legacy XTI’s Board of Directors with assistance of third-party valuation specialists. Legacy XTI's Board of Directors exercised reasonable judgment and\nconsidered a number of objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair market value, which included important developments in Legacy\nXTI’s operations, actual operating results, financial performance, external market conditions, equity market conditions of comparable public companies, and the lack of\nmarketability of Legacy XTI’s common stock.\nExpected Term – The Company’s expected term represents the period that the Company’s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using\nthe simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term).\nExpected Volatility – Because Legacy XTI was privately held prior to the XTI Merger and did not have an active trading market for its common stock, the expected\nvolatility was estimated based on the average volatility for publicly traded companies that the Company considers to be comparable, over a period equal to the expected\nterm of the stock option grants.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate – The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the\nexpected term of option.\nExpected Dividend – The Company has never paid dividends on its common stock and has no plans to pay dividends on its common stock. Therefore, the Company\nused an expected dividend yield of zero.\nNet Loss Per Share\nNet loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed using the two-class method required for multiple classes of common stock and participating securities. The\nCompany’s participating securities included the Company’s convertible preferred stock and preferred stock. Neither the holders of convertible preferred stock, preferred stock\nnor the holders of the Company’s common stock warrants have a contractual obligation to share in losses.\nBasic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net loss, as adjusted for any dividends on the preferred stock for the period,\nattributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, adjusted for outstanding shares that are subject\nto repurchase or outstanding shares that are contingently returnable by the holder. Contingently issuable shares, including shares that are issuable for little or no cash\nconsideration, are considered outstanding common shares and included in net loss per share as of the date that all necessary conditions have been satisfied. Such shares include\noutstanding penny warrants and shares issuable to Xeriant Inc. (\"Xeriant\") related to the the joint venture arrangement that expired on May 31, 2023.\nDiluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method\nbased on the nature of such securities. For periods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same\nas basic net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders, because potentially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-\ndilutive.\nSegments\nThe Company and its Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"), acting as the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") determined its operating segments in accordance with ASC\n280, \"Segment Reporting\" (\"ASC 280\"). The Company is organized and operates as two business segments based on similar economic characteristics, the nature of products\nand production processes, end-use markets, channels of distribution, and regulatory environments.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn July 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-03, \"Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205), Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220),\nDistinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), Equity (Topic 505), and Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)\", which updates codification on how an entity\nwould apply the scope guidance in paragraph 718-10-15-3 to determine whether profits interest and similar awards should be accounted for in accordance with Topic 718,\nCompensation—Stock Compensation.

The Company derives revenue from software as a service, design and implementation services for its Indoor\nIntelligence systems, and professional services for work performed in conjunction with its systems recognition policy. Revenues consisted of the following (in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRecurring revenue\nSoftware $ 327 $ — $ 697 $ —\nTotal recurring revenue $ 327 $ — $ 697 $ —\nNon-recurring revenue\nHardware $ 422 $ — $ 1,190 $ —\nSoftware 77 — 82 —\nProfessional services 92 — 200 —\nTotal non-recurring revenue $ 591 $ — $ 1,472 $ —\nTotal Revenue $ 918 $ — $ 2,169 $ —\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue recognized at a point in time\nIndustrial IoT (1) $ 499 $ — $ 1,272 $ —\nTotal $ 499 $ — $ 1,272 $ —\nRevenue recognized over time\nIndustrial IoT (2) (3) $ 419 $ — $ 897 $ —\nTotal $ 419 $ — $ 897 $ —\nTotal Revenue $ 918 $ — $ 2,169 $ —\n(1) Hardware and Software's performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time when they are shipped to the customer.\n(2) Professional services are also contracted on the fixed fee and time and materials basis.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023\nDeferred revenue\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any deferred revenue. As part of the XTI Merger, the Company acquired approximately $0.8 million of deferred revenue,\nall of which relates to RTLS maintenance agreements.\nThe Company's deferred revenue balance of $0.5 million as of September 30, 2024 related to cash received in advance for product maintenance services and professional\nservices provided by the Company’s technical staff. The fair value of the deferred revenue approximates the services to be rendered. The Company expects to satisfy its\nremaining performance obligations for these maintenance services and professional services, and recognize the deferred revenue and related contract costs over the next twelve\nmonths.\nNote 5 – Merger Transaction\nThe XTI Merger was accounted for as a reverse merger in accordance with GAAP. Under this method of accounting, Legacy Inpixon was treated as the \"acquired\" company for\nfinancial reporting purposes. This determination is primarily based on the fact that subsequent to the XTI Merger, Legacy XTI maintains control of the Board of Directors and\nmanagement of the Company, and the preexisting shareholders of Legacy XTI have majority voting rights of the Company. For accounting purposes, the acquirer is the entity\nthat has obtained control of another entity and, thus, consummated a business combination. Accordingly, Legacy XTI’s assets and liabilities are recorded at carrying value and\nthe assets and liabilities associated with Legacy Inpixon are recorded at estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair\nvalue of the net assets acquired, if applicable, is recognized as goodwill.\nThe below summarizes the total consideration transferred in the business combination (in thousands):\nFair value of common stock $ 10,939\nFair value of warrants 3,250\nFair value of preferred stock 11,302\nFair value of debt assumed 114\nTotal consideration $ 25,605\nThe Company determined the estimated fair value of common stock included in consideration to be calculated based on Legacy Inpixon’s common stock outstanding of\n2,075,743 multiplied by the price of Legacy Inpixon’s common stock on March 12, 2024 of $5.27 (which reflects the 1 to 100 reverse stock split which became effective before\nthe closing of the XTI Merger). The Company utilized Legacy Inpixon's common stock price in determining fair value as it is more reliably measurable than the value of\nLegacy XTI’s (accounting acquirer) equity interests given it is not a publicly traded entity.\nThe aggregate fair value of warrants was approximately $3.3 million was included in the total equity consideration. A portion of this total represents 918,689 warrants\noutstanding by the Company with a fair value of $1.00 per warrant, which is the warrant's redemption value. The warrant fair value was determined to be the redemption value\nas the warrants include protective covenants for the Company which prevent the holder from exercising the warrants. The remainder of this total represents 491,310 warrants\nwith a fair value of $4.75 per warrant which was determined by using level 3 inputs and utilizing a Black-Scholes valuation. Significant inputs related to these warrants are as\nfollows:\nFair value of common stock $ 5.27\nExercise price $ 5.13\nExpected term 4.76 years\nVolatility 146 %\nRisk-free interest rate 4.2 %\nDividend yield — %\nThe fair value of preferred stock of approximately $11.3 million included in the total equity consideration represents 11,302 shares of a new series of Preferred Stock that was\nissued and outstanding by the Company upon the consummation of the XTI Merger at a stated value and fair value of $1,000 per share.\n19\nTable of Contents\nXTI AEROSPACE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023\nThe Company has determined preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the XTI Merger. These values are subject to change as the Company\nperforms additional reviews of its assumptions utilized. The Company has made a provisional allocation of the purchase price of the XTI Merger to the assets acquired and the\nliabilities assumed as of the purchase date. The following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocations relating to the XTI Merger (in thousands):\nAssets acquired\nCash and cash equivalents $ 2,968\nAccounts receivable 696\nNotes and other receivables 7,929\nInventory 3,283\nPrepaid assets and other current assets 756\nProperty and equipment 246\nOther assets 1,202\nWarrant assets 448\nTradename & trademarks 913\nProprietary technology 2,934\nCustomer relationships 702\nIn process research and development 243\nGoodwill 12,398\n34,718\nLiabilities assumed\nAccounts payable 2,675\nAccrued liabilities 4,282\nOperating lease obligation 299\nDeferred revenue 824\nShort-term debt 114\nWarrant liability 919\nTotal liabilities assumed 9,113\nEstimated fair value of assets acquired $ 25,605\nThe assets were valued using a combination of a multi-period excess earnings methodologies, a relief from royalty approach, a discounted cash flow approach and present value\nof cash flows approach. The goodwill represents the excess fair value after the allocation of intangibles. As a nontaxable transaction, the historical tax bases of the acquired\nassets, liabilities and tax attributes have carried over. Although no new tax goodwill has been created in the transaction, the Company has approximately $5.8 million of tax\ndeductible goodwill that arose in previous transactions which carries over.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred merger related transaction costs of approximately $6.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively.\nNote 6 - Proforma Financial Information\nInpixon Financial Information\nThe following unaudited proforma financial information presents the consolidated results of operations of the Company and Legacy Inpixon for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, as if the acquisition had occurred as of the beginning\n20\nTable of Contents\nXTI AEROSPACE, INC.

Maxim is entitled\nto compensation at a fixed commission rate of 3.0% of the gross sales price per Share sold excluding Maxim's costs and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with its\nservices, including the fees and out-of-pocket expenses of its legal counsel.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 3,190,727 shares of common stock under the Equity Distribution Agreement at per share prices between\napproximately $0.19 and $0.43, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $1.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold\n12,490,930 shares of common stock under the Equity Distribution Agreement at per share prices between approximately $0.19 and $1.35, resulting in net proceeds to the\nCompany of approximately $9.6 million.\nSince the date of the Equity Distribution Agreement through the date of this report, the Company sold 101,704,300 shares of common stock at per share prices between\napproximately $0.06 and $1.86 under the Equity Distribution Agreement, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $45.2 million. As of the date of this report, there was\napproximately $38.6 million in common stock gross sales remaining under the Equity Distribution Agreement, subject to the limitations set forth in the Series 9 ATM Consent\n(as defined below).\nIn connection with the Amendment and in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation of Preferences and Rights of the Company's Series 9 Preferred Stock (the\n\"Certificate of Designation\"), on June 14, 2024, the Company obtained a written consent (the \"Series 9 ATM Consent\") from the Required Holders (as defined below).

Immediately prior to the conversion, the convertible notes, at fair value were marked to market resulting in a gain of\n$12.9 million, which is included in change in fair value of convertible notes in the other income and expense section of the condensed consolidated statement of operations. As\na result of the conversions, the notes were satisfied in full and therefore relieved the Company of all obligations.\nNote Inducements\nTo induce certain note holders to convert their outstanding note balances into shares of Legacy XTI common stock ahead of the XTI Merger, Legacy XTI entered into voluntary\nnote conversion letter agreements in February 2024 as detailed in the below table. Per the letter agreements, some or all of the outstanding principal and accrued interest under\nthe notes was converted at a reduced conversion price into shares of Legacy XTI common stock immediately prior to the XTI Merger closing time, which converted into shares\nof the Company's common stock upon the closing of the XTI Merger. In connection with some of the voluntary note conversions, the Company assumed a repayment obligation\nwith respect to any outstanding balance under the notes that was not converted into Legacy XTI shares. The Company accounted for these conversions as an inducement and\nrecognized a loss related to the fair value of the additional shares issued compared to the original terms of the convertible note, which is included in inducement loss on debt\nconversions in the other income and expense section of the condensed consolidated statement of operations.

Per the letter agreement, $0.9 million of the outstanding note balance was converted at\na reduced conversion price of $0.309 into shares of Legacy XTI common stock immediately prior to the XTI Merger closing time equal to 266,272 shares of the Company's\ncommon stock, and the Company assumed the obligation to pay the note holder $0.2 million of the note balance that was not converted into Legacy XTI shares. This repayment\nobligation was subsequently paid in full on April 1, 2024. The Company accounted for this conversion as an inducement and recognized an inducement charge of $1.0 million\nrelated to the fair value of the additional shares issued compared to the original terms of the convertible note. As this note holder is a related party of the Company, the\nCompany accounted for the conversion as a capital transaction and therefore recorded the inducement charge within additional paid in capital.\nShare Issuances At or Immediately Prior to XTI Merger Closing\n27\nTable of Contents\nXTI AEROSPACE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023\nAt the closing of the XTI Merger, 2,075,743 shares of the Company's common stock were issued to Legacy Inpixon’s preexisting shareholders as consideration for the\ntransaction.\nShares of Legacy XTI common stock were issued to Xeriant immediately prior to the XTI Merger closing time, equal to 298,395 post merger shares of Company common\nstock. This share issuance to Xeriant fully settled the obligation relating to a joint venture arrangement by and between Legacy XTI and Xeriant which terminated by its terms\non May 31, 2023. The obligation to issue shares to Xeriant was classified in equity as of December 31, 2023, as the share consideration became fixed once the joint venture\nterminated.\nOther Share Issuances\nOn June 6, 2024, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with a third party consultant, which has a term until December 10, 2024, pursuant to which the Company\nmade a cash deposit of $0.1 million and issued 309,483 shares of restricted common stock valued at approximately $0.3 million to the consultant as a prepayment for marketing\nand distribution services agreed to be rendered to the Company over the six-month contract period.\nOn June 7, 2024, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with a separate third party consultant, which has a term of six months, pursuant to which the Company\nissued 120,000 shares of restricted common stock valued at approximately $0.1 million to the consultant as a prepayment for business development consulting services agreed\nto be rendered to the Company over the six-month contract period.\nOn June 13, 2024 and July 5, 2024, the Company issued 2,680,459 shares valued at $1.2 million and 2,774,883 shares valued at $1.1 million, respectively, of fully vested\nrestricted stock to Nadir Ali, a consultant, under the Company’s 2018 Employee Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, as payment of accrued consulting fees in accordance with\nthe terms of a consulting agreement, dated March 12, 2024, by and between the Company and Mr. Ali.\nOn July 31, 2024, the Company entered into an advisory agreement with a third party advisor, pursuant to which the Company issued 1,000,000 shares valued at $0.3 million of\nrestricted common stock to the advisor in consideration for financial advisory and business development services agreed to be rendered to the Company pursuant to the\nagreement.\nNote 11 - Preferred Stock\nThe Company is authorized to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share with rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions as to be\ndetermined by the Company’s Board of Directors.\nSeries 9 Preferred Stock\nOn March 12, 2024, the Company filed the Certificate of Designations of Preferences and Rights of Series 9 Preferred Stock (the “Certificate of Designation”), with the\nSecretary of State of Nevada, designating 20,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 of the Company, as Series 9 Preferred Stock, which was amended by the\nCertificate of Amendment to Designations of Preferences and Rights of Series 9 Preferred Stock filed by the Company with the Secretary of State of Nevada on April 30, 2024.\nEach share of Series 9 Preferred Stock has a stated face value of $1,050 (“Stated Value”) and do not have any voting rights.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023\nExchange Agreement\nOn March 12, 2024, Inpixon and Streeterville Capital, LLC (the “Note Holder” or “Streeterville”), the holder of an outstanding promissory note issued on December 30, 2023\n(as amended, the “December 2023 Note”), entered into an Exchange Agreement, pursuant to which the Note Holder exchanged the remaining balance of principal and accrued\ninterest under the December 2023 Note in the aggregate amount of approximately $9.8 million for 9,802 shares of Series 9 Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”), based on an\nexchange price of $1,000 per share of Series 9 Preferred Stock. The Company analyzed the exchange of the principal and interest as an extinguishment and compared the net\ncarrying value of the debt being extinguished to the reacquisition price (shares of preferred stock being issued). The Company notes that the net carrying value of the debt was\nthe fair value of the preferred stock (reacquisition price). As such, no gain or loss was recognized upon debt extinguishment. Following such exchange and the extinguishment\nof the December 2023 Note, the December 2023 Note is deemed paid in full, automatically canceled, and will not be reissued.\nSecurities Purchase Agreement\nOn March 12, 2024, Legacy Inpixon entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with 3AM Investments, LLC (\"3AM\"), an entity\ncontrolled by Legacy Inpixon’s former director and former Chief Executive Officer, Nadir Ali (such entity, the \"Purchaser\"). Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the\nPurchaser purchased 1,500 shares of Series 9 Preferred Stock for a total purchase price of approximately $1.5 million, based on a purchase price of $1,000 per share of Series 9\nPreferred Stock. The Company agreed that the Purchaser will be deemed a “Required Holder” as defined in the Certificate of Designation as long as the Purchaser holds any\nshares of Series 9 Preferred Stock.\nThe Securities Purchase Agreement sets forth certain restrictions on the Company’s use of the proceeds from the sale of the Series 9 Preferred Stock pursuant thereto, including\nthat the proceeds must be used in connection with the redemption of the Series 9 Preferred Stock pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or working capital purposes, and\nmay not, without the consent of the required holders of Series 9 Preferred Stock, be used for, among other things, (i) the redemption of any XTIA common stock or common\nstock equivalents, (ii) the settlement of any outstanding litigation, or (iii) for the repayment of debt for borrowed money to any officer or director, or Merger-transaction related\nbonuses to any employee or vendor except for such\nnon-merger transaction related bonuses as may be payable to participants pursuant to the Company’s existing employee bonus plan.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Preferred Stock, the direct and incremental expenses incurred were immaterial.\nAmendment to Series 9 Preferred Stock\nThe Certificate of Amendment to Designations of Preferences and Rights of Series 9 Preferred Stock (the “Certificate of Amendment”) allows the Company to pay the holders\nof Series 9 Preferred Stock, if such holders agree, with securities or other property of the Company in an amount equal to the Series 9 Preferred Liquidation Amount (as defined\nin the Series 9 Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation) in the event the Company elects to redeem all of any portion of the Series 9 Preferred Stock then issued and\noutstanding (a “Corporation Optional Redemption”). Previously, the Company was to pay any such amount in only cash. The Certificate of Amendment also now provides that\nthe Company will provide notice of a Corporation Optional Redemption to the holders of Series 9 Preferred Stock within five business days prior to the consummation of such\nredemption rather than five business days following the determination of the Company’s board of directors to consummate such redemption. In addition, the Certificate of\nAmendment eliminates the requirement for the Company to obtain the written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Series 9 Preferred Stock before\nrepaying any outstanding indebtedness owed to any holder of Series 9 Preferred Stock or its affiliates. The Company evaluated the amendment and accounted for it as a\nmodification, which requires the Company to recognize any increase in fair value as an expense. However, the Company concluded the increase in the fair value of the Series 9\nPreferred Stock from immediately before to immediately after the amendment is immaterial.\nSeries 9 Preferred Stock Exchanges\nFrom April through September 2024, the Company entered into exchange agreements with the holder of shares of the Company’s Series 9 Preferred Stock pursuant to which\nthe Company and the holder agreed to exchange 4,625 shares of Series 9 Preferred Stock with an aggregate stated value of $4,856,250 (the “Preferred Shares”) for 7,196,000\nshares of common stock (the “Preferred Exchange Shares”) at an effective price per share ranging from $0.2085 to $2.96.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023\nPreferred Exchange Shares to the holder, at which time the Preferred Shares were cancelled. The Preferred Exchange Shares were issued in reliance on the exemption from\nregistration provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, on the basis that (a) the Preferred Exchange Shares were issued in exchange for other outstanding securities of the\nCompany, (b) there was no additional consideration delivered by the holder in connection with the exchange and (c) there were no commissions or other remuneration paid by\nthe Company in connection with the exchange. The Company notes that the redemption of the Preferred Shares to Common Stock was accounted for as an extinguishment.\nDuring the three and nine months ending September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a deemed dividend of $53,750 and $230,730, respectively. The deemed dividends\nrepresented the excess fair value of the common shares issued over the carrying amount of the Preferred Shares and were accounted for as a reduction to additional paid-in\ncapital.\nNote 12 - Stock Award Plans and Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Company has three Employee Stock Incentive plans. The Company assumed Legacy XTI's 2017 Employee and Consultant Stock Ownership Plan (the \"2017 Plan\") in\nconnection with the XTI Merger. Legacy Inpixon had put in place a 2011 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the \"2011 Plan\") and a 2018 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the\n\"2018 Plan\" and together with the 2011 Plan, the \"Legacy Inpixon Option Plans\"). The Company determined that activity within the 2011 Plan is not material.\n2017 Plan\nDuring 2017, Legacy XTI adopted the 2017 Plan, which was amended in 2021 to increase the maximum shares eligible to be granted under the 2017 Plan. The Company may\nissue awards in the form of restricted stock units and stock options to employees, directors, and consultants. Under the 2017 Plan, stock options are generally granted with an\nexercise price equal to the estimated fair value of the Company’s common stock, as determined by the Company’s Board of Directors on the date of grant.

As the reduction in exercise price was part of the\nconsideration for the XTI Merger, the Company accounted for the modification as part of its purchase accounting.\nWarrant Exercises\nOn March 11, 2024, Legacy XTI entered into an amendment (the “Warrant Amendment”) with Mesa Airlines (\"Mesa\"). The Warrant Amendment modifies the vesting criteria\nwith respect to the shares of common stock underlying the warrant issued by the Company to Mesa pursuant to the conditional aircraft purchase contract described below. As\namended by the Warrant Amendment, (i) one-third of the shares represented by the warrant vested upon the execution and delivery of the conditional aircraft purchase contract,\ndated February 2, 2022, by and between the Company and Mesa, relating to the purchase of 100 TriFan 600 aircraft, (ii) one-sixth of the shares vested on March 12, 2024 in\nwhich the Company recorded $0.5 million of stock-based compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, (iii) one-sixth of unvested shares lapsed on\nMarch 12, 2024, and (iv) one-third or 189,156 shares will vest upon the acceptance of delivery and final purchase of the first TriFan 600 aircraft by Mesa pursuant to the\nAircraft Purchase Agreement. On March 12, 2024 and per a warrant exercise letter agreement, all vested warrant shares were net exercised into shares of Legacy XTI common\nstock immediately prior to the XTI Merger closing time, which resulted in the issuance of 283,737 shares of the Company's common stock in accordance with the exchange\nratio pursuant to the XTI Merger Agreement.\nTo induce warrant holders to exercise warrant shares, Legacy XTI entered into exercise letter agreements with several warrant holders in February 2024 at reduced exercise\nprices from the original warrant agreements. The net impact of these warrant inducements to the condensed consolidated statement of operations was not material. In total,\n1,182,522 warrant shares were net exercised into shares of Legacy XTI common stock immediately prior to the XTI Merger closing time, which resulted in the issuance of\n105,550 shares of the Company's common stock in accordance with the exchange ratio pursuant to the XTI Merger Agreement.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, an additional 20,528 warrant shares originally issued by Legacy XTI were exercised into 20,528 shares of the Company's common stock at\nan exercise price of $0.12.\nWarrant Exchanges\nOn April 30, 2024 and May 1, 2024, the Company entered into warrant exchange agreements with the holders of certain of our then outstanding warrants (the “Existing\nWarrants”) initially issued on May 17, 2023, which were exercisable for an aggregate of 918,690 shares of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the agreements, on May\n2, 2024, the Company issued to the warrant holders 0.70 shares of common stock for each Existing Warrant, for an aggregate of 643,082 shares of common stock valued at\n$1,590,859, in exchange for the Existing Warrants. As the Existing Warrants were liability classified, the exchange resulted in the liability being (i) remeasured at the warrant\nredemption value of $1,590,859 resulting in a fair value loss of $672,174 which is reported in other income (expense) within the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and (ii) reclassified to stockholders' equity (deficit) within the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September\n30, 2024. Following the consummation of the warrant exchange, the Existing Warrants were cancelled and no further shares are issuable pursuant to the Existing Warrants\nagreement.\n33\nTable of Contents\nXTI AEROSPACE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023\nOn May 30, 2024, the Company entered into a warrant exchange agreement with the holder of certain warrants of the Company (the “Assumed Warrants”) to purchase shares of\ncommon stock, which Assumed Warrants were originally issued by Legacy XTI and assumed by the Company in connection with the XTI Merger. Pursuant to the terms of the\nagreement, the Company issued to the warrant holder an aggregate of 112,360 shares of common stock valued at $106,742 in exchange for 192,626 Assumed Warrants, which\nincluded 167,664 warrants shares granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as result of price protection clauses per the Assumed Warrant agreements relating\nto subsequent equity sales by the Company. As the Assumed Warrants were liability classified, the exchange resulted in the liability being (i) remeasured at the warrant\nredemption value of $106,742 resulting in a fair value loss of $6,742 which is reported in other income (expense) within the condensed consolidated statements of operations\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and (ii) reclassified to stockholders' equity (deficit) within the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024.\nFollowing the consummation of the warrant exchange, the Assumed Warrants were cancelled and no further shares are issuable pursuant to the Assumed Warrants agreement.\nOn June 12, 2024 and June 13, 2024, the Company entered into warrant exchange agreements with the holders (the “Warrant Holders”) of 491,314 existing warrants of the\nCompany (the “Existing Warrants”) initially issued on December 19, 2023, which were exercisable for an aggregate of 491,314 shares of our common stock. Pursuant to the\nterms of the agreements, on June 13, 2024, the Company issued to the Warrant Holders 1.50 shares of Common Stock for each Existing Warrant, for an aggregate of\n736,973 shares of common stock, in exchange for the Existing Warrants. Following the consummation of the Warrant Exchange, the Existing Warrants were cancelled and no\nfurther shares are issuable pursuant to the Existing Warrants agreements.\nAs it relates to the aforementioned Existing Warrants issued on December 19, 2023, there were 663,581 shares of common stock issued on June 12, 2024 for $0.47 per share\nand 73,392 shares of common stock issued on June 13, 2024 for $0.44 per share. The Warrant Holders received a total value of $344,176 for the conversion of the Existing\nWarrants to shares of common stock. The Company determined the fair value of the Existing Warrants as if issued on the exchange date and compared that to the fair value of\nthe common stock issued. The Company calculated the fair value of the Existing Warrants using a Black-Scholes Option pricing model and determined the fair value to be\napproximately $61,000. The inputs to the Black-Scholes Option pricing model for the June 12, 2024 redemption include a dividend rate of 0%, a risk free rate of 4.4%, a stock\nprice of $0.47, strike price of $5.13, term of 4.51, and a volatility of 90.0%. The inputs to the Black-Scholes Option pricing model for the June 13, 2024 redemption include a\ndividend rate of 0%, a risk free rate of 4.3%, a stock price of $0.44, a strike price of $5.13, a term of 4.51, and a volatility of 91.0%. The fair values of the common stock issued\nwere based on the closing stock price of the date of the exchange. The incremental increase in fair value of $283,176 was recorded as a return of capital, which reduces the\nadditional paid-in capital on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024, and is shown as a reconciling item on the condensed consolidated statements\nof operations from Net Loss to Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders.\nNote 14 - Segments\nThe Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), acting as the Chief Operating Decision Maker, or (“CODM”), regularly reviews and manages certain areas of its businesses,\nresulting in the Company identifying two reportable segments: Industrial IoT and Commercial Aviation. The Company manages and reports its operating results through these\ntwo reportable segments. This allows the Company to enhance its customer focus and better align its business models, resources, and cost structure to the specific current and\nfuture growth drivers of each business, while providing increased transparency to the Company’s shareholders.\nThe commercial aviation segment is currently in the pre-revenue development stage and its primary activity is the development of the TriFan 600 aircraft. The Industrial IoT\nsegment generates revenue primarily from the sale of real-time location system solutions for the industrial sector and its customers are primarily located in Germany and the\nU.S. As it relates to the Industrial IoT segment, the results disclosed in the table below only reflect activity following the XTI Merger closing through the September 30, 2024\nreporting date.\nGross profit and income (loss) from operations are the primary measures of Industrial IoT segment performance used by the Company’s CODM. The Company notes that\nCommercial Aviation is in the pre-revenue operating stage, and therefore the CODM primarily focuses on research and development expenses and total loss by operations as\nthe primary measure of Commercial Aviation segment performance used by the Company’s CODM.\n34\nTable of Contents\nXTI AEROSPACE, INC.

The Company determines fair value based upon the exit price that would be\nreceived to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, as determined by either the principal market or the most\nadvantageous market. Inputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values are classified based on a three-level hierarchy. These levels are:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets but corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and values determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar\ntechniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.\nFinancial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, warrant asset, accounts payable, warrant liability, convertible notes, and the\nloan conversion derivative. Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable are stated at their respective carrying amounts, which approximate fair value\ndue to their short-term nature.\nThe changes in fair value of the warrant liability, convertible notes, and warrant asset are presented within 'Change in fair value of warrant liability', 'Change in fair value of\nconvertible notes', and 'Other expense', respectively, in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nThe fair value of the Level 3 warrant liability was determined using a pricing model with certain significant unobservable market data inputs.\nDamon Motors Convertible Note\nOn October 26, 2023, Legacy Inpixon purchased a convertible note through a private placement in aggregate principal amount of $3.0 million for a purchase price of\n$3.0 million from Damon Motors Inc. Interest on the convertible note accrues at 12% per annum. The note was subsequently amended. As amended, the note matures on\nNovember 30, 2024. The convertible note is subject to certain conversion features which include qualified financing, and/or qualified transaction, as defined in the securities\npurchase agreement. The note will be required to convert upon Damon Motors Inc. completing a public company event. In addition, Damon Motors Inc. issued a five-year\nwarrant to purchase 1,096,321 shares of Damon Motors Inc. common stock in connection with the note. Management notes the Warrant is freestanding. The exercise price per\nCommon Share is $2.7364. The Warrant provides for cashless exercise after 180 days following the closing of the public company event should there be no effective\nregistration statement. The convertible note receivable is not traded in active markets and its fair value was determined using a present value technique. The convertible note\nreceivable is accounted for as an available-for-sale debt security based on “Level 3” inputs, which consist of unobservable inputs and reflect management’s estimates of\nassumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset, with unrealized holding gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive\nincome (loss). The Warrant is accounted for as an equity security based on “Level 3” inputs, which consist of unobservable inputs and reflect management’s estimates of\nassumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset, recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in earnings. The convertible note's and\nwarrant's values as of September 30, 2024 total $4.0 million and are included in Notes Receivable, $3.6 million, and Warrant asset, $0.4 million, on the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n36\nTable of Contents\nXTI AEROSPACE, INC.

The Company records a provision for a\nliability when it is both probable that the loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If the Company determines that a loss is reasonably\npossible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, it discloses the possible loss or range of loss. Any potential gains associated with legal matters are not\nrecorded until the period in which all contingencies are resolved and the gain is realized or realizable. Depending on the nature and timing of any such proceedings that may\narise, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect the Company’s future consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular\nperiod. Except if otherwise indicated, it is not reasonably possible to determine the probability of loss or estimate damages for any of the matters discussed below, and\ntherefore, the Company has not established reserves for any of these matters.\nOn December 6, 2023, Xeriant filed a complaint against Legacy XTI, along with two unnamed companies and five unnamed persons, in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York (the \"Xeriant Matter\"). On January 31, 2024, Xeriant filed an amended complaint, which added the Company as a defendant to the Xeriant\nMatter. On February 29, 2024, Xeriant filed a second amended complaint. The Xeriant Matter alleges that Legacy XTI has prevented Xeriant from obtaining compensation\nowed under various agreements entered into between Xeriant and Legacy XTI, including but not limited to a joint venture agreement, a cross-patent license agreement, an\noperating agreement, and a letter dated May 17, 2022 (the “May 17 letter”). In particular, Xeriant contends that Legacy XTI gained substantial advantages from the intellectual\nproperty, expertise, and capital deployed by Xeriant in the design and development of Legacy XTI’s TriFan 600 aircraft yet has excluded Xeriant from the transaction involving\nthe TriFan 600 technology in its merger with Legacy Inpixon, which has resulted in a breach of the May 17 letter. Xeriant seeks damages in excess of $500 million, injunctive\nrelief enjoining us from engaging in any further misconduct, the imposition of a royalty obligation, and such other relief as deemed appropriate by the court.\nOn March 13, 2024, Legacy XTI moved for partial dismissal of the Xeriant Matter. The case is in its early stages, no discovery with respect to the Company has occurred. The\nCourt has not scheduled hearings for Legacy XTI’s motion nor otherwise ruled upon it. Legacy XTI nevertheless denies the allegations of wrongdoing contained in the second\namended complaint and is vigorously defending against the lawsuit.\nIn connection with the Xeriant Matter, on June 12, 2024, we received a letter from counsel for Auctus Fund, LLC (“Auctus”), dated April 3, 2024, claiming that, pursuant to the\nabove-referenced May 17 letter by and between Xeriant and Legacy XTI, as a result of the XTI Merger and Legacy XTI’s entry into a promissory note agreement with Legacy\nInpixon in March 2023, XTI Aerospace and Legacy XTI may have assumed Xeriant’s obligations under that certain Senior Secured Promissory Note in the principal amount of\n$6,050,000 issued by Xeriant to Auctus, including the obligation to repay Auctus all principal and accrued and unpaid interest thereunder, which Auctus claims was\n$8,435,008.81 as of April 3, 2024. In July 2024, Legacy XTI\n40\nTable of Contents\nXTI AEROSPACE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023\nresponded to such letter and indicated that it believes that the May 17 letter is invalid and unenforceable on several bases. It further explained that even if it were valid and\nenforceable, Legacy XTI does not believe such letter resulted in, or otherwise triggered, the assumption of obligations of Xeriant under the Senior Secured Promissory Note or\nany other obligation on the part of Legacy XTI. There have been no further developments on this matter. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of a potential loss, if any,\non this matter. To the extent suits or actions are commenced with respect to this matter, we intend to vigorously defend against any and all claims.\nOn or about August 1, 2024, Chardan Capital Markets LLC (”Chardan”) commenced an arbitration (the “Arbitration”) before FINRA against the Company and its subsidiary,\nXTI Aircraft Company (“Aircraft”). Aircraft and Chardan are parties to an engagement letter agreement (the “Agreement”). In the Arbitration, Chardan alleges that the\nCompany is bound by the Agreement even though it did not sign the Agreement, which the Company denies. Chardan further alleges that Aircraft and the Company breached\nthe Agreement by not making separate payments to Chardan of $200,000, $94,511, $484,044 and $174,000. Chardan also seeks to recover unspecified amounts relating to an\nalleged right of first refusal to perform banking services that the Company supposedly did not honor, including with respect to an At-The-Market securities offering that was\nunderwritten by The Maxim Group LLC. The Company and Aircraft deny that Chardan performed its duties under the Agreement and otherwise that Chardan is owed any sums\nunder the Agreement. The Company has filed a petition in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking to stay the Arbitration to the extent that it has\nbeen asserted against the Company. The Company has indicated that it plans to prosecute the foregoing Petition and, if the Arbitration is not stayed, defend against the\nArbitration vigorously.

In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the\nCompany was provided a period of 180 calendar days, or until January 6, 2025, in which to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. On November 7, 2024,\nthe Company received another letter (the \"Low Price Deficiency Letter\") from Nasdaq notifying the Company that, as of November 6, 2024, the Company’s common stock had\na closing bid price of $0.10 or less for ten consecutive trading days. Accordingly, the Company is subject to the provisions contemplated under Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iii)\n(the \"Low Priced Stocks Rule\"). As a result, Nasdaq has determined to delist the Company’s securities from The Nasdaq Capital Market (the \"Determination\"), unless the\nCompany requests an appeal of the Determination on or prior to November 14, 2024, pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5800 Series.

There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be successful in its appeal to the Panel\nor be able to regain or maintain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules.\n43\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2: MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and\nthe related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and with Legacy Inpixon's audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC. In addition to our historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains\nforward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.\nFactors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, particularly in Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\nOverview of Our Business\nFollowing the closing of the XTI Merger, we are primarily an aircraft development company. We also provide real-time location systems (“RTLS”) for the industrial\nsector, which was our primary focus prior to the closing of the XTI Merger. Headquartered in Englewood, Colorado, XTI Aerospace is developing a vertical takeoff and landing\n(\"VTOL\") aircraft that is designed to take off and land like a helicopter and cruise like a fixed-wing business aircraft. We believe our initial configuration, the TriFan 600, will\nbe one of the first civilian fixed-wing VTOL aircraft that offers the speed, range and comfort of a business aircraft and the versatility of a helicopter for a wide range of\ncustomer applications, including private aviation for business and high net worth individuals, emergency medical services, and commuter and regional air travel. Since 2013,\nwe have been engaged primarily in developing the design and engineering concepts for the TriFan 600, building and testing a two-thirds scale unmanned version of the TriFan\n600, generating pre-orders for the TriFan 600, and seeking funds from investors to enable the Company to build full-scale piloted prototypes of the TriFan 600, and to\neventually engage in commercial production and sale of the TriFan 600 aircraft.\nOur RTLS solution leverages cutting-edge technologies such as IoT, AI, and big data analytics to provide real-time tracking and monitoring of assets, machines, and\npeople within industrial environments. With our RTLS, businesses can achieve improved operational efficiency, enhanced safety and reduced costs. By having real-time\nvisibility into operations, industrial organizations can make informed, data-driven decisions, minimize downtime, and ensure compliance with industry regulations.\nWe report financial results for two segments: Commercial Aviation and Industrial IoT. For Industrial IoT, we generate revenue from sales of hardware, software\nlicenses and professional services. For Commercial Aviation, the segment is pre-revenue as we are currently developing the TriFan 600 aircraft.\nKey Factors Affecting Operating Results\nWe believe that the growth of our business and our future success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to retain and develop engineering internal\nand third-party resources, secure strategic partnerships with suppliers, expand the number of customer purchase orders, locate a facility for further aircraft development and\ntesting, expand on that facility or locate to a new facility for commercial production, build-out production assembly lines in a timely manner, develop ancillary service offerings\nrelated to the TriFan 600 such as flight training and maintenance products, and secure the needed financing to achieve Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\") certification.\nWhile each of these areas presents significant opportunities for us, they also pose material challenges and risks that we must successfully address to achieve FAA\ncertification of the TriFan 600 and further reach our current aircraft delivery forecasts.\n44\nTable of Contents\nCorporate Strategy Update\nCommercial Aviation\nWe intend to continue our development of the TriFan 600 by engaging key supply partners, establishing vendors of key components of the full-scale Test Aircraft #1,\ncommissioning and completing trade studies, and completing the development design review of the TriFan 600. We will need additional capital to complete our development of\nthe series of Test Aircraft and beyond and are pursuing multiple alternatives for such funding.\nWe will continue to develop an internal and external sales and marketing capability to increase awareness of the aircraft and position the Company to continue taking\ncustomer orders and deposits. We believe that increasing awareness of the aircraft and demonstrating customer demand through sales orders will enhance the Company’s ability\nto continue raising capital in the future.\nWe do not believe we will be able to generate revenues in this commercial aviation segment without successfully completing the certification of the proposed TriFan\n600 aircraft.\nIndustrial IoT\nSince 2019 and post acquisition, Legacy Inpixon's operations have been focused on building and developing our Indoor IntelligenceTM platform to be able to offer a\ncomprehensive range of solutions that allow for the collection of data within workplace environments to delivering insights from that data for, people, places and things. We\nbelieve we have positioned the Industrial IoT business as a market leader with a comprehensive suite of products and solutions allowing us to help organizations enhance the\nvisitor and employee experience with actionable indoor intelligence making them smarter, safer and more secure. We operate and compete in an industry that is characterized\nby rapid technological innovation, changing customer needs, evolving industry standards and frequent introductions of new products, product enhancements, services and\ndistribution methods. Our success will depend on our ability to develop expertise with these new products, product enhancements, services and distribution methods and to\nimplement solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid changes in technology, the industry, and customer needs.\nResearch and Development\nCommercial Aviation\nWe plan to seek FAA certification of the TriFan 600 as a fixed-wing, VTOL aircraft. Initial concept and engineering analysis for the TriFan 600 was completed in July\n2015. Legacy XTI built a 65% scale prototype and in May 2019 began initial hover tests. The prototype was successfully hover-tested multiple times. Subsequent to raising\nprivate funding during 2021, Legacy XTI hired a number of engineers (employees and consultants) to establish its core engineering organization. Additionally, Legacy XTI\nretained consulting firms to provide specialized engineering technical knowledge to complement XTI’s team.\nLegacy XTI completed its preliminary design review (“PDR”) in 2022, which set the stage for the next step of design development. Legacy XTI updated the exterior\ndesign of the TriFan 600, including the location of the wing fans and the location of the horizontal tail, all of which had a positive impact on the performance and efficiency of\nthe aircraft. Design and engineering for other systems, including the propulsion system, landing gear, cockpit visibility, cabin sizing and structural integrity were also advanced\nduring 2022 and 2023.\nThe XTI team is currently working toward an update to the initial PDR to address additional aerodynamic and performance improvements. In addition, the program\nincludes further interactions with potential suppliers for the development of major structures and systems of the aircraft. The team is focused on industry-respected suppliers\nand systems for the TriFan 600 to reduce certification risk and to deliver a fully-integrated aircraft. Also, during this phase XTI will formally establish a project plan with the\nFAA and apply for Type Certification (TC).\nThe next target milestones include the critical design review (“CDR”) and building and preliminary testing of a full-scale flight test aircraft, along with building\nadditional full-scale flight test aircraft, are fully dependent on raising additional financing.\n45\nTable of Contents\nIndustrial IoT\nOur management believes that we must continue to dedicate significant resources to research and development efforts to maintain a competitive position. Our RTLS\nproducts intersect many emerging fields including metaverse, augmented reality, occupancy planning, industry 4.0, smart cities, and more, and we continue to innovate and\npatent new methods to solve problems for our customers.\nCompetition\nCommercial Aviation\nThe business aircraft market is highly competitive and we face a significant number of original equipment manufacturer competitors, most of which are larger, better\nknown and have better financial resources than us. When the TriFan 600 goes into production, we believe it will compete with other aircraft manufacturers by providing our\ncustomers with what we believe is a unique “crossover” aircraft with distinct and largely unique performance capabilities at a competitive purchase price. We believe the TriFan\n600 will be one of a small number of aircraft that offers the speed, range and comfort of a business aircraft with the versatility of VTOL. As we expect that the TriFan 600 will\nbe capable of flying greater distances and on average at twice the speed and three times the range of competing helicopters, we expect the TriFan 600 to offer lower direct\noperating costs (cost per flight hour) and be able to fly almost twice as many missions, thus generating additional cost savings and revenue for airlines and aircraft operators\nwhen compared with helicopters.\nIndustrial IoT\nIn addition, our Industrial IoT business is characterized by innovation and rapid change. Our RTLS Indoor Intelligence products compete with companies such as\nAruba, Cisco, Juniper Networks/Mist Systems, Ubisense, Sewio, Kinexon, Zebra Technologies and other mostly vertical focused RTLS companies. Some competitors\ndetermine positioning primarily using BLE or Wi-Fi and, therefore, we believe they cannot achieve the same accuracy that we do and so cannot meet some customers' needs.\nMany RTLS competitors are focused on one technology and/or vertical and, at this time, we believe none of them have as complete an offering of tags, anchors, positioning,\nengine, software, integrations and analytics. We believe we offer a unique and differentiated approach to the market with our Industrial IoT business which is comprehensive,\nscalable, and technology-agnostic.\nRecent Events\nThe Company completed its merger with Legacy XTI on March 12, 2024, which was structured as a reverse triangular merger.\nCompliance with Nasdaq Continued Listing Requirements\nOn July 9, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\"Nasdaq\") indicating that, based upon the\nclosing bid price of the Company’s common stock for the last 30 consecutive business days beginning on May 23, 2024, and ending on July 8, 2024, the Company no longer\nmeets the requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A),\nthe Company was provided a period of 180 calendar days, or until January 6, 2025, in which to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.\nOn November 7, 2024, the Company received another letter (the \"Low Price Deficiency Letter\") from Nasdaq notifying the Company that, as of November 6, 2024,\nthe Company’s common stock had a closing bid price of $0.10 or less for ten consecutive trading days. Accordingly, the Company is subject to the provisions contemplated\nunder Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iii) (the \"Low Priced Stocks Rule\"). As a result, Nasdaq has determined to delist the Company’s securities from The Nasdaq Capital Market\n(the \"Determination\"), unless the Company requests an appeal of the Determination on or prior to November 14, 2024, pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Nasdaq\nListing Rule 5800 Series.\nThe Company requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the \"Panel\") to appeal the Determination and to address compliance with the Low Priced Stocks\nRule. The Low Price Deficiency Letter states that hearings are typically scheduled to occur approximately 30-45 days after the date of the hearing request. The Company will\nbe asked to provide the Panel with a plan to regain compliance, which plan the Company is in the process of preparing.\n46\nTable of Contents\nThe Low Price Deficiency Letter has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s common stock on Nasdaq and its common stock will continue to be listed on\nthe Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"XTIA.\" While the appeal process is pending, the suspension of trading of the Company’s common stock would be stayed and the\nCompany’s common stock would continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market until the hearing process concludes and the Panel issues a written decision. There can be no\nassurance, however, that the Company will be successful in its appeal to the Panel or be able to regain or maintain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules.\nEmployment Agreement with Chief Strategy Officer\nThe Company entered into an employment agreement with Tobin Arthur on September 19, 2024, effective as of such date (the \"Arthur Employment Agreement\"),\npursuant to which Mr. Arthur agreed to serve as the Company’s Chief Strategy Officer. Pursuant to the terms of the Arthur Employment Agreement, Mr. Arthur is entitled to\nreceive an annual base salary of $300,000, which may be increased by the Board from time to time in its sole discretion. Mr. Arthur is also entitled to receive an annual cash\nbonus of up to a baseline of 60% of his base salary, with the right and ability to earn up to a cap of 90% of his base salary, applying a weighted average percentage of the\nobjective and subjective criteria and milestones set forth in the Arthur Employment Agreement, which include target amounts and target dates for equity investments received\nby the Company and the Company’s average market cap in addition to the completion of certain milestones in the development of the Company’s TriFan 600 aircraft. The\nBoard will determine and award the annual cash bonus within 30 days after the end of each calendar year during Mr. Arthur’s employment period. Pursuant to the Arthur\nEmployment Agreement, the Compensation Committee of the Board granted Mr. Arthur stock options to purchase 1,171,875 shares of the Company’s common stock under the\nCompany’s 2018 Employee Stock Incentive Plan, as amended. The stock options have a grant date of September 19, 2024 and an exercise price of $0.473 per share. The stock\noptions vest 1/3rd annually over three years starting from August 1, 2024, and expire ten years after the grant date. Mr. Arthur’s employment agreement term ends on December\n31, 2025, with one automatic one-year extension to December 31, 2026, unless either party provides prior notice of non-renewal on or before March 31, 2025.\nThe Arthur Employment Agreement provides that Mr. Arthur’s receipt of compensation following termination of employment is subject to his execution of a release\nreleasing all claims against the Company and its executives, directors and employees, other than as prohibited by law. If Mr. Arthur is terminated without cause (other than due\nto death or disability) or if he resigns for good reason (as such terms are defined in the Arthur Employment Agreement), then Mr. Arthur will be entitled to (i) a severance\npayment equivalent to the base salary that would have been paid to him through the end of the employment period, (ii) payment for any unused vacation accrued to the date of\ntermination, (iii) payment for any accrued but unpaid expenses through the date of termination and (iv) any benefits to which he may be entitled upon termination pursuant to\nthe terms of any applicable plans and programs or as may be required by applicable law. If Mr. Arthur terminates for good reason, in addition to the foregoing compensation\nand benefits, he is entitled to receive reimbursements of premium payments for continuation coverage under applicable state or federal law, in the event he elects such\ncontinuation coverage, for the remainder of his employment period, or, if longer, for a period of six months after termination of employment. If Mr. Arthur is terminated for\ncause, then immediately following such termination, he is entitled only to any unpaid compensation and unreimbursed expenses.\nThe Arthur Employment Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.5 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and the description above of the material terms of the Arthur\nEmployment Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such exhibit.\nResignation of Chief Legal Officer\nEffective as of October 28, 2024, the Company’s board of directors appointed Jennifer Gaines as the Company’s Chief Legal Officer and, in connection with her\nappointment, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Ms. Gaines, effective as of October 28, 2024, which is filed as Exhibit 10.9 to this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q. As disclosed under Part II, Item 5 of this report, on November 12, 2024, Jennifer Gaines amicably resigned as Chief Legal Officer of the Company, effective\nimmediately.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In connection with the\npreparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and\nother factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies,\nassumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events\nand their\n47\nTable of Contents\neffects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 3 of the condensed consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following accounting estimates are\nthe most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from\nthe need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. There have been no changes to estimates during the periods presented in the filing.\nHistorically changes in management estimates have not been material.\nThere have been no significant changes to Legacy Inpixon's critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in Item 7, \"Management's\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023,\nexcept for the addition of Legacy XTI's critical accounting policies and estimates which have been incorporated and disclosed in Note 3 of the condensed consolidated\nfinancials statements included elsewhere in this report and the valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill as noted below.\nValuation of Long-lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill.\nWe periodically review long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 360,\n“Property, Plant, and Equipment.” Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are reviewed annually for impairment in accordance with ASC 350, “Intangibles –\nGoodwill and Other,” or more often if there are indications of possible impairment.\nThe analysis to determine whether or not an asset is impaired requires significant judgments that are dependent on internal forecasts, including estimated future cash\nflows, estimates of long-term growth rates for our business, the expected life over which cash flows will be realized and assumed royalty and discount rates. Changes in these\nestimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and any impairment charge. While the fair value of these assets exceeds their carrying value\nbased on our current estimates and assumptions, materially different estimates and assumptions in the future in response to changing economic conditions, changes in our\nbusiness or for other reasons could result in the recognition of impairment losses.\nFor assets to be held and used, including acquired intangible assets subject to amortization, we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future\nundiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. Any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds\nits fair value. Significant management judgment is required in this process.\nFor intangible assets not subject to amortization such as goodwill, we test for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their\ncarrying value may not be recoverable. In testing goodwill for impairment, we compare the fair value with the carrying value. The determination of fair value is based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis, using inputs and assumptions such as revenue growth rates, projected research and development expenditures based on future milestones of the\nTriFan 600 aircraft development, other projected expenses, and discount rates. If we were to experience a decrease in forecasted future revenues attributable to the intangible\nassets, this could indicate a potential impairment. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, the goodwill is considered impaired, and an impairment loss will be\nrecognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of goodwill.\nWe will perform our annual goodwill impairment test required by ASC 350 as of October 1st of each year. In testing goodwill for impairment, we analyze qualitative\nfactors as stated within ASC 350 to determine if the fair value of our single reporting unit may be less than the carrying value of the reporting unit. We have one reporting unit\n(Industrial IoT). If the fair value of the reporting unit, based on qualitative factors, may be less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, we then perform the goodwill\nimpairment test required under ASC 350 by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying value of the reporting unit and, if the fair value is less than the\ncarrying value, the amount that the carrying value exceeds fair value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. Accordingly, we would recognize an impairment loss in the\namount of such excess.\nIn the Merger we recorded approximately $12.4 million in goodwill which allocated to our Industrial IOT reporting unit. Since the closing date of the Merger on\nMarch 12, 2024, the price of our common stock has declined significantly and may continue to fluctuate in future periods. A sustained decrease in the price of our common\nstock is one of the qualitative factors to be considered as part of an impairment test when evaluating whether events or changes in circumstances may indicate that it is more\nlikely than not that a potential goodwill impairment exists. We will continue monitoring the analysis of the qualitative and quantitative factors used as a basis for the goodwill\nimpairment test during fiscal year 2024 and at the Company’s October 1st\n48\nTable of Contents\nannual testing date. As of September 30, 2024, Management evaluated potential triggers and completed a qualitative assessment and determined in the aggregate, it is not more\nlikely than not, that the fair value of the Goodwill is less than its carrying value. To corroborate this conclusion, we entered into an agreement for a proposed equity investment\nat a post-money valuation in line with the fairness opinion obtained in July 2023 and compared our equity carrying value to our market capitalization and concluded that there\nwas no goodwill impairment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. If the negative volatility of our market capitalization is sustained, it is possible that our\ngoodwill could become impaired, which could result in a material charge and adversely affect our results of operations.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nCommercial Aviation\nWe are still working to design, develop and certify the TriFan 600 aircraft and thus have not generated revenue from this segment. We do not expect to begin\ngenerating significant revenues until we are able to complete the design, development, certification, and manufacturing of the aircraft.\nIndustrial IoT\nOur RTLS products are primarily sold on a license and SaaS mode, which we call \"location as a service\" or \"LaaS.\" In our licensing model, we also typically charge an\nannual maintenance fee. The LaaS model is typically for a 3-5 year contract and includes a license to use, maintenance and hardware upgrades. The LaaS model generates a\nrecurring revenue stream.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development activities represent a significant part of our business. Our research and development efforts focus on the design and development of (i) our\nindoor intelligence products, and (ii) our TriFan 600 aircraft, including certain of the systems that will be used in it. As part of our aircraft development activities, we continue\nto work closely with the FAA towards our goal of achieving certification of our aircraft on an efficient timeline.\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the research and development of the TriFan 600 aircraft. These expenses\ninclude:\n• employee-related expenses, including salaries and benefits for personnel engaged in research and development functions;\n• expenses incurred under agreements with third parties such as consultants and contractors; and\n• software and technology-related expenses to support computer-aided design of the aircraft, flight simulations, and other technology needs of our engineers.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly as we increase staffing to\nsupport aircraft engineering and software development, build aircraft prototypes and continue to explore and develop technologies.\nWe cannot determine with certainty the timing, duration or the costs necessary to complete the design, development, certification, and manufacturing of our TriFan 600\naircraft due to the inherently unpredictable nature of our research and development activities. Development timelines, the probability of success, and development costs may\ndiffer materially from expectations.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\nSelling and marketing costs include activities such as aircraft reservation procurement, public relations and business opportunity advancement. These functions mainly\ngenerate expenses relating to travel, trade show fees and costs, salaries and benefits. Selling and marketing expenses are expensed as incurred.\n49\nTable of Contents\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, finance, corporate and business development, and\nadministrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters, including non-capitalizable transaction costs;\nprofessional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and administrative consulting services; insurance costs, facility related expenses including maintenance and allocated expenses\nfor rent and other operating costs.\nWe anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase substantially in the future as we increase our headcount to support continued research and\ndevelopment and commercialization of the TriFan 600.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest expense, net consists primarily of (i) interest relating to convertible and promissory notes payable, (ii) amortization of debt discounts relating to warrants and\nstock options issued in conjunction with convertible notes, and (iii) interest income on notes receivable.\nInducement loss on debt conversions includes primarily the inducement charges incurred by Legacy XTI when it entered into voluntary note conversion letter\nagreements with several note holders during the first quarter of 2024. Per the letter agreements, principal and accrued interest under the notes was converted at a reduced\nconversion price into shares of Legacy XTI common stock immediately prior to the XTI Merger closing time, which converted into shares of the Company's common stock\nupon the closing of the XTI Merger. The Company accounted for these conversions as an inducement and, as such, recognized a loss related to the fair value of the additional\nshares issued compared to the original terms of the convertible notes.\nChange in fair value of convertible notes represent the remeasurement of certain Legacy XTI convertible notes to fair value. These notes were converted to equity\nprior to the closing of XTI Merger.\nChange in fair value of warrant liability represents the remeasurement of certain Legacy XTI and Legacy Inpixon outstanding warrants to fair value. These outstanding\nwarrants were exchanged for common shares of the Company during the second quarter of 2024.\nOther income (expense), net consists of miscellaneous income and expense items.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nThe following table sets forth selected consolidated financial data and as a percentage of period-over-period change:\nThree Months Ended September\n30,\n2024 2023\n%\n(in thousands, except percentages) Amount Amount $ Change Change*\nRevenues $ 918 $ — $ 918 **\nCost of revenues $ 398 $ — $ 398 **\nGross profit $ 520 $ — $ 520 **\nOperating expenses $ 4,736 $ 2,378 $ 2,358 99 %\nLoss from operations $ (4,216) $ (2,378) $ (1,838) 77 %\nOther income (expense) $ (219) $ (325) $ 106 (33)%\nProvision for income taxes $ — $ — $ — **\nNet loss $ (4,435) $ (2,703) $ (1,732) 64 %\n* Amounts used to calculate dollar and percentage changes are based on numbers in the thousands. Accordingly, calculations in this item, which may be rounded to the\nnearest hundred thousand, may not produce the same results.\n50\nTable of Contents\n** Comparisons between positive and negative numbers and with a zero are not meaningful.\nRevenues\nRevenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $0.9 million compared to $0.0 million for the comparable period in the prior year for an increase of\napproximately $0.9 million. The revenue amount for the three months ended September 30, 2024 represents the results of the revenue-generating Industrial IoT segment,\nwhereas the Company was pre-revenue in 2023. We expect revenues for the fourth quarter of 2024 to remain consistent with the third quarter of 2024.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $0.4 million compared to $0.0 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The cost of\nrevenues amount for the three months ended September 30, 2024 represents the results of the revenue-generating Industrial IoT segment, whereas the Company was pre-\nrevenue in 2023.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $0.5 million compared to $0.0 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The gross profit\namount for the three months ended September 30, 2024 represents the results of the revenue-generating Industrial IoT segment, whereas the Company was pre-revenue in 2023.\nRevenue and gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $1.03 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The decline in gross profit for the quarter ended September\n30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024 of approximately $0.2 million was primarily driven by a decline in revenue and the recognition of a one-time inventory\nimpairment charge of approximately $0.04 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. We expect gross profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 to be similar\nto the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $4.7 million and $2.4 million for the comparable period ended September 30, 2023. During\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized one-time income of $2.3 million, which is included in general and administrative expenses, relating to the forfeiture\nof vested stock options previously granted to the former CEO of Legacy XTI. Excluding the income recognized from the aforementioned stock option forfeiture, operating\nexpenses increased by approximately $4.7 million due primarily to (i) an increase in expenditures relating to the development of the TriFan 600 aircraft, (ii) an increase in\nconsulting compensation mainly attributable to consulting arrangements entered into with prior executives of Legacy Inpixon on March 12, 2024, (iii) an increase in public\ncompany-related professional fees as the 2023 historical results reflect the operations of a private company, Legacy XTI, and (iv) the inclusion of the operating results of the\nIndustrial IoT segment as of the closing of the XTI Merger. After excluding one-time items, we expect total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2024 to remain\ncomparable to the third quarter.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a loss of $0.2 million compared to a loss of $0.3 million for the comparable period in the\nprior year. This fluctuation in other income (expense) of approximately $0.1 million was primarily attributable to a decline in interest expense as a result of Legacy XTI\nconvertible notes being converted into equity immediately prior to the XTI Merger closing.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income tax for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was immaterial.\n51\nTable of Contents\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nThe following table sets forth selected consolidated financial data and as a percentage of period-over-period change:\nNine Months Ended September\n30,\n2024 2023\n%\n(in thousands, except percentages) Amount Amount $ Change Change*\nRevenues $ 2,169 $ — $ 2,169 **\nCost of revenues $ 846 $ — $ 846 **\nGross profit $ 1,323 $ — $ 1,323 **\nOperating expenses $ 28,343 $ 7,702 $ 20,641 268 %\nLoss from operations $ (27,020) $ (7,702) $ (19,318) 251 %\nOther income (expense) $ 5,289 $ (1,195) $ 6,484 (543)%\nProvision for income taxes $ (16) $ — $ (16) **\nNet loss $ (21,747) $ (8,897) $ (12,850) 144 %\n* Amounts used to calculate dollar and percentage changes are based on numbers in the thousands. Accordingly, calculations in this item, which may be rounded to the\nnearest hundred thousand, may not produce the same results.\n** Comparisons between positive and negative numbers and with a zero are not meaningful.\nRevenues\nRevenues the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $2.2 million compared to $0.0 million for the comparable period in the prior year for an increase of\napproximately $2.2 million. The revenue amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represents the results of the revenue-generating Industrial IoT segment\nfollowing the XTI Merger closing date of March 12, 2024 through the September 30, 2024 reporting date, whereas the Company was pre-revenue in 2023.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $0.8 million compared to $0.0 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The cost of\nrevenues amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represents the results of the revenue-generating Industrial IoT segment following the XTI Merger closing date\nof March 12, 2024 through the September 30, 2024 reporting date, whereas the Company was pre-revenue in 2023.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.3 million compared to $0.0 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The gross profit\namount for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represents the results of the revenue-generating Industrial IoT segment following the XTI Merger closing date of March\n12, 2024 through the September 30, 2024 reporting date, whereas the Company was pre-revenue in 2023.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $28.3 million and $7.7 million for the comparable period ended September 30, 2023. This\nincrease of approximately $20.6 million was primarily attributable to (i) the recognition of $6.7 million of nonrecurring transaction bonus expense during the second quarter of\n2024 as the bonuses became payable upon the earlier of the closing of qualifying financings or June 30, 2024, (ii) an increase in one-time merger-related transaction costs of\n$5.1 million, (iii) an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense of approximately $1.1 million, (iv) an increase in consulting compensation mainly attributable to\nconsulting arrangements entered into with prior executives of Legacy Inpixon on March 12, 2024, (v) an increase in legal and accounting fees relating to capital raising\nactivities during 2024, (vi) an increase in public company-related professional fees as the 2023 historical results reflect the operations of a\n52\nTable of Contents\nprivate company, Legacy XTI, and (vii) the inclusion of the operating results of the Industrial IoT segment as of the XTI Merger closing date through the September 30, 2024\nreporting date.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a gain of $5.3 million compared to a loss of $1.2 million for the comparable period ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. This fluctuation of approximately $6.5 million was primarily attributable to the Company recognizing an income gain of approximately $12.9 million\nrelating to the remeasurement of convertible notes at fair value during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by inducement losses on debt conversions of\napproximately $6.7 million incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income tax for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was immaterial.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources as of September 30, 2024\nOur current capital resources and operating results as of and through September 30, 2024, consist of:\n1) an overall working capital deficit of approximately $11.9 million;\n2) cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.5 million;\n3) net cash used by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of $14.3 million.\nThe breakdown of our overall working capital deficit as of September 30, 2024 is as follows (in thousands):\nWorking Capital Assets Liabilities Net\nCash and cash equivalents $ 511 $ — $ 511\nAccounts receivable, net / accounts payable 610 7,625 (7,015)\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 1,704 — 1,704\nInventory 2,730 — 2,730\nAccrued liabilities — 8,659 (8,659)\nAccrued interest — 940 (940)\nCustomer deposits — 1,350 (1,350)\nOperating lease obligation — 217 (217)\nDeferred revenue — 526 (526)\nNotes and other receivables / short-term debt 4,153 2,620 1,533\nWarrant asset 424 — 424\nOther — 100 (100)\nTotal $ 10,132 $ 22,037 $ (11,905)\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nContractual obligations are cash that we are obligated to pay as part of certain contracts that we have entered during our course of business. Our contractual obligations\nconsists of operating lease liabilities and merger-related transaction liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet and vendor commitments associated with\nagreements that are\n53\nTable of Contents\nlegally binding. As of September 30, 2024, the total obligation for capitalized operating leases was approximately $0.5 million, of which approximately $0.2 million is expected\nto be paid in the next twelve months.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we owed approximately $2.6 million relating to outstanding short-term promissory notes. This balance excludes intercompany amounts that\nare eliminated in the financial statements. These notes are payable within the next twelve months and the interest rate charged under the notes range from 4.0% to 18.6%.\nCustomer Deposits\nAs of September 30, 2024, we received conditional pre-orders under a combination of non-binding aircraft purchase agreements, reservation deposit agreements,\noptions and letters of intent for aircraft which generated approximately $1.4 million of cash from customer deposits. These funds from customer reservation deposits will not be\nrecorded as revenue until the orders for aircraft are delivered, which may not be for many years or at all if we do not deliver the aircraft. The deposits prioritize orders when the\naircraft becomes available for delivery. Customers making deposits are not obligated to purchase aircraft until they execute a definitive purchase agreement. Customers may\nrequest a return of their refundable deposit any time up until the execution of a purchase agreement. Customers’ request for a return of their refundable deposits could adversely\naffect our liquidity resources and we may be financially unable to return such deposits.\nFinancial Advisory Fees in connection with the XTI Merger\nPursuant to the terms of an amended advisory fees agreement among Legacy XTI, the Company and Maxim and in accordance with the XTI Merger Agreement, the\nCompany issued 385,359 registered shares of XTI Aerospace common stock in exchange for shares of Legacy XTI common stock issued to Maxim based on the exchange ratio\nunder the XTI Merger Agreement. Additionally, Maxim will receive $0.2 million payable upon the closing of one or more debt or equity financings for which Maxim serves as\nplacement agent or underwriter and in which the Company raises minimum aggregate gross proceeds of $10 million following the Effective Time.\nLegacy XTI Deferred Compensation and Retention Bonus Plan\nIn an effort to conserve cash, Legacy XTI implemented a cost savings plan, effective on July 1, 2022. As part of the cost savings plan, Legacy XTI installed a\ncompensation reduction directive and retention bonus program impacting all employees and several current consultants. Accrued deferred compensation amounts under the cost\nsavings plan will be repaid to participating individuals when executive management, at its sole discretion, determines that sufficient funding has been received by the Company,\nprovided, in the case of employees, that such employees remain employed with the Company on such date.\nAs part of the plan, Legacy XTI granted participants a retention bonus, of either cash or equity, at the participant’s discretion, equal in value to three months of their\nmonthly deferred compensation amount, if cash, or six months of their monthly deferred compensation amount, if equity, if the employee remains with the Company at the\n“earn date,” which is defined as six months after the date on which the deferred compensation described above is repaid.\nUpon receiving additional financing during the first quarter of 2023, Legacy XTI restored the salaries of all employees to the original salary amount, effective with the\nsemi-monthly payroll ended March 31, 2023.\nAs of the date of this report, the Company has obligations of approximately $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, relating to deferred compensation and retention\nbonuses under this plan.\nAgreements with Prior \"Legacy Inpixon\" CEO\nOn March 12, 2024, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Nadir Ali (the “Ali Consulting Agreement”), the Company's former Chief Executive\nOfficer. Mr. Ali, through a company of which he is a controlling member, currently holds shares of the Company's Series 9 Preferred Stock. Pursuant to the Ali Consulting\nAgreement, following the closing of the XTI Merger, Mr. Ali will provide consulting services to the Company for 15 months (\"Ali Consulting Period\") or until earlier\ntermination in accordance with its terms. During the Ali Consulting Period, the Company will pay him an aggregate of $0.3 million.\nIn addition, the Company shall pay Mr. Ali (a) the amount of $1.5 million due three months following the Closing, and (b) the aggregate amount of $4.5 million,\npayable in 12 equal monthly installments, starting four months after the closing date of the XTI Merger (the payments described in (a) and (b), each an “Equity Payment”).\nEach Equity Payment may be made, in Company’s discretion, in (i) cash, (ii) fully vested shares of common stock under the Company’s equity incentive plan, or a combination\nof cash and registered shares. As of the date of this report, the Company repaid the initial $1.5 million owed to Mr.\n54\nTable of Contents\nAli under the Ali Consulting Agreement. As of the date of this report, the Company owed Mr. Ali accrued consulting fees of approximately $1.0 million.\nConsulting Arrangement with Prior \"Legacy Inpixon\" CFO\nOn March 12, 2024, the Company also entered into a Consulting Agreement with Ms. Wendy Loundermon (the “Loundermon Consulting Agreement”), the Company's\nformer Chief Financial Officer. Pursuant to the Loundermon Consulting Agreement, following the Closing, Ms. Loundermon will provide consulting services to the Company\nfor one year or until earlier termination in accordance with its terms (the “Loundermon Consulting Period”). As compensation for Ms. Loundermon’s consulting services, the\nCompany will pay her (i) $83,333 per month for the first six months of the Loundermon Consulting Period for services she performs on an as-needed basis during the\nLoundermon Consulting Period regarding the transition of the management of the Company’s financial reporting function to ensure continuity of business operations, and (ii)\n$300 per hour for services performed on an as needed basis regarding the preparation and filing of Company’s public company financial reporting and compliance matters\nincluding accounting, payroll, audit and tax compliance functions. As of the date of this report, the Company owed Ms. Loundermon accrued consulting fees of approximately\n$0.5 million.\nTransaction Bonus Plan\nOn July 24, 2023, the compensation committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”) adopted a Transaction Bonus Plan, which was amended on March 11,\n2024, and was intended to provide incentives to certain employees and other service providers to remain with the Company through the consummation of a qualifying\ntransaction. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company accrued 100% or $6.7 million of the transaction bonuses, which is included in general and administrative within\nthe accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations, as the bonuses became payable upon the earlier of the closing of financing or June 30, 2024. As of the date\nof this report, the Company had an aggregate transaction bonus obligation outstanding of approximately 5.5 million.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company has a working capital deficit of approximately $11.9 million, and cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.5 million.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of approximately $21.7 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company\nused approximately $14.3 million of cash for operating activities.\nThere can be no assurances that the Company will ever earn revenues sufficient to support its operations, or that it will ever be profitable. In order to continue its\noperations, the Company has historically supplemented the revenues it earned with proceeds from the sale of our equity, including through our ATM Offering with Maxim (as\ndiscussed below), and debt securities and proceeds from loans and bank credit lines. We believe that our current revenue, as supplemented by proceeds from our financings, will\nprovide us with liquidity to fund our planned operating needs into the second quarter of 2025. Therefore, we will need to secure additional capital or financing and/or\nsignificantly delay, defer or reduce our cash expenditures over the next two quarters. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional capital or financing on\nterms acceptable to us, on a timely basis or at all.\nAs discussed in Note 10 of the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part I, Item 1 of this report, the Company may, from time to time,\nsell shares of the Company’s common stock under its ATM Offering through Maxim, as the Company’s exclusive sales agent. Maxim is entitled to compensation at a fixed\ncommission rate of 3.0% of the gross sales price per share sold excluding Maxim's costs and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the fees\nand out-of-pocket expenses of its legal counsel. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 3,190,727 shares of common stock under the Equity\nDistribution Agreement at per share prices between approximately $0.19 and $0.43, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $1.0 million.\nAs of the date of this report, there was approximately $38.6 million in common stock gross sales remaining under the Equity Distribution Agreement, subject to the\nlimitations set forth in the Series 9 ATM Consent, which, among other things, provides that the Company may not register shares under the ATM Offering in excess of\n$47.4 million (the \"ATM Maximum Amount\") without the prior written consent of the Required Holders (as defined below), and the Company may not issue or sell more than\n$6 million of additional shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Offering (the \"Initial Tranche\") without the Required Holders’ prior written consent, which consent the\nCompany is required to obtain for each additional $5 million in sales of common stock under the ATM Offering after the Initial Tranche up to the ATM Maximum Amount.\n\"Required Holders\" is defined in the Series 9 Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation as the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Series 9 Preferred Stock;\nprovided that, pursuant to that certain securities purchase agreement dated as of March 12, 2024, between the Company and 3AM Investments LLC (an entity controlled by the\nCompany's former director and former Chief Executive Officer, Nadir Ali) (the \"Purchaser\"), the Purchaser will be deemed a \"Required Holder\" as defined in the Series 9\nPreferred Stock Certificate of Designation as long as the Purchaser holds any shares of Series 9 Preferred Stock.\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe Company's recurring losses and utilization of cash in its operations are indicators of going concern. The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements\nas of September 30, 2024 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will continue as a\ngoing concern for the next twelve months from the date the financial statements are issued. Management’s plans and assessment of the probability that such plans will mitigate\nand alleviate any substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company's ability to obtain additional equity or debt\nfinancing, and attain further operating efficiency, which is uncertain, which together represent the principal conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue\nas a going concern. The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 do not include\nany adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There can be no assurance that any additional capital, whether in the form of equity or debt financing,\nwill be sufficient or available and, if available, that such capital will be offered on terms and conditions acceptable to us. We are currently seeking additional financing in order\nto meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to fund our operations, we will be required to evaluate further alternatives, which could include\ncurtailing or suspending operations, reducing headcount, selling the Company, dissolving and liquidating its assets or seeking protection under the bankruptcy laws. A\ndetermination to take any of these actions could occur at a time that is earlier than when we would otherwise exhaust our cash resources.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company’s net cash flows used in operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and certain balances as of\nthe end of those periods are as follows (in thousands):\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (14,305) $ (2,986)\nNet cash provided by investing activities 2,875 (3)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 11,928 3,110\nEffect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash 8 —\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 506 $ 121\nAs of September 30, As of December 31,\n2024 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 511 $ 5\nWorking capital deficit $ (11,905) $ (13,028)\nOperating Activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nNet cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately $14.3 million.

During the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, the Company received incoming cash flows of approximately $9.6 million from the ATM Offering, $2.0 million from promissory notes issued to Streeterville Capital,\nLLC, and approximately $1.0 million in proceeds from an existing promissory note arrangement with Legacy Inpixon. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the\nCompany repaid $0.7 million towards outstanding promissory notes.\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $3.1 million. During the nine months ended September 30,\n2023, the Company received proceeds of $0.8 million from the issuance of convertible notes, received $0.2 million in proceeds from the sale of common stock, and received\n$2.2 million in proceeds from promissory notes with David Brody and Legacy Inpixon.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do not engage in trading activities involving non-\nexchange traded contracts.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, please see Note 3 to our financial statements, which are included in this report beginning on page F-1.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nNot applicable.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange\nAct, such as this Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also\ndesigned with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal\nFinancial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Internal controls are procedures which are designed with the objective of providing\nreasonable assurance that (1) our transactions are properly authorized, recorded and reported; and (2) our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use, to permit\nthe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP.\nWe conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nconcluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. As discussed elsewhere in this report, on March 12, 2024, we completed the\nXTI Merger. Legacy Inpixon was the legal acquirer in the XTI Merger, but Legacy XTI was the accounting acquirer in the XTI Merger under GAAP. In accordance with\nGAAP, the historical financial statements of Legacy XTI are considered the financial statements of the combined company. Prior to the XTI Merger, because Legacy XTI was\nnot subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Legacy XTI did not have the necessary processes, systems, procedures, and related internal controls necessary to satisfy\nthe financial reporting requirements of a public company. During the second quarter of 2024, we commenced the process of integrating Legacy XTI into our system of\ndisclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. As of September 30, 2024, we believe Legacy XTI has been fully integrated into our system of\ndisclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. However, as of the date of this report, this integration of Legacy XTI is currently being\nevaluated by a third-party consulting firm that we engaged during the fourth quarter of 2024 to assist in the evaluation and remediation of our internal controls over financial\nreporting on the combined entity.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nAs noted above, as of September 30, 2024, we believe Legacy XTI has been fully integrated into our system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting. However, this integration of Legacy XTI is\n59\nTable of Contents\ncurrently being evaluated by the aforementioned third-party consulting firm as of the date of this report. There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial\nreporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations of the Effectiveness of Control\nA control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nBecause of the inherent limitations of any control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been\ndetected.\n60\nTable of Contents\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nThere are no material pending legal proceedings as defined by Item 103 of Regulation S-K, to which we are a party or of which any of our property is the subject,\nother than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the Company’s business and as described in Note 18 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included\nin Part I, Item 1 of this report under the heading \"Litigation.\"\nThere are no proceedings in which any of the directors, officers or affiliates of the Company, or any registered or beneficial holder of more than 5% of the Company’s\nvoting securities, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to that of the Company.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nWe face a number of significant risks and uncertainties in connection with our operations. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be\nmaterially adversely affected by these risks. In addition to the risk factors set forth below and the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider\nthe factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024, which\nreport is incorporated by reference herein, all of which could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results.\nIf we continue to fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, our ability\nto produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing\nstandards of Nasdaq. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial\nreporting. Based upon an evaluation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are\nineffective. As discussed elsewhere in this report, on March 12, 2024, we completed the XTI Merger. Legacy Inpixon was the legal acquirer in the XTI Merger, but Legacy XTI\nwas the accounting acquirer in the XTI Merger under GAAP. In accordance with GAAP, the historical financial statements of Legacy XTI are considered the financial\nstatements of the combined company. Prior to the XTI Merger, because Legacy XTI was not subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Legacy XTI did not have the\nnecessary processes, systems, procedures, and related internal controls necessary to satisfy the financial reporting requirements of a public company. During the second quarter\nof 2024, we commenced the process of integrating Legacy XTI into our system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we believe Legacy XTI has been fully integrated into our system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nHowever, as of the date of this report, this integration of Legacy XTI is currently being evaluated by a third-party consulting firm that we engaged during the fourth quarter of\n2024 to assist in the evaluation and remediation of our internal controls over financial reporting on the combined entity. We cannot provide assurance as to how long the\nintegration process may take.\nIn order to improve and maintain the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and\nanticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. Our current controls and any new\ncontrols that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. In addition, changes in accounting principles or interpretations could also\nchallenge our internal controls and require that we establish new business processes, systems and controls to accommodate such changes. Additionally, if these new systems,\ncontrols or standards and the associated process changes do not give rise to the benefits that we expect or do not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our financial\nreporting systems and processes, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial reports, or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, our\nbusiness may be harmed if we experience problems with any new systems and controls that result in delays in their implementation or increased costs to correct any post-\nimplementation issues that may arise.\nFurther, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain\neffective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our business or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may\nresult in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could\nadversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and\n61\nTable of Contents\ninternal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect\non the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on Nasdaq.\nAny failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations\nand could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nOur failure to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market may result in our common stock being delisted from the Nasdaq\nCapital Market, which could negatively impact the price of our common stock, liquidity and our ability to access the capital markets.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “XTIA.” The listing standards of Nasdaq provide that a company, in\norder to qualify for continued listing, must maintain a minimum stock price of $1.00 and satisfy standards relative to minimum stockholders’ equity, minimum market value of\npublicly held shares and various additional requirements. If Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, we and our\nstockholders could face significant negative consequences including:\n• limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n• a determination that the common stock is a \"penny stock\" which would require brokers trading in the common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly\nresulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for shares of common stock;\n• a limited amount of analyst coverage, if any; and\n• a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nDelisting from Nasdaq could also result in other negative consequences, including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers, customers and employees, the loss of\ninstitutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nIn several instances in the past, including as recently as on July 9, 2024, we received written notification from Nasdaq informing us that because the closing bid price\nof our common stock was below $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days, our shares no longer complied with the minimum closing bid price requirement for continued listing on\nNasdaq under the Nasdaq Listing Rules. Each time, we were given a period of 180 days from the date of the notification to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s listing\nrequirements by having the closing bid price of our common stock listed on Nasdaq be at least $1.00 for at least 10 consecutive trading days.\nIn connection with the July 9, 2024 notice, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we were provided a period of 180 calendar days, or until January 6,\n2025, in which to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. However, on November 7, 2024, we received another letter (the \"Low Price Deficiency Letter\")\nfrom Nasdaq notifying us that, as of November 6, 2024, our common stock had a closing bid price of $0.10 or less for ten consecutive trading days. Accordingly, we are subject\nto the provisions contemplated under Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iii) (the \"Low Priced Stocks Rule\"). As a result, Nasdaq has determined to delist our securities from The\nNasdaq Capital Market (the \"Determination\"), unless we request an appeal of the Determination on or prior to November 14, 2024, pursuant to the procedures set forth in the\nNasdaq Listing Rule 5800 Series. We requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the \"Panel\") to appeal the Determination and to address compliance with the Low\nPriced Stocks Rule. The Low Price Deficiency Letter states that hearings are typically scheduled to occur approximately 30-45 days after the date of the hearing request. We\nwill be asked to provide the Panel with a plan to regain compliance, which plan we are in the process of preparing.\nThe Low Price Deficiency Letter has no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq and our common stock will continue to be listed on the\nNasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"XTIA.\" While the appeal process is pending, the suspension of trading of our common stock would be stayed and our common stock\nwould continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market until the hearing process concludes and the Panel issues a written decision. There can be no assurance, however, that we\nwill be successful in our appeal to the Panel or be able to regain or maintain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules.\nIf our shares of common stock lose their status on Nasdaq, we believe that they would likely be eligible to be quoted on the inter-dealer electronic quotation and\ntrading system operated by OTC Markets Group Inc., commonly referred to as the Pink Open Market and we may also qualify to be traded on their OTCQB market (The\nVenture Market). These markets are generally not considered to be as efficient as, and not as broad as, Nasdaq. Selling our shares on these markets could be more\n62\nTable of Contents\ndifficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, and transactions could be delayed. In addition, in the event our shares are delisted, broker-dealers\nhave certain regulatory burdens imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock or even holding our common stock,\nfurther limiting the liquidity of our common stock. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our common stock.\nAdverse judgments or settlements in legal proceedings could materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe may be a party to claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, which may include those related to, for example, our securities\nofferings, contracts, sub-contracts, protection of confidential information or trade secrets, adversary proceedings arising from customer bankruptcies, employment of our\nworkforce and immigration requirements or compliance with any of a wide array of state and federal statutes, rules and regulations that pertain to different aspects of our\nbusiness.\nAdditionally, we are and we may be made a party to future claims relating to the XTI Merger. On December 6, 2023, Xeriant, Inc. (“Xeriant”) filed a complaint against\nLegacy XTI, along with two unnamed companies and five unnamed persons, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On January 31, 2024,\nXeriant filed an amended complaint, which added us as a defendant. On February 2, 2024, the Court ordered Xeriant to show cause as to why the amended complaint should\nnot be dismissed without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On February 29, 2024, Xeriant filed a second amended complaint, which removed us and one of the\nunnamed companies as defendants. The second amended complaint alleges that Legacy XTI, through multiple breaches and fraudulent actions, has caused substantial harm to\nXeriant and has prevented it from obtaining compensation owed to it under various agreements entered into between Xeriant and Legacy XTI, including but not limited to a\njoint venture agreement, a cross-patent license agreement, an operating agreement, and a letter dated May 17, 2022 (the “May 17 letter”). In particular, Xeriant contends that\nLegacy XTI gained substantial advantages from the intellectual property, expertise, and capital deployed by Xeriant in the design and development of Legacy XTI’s TriFan 600\naircraft yet has excluded Xeriant from the transaction involving the TriFan 600 technology in its merger with us, which has resulted in a breach of the May 17 letter, in addition\nto the other aforementioned agreements. Xeriant, in the second amended complaint, asserts the following causes of action: (1) breach of contract; (2) intentional fraud; (3)\nfraudulent concealment; (4) quantum meruit; (5) unjust enrichment; (6) unfair competition/deceptive business practices; and (7) misappropriation of confidential information,\nand seeks damages in excess of $500 million, injunctive relief enjoining us from engaging in any further misconduct, the imposition of a royalty obligation, and such other\nrelief as deemed appropriate by the court. On March 13, 2024, Legacy XTI moved for partial dismissal of the second amended complaint, Counts 2 through 7 in particular.\nLegacy XTI argued that Counts 2 through 7 are (1) impermissible attempts to repackage claims arising from contractual dispute as quasi-contractual or tort claims; and (2)\nexpressly refuted by the clear and unequivocal terms of the aforementioned agreements. The case is in its early stages, no discovery with respect to the Company has occurred,\nand we are unable to estimate the likelihood or magnitude of a potential adverse judgment. The Court has neither scheduled Legacy XTI’s motion for hearing nor otherwise\nruled upon it. Legacy XTI denies the allegations of wrongdoing contained in the second amended complaint and is vigorously defending against the lawsuit.\nIn connection with the litigation matter described in the immediately preceding paragraph, on June 12, 2024, we received a letter from counsel for Auctus Fund, LLC\n(“Auctus”), dated April 3, 2024, claiming that, pursuant to the above-referenced May 17 letter by and between Xeriant and Legacy XTI, as a result of the XTI Merger and\nLegacy XTI’s entry into a promissory note agreement with Legacy Inpixon in March 2023, XTI Aerospace and Legacy XTI may have assumed Xeriant’s obligations under that\ncertain Senior Secured Promissory Note in the principal amount of $6,050,000 issued by Xeriant to Auctus, including the obligation to repay Auctus all principal and accrued\nand unpaid interest thereunder, which Auctus claims was $8,435,008.81 as of April 3, 2024. In July 2024, Legacy XTI responded to such letter and indicated that it believes that\nthe May 17 letter is invalid and unenforceable on several bases. It further explained that even if it were valid and enforceable, Legacy XTI does not believe such letter resulted\nin, or otherwise triggered, the assumption of obligations of Xeriant under the Senior Secured Promissory Note or any other obligation on the part of Legacy XTI. There have\nbeen no further developments on this matter. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of a potential loss, if any, on this matter. To the extent suits or actions are commenced\nwith respect to this matter, we intend to vigorously defend against any and all claims.\nOn August 15, 2024, we became aware that Chardan Capital Markets LLC (\"Chardan\") commenced an arbitration (the \"Arbitration\") before the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority (\"FINRA\") against XTI Aerospace, Inc. and Legacy XTI related to an engagement letter, dated as of June 7, 2022, by and between Chardan and Legacy\nXTI, as amended (the \"Chardan Engagement Letter\"). In the Arbitration, Chardan alleges that XTI Aerospace, Inc. is bound by the Chardan Engagement Letter even though\nXTI Aerospace, Inc. did not sign or assume the Chardan Engagement Letter. XTI Aerospace, Inc. denies that it has any liability under the Chardan Engagement Letter. Chardan\nfurther alleges that Legacy XTI and XTI Aerospace, Inc. breached the Chardan Engagement Letter by not making separate payments to Chardan of $200,000, $94,511,\n$484,044.40 and $174,000. Chardan also seeks to recover unspecified amounts relating to its alleged right of first refusal to perform banking services that XTI Aerospace, Inc.\nsupposedly did not honor, including with respect to the Company’s ATM Offering with\n63\nTable of Contents\nMaxim. XTI Aerospace, Inc. and Legacy XTI deny that Chardan performed its duties under the Chardan Engagement Letter and otherwise deny that Chardan is owed any sums\nunder the Chardan Engagement Letter. XTI Aerospace, Inc. has filed a petition in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking to stay the Arbitration to\nthe extent that it has been asserted against XTI Aerospace, Inc. XTI Aerospace, Inc. plans to prosecute the foregoing petition and, if the Arbitration is not stayed, defend against\nthe Arbitration vigorously.\nRegardless of the merits of any particular claim, responding to such actions could divert time, resources and management’s attention away from our business\noperations, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits or other similar lawsuits. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently\nuncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some of these legal disputes may result in adverse monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our\nreputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future.\nFurthermore, while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to\nvarious exclusions as well as deductibles and caps on amounts of coverage. Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to\ncoverage for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if the insurers prevail, the amount of our available insurance coverage for a particular claim.\nWe may also be required to initiate expensive litigation or other proceedings to protect our business interests. There is a risk that we will not be successful or otherwise\nbe able to satisfactorily resolve such claims or litigation. Litigation and other legal claims are subject to inherent uncertainties. Those uncertainties include, but are not limited\nto, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees, unpredictable judicial or jury decisions and the differing laws and judicial proclivities regarding damage awards among the states in\nwhich we operate. Unexpected outcomes in such legal proceedings, or changes in management’s evaluation or predictions of the likely outcomes of such proceedings, could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our current financial status may increase our default and litigation risks\nand may make us more financially vulnerable in the face of threatened litigation.\nThe obligations to the Lender (as defined below) under the Notes (as defined below) and related agreements are secured by a security interest in all of our Legacy XTI\ncommon stock and all of the assets of Legacy XTI, our wholly-owned subsidiary, so if we default on those obligations, the Lender could proceed against any or all such\nassets.\nOur obligations under the secured promissory notes (the “Notes”) issued to Streeterville Capital, LLC (the “Lender”) pursuant to a note purchase agreement, dated as\nof May 1, 2024, by and between us and the Lender (the “Purchase Agreement”), and related agreements are secured by all of the Legacy XTI common stock owned by XTI\nAerospace and all of the assets of Legacy XTI, our wholly-owned subsidiary, pursuant to a pledge agreement executed by us and a security agreement executed by Legacy XTI,\nrespectively, in connection with the issuance of the Notes. As such, the Lender may enforce its security interests over our Legacy XTI common stock and the assets of Legacy\nXTI that secure the repayment of such obligations, take control of such assets and operations, force us to seek bankruptcy protection or force us to curtail or abandon our\ncurrent business plans and operations. If that were to happen, any investment in our securities could become worthless.\nWe are subject to certain contractual limitations that could materially adversely affect our ability to consummate future financings.\nPursuant to the Purchase Agreement, in connection with the issuance of the Notes to the Lender, we agreed to be subject to certain restrictions on our ability to issue\nsecurities until all of our obligations under the Notes, Purchase Agreement and all other related agreements are paid and performed in full. Specifically, we agreed, among other\nthings, to not issue securities in any Variable Rate Transaction (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) or issue or guarantee any debt or debt instrument, subject to certain\nexceptions; provided that the issuance by us of shares of common stock in an at-the-market offering will not be deemed a Variable Rate Transaction. Such restrictions could\nmaterially adversely affect our ability to consummate future financings. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, if we breach or allegedly breach such restrictions, we will\nbe obligated to indemnify the Lender and all its officers, directors, employees, attorneys, and agents for loss or damage arising as a result of or related to such breach or alleged\nbreach, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and\nto respond to business opportunities, challenges, or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results\nof operations, and financial condition.\n64\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to comply with the restrictions and covenants in the Purchase Agreement or the Notes, there could be an event of default under the Notes, which could result in\nan acceleration of payments due under the Notes, the application of default interest and other consequences.\nFailure to meet the restrictions, obligations and limitations under the Purchase Agreement and the Notes may result in an event of default in accordance with the terms\nof the Notes. Such events include, among others, our failure to pay any amount when due and payable thereunder, us becoming insolvent or declaring bankruptcy, failure to\nobserve or perform in any material respect any covenant, obligation, condition or agreement set forth in the Notes, Purchase Agreement or in any other transaction document if\nsuch default or breach remains uncured for a period of at least five business days, and our breach in any material respect or the occurrence of any event of default under any\nterm or provision of any existing and future agreements and instruments between us and the Lender, which events could result in the acceleration of obligations under the\nNotes. Additionally, at any time following an event of default, upon written notice to us, interest will accrue on the outstanding balance of the Notes beginning on the date the\napplicable event of default occurred at an interest rate equal to the lesser of 22% per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law. Moreover, upon the\noccurrence of a sale of all or substantially all of the our assets, or a merger, consolidation, or other capital reorganization of the Company with or into another company in\nwhich the holders of equity of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such transaction continue to hold, after such transaction, 50% or less of the total voting power\nrepresented by the voting securities of the Company, or such surviving entity (a “change in control”), and without further notice to us, all unpaid principal, plus all accrued\ninterest, original issue discount, and other amounts due under the Notes, will become immediately due and payable. Such consequences upon an event of default or a change in\ncontrol could materially impair our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if the Lender accelerates the Notes, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to\nsatisfy our obligations under the Notes.\nThe redemption feature of the Notes may require us to make redemption payments at the request of the Lender, which redemptions may have a material adverse effect on\nour cash flows, results of operations and ability to pay our debts as they come due, and we may not have the required funds to pay such redemptions, which could result in\nan event of default under the Notes.\nFrom time to time, beginning six months after issuance, the Lender may require us to redeem up to an aggregate of one-sixth (1/6) of the initial principal balance of\neach Note plus any accrued interest thereunder each month (each monthly exercise, a “Monthly Redemption Amount”) by providing us written notice (each, a “Monthly\nRedemption Notice”); provided, however, that if the Lender does not exercise any Monthly Redemption Amount in its corresponding month then such Monthly Redemption\nAmount will be available for the Lender to redeem in any future month in addition to such future month’s Monthly Redemption Amount. Upon receipt of any Monthly\nRedemption Notice, we will be required to pay the applicable Monthly Redemption Amount in cash to the Holder within five business days of our receipt of such Monthly\nRedemption Notice. Such redemptions may have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and ability to pay our other debts as they come due. In\naddition, we may not have the required funds to pay such redemptions and our failure to pay the redemptions, when due, may result in an event of default under the Notes.\nThe terms of the Series 9 Preferred Stock impose additional challenges on our ability to raise capital.\nThe terms of our Series 9 Preferred Stock contain a number of restrictive covenants that may impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us while the\nSeries 9 Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless the restrictions are waived by the consent of at least a majority of the outstanding Series 9 Preferred Stock. These\nrestrictions include, but are not limited to, restrictions on our ability to (i) issue or sell any equity securities which result in net proceeds to the Company in excess of an\naggregate of $10,000,000, (ii) enter into any agreement or otherwise agree to any covenant, condition, or obligation that locks up, restricts in any way or otherwise prohibits the\nCompany from issuing common stock, preferred stock, warrants, convertible notes, other debt securities, or any other of our securities to any holder of Series 9 Preferred Stock\nor any affiliate of any such holder, except as may be required in connection with “standstill” provisions arising from a subsequent financing, provided, however, such “standstill\nrestriction” shall not exceed more than 45 days without the Required Holders’ prior written consent which consent may be granted or withheld in the Required Holders’ sole\nand absolute discretion, (iii) issue, incur or guaranty any debt (excluding any intercompany debt) or issue any debt or equity securities in any variable rate transaction (which\ndoes not include the issuance of shares of common stock in an at-the-market offering, subject to the limitations set forth in the Series 9 Preferred Stock Certificate of\nDesignation) and (iv) create, authorize, or issue, or enter into any agreement to create, authorize, or issue, any class of preferred stock (including additional issuances of Series\n9 Preferred Stock).\nFor example, sales of shares of our common stock, if any, pursuant to our ATM Offering are subject to the limitations set forth in a written consent (the \"Series 9 ATM\nConsent\") that we obtained on June 14, 2024 from the Required Holders (as defined below). The Series 9 ATM Consent provides that we may not, without the Required\nHolders’ prior written consent, register shares for sale under the ATM Offering in excess of the $47.4 million (the \"ATM Maximum Amount\") in shares of common stock\nregistered pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-279901) filed with the SEC on May 31, 2024 and declared effective on June 18, 2024 (the\n\"Registration Statement\"), a prospectus relating to the ATM Offering\n65\nTable of Contents\nincluded in the Registration Statement and an accompanying base prospectus included in the Registration Statement. The Series 9 ATM Consent further provides that we may\nnot issue or sell more than $6 million of additional shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Offering (\"Initial Tranche\") without the Required Holders’ prior written\nconsent, which consent we are required to obtain for each additional $5 million in sales of common stock under the ATM Offering after the Initial Tranche up to the ATM\nMaximum Amount. \"Required Holders\" is defined in the Series 9 Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation as the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Series 9\nPreferred Stock; provided that, pursuant to that certain securities purchase agreement, dated as of March 12, 2024 (the \"Securities Purchase Agreement\"), between the Company\nand 3AM Investments LLC (an entity controlled by the Company's former director and former Chief Executive Officer, Nadir Ali) (the \"Purchaser\"), the Purchaser will be\ndeemed a \"Required Holder\" as defined in the Series 9 Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation as long as the Purchaser holds any shares of Series 9 Preferred Stock.\nA breach of the restrictive covenants under the Series 9 Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation could result in an event of default under the Series 9 Preferred Stock\nCertificate of Designation which may require redemption of the Series 9 Preferred Stock. As a result of these restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct our business,\nunable to finance our operations through additional debt or equity financings and/or unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\na) Sales of Unregistered Securities\nThere were no sales of unregistered securities by the Company during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that were not previously reported in current reports on\nForm 8-K filed with the SEC.\nc) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nNone.\nItem 3.

The Preferred Exchange Shares will be issued in reliance on the exemption from\nregistration provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on the basis that (a) the Preferred Exchange Shares will be issued in exchange for other\noutstanding securities of the Company; (b) there was no additional consideration delivered by the holder in connection with the exchange; and (c) there were no commissions or\nother remuneration paid by the Company in connection with the exchange.\nAs of November 14, 2024, after taking into account the issuance of the Preferred Exchange Shares, the Company has 163,497,143 shares of common stock\noutstanding.\nThe information set forth below is included herein for the purpose of providing the disclosure required under \"Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers;\nElection of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.\" of Form 8-K.\nOn November 12, 2024, Jennifer Gaines amicably resigned as Chief Legal Officer of the Company, effective immediately.\n66\nTable of Contents\nc) Insider trading arrangements\nNone of the Company’s directors or officers adopted, modified or terminated a Rule 10b-5 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b-5 trading arrangement during the\nfiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, as such terms are defined under Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nItem 6.
