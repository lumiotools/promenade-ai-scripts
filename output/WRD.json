With cutting-edge technology, a strong balance sheet, and a talented team, we are committed to maintaining financial discipline while driving innovation in the industry. There are fluctuations in our gross profit which is largely driven by the mix-shift in our revenues from quarter to quarter. However, we are confident to establish greater customer base through further commercialization of our technologically leading product and services hence, stabilizing revenue and cost of goods structure. Additionally, we are committed to optimizing operational efficiency through economies of scale while strategically investing in R&D and market expansion to deliver long-term value to our shareholders.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**_Revenues_**\n\nTotal revenues decreased to RMB70.0 million (US$10.0 million) from RMB74.2 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n  * Product revenue increased to RMB15.0 million (US$2.1 million) from RMB0.1 million in the same period of 2023.

Unless otherwise noted, all translations from RMB to U.S. dollars are made at a rate of RMB7.0176 to US$1.00, the exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as of September 30, 2024.\n\n**Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures**\n\nIn evaluating its business, the Company considers and uses the non-IFRS financial measure of adjusted net loss as a supplemental measure to review and assess operating performance. The Company believes that adjusted net loss provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company’s consolidated results of operations in the same manner as it helps the Company’s management. The Company defines adjusted net loss as net loss for the year/period excluding share-based compensation expenses, fair value changes of financial liabilities measured at FVTPL, fair value changes of financial assets at FVTPL and changes in the carrying amounts of preferred shares and other financial instruments subject to redemption and other preferential rights.\n\nThe Company presents the non-IFRS financial measure because it is used by its management to evaluate its operating performance and formulate business plans. Adjusted net loss enables the Company’s management to assess the Company’s operating results without considering the impact of the aforementioned non-cash adjustment items that it does not consider to be indicative of its core operations. Accordingly, the Company believes that the use of this non-IFRS financial measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors.\n\nThis non-IFRS financial measure is not defined under IFRS and is not presented in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool. One of the key limitations of using the adjusted net loss is that it does not reflect all items of expenses that affect the Company’s operations. Further, this non-IFRS measure may differ from the non-IFRS information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore its comparability may be limited.\n\nThe non-IFRS financial measure should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to loss for the year/period or any other measure of performance information prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS or as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review the Company’s historical non-IFRS financial measure in light of the most directly comparable IFRS measure, as shown below. The non-IFRS financial measure presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measure presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting the usefulness of such measures when analyzing the Company’s data comparatively. It is encouraged that you review the Company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nThis press release contains statements that may constitute “forward-looking” statements pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

This milestone represents Singapore's first commercialized autonomous sanitation project, setting a benchmark for the broader adoption of smart sanitation technologies in the country.\n\nThe commercial launch of WeRide's two autonomous sanitation devices follows one week after the company’s receipt of M1 and T1 licenses from the Land Transport Authority of Singapore (LTA), highlighting WeRide's exceptional execution capabilities and industry-leading speed in advancing global commercialization.\n\nIn partnership with Chye Thiam Maintenance (CTM), one of Singapore's largest and highest-ranked environmental services companies, WeRide completed licensing, testing, and commercial deployment in under six months. WeRide’s Robosweeper S6 and Robosweeper S1 have become integral components of Singapore's smart sanitation ecosystem.\n\nMarina Bay’s complex road layouts and high pedestrian traffic demand precise and efficient sanitation solutions. WeRide’s Robosweeper S6 and Robosweeper S1 leverage 360-degree perception capabilities and responsive planning and control technologies to complement traditional sanitation operations through coordinated day-and-night shifts. These fully electric vehicles ensure safe and efficient operations while reducing carbon emissions, contributing to Singapore’s vision of a green, low-carbon city.\n\nChee Hong Tat, Minister for Transport of Singapore, recently highlighted on social media that the LTA has approved the trial operation of autonomous vehicles on public roads and expressed support for the development of autonomous driving technology with considerations for road traffic safety.\n\nAs the world’s first publicly listed universal autonomous driving technology company and the first publicly listed Robotaxi company, WeRide is committed to advancing smart sanitation solutions globally, fostering greener, sustainable urban living.\n\n**About WeRide**\n\nWeRide is a global leader and a first mover in the autonomous driving industry. Empowered by the smart, versatile, cost-effective and highly adaptable WeRide One platform, WeRide provides autonomous driving products and services from L2 to L4, addressing the vast majority of transportation needs across the widest range of use cases on the open road, including in the mobility, logistics, and sanitation industries.

By leveraging our cutting-edge technology, we are delivering innovative products that meet the evolving needs of the market. The launch of our next-generation GXR Robotaxi platform, backed by over 1,800 days of operational experience, reflects our commitment to upholding the highest safety standards, ensuring customer satisfaction, and prioritizing commercial viability. Our commercial expansion into seven countries and our strategic partnership with Uber demonstrate the global scalability of our technology.

With cutting-edge technology, a strong balance sheet, and a talented team, we are committed to maintaining financial discipline while driving innovation in the industry. There are fluctuations in our gross profit which is largely driven by the mix-shift in our revenues from quarter to quarter. However, we are confident to establish greater customer base through further commercialization of our technologically leading product and services hence, stabilizing revenue and cost of goods structure. Additionally, we are committed to optimizing operational efficiency through economies of scale while strategically investing in R&D and market expansion to deliver long-term value to our shareholders.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**_Revenues_**\n\nTotal revenues decreased to RMB70.0 million (US$10.0 million) from RMB74.2 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n  * Product revenue increased to RMB15.0 million (US$2.1 million) from RMB0.1 million in the same period of 2023.

Excluding share-based compensation, administrative expenses were RMB60.0 million, compared to RMB40.1 million in the same period of 2023, representing an increase of 49.6%, as the Company continued to execute its growth strategy, strengthened its organizational infrastructure, and increased headcounts across relevant functions and higher professional service fee as it transitions to a publicly listed company.\n  * Selling expenses were RMB15.5 million (US$2.2 million), compared to RMB16.8 million in the same period of 2023. Excluding share-based compensation, selling expenses were RMB13.8 million, compared to RMB6.2 million in the same period of 2023, representing an increase of 122.6%, as the Company continued to expand its sales network, build brand awareness and inform market participants on the benefits of its autonomous driving products and services.\n\n\n\n**_Net Loss_**\n\n  * Net loss was RMB1,042.7 million (US$148.6 million), compared to RMB846.8 million in the same period of 2023.\n  * Non-IFRS adjusted net loss1 was RMB240.3 million (US$34.2 million), compared to RMB154.5 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n\n\n**_Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per ADS_**\n\n  * Basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share were RMB4.93 (US$0.70), compared to RMB7.15 in the same period of 2023.\n  * Basic and diluted net loss per ADS were RMB14.79 (US$2.10), compared to RMB21.45 in the same period of 2023.\n\n\n\n**_Balance Sheet_**\n\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Company had RMB2,705.9 million (US$385.6 million) in cash and cash equivalents and time deposits, RMB13.8 million (US$2.0 million) in restricted cash and RMB850.2 million (US$121.1 million) in financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Company had long-term bank borrowings of RMB50 million (US$7.1 million).\n\n\n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nMacroeconomic economic uncertainties are expected to remain in the near term. The Company expects its total revenues to be between RMB350 million and RMB380 million for the full fiscal year of 2024. This forecast reflects management’s current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to change.\n\n**About WeRide**\n\nWeRide is a global leader and a first mover in the autonomous driving industry. Empowered by the smart, versatile, cost-effective and highly adaptable WeRide One platform, WeRide provides autonomous driving products and services from L2 to L4, addressing a vast majority of transportation needs across a wide range of use cases on the open road, including in the mobility, logistics, and sanitation industries.

Unless otherwise noted, all translations from RMB to U.S. dollars are made at a rate of RMB7.0176 to US$1.00, the exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as of September 30, 2024.\n\n**Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures**\n\nIn evaluating its business, the Company considers and uses the non-IFRS financial measure of adjusted net loss as a supplemental measure to review and assess operating performance. The Company believes that adjusted net loss provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company’s consolidated results of operations in the same manner as it helps the Company’s management. The Company defines adjusted net loss as net loss for the year/period excluding share-based compensation expenses, fair value changes of financial liabilities measured at FVTPL, fair value changes of financial assets at FVTPL and changes in the carrying amounts of preferred shares and other financial instruments subject to redemption and other preferential rights.\n\nThe Company presents the non-IFRS financial measure because it is used by its management to evaluate its operating performance and formulate business plans. Adjusted net loss enables the Company’s management to assess the Company’s operating results without considering the impact of the aforementioned non-cash adjustment items that it does not consider to be indicative of its core operations. Accordingly, the Company believes that the use of this non-IFRS financial measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors.\n\nThis non-IFRS financial measure is not defined under IFRS and is not presented in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool. One of the key limitations of using the adjusted net loss is that it does not reflect all items of expenses that affect the Company’s operations. Further, this non-IFRS measure may differ from the non-IFRS information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore its comparability may be limited.\n\nThe non-IFRS financial measure should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to loss for the year/period or any other measure of performance information prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS or as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review the Company’s historical non-IFRS financial measure in light of the most directly comparable IFRS measure, as shown below. The non-IFRS financial measure presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measure presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting the usefulness of such measures when analyzing the Company’s data comparatively. It is encouraged that you review the Company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nThis press release contains statements that may constitute “forward-looking” statements pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The Company was entitled an option to repurchase these ordinary shares at USD128.1 if an initial public offering (“IPO”) does not consummate on or before March 31, 2025. Because these ordinary shares were contingently returnable, they were not treated as “outstanding” for EPS purposes and excluded from the calculation of basic EPS prior to the consummation of the IPO. Upon the consummation of the IPO, the Company did retrospective adjustments for basic and diluted EPS of all periods presented since those shares are no longer subject to recall.\n\n**WeRide Inc.**  \n---  \n**Reconciliation of IFRS and Non-IFRS results**  \n**Nine Months Ended September 30,**| **Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nRMB’000| USD’000| RMB’000| RMB’000| USD’000| RMB’000  \nLoss for the period| (1,924,367| )| (274,219| )| (1,569,851| )| (1,042,667| )| (148,579| )| (846,759| )  \nAdd:  \nShare-based compensation expenses| 909,229| 129,564| 808,084| 617,329| 87,969| 561,651  \nFair value changes of financial assets at FVTPL| 34,564| 4,925| (37,563| )| 39,067| 5,567| (11,699| )  \nFair value changes of financial liabilities measured at FVTPL| -| -| 4,549| -| -| -  \nChanges in the carrying amounts of preferred shares and other financial instruments subject to redemption and other preferential rights| 424,175| 60,444| 408,841| 145,949| 20,798| 142,321  \n**Adjusted net loss**| **(556,399**| **)**| **(79,286**| **)**| **(385,940**| **)**| **(240,322**| **)**| **(34,245**| **)**| **(154,486**| **)**  \n  \n____________________1 Adjusted net loss is defined as net loss for the year/period excluding share-based compensation expenses, fair value changes of financial liabilities measured at FVTPL, fair value changes of financial assets at FVTPL and changes in the carrying amounts of preferred shares and other financial instruments subject to redemption and other preferential rights.\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/MTU5NzJmNDEtYmEzMi00OWY2LTkyM2QtOTcwOGVhMGQ3NzY3LTEyNTU4MzA=/tiny/WeRide-Inc-.png)\n\nSearch Investors\n\nSearch this site\n\nSubmit\n"
