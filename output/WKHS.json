We have already built and shipped the first 15 trucks under this agreement and believe we will earn a larger order from FedEx in 2025. We also recently announced several new purchase orders with independent FedEx Ground contractors and are working diligently to convert the positive conversations and vehicle demos we are having with both contractors and other fleets into firm purchase orders.\n\nMr. Dauch added: “I’m excited to announce that that we have been awarded a General Services Administration (GSA) contract, which further expands our reach by enabling federal government agencies that desire to purchase our vehicles the ability to more easily procure Workhorse vehicles. We continue to see the industry slowly, but steadily, shifting towards zero-emissions, especially in California and other key regions across the country. Workhorse stands ready as a capable and reliable partner to help businesses and government owned fleets execute on their sustainability initiatives.”\n\n**Executing Strategic and Financial Actions**\n\n  * **Creating Strong Partnerships with Commercial Last-Mile Delivery Customers:** In July, Workhorse and FedEx signed a three-year Master Framework Agreement, and FedEx placed an initial order for 15 W56 step vans, which were delivered for upfit during the third quarter. Following the FedEx Forward Service Provider Summit event in early October, the Company received purchase orders for seven additional W56 electric step vans, which are expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter for completion of third-party upfit. Workhorse continues to experience increased parcel delivery fleet interest, with multiple demos planned in California and additional units in the quoting process. \n  * **Advancing EV Product Roadmap with Extended Product Offerings:** The Company’s 208-inch extended wheelbase version of the all-electric W56 step van was certified to meet full FMVSS (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards) and received HVIP (Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project) certification. The 208-inch version extends Workhorse’s product offering to meet larger cargo-volume requirements, while providing the same efficient and robust platform as the 178-inch version. For customers interested in a reduced range option, Workhorse is currently designing and validating a 140-kWh battery option for the W56 chassis which will have a range of 100 miles per charge.\n\n\n  * **Establishing Government and Cooperative Purchasing Partnerships:** Last week, Workhorse was awarded a General Services Administration (GSA) Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) contract. This milestone allows federal government agencies to streamline procurement of Workhorse vehicles. This award follows a comprehensive review of the Company’s capabilities and inspection of its manufacturing facility, underscoring the quality and reliability of the Company’s processes and products. With the addition of GSA, Workhorse is now an approved supplier under multiple cooperative purchasing agreements, including Sourcewell and the Florida Sheriff's Association Purchasing Program, which supports police departments, municipalities, and educational institutions across the United States. In addition, the Company’s vehicles are available through OMNIA Partners via its dealer, Doering Fleet Management, and the Company anticipates adding Canoe, Sourcewell's Canadian counterpart, upon completing pending certifications for Canadian vehicle sales. These partnerships reinforce the Company’s commitment to expanding access to reliable, zero-emission trucks for public sector fleets across North America.\n\n\n  * **Conserving Cash and Extending Financial Runway:** Workhorse continues to take steps to manage costs across the organization and strengthen its financial position. During the third quarter, the Company began realizing the benefits of cost- and cash-saving measures taken during the first and second quarters to improve its liquidity and working capital requirements. The Company also received additional proceeds in the third quarter from the financing agreement entered into on March 15, 2024.\n\n\n  * **Showcasing Reliability, Durability, and Real-World Capabilities on the Road:** During a delivery route testing with FedEx Express, the W56 achieved an impressive 31 MPGe (miles per gallon equivalent), compared to the national average fuel economy of 7 MPG for internal combustion engine delivery trucks. The test demonstrated the W56’s significantly lower energy consumption per mile and reduced operating costs for fleet operators, aligning with Workhorse’s own field data. The recent 1,000-mile drive by the W56 to the FedEx Forward event in Orlando, Florida, averaging 27 MPGe in adverse weather conditions showcased the reliability, real-world durability, and performance of the step-van. Based on extensive cost data collected during 12-18 months of daily operations at Stables by Workhorse (the Company’s owned and operated FedEx Ground contractor business), the investment in EV step vans has an expected payback of less than five years, without factoring in any state level incentives. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Results**\n\nSales, net of returns and allowances, for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were $2.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively. The decrease in sales was primarily due to the non-recurrence of a $2.3 million sales allowance reversal related to W4 CC vehicle sales recognized in the prior period and an increase in W4 CC and W56 truck sales in the current period of $1.8 million.\n\nCost of sales was $6.6 million in the third quarter compared to $6.6 million in the same period last year. Cost of sales was primarily flat as increased costs related to direct materials due to higher sales volume were offset by lower inventory reserves of $1.1 million and lower direct and indirect labor costs of $1.0 million primarily due to lower headcount as a result of employee furloughs during the period.\n\nSelling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses decreased to $7.7 million in the third quarter compared to $11.8 million in the same period last year. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by a $1.8 million reduction in employee compensation and related expenses due to lower headcount, a decrease of $1.1 million in consulting expenses, a $0.3 million decrease in legal and professional expenses, and lower corporate insurances of $0.3 million.\n\nResearch and development (“R&D”) expenses decreased to $2.3 million in the third quarter compared to $5.8 million in the same period last year. The decrease in R&D expenses was primarily driven by a $2.1 million decrease in employee compensation and related expenses due to lower headcount and a $0.8 million reduction in consulting expenses.\n\nNet interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $8.3 million compared to net interest income of $0.4 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to a $5.3 million fair value net loss on note conversions and $2.9 million in financing fees related to funds received.\n\nNet loss was $25.1 million compared to $30.6 million in the same period last year.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $3.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, total receivables of $3.7 million, net inventory of $43.2 million, and accounts payable of $10.5 million.\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Overview**\n\n“We continue to take steps to extend our operational runway and manage our cash flow efficiently through reducing operating costs and improving our liquidity and working capital requirements,” said Workhorse CFO Bob Ginnan. “We are confident in our ability to generate additional purchase orders and revenue from our customers while strengthening our financial position.”\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nWorkhorse management will hold a conference call today, November 14, 2024 at 6:00 p.m. Eastern time (3:00 p.m. Pacific time) to discuss these results and answer related questions.\n\nU.S. dial-in: 877-407-8289International dial-in: 201-689-8341\n\nPlease call the conference telephone number 10 minutes prior to the start time.

(“Workhorse”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is an American technology company with a vision to pioneer the transition to zero-emission commercial trucks. We design, develop, manufacture and sell fully electric trucks. \n\nLiquidity, Capital Resources, and Going Concern \n\nThe accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) applicable to a going concern. The going concern basis of presentation assumes that the Company will continue in operation one year after the date these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are issued and will be able to realize assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classification of assets, liabilities, and reported expenses that may be necessary if the Company were unable to continue as a going concern.\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (“ASC 205-40”), management must evaluate whether there are conditions and events, considered in aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are issued. In accordance with ASC 205-40, management’s analysis can only include the potential mitigating impact of management’s plans that have not been fully implemented as of the issuance date if (a) it is probable that management’s plans will be effectively implemented on a timely basis, and (b) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will alleviate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nWe had sales of $4.7 million, incurred a net loss of $80.6 million and used $40.1 million of cash in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $3.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, net accounts receivable of $0.7 million, other receivables of $3.0 million, inventory, net of $43.2 million and accounts payable of $10.6 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of $7.9 million and an accumulated deficit of $832.2 million. \n\nAs a result of our recurring losses from operations, accumulated deficit, projected capital needs, and delays in bringing our trucks to market and lower than expected market demand, substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance date of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of management’s intended plan over the next twelve months to improve the Company’s liquidity and working capital, which includes, but is not limited to:\n\n•Generating revenue by increasing sales of our trucks and other services.\n\n•Reducing expenses and limiting non-contracted capital expenditures.\n\n•Raising capital to fund operations through the issuance of debt or equity securities, including through our 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement (as defined below) and our At-the-Market Sales Agreement (“ATM Agreement”), the sale of assets, or other strategic transactions.\n\nIt is essential that we have access to capital as we bring our existing line of trucks to market, scale up production and sales of such trucks and continue to develop additional variations of our existing trucks and our next generation of trucks. There is no assurance that we will be successful in implementing management’s plans to generate liquidity to fund these activities or other aspects of our short and long-term strategy, that our projections of our future capital needs will prove accurate or that any additional funding would be available or sufficient to continue operations in future periods. \n\nTo the extent revenues from operations are insufficient to meet our liquidity requirements, our ability to continue as a going concern will be dependent on effectively raising capital through private or public placement of our equity, debt and equity-linked securities, including the continued access to the additional closings of, as of November 18, 2024, up to $105.5 million in aggregate principal amount of additional 2024 Notes (as defined below) and, if our share price makes such exercise feasible, the possible receipt of proceeds from the exercise of the corresponding 2024 Warrants (as defined below) pursuant to the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement (as defined below), and the continued use of the ATM Agreement, for which there can be no \n\n6\n\nassurance we will be successful in such efforts. We will also rely on other debt financing or other sources of capital funding such as through the sale of assets to obtain sufficient financial resources to fund our operating activities. If we are unable to maintain sufficient financial resources, our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our ability to continue to develop, produce and market our truck programs and satisfy our obligations as they become due, the Company will be materially and adversely affected. This could affect future truck program production and sales. Failure to obtain additional financing will have a material, adverse impact on our business operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing needed to achieve our goals on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, any equity or equity-linked financings would likely have a dilutive effect on the holdings of our existing stockholders. The Company’s current level of cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to execute our business plan. For the foreseeable future, we will incur significant operating expenses, capital expenditures and working capital funding that will deplete our cash on hand. These conditions raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOur ability to obtain additional financing is extremely limited under current market conditions including the significant amount of capital required, the market price of our stock and potential dilution from the issuance of any additional securities and our ability to regain compliance with the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market. If we are unable to identify other sources of funding, we may need to further adjust our operations and seek protection by filing a voluntary petition for relief under the Bankruptcy Code. If this were to occur, the value available to our various stakeholders, including our creditors and stockholders, is uncertain and trading prices for our securities may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by holders of our securities in bankruptcy proceedings, if any.\n\nDue to these uncertainties and continued delays in market adoption of commercial electric trucks, the Company identified a triggering event under ASC 360-35-21 that required further analysis and concluded that no impairment was required.\n\nAdditional actions taken by the Company with regards to liquidity and its plan to manage operating capital include the following:\n\nFinancings under the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement\n\nAs part of management's plan to raise capital to fund operations, we have entered into a financing arrangement that makes liquidity available in both the short term and over time. On March 15, 2024, we have entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “2024 Securities Purchase Agreement”) with an institutional investor (the “Investor”) under which we agreed to issue and sell, in one or more registered public offerings by the Company directly to the Investor in multiple tranches over a period beginning on March 15, 2024, (i) senior secured convertible notes for up to an aggregate principal amount of $139.0 million (the “2024 Notes”) that are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock, par value of $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”) and (ii) warrants (the “ 2024 Warrants”) to purchase shares of Common Stock.\n\nPursuant to the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 the Company issued and sold to the Investor (i) 2024 Notes in the original principal amount of $10.0 million ($4.0 million on July 18; $2.6 million on August 23, and $3.4 million on September 30) and (ii) 2024 Warrants to purchase up to 10.1 million (2.7 million on July 18; 2.9 million on August 23; and 4.5 million on September 30) shares of Common Stock. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, $9.4 million aggregate principal amount remained outstanding under the 2024 Notes, and no shares had been issued pursuant to the 2024 Warrants. Upon our filing of one or more additional prospectus supplements, and our satisfaction of certain other conditions, as of September 30, 2024, the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement contemplates additional closings of 2024 Notes of up to $106.7 million in aggregate principal amount of additional 2024 Notes and corresponding 2024 Warrants. \n\nSale Leaseback of Union City, Indiana Manufacturing Facility\n\nAnother strategic opportunity identified by management to raise capital to fund operations was to enter into a sale leaseback for our Union City, Indiana manufacturing facility. As previously reported, on January 31, 2024, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement (the “Purchase and Sale Agreement”) with William Repny LLC (the “Union City Purchaser”) for the sale of the Company’s Union City, Indiana manufacturing facility for a purchase price, before fees and expenses, of approximately $34.5 million, in connection with which the Company would lease the property back from the Union City Purchaser. Although the Purchase and Sale Agreement has not been terminated, the Company does not believe the transaction will be consummated at the current purchase price. Accordingly, the Company is currently discussing alternative sale and leaseback transactions with other potential purchasers, as well as possible changes to the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement with the Union City Purchaser or other strategic alternatives. The Company expects that if a sale and leaseback transaction for the Union City facility is consummated, whether with the Union City Purchaser or another party, the purchase price in such transaction will be materially lower than the price provided in the Purchase and Sale Agreement. Moreover, \n\n7\n\nbecause the Union City facility is currently operating at a very limited portion of its capacity, the Company believes that it may not be possible to consummate a sale leaseback of the facility on acceptable terms unless the Company or an additional occupant begins using a larger portion of the facility and sales ramp up.\n\nCost-saving Measures\n\nAs previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 12, 2024 (the “Form 10-K”) a vital component of management’s intended plan to improve our liquidity and working capital requirements is reducing our operating costs to, among other things, reduce demands on our available liquidity. During the first quarter of 2024, we initiated a reduction in force (the “RIF”) pursuant to which we terminated the approximately 20% of our total workforce, excluding direct labor, and our executive officers agreed to defer approximately 20% of their cash compensation into the third quarter of 2024. Effective for the pay period beginning October 28, 2024 the Company will no longer defer approximately 20% of the cash compensation of our executive officers described above. However, the previously deferred compensation of $0.4 million in Accrued and other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet will remain deferred and the Company does not expect to pay such deferred amounts until it has adequate liquidity to do so. \n\nIn April 2024, the Company initially furloughed 73 employees at its Union City manufacturing facility without pay and from these 16, have since been reinstated as of September 30, 2024. The Company has not incurred, and does not expect to incur, material costs in connection with the RIF and furloughs. The Company is also currently working with certain of its vendors to extend or restructure the payment terms of certain of its accounts payable. The Company currently intends to reinstate furloughed employees when the Company’s financial and operational position permits. However, there can be no assurance that such furloughed employees will be available and willing to return to work.\n\nAero Drone Design and Manufacturing Operations\n\nManagement’s plan also included a decision to cease the production operations of our drone design and manufacturing business and transition exclusively to operating as a Drones as a Service business, as previously disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K. On June 6, 2024, the Company completed the previously disclosed divestiture of its Aero business (the “Aero Divestiture”) to a third party. The Company expects the Aero Divestiture to provide monthly cost savings of approximately $0.4 million and enhance its ability to concentrate on its commercial electric truck business. Under the agreement’s earn-out provisions, the Company will receive a portion of the proceeds if the Aero business realizes positive net cash flow but these contingencies are indeterminable at this time. The loss on the Aero Divestiture was $0.7 million of which $0.4 million was included in Selling, general and administrative expenses and $0.3 million in Cost of sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nNASDAQ Listing Requirements and Reverse Stock Split\n\nIn order to regain compliance with the Listing Requirements of Nasdaq, on June 17, 2024, the Company effected a 1-for-20 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Split”) of the Company’s then issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”). The authorized number of shares of Common Stock was not affected by the Reverse Split. The Company adjusted the exercise price, number of shares issuable on exercise or vesting and/or other terms of its outstanding stock options, warrants, restricted stock, and restricted stock units to reflect the effects of the Reverse Split. Prior periods presented have also been adjusted to reflect this change. On July 3, 2024, Nasdaq confirmed that we were in compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement.\n\nOn October 2, 2024, the Company received a second written notice from Nasdaq indicating that the Company was no longer in compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement.\n\nThe Company has been provided with a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until March 31, 2025, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price. If the Company does not regain compliance by March 31, 2025, the Company may be eligible for an additional grace period subject to certain conditions.\n\nThe Company is currently evaluating various courses of action to regain compliance. There can be no assurance that the Company will regain compliance with the bid price requirement during the 180-day compliance period ending March 31, 2025, secure an extension of the compliance period beyond March 31, 2025 or maintain compliance with any other Nasdaq listing requirement.\n\nIn addition, Nasdaq has recently adopted new rules and proposed new rules that could hinder our ability to cure our deficiency\n\nand maintain the continued listing of our common stock. These new rules and rule proposals would provide for the immediate\n\ndelisting with no grace period of any listed company that falls out of compliance with the minimum bid price requirement twice\n\nin a twelve-month period, provide for the immediate delisting if a listed company effects a reverse stock split that causes it to\n\n8\n\nfall out of compliance with certain other listing requirements, and limits the ratio of reverse stock splits to a cumulative ratio of\n\n1-to-250 in any two-year period. Delisting would likely have an adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock, decrease\n\nthe market price of our common stock, result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers, and\n\nemployees, and fewer business development opportunities, and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for our\n\ncontinuing operations, including our ability to issue and sell additional notes to the investors party to the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement or secure other future financing agreements.\n\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation \n\nThe accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the SEC regarding interim financial reporting and include the accounts and operations of the Company and those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for annual audited financial statements. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.\n\nDuring the period, the Company identified that certain items in its prior year Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were presented as combined totals, including right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities related to operating and finance leases, accounts receivable and other receivables. The Company has reclassified these amounts to separately disclose the relevant components in the accompanying financial statements. These changes in presentation do not impact total assets, total liabilities, net income, or cash flows.\n\nThe Company has elected the fair value option for its convertible debt and associated warrants. This election was made to align the measurement of these financial instruments with their market values and simplify the accounting for the components. Changes in fair value are recognized in Interest income (loss) and Fair value adjustment (loss) on warrants, respectively in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n\nIn the opinion of our management, the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a basis consistent with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of Workhorse’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented may not necessarily be indicative of full-year results. Reference should be made to the financial statements contained in our 2023 Form 10-K.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\n\nRevenue is recognized when the Company transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as the Company fulfills its obligations under the agreement, the Company performs the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including any constraints on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that it will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.\n\nThe Company generates revenue through the sale of electric trucks (Workhorse W4 CC, W56 and W750) as well as service and parts directly to dealership customers and route revenue from the Company’s Stables by Workhorse. The Company reviews the performance obligations in the Company’s agreements, which is the Company’s promise to transfer the Company’s product to customers based on the performance of services, transfer of title or shipping terms in the arrangement and any other variable considerations. The revenue is allocated based on the Company's performance obligation, and an estimate of Sales returns and allowances are recognized. The Company offers concessions to certain customers and estimates the variable consideration based on historical sales activity. In addition, the Company considers the extent to which revenue should be constrained such that there is not a significant reversal of revenue in the future. In the current quarter, the Company constrained approximately $1.1 million of revenue.\n\nOn or before shipment of the trucks, the Company bills its customers the total consideration of its obligations under the agreement. Consistent with industry practice, the Company generally offers customers a limited warranty for work performed \n\n9\n\non the truck under the builds/sales contract. The customers do not have a contractual right of return. The Company only offers a limited warranty for the work performed on the truck. If a customer disputes any work performed, the Company will attempt to remedy the work, however, it shall not be required to discount the transaction price. The Company considers this an assurance-type warranty and not a separate performance obligation.\n\nThe Company's agreements do not allow customers to return products. However, under certain conditions, such as defects or non-compliance with specifications, or other allowances, the Company may elect to allow limited returns in special situations. To account for these returns, the Company estimates and records a sales returns allowance as a reduction of gross revenue. This allowance is based on historical return rates and expectations of future returns, adjusted for any known factors that may affect return rates, such as changes in product quality or customer mix.\n\nThe Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. While the Company engages in product quality programs and processes, including quality control test driving trucks, the warranty obligation is calculated by historical warranty costs per truck. Should actual costs differ from the Company’s estimates, revisions to increase or decrease the estimated warranty liability may be required.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the accompanying notes.\n\n2. INVENTORY, NET\n\nInventory, net consisted of the following:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nRaw materials| $| 46,097,429 | $| 32,682,324  \nWork in process| 4,123,097 | 2,892,329  \nFinished goods| 5,476,095 | 18,309,829  \n55,696,621 | 53,884,482  \nLess: inventory reserves| (12,510,159)| (8,476,290)  \nInventory, net| $| 43,186,462 | $| 45,408,192  \n  \nWe reserve inventory for any excess or obsolete inventories or when we believe the net realizable value of inventories is less than the carrying value.\n\nInventory reserves represents the Company’s best estimate in value lost due to excessive inventory level, physical deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price levels, or other causes based on individual facts and circumstances. Inventory reserves relate to inventory items including finished goods, work-in-process and raw materials. Reductions to inventory reserves are recognized only when the related inventory has been consumed, sold, disposed or scrapped.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we carried inventory reserves of $12.5 million and $8.5 million, respectively. The increase in inventory reserves was primarily attributable to excess inventory due to slower than anticipated truck sales.\n\n3. CONTRACT MANUFACTURING SERVICES AND INVESTMENT IN TROPOS\n\nWe have a minority ownership investment in Tropos Technologies, Inc. (“Tropos”). The investment was acquired during the third quarter of 2022 in exchange for a cash payment of $5.0 million and a $5.0 million contribution of non-cash consideration representing a deposit from Tropos for future assembly services under an Assembly Services Agreement. The $5.0 million non-cash consideration was recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as revenue over time as assembly service performance obligations are satisfied.\n\nWe recorded our investment at cost less impairment, if applicable. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 321, Investments - Equity Securities, we assessed our investment for impairment at each reporting period to determine if the fair value declined below its cost basis and if the impairment is other-than-temporary. \n\n10\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, we determined that our investment in Tropos was impaired based on the economic conditions and uncertainties that have significantly affected Tropos’ performance and financial position. The impairment is considered other-than-temporary as the decline in fair value of the investment is not expected to recover in the foreseeable future. \n\nThe impairment loss recognized for our investment was $10.0 million, which represents the difference between the original cost of the investment and its fair value as of the impairment assessment date. The impairment loss was recognized in Other income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the previous period. \n\nThe impairment of our investment did not release the Company from its obligation to perform assembly services under the Assembly Services Agreement and, accordingly, the Company continues to be obligated to perform assembly services and carry the balance of such obligations in Deferred revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, deferred revenue related to the Assembly Services Agreement was $4.7 million.\n\n11\n\n4. PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS\n\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets consisted of the following:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nPrepaid purchases(1)| $| 6,824,168 | $| 7,908,087  \nLess: prepaid purchases reserve(2)| (1,943,969)| (1,999,068)  \nPrepaid purchases, net| 4,880,199 | 5,909,019  \nPrepaid insurance| 864,110 | 1,283,146  \nOther| 1,613,529 | 908,997  \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets| $| 7,357,838 | $| 8,101,162  \n  \n(1) Our prepaid purchases consist of deposits made to our suppliers for non-recurring production parts and engineering costs. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, net prepaid purchases primarily consisted of deposits for direct materials associated with our W4 CC and W750 trucks. The decrease in prepaid purchases as of September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 is primarily due to receipts of direct materials associated with our W4 CC and W750 trucks.\n\n(2) We record reserves on prepaid purchases that are significantly aged and for balances specifically identified as having a carrying value in excess of net realizable value. The prepaid purchases reserve represents our best estimate of deposits on orders that we do not expect to recover.\n\n5. REVENUE\n\nThe following table provides a summary of sales activity for the periods indicated:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nSales, net of returns and allowances| $| 2,169,769 | $| 2,570,250 | $| 2,753,384 | $| 7,292,417  \nOther sales| 339,948 | 458,295 | 1,938,067 | 1,396,006  \nTotal sales, net of returns and allowances| $| 2,509,717 | $| 3,028,545 | $| 4,691,451 | $| 8,688,423  \n  \nSales, net of returns and allowances, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of truck sales. Other sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of non-warranty after-sales truck services, parts and accessories and revenue generated from operating our Stables by Workhorse route, Drones as a Service prior to the Aero Divestiture, and other service revenue. \n\nDeferred revenue was $6.4 millionand $4.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, consisting of the total service fee allocated to the assembly service performance obligations under the Tropos Assembly Services Agreement of $4.7 million and certain performance obligations related to the sale of W4 CC trucks in the second quarter of 2024 that were unsatisfied as of September 30, 2024 of $1.7 million. The Company expects to recognize a portion of deferred revenue related to the sale of W4 CC trucks as revenue during the remainder of 2024.\n\n12\n\n6. ACCRUED AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES\n\nAccrued and other current liabilities consisted of the following:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nCompensation and related costs| $| 3,935,226 | $| 2,083,808  \nAccrued interest| 114,438 | —  \nSales returns and allowances| 1,102,005 | —  \nOther| 3,232,652 | 2,778,932  \nTotal accrued and other current liabilities| $| 8,384,321 | $| 4,862,740  \n  \nWarranties\n\nWe provide a manufacturer's warranty on all new trucks we sell. We record a warranty liability for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. The amount of warranty liability accrued reflects management’s best estimate of the nature, frequency, and costs of future claims. Historically, the cost of fulfilling the warranty obligations has principally involved replacement parts, towing and transportation costs, labor and sometimes travel for any field retrofit campaigns. Our estimates are based on historical experience, the extent of pre-production testing, the number of units involved and the extent of features/components included in product models. Although we believe the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in our warranty liability accrual that could be material.\n\nAccrued warranty liability activity consisted of the following for the periods indicated:\n\nThree Months EndedSeptember 30,| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nWarranty liability, beginning of period| $| 642,326 | $| 1,922,580 | $| 1,902,647 | $| 2,207,674  \nWarranty costs incurred| (61,611)| (289,404)| (189,904)| (884,717)  \nProvision for warranty(1)| 195,708 | 144,344 | (936,320)| 454,563  \nWarranty liability, end of period| $| 776,423 | $| 1,777,520 | $| 776,423 | $| 1,777,520  \n  \n(1) We record a warranty liability for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. The negative provision for warranty for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is driven by the expiration of the warranty liability related to non-current truck models.\n\n7. DEBT\n\nA reconciliation of the fair value of the convertible notes is as follows:\n\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024  \n---  \nFair value of convertible notes, beginning of period| $| 20,180,100  \nFair value of convertible notes issued during period| 45,829,120  \nPayments on convertible notes| (20,180,100)  \nChange in fair value of convertible notes (1)| (1,488,754)  \nFair value of convertible notes exchanged for common stock| (31,157,899)  \nFair value of convertible notes, end of period| $| 13,182,467  \n  \n13\n\n(1) The Company recognizes changes in fair value of convertible notes for Common Stock in Interest income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The negative provision for warranty for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is driven by the expiration of the warranty liability related to non-current truck models.\n\nSenior Secured Convertible Notes \n\n2024 Securities Purchase Agreement\n\nOn March 15, 2024, we entered into the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement with the Investor under which the Company agreed to issue and sell, in one or more registered public offerings by the Company directly to the Investor in multiple tranches over a period beginning on March 15, 2024, (i) 2024 Notes for up to an aggregate principal amount of $139.0 million that will be convertible into shares of the Company’s Common Stock and (ii) 2024 Warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock. \n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued and sold to the Investor (i) 2024 Notes in the original principal amount of $10.0 million ($4.0 million on July 18; $2.6 million on August 23, and $3.4 million on September 30) and (ii) 2024 Warrants to purchase up to 10.1 million (2.7 million on July 18; 2.9 million on August 23; and 4.5 million on September 30) shares of Common Stock. \n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued and sold to the Investor (i) 2024 Notes in aggregate original principal amount of $32.3 million and (ii) 2024 Warrants to purchase up to 15.6 million shares of Common Stock pursuant to the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement (following adjustment in connection with the Company’s Reverse Split). As of September 30, 2024, $9.4 million aggregate principal amount remained outstanding under the 2024 Notes, and no shares had been issued pursuant to the 2024 Warrants.\n\nNo 2024 Notes may be converted and no 2024 Warrants may be exercised to the extent that such conversion or exercise would cause the then holder of such 2024 Notes or 2024 Warrants to become the beneficial owner of more than 9.99% of the Company’s then outstanding Common Stock, after giving effect to such conversion or exercise.\n\n2024 Notes\n\nThe 2024 Notes were issued with original issue discount of 12.5%, resulting in $28.3 million of net proceeds to the Company before fees and expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The 2024 Notes are or will be senior, secured obligations of the Company, ranking senior to all other unsecured indebtedness, subject to certain limitations and are unconditionally guaranteed by each of the Company’s subsidiaries, pursuant to the terms of a certain security agreement and subsidiary guarantee. The 2024 Notes are issued pursuant to the Company’s Indenture (the “Base Indenture”) with U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”), and supplemental indentures thereto.\n\nEach 2024 Notes bears interest at a rate of 9.0% per annum, payable in arrears on the first trading day of each calendar quarter, at the Company’s option, either in cash or in-kind by compounding and becoming additional principal. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the interest rate will increase to 18.0% per annum. Unless earlier converted or redeemed, each 2024 Notes will mature on the one-year anniversary of the date hereof, subject to extension at the option of the holders in certain circumstances as provided therein. \n\nAll amounts due under any 2024 Notes are convertible at any time, in whole or in part, at the option of the holders into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price equal to the applicable Reference Price set forth in such 2024 Notes or (b) the greater of (x) the applicable Floor Price set forth in such 2024 Notes and (y) 87.5% of the volume weighted average price of the Common Stock during the ten trading days ending and including the trading day immediately preceding the delivery or deemed delivery of the applicable conversion notice, as elected by the converting holder. The Reference Price and Floor Price are subject to customary adjustments upon any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization or similar event. The Reference Price is also subject to full-ratchet adjustment in connection with a subsequent offering at a per share price less than the Reference Price then in effect. Subject to the rules and regulations of Nasdaq, we have the right, at any time, with the written consent of the Investor, to lower the reference price to any amount and for any period of time deemed appropriate by our board of directors. Upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, we may prepay any 2024 Notes upon 15 business days’ written notice by paying an amount equal to the greater of (i) the face value of the 2024 Notes at premium of 25% (or 75% premium, during the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, or in the event certain redemption conditions are not satisfied) and (ii) the equity value of the shares of Common Stock underlying the 2024 Notes. The equity value of our Common Stock underlying the 2024 Notes is calculated using the two greatest volume weighted average prices of our Common Stock during the period immediately preceding the date of such redemption and ending on the date we make the required payment.\n\nThe 2024 Notes contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including certain limitations on debt, liens, restricted payments, asset transfers, changes in the business and transactions with affiliates. The 2024 Notes require the Company to maintain minimum liquidity on the last day of each fiscal quarter in the amount of either (i) $1.5 million if the sale leaseback transaction of Company’s manufacturing facility in Union City, Indiana (the “Sale Leaseback”) has not been consummated and \n\n14\n\n(ii) $4.0 million if the Sale Leaseback has been consummated, subject to certain conditions. The 2024 Notes also contain customary events of default. \n\nUnder certain circumstances, including a change of control, the holder may cause us to redeem all or a portion of the then-outstanding amount of principal and interest on any 2024 Notes in cash at the greater of (i) the face value of the amount of 2024 Notes to be redeemed at a 25% premium (or at a 75% premium, if certain redemption conditions are not satisfied or during the occurrence and continuance of an event of default), (ii) the equity value of our Common Stock underlying such amount of 2024 Notes to be redeemed and (iii) the equity value of the change of control consideration payable to the holder of our Common Stock underlying such 2024 Notes.\n\nIn addition, during an event of default, the holder may require us to redeem in cash all, or any portion, of any outstanding 2024 Notes at the greater of (i) the face value of our Common Stock underlying such 2024 Notes at a 75% premium and (ii) the equity value of our Common Stock underlying such 2024 Notes. In addition, during a bankruptcy event of default, we shall immediately redeem in cash all amounts due under the 2024 Notes at a 75% premium unless the holder of such 2024 Notes waives such right to receive payment. Further, upon the sale of certain assets, the holder may cause a redemption at a premium, including upon consummation of the Sale Leaseback if the redemption conditions are not satisfied. The 2024 Notes also provide for purchase and participation rights in the event of a dividend or other purchase right being granted to the holders of Common Stock.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the contractual principal balance of the 2024 Notes was $9.4 million and the fair value was $13.2 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Investor converted $8.5 million of principal into Common Stock and we recorded a $5.3 million fair value net loss in Interest income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the nine months ended, September 30, 2024 the Investor converted 2024 Notes in the principal amount of $22.9 million into Common Stock and we recorded a $8.9 million fair value net loss in Interest income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. No fair value adjustments related to the 2024 Notes attributable to changes in credit risk were recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Going forward, any future fair value adjustments attributable to changes in credit risk will be recorded in Other comprehensive loss.\n\nThe September 30, 2024 estimated fair value of the 2024 Notes totaled $13.2 million. The fair value was computed using a Monte Carlo Simulation Model which incorporates significant inputs that are not observable in the market, and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement. The unobservable inputs utilized for measuring the fair value of the 2024 Notes reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the 2024 Notes as of the issuance date and subsequent reporting period.\n\nWe determined the fair value by using the following key inputs to the Monte Carlo Simulation Model:\n\nIssuance Date| March 15, 2024  \n---|---  \nMaturity Date| March 15, 2025  \nPrincipal Balance as of the Valuation Date| $| 9,000,000  \nRisk-Free Rate (Annual)| 5.3 | %  \nCorporate Bond Yield| 15.8 | %  \nVolatility (Annual)| 85.0 | %  \n  \nIssuance Date| May 10, 2024  \n---|---  \nMaturity Date| May 10, 2025  \nPrincipal Balance as of the Valuation Date| $| 6,285,714  \nRisk-Free Rate (Annual)| 5.3 | %  \nCorporate Bond Yield| 15.6 | %  \nVolatility (Annual)| 95.0 | %  \n  \n15\n\nIssuance Date| May 29, 2024  \n---|---  \nMaturity Date| May 29, 2025  \nPrincipal Balance as of the Valuation Date| $| 7,000,000  \nRisk-Free Rate (Annual)| 5.3 | %  \nCorporate Bond Yield| 15.6 | %  \nVolatility (Annual)| 90.0 | %  \n  \nIssuance Date| July 18, 2024  \n---|---  \nMaturity Date| July 18, 2025  \nPrincipal Balance as of the Valuation Date| $| 4,000,000  \nRisk-Free Rate (Annual)| 4.8 | %  \nCorporate Bond Yield| 17.4 | %  \nVolatility (Annual)| 80.0 | %  \n  \nIssuance Date| August 23, 2024  \n---|---  \nMaturity Date| August 23, 2025  \nPrincipal Balance as of the Valuation Date| $| 2,600,000  \nRisk-Free Rate (Annual)| 4.3 | %  \nCorporate Bond Yield| 17.8 | %  \nVolatility (Annual)| 90.0 | %  \n  \nIssuance Date| September 30, 2024  \n---|---  \nMaturity Date| September 30, 2025  \nPrincipal Balance as of the Valuation Date| $| 3,400,000  \nRisk-Free Rate (Annual)| 3.9 | %  \nCorporate Bond Yield| 15.9 | %  \nVolatility (Annual)| 100.0 | %  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the debt terms and associated covenants under the 2024 Notes. As of November 18, 2024, $5.4 million in aggregate principal amount remained outstanding under the 2024 Notes.\n\n2024 Warrants\n\nThe Investor has a purchase right that allows the Investor to participate in transactions in which the Company issues or sells certain securities or other property to holders of Common Stock, allowing the Investor to acquire, on the terms and conditions applicable to such purchase rights, the aggregate purchase rights which the Investor would have been able to acquire if the Investor held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon exercise of the 2024 Warrants. \n\nIn the event of a Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the 2024 Warrants) that is not a change of control or corporate event as described in the 2024 Warrants, the surviving entity would be required to assume the Company’s obligations under the 2024 Warrants. In addition, if the Company engages in certain transactions that result in the holders of the Common Stock receiving consideration, a holder of the 2024 Warrants will have the option to either (i) exercise the 2024 Warrants prior to the consummation of such transaction and receive the consideration to be issued or distributed in connection with such transaction or (ii) cause the Company to repurchase the 2024 Warrants for its then Black Scholes Value (as defined in the 2024 Warrants).\n\nWarrants Exercisable \n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 2024 Warrants to purchase 10.1 million and 15.6 million shares of Common Stock respectively at an exercise price ranging from $1.11 to $7.00 per share (following adjustment in connection with the Company’s Reverse Split). As of September 30, 2024, no shares have been issued pursuant to \n\n16\n\nthe 2024 Warrants. In connection with the October 16, 2024 limited waiver to the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Waiver”), the Investor agreed to waive its right to receive warrants in connection with future 2024 Notes issuances up to $14.8 million.\n\nThe September 30, 2024 estimated fair value of the 2024 Warrants as of each respective issuance date totaled $7.2 million. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a $2.6 million and $7.1 million net fair value loss, respectively, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations related to the 2024 Warrants. The fair value of the 2024 Warrants was measured using the Black Scholes model approach. \n\nSignificant inputs to the model at each respective issuance date and September 30, 2024 were as follows:\n\nValuation Assumptions| September 30, 2024| Initial Recognition on March 15, 2024  \n---|---|---  \nFair Value | $| 688,611 | $| 4,749,754  \nStock Price| $| 0.87| $| 5.32  \nStrike Price| $| 7.0000| $| 7.0000  \nVolatility (annual)| 75.0%| 45.0%  \nRisk-Free Rate| 3.7%| 4.2%  \nEstimated time to expiration (years)| 9.50| 10  \nDividend Yield| 0.0%| 0.0%  \n  \nValuation Assumptions| September 30, 2024| Initial Recognition on May 10, 2024  \n---|---|---  \nFair Value | $| 758,360 | $| 3,706,121  \nStock Price| $| 0.87| $| 3.60  \nStrike Price| $| 5.8860| $| 5.8860  \nVolatility (annual)| 70.0%| 50.0%  \nRisk-Free Rate| 3.7%| 4.4%  \nEstimated time to expiration (years)| 9.6| 10  \nDividend Yield| 0.0%| 0.0%  \n  \nValuation Assumptions| September 30, 2024| Initial Recognition on May 29, 2024  \n---|---|---  \nFair Value | $| 849,041 | $| 4,099,389  \nStock Price| $| 0.87| $| 3.80  \nStrike Price| $| 5.8880| $| 5.8880  \nVolatility (annual)| 70.0%| 45.0%  \nRisk-Free Rate| 3.7%| 4.5%  \nEstimated time to expiration (years)| 9.7| 10  \nDividend Yield| 0.0%| 0.0%  \n  \n17\n\nValuation Assumptions| September 30, 2024| Initial Recognition on July 18, 2024  \n---|---|---  \nFair Value| $| 1,296,378 | $| 2,901,545  \nStock Price| $| 0.87| $| 1.89  \nStrike Price| $| 2.9300| $| 2.9300  \nVolatility (annual)| 65.0%| 50.0%  \nRisk-Free Rate| 3.7%| 4.1%  \nEstimated time to expiration (years)| 9.8| 10  \nDividend Yield| 0.0%| 0.0%  \n  \nValuation Assumptions| September 30, 2024| Initial Recognition on August 24, 2024  \n---|---|---  \nFair Value| $| 1,384,743 | $| 1,200,626  \nStock Price| $| 0.87| $| 0.78  \nStrike Price| $| 1.1100| $| 1.1100  \nVolatility (annual)| 45.0%| 45.0%  \nRisk-Free Rate| 3.7%| 3.7%  \nEstimated time to expiration (years)| 9.9| 10  \nDividend Yield| 0.0%| 0.0%  \n  \nValuation Assumptions| September 30, 2024| Initial Recognition on September 30, 2024  \n---|---|---  \nFair Value| $| 2,252,786 | $| 2,252,786  \nStock Price| $| 0.87| $| 0.87  \nStrike Price| $| 1.2700| $| 1.2700  \nVolatility (annual)| 50.0%| 50.0%  \nRisk-Free Rate| 3.7%| 3.7%  \nEstimated time to expiration (years)| 10| 10  \nDividend Yield| 0.0%| 0.0%  \n  \nThe Company determines the accounting classification of warrants it issues as either liability or equity classified by first assessing whether the warrants meet liability classification in accordance with ASC 480-10, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity (“ASC 480”), then in accordance with ASC 815-40 (“ASC 815”), Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock. In order for a warrant to be classified in stockholders’ equity (deficit), the warrant must be (i) indexed to the Company’s equity and (ii) meet the conditions for equity classification.\n\nIf a warrant does not meet the conditions for stockholders’ equity (deficit) classification, it is carried in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as a warrant liability measured at fair value, with subsequent changes in the fair value of the warrant recorded in other non-operating losses (gains) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. If a warrant meets both conditions for equity classification, the warrant is initially recorded, at its relative fair value on the date of issuance, in stockholders’ equity (deficit) in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the amount initially recorded is not subsequently remeasured at fair value.\n\n2023 Securities Purchase Agreement (Green Senior Convertible Notes Due 2026)\n\n18\n\nOn December 12, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “2023 Securities Purchase Agreement”) under which the Company issued, pursuant to the Base Indenture and a First Supplemental Indenture between the Company and the Trustee, $20.0 million principal amount of green senior convertible notes (the “2026 Notes”) due October 1, 2026. The 2026 Notes were a senior secured obligation of the Company and ranked senior to all unsecured debt of the Company. The 2026 Notes were guaranteed by all the Company’s current subsidiaries and were secured by substantially all the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. The 2026 Notes were issued with an original issue discount of 12.5%.\n\nThe Company paid fees in connection with the issuance of the 2026 Notes of $0.6 million, resulting in net proceeds of $16.9 million. We have elected to account for the 2026 Notes using the fair value option under GAAP. All direct costs related to the issuance of our convertible notes were recognized in Interest income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the Company repaid the 2026 Notes in full.\n\nWarrants Under the 2023 Securities Purchase Agreement\n\nOn December 12, 2023, as part of the 2023 Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company issued warrants (the “2023 Warrants”) to purchase 25.6 million** shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $8.984 per share**. \n\nThe fair value of the components of the 2023 Securities Purchase Agreement was allocated between the 2026 Notes and the 2023 Warrants. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the 2023 Warrants was $5.6 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, in connection with a First Amendment to Green Senior Secured Convertible Note Due 2026, the Company entered into an agreement to exchange the 2023 Warrants for a total of 0.4 million shares of Common Stock for a total value of $2.8 million, whereupon the 2023 Warrant was cancelled. The Company recorded a gain in the quarter ended March 31, 2024 of $2.7 million in connection with this exchange in Interest income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations related to the 2023 Warrants. The transaction occurred in the quarter ended March 30, 2024.\n\n** Prior periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the 1-for-20 reverse stock split which was effective on June 17, 2024. Additional information regarding the reverse stock split may be found in Note 1 Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Principles\n\n8. LEASES\n\nWe have entered into various operating and finance lease agreements for offices, manufacturing and warehouse facilities. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease provision, at inception and record the leases in our financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for our use by the lessor.\n\nWe have elected not to record in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at lease inception that do not contain a purchase option or renewal term provision we are reasonably certain to exercise. All other lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Because most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, we used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\n\nOur leases may include options to extend the lease term for up to 5 years. Some of our leases also include options to terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For the purpose of calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain we will exercise such options.\n\nLease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as either cost of sales or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset. In connection with the Aero Divestiture, we entered into an agreement for an operating lease associated with the Aero business whereby the buyer agreed to reimburse the Company for the monthly operating lease payment of approximately $52,000 per month. In connection with the Waiver, we agreed to waive the buyer’s obligation to reimburse these amounts going forward and, accordingly, we will not realize these savings in future periods through the remaining term of the lease.\n\n19\n\nThree Months EndedSeptember 30,| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nShort-term lease expense| $| 63,428 | $| 74,058 | $| 200,858 | $| 200,733  \nOperating lease expense| 385,933 | 614,060 | 1,750,431 | 1,754,557  \nTotal lease expense| $| 449,361 | $| 688,118 | $| 1,951,289 | $| 1,955,290  \n  \nThe Company was reimbursed by the buyer of the Aero business for operating lease payments of $156,927 and $210,136 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\n\nLease right-of-use assets consisted of the following:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nOperating leases| $| 3,465,637 | $| 4,174,800  \nFinance leases| 5,470,933 | 5,621,181  \nTotal lease right-of-use assets| $| 8,936,570 | $| 9,795,981  \n  \nLease liabilities consisted of the following:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nOperating lease liabilities, current| $| 1,001,120 | $| 1,012,428  \nFinance lease liabilities, current| 2,100,635 | 2,548,184  \nOperating lease liabilities, long term| 4,556,738 | 5,280,526  \nTotal Lease Liabilities| $| 7,658,493 | $| 8,841,138  \n  \n9.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n\nWe estimate the fair value of the 2024 Notes, 2024 Warrants, 2026 Notes and 2023 Warrants using commonly accepted valuation methodologies upon issuance and at each reporting date. Considerable judgment was required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the Company’s estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company, or holders of the instruments, could realize in a current market exchange. Significant assumptions used in the fair value model included estimates of the redemption dates, credit spreads and the market price and volatility of the Company’s Common Stock. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair values. The following table presents the estimated fair values:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nFair Value| Level 1| Level 2| Level 3| Fair Value| Level 1| Level 2| Level 3  \nWarrant liability| $| 7,229,919 | $| — | $| — | $| 7,229,919 | $| 5,605,325 | $| — | $| — | $| 5,605,325  \nConvertible notes| $| 13,182,467 | $| — | $| — | $| 13,182,467 | $| 20,180,100 | $| — | $| — | $| 20,180,100  \n  \n10. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\n\nWe maintain, as approved by the board of directors and the stockholders, the 2017 Incentive Stock Plan, the 2019 Incentive Stock Plan, and 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan (collectively, the “Plans”) providing for the issuance of stock-based awards to employees, officers, directors or consultants of the Company. Non-qualified stock options may only be granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of our Common Stock on the grant date. Shares reserved for stock awards under the plans total 17.5 million. Total shares remaining available for stock incentive grants under the Plans totaled approximately 3.0 million as of September 30, 2024. We have granted stock options, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and performance share units (“PSUs”) under the Plans. \n\n20\n\nOn June 17, 2024, the Company effected the Reverse Split. The authorized number of shares of Common Stock was not affected by the Reverse Split.\n\nThe Company adjusted the exercise price, number of shares issuable on exercise or vesting and/or other terms of its outstanding stock options, warrants, restricted stock, and restricted stock units to reflect the effects of the Reverse Split. The number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Company’s equity incentive plans was not affected.\n\nStock-based compensation expense\n\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense for the periods indicated:\n\nThree Months EndedSeptember 30,| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nStock options| $| 167,700 | $| 244,887 | $| 652,168 | $| 727,996  \nRestricted stock awards| 1,459,282 | 2,385,352 | 5,333,433 | 6,952,424  \nRestricted stock units| (38,075)| — | 101,601 | —  \nPerformance-based restricted stock awards| 351,349 | 890,166 | 2,119,471 | 2,641,470  \nTotal stock-based compensation expense| $| 1,940,256 | $| 3,520,405 | $| 8,206,673 | $| 10,321,890  \n  \nStock options\n\nA summary of stock option activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is as follows:\n\nNumber of Options| WeightedAverageExercise Priceper Option| WeightedAverageRemainingContractual Life(Years)  \n---|---|---  \nBalance, December 31, 2023| 14,822 | $| 205.4 | 8.0  \nExercised| — | — | —   \nBalance, September 30, 2024| 14,822 | $| 205.4 | 7.25  \nNumber of options exercisable at September 30, 2024| 14,822 | $| 205.4 | 7.25  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, unrecognized compensation expense was $0.0 for unvested options which is expected to be recognized over the next 0 years.\n\nRestricted stock awards\n\nA summary of restricted stock award activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is as follows:\n\nNumber of Unvested Shares | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share  \n---|---  \nBalance, December 31, 2023| 256,416 | $| 52.3  \nGranted| — | —  \nVested| (105,793)| 66.6  \nForfeited| (23,595)| 48.3  \nBalance, September 30, 2024| 127,028 | $| 41.1  \n  \n21\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, unrecognized compensation expense was $2.7 million for unvested restricted stock awards which is expected to be recognized over the next 1 year.\n\nRestricted stock units\n\nA summary of restricted stock unit activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is as follows:\n\nNumber of Unvested Shares | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share  \n---|---  \nBalance, December 31, 2023| — | $| —  \nGranted| 759,120 | 6.34  \nVested| (98,582)| 6.34  \nForfeited| (83,067)| 6.34  \nBalance, September 30, 2024| 577,471  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, unrecognized compensation expense was $0.4 million for unvested restricted stock units which is expected to be recognized over the next 2.4 years.\n\nPerformance share units\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the number of unvested PSUs was 0.7 million. The vesting of PSUs is conditioned upon achievement of certain performance objectives over a performance period ending December 31, 2024, 2025 and 2026 as defined in each award agreement. For the PSUs issued in 2022 and 2023 with a performance period ending December 31, 2024 and 2025, fifty percent of the PSUs vest based upon the Company’s total shareholder return as compared to a group of peer companies (“TSR PSUs”), and fifty percent of the PSUs vest based upon our performance on certain measures including a cumulative adjusted EBITDA target (“EBITDA PSUs”). For the PSUs issued in 2024 with a performance period ending December 31, 2026, one hundred percent of the PSUs vest based upon our performance on a cumulative revenue target (“Revenue PSUs”). Depending on the actual achievement on the performance objectives, the grantee may earn between 0% and 200% of the target PSUs.\n\nA summary of the activity for PSU awards with total shareholder return performance objectives for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is as follows:\n\nNumber of Unvested Shares| Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share  \n---|---  \nBalance, December 31, 2023| 83,598 | $| 88.00  \nGranted| — | —  \nForfeited| (7,772)| 63.67  \nBalance, September 30, 2024| 75,826 | $| 90.77  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, unrecognized compensation expense was $1.3 million performance measures are expected to be met and vest and be recognized over the next 0.7 years. \n\nA summary of the PSU awards with cumulative adjusted EBITDA targets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is as follows:\n\n22\n\nNumber of Unvested Shares  \n---  \nBalance, December 31, 2023| 68,288  \nGranted| —  \nForfeited| (7,772)  \nBalance, September 30, 2024| 60,516  \n  \nThe fair value of PSUs is calculated based on the stock price on the date of grant. The stock-based compensation expense recognized each period is dependent upon our estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately vest based on the achievement of EBITDA-based performance conditions. Future stock-based compensation expense for unvested EBITDA PSUs will be based on the fair value of the awards as of the grant date. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an expense of $0.1 million related to unvested 2022 issued EBITDA PSUs. This expense reflects the fair value of the EBITDA PSUs that is expected to vest based on the achievement of the established performance targets. The future stock-based compensation expense for the 2023 issued unvested revenue PSUs will be based on the fair value of the awards as of the grant date which has not yet occurred, as the cumulative adjusted EBITDA target condition is not yet defined. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were no PSU awards expensed as cumulative revenue targets have yet to be determined. The stock-based compensation expense recognized each period is dependent upon our estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately vest based on the achievement of revenue-based performance conditions. Future stock-based compensation expense for unvested revenue PSUs will be based on the fair value of the awards as of the grant date, which has not yet occurred, as the cumulative adjusted revenue target condition is not yet defined.\n\n11. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n\nCommon Stock\n\nWe have one class of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share. Each share of our Common Stock is entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to stockholders. The Company effected the Reverse Stock Split of the Company’s then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. The Reverse Stock Split did not affect the number of authorized shares of Common Stock for issuance, and, as of September 30, 2024, our authorized shares of Common Stock for issuance was 450.0 million with a par value $0.001 per share.\n\nAt-The-Market Sales Agreement\n\nOn March 10, 2022, we established an at-the-market equity program (the “ATM Program”). Under the ATM Program, we may offer and sell shares of our Common Stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $175.0 million.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 no shares were issued under the ATM Program and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 0.5 million shares under the ATM Program for net proceeds of $2.7 million. The remaining aggregate sales available under the ATM Program is $95.6 million as of September 30, 2024. Certain of our other existing financing arrangements place certain conditions and restrictions on the use of our ATM Program.\n\nEquity Line of Credit\n\nOn December 12, 2023, the Company entered into an equity line of credit purchase agreement (the “ELOC Purchase Agreement”) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (the “Purchaser”) which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, the Company may sell to the Purchaser up to $50.0 million of shares of Common Stock over the 24-month term of the ELOC Purchase Agreement. \n\nIn connection with the ELOC Purchase Agreement, the Company paid a non-cash commitment fee to the Purchaser in the amount of 188,755 shares of Common Stock of the Company (valued at $1.5 million). The Company reflected the commitment fee as an expense in Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations based on the fair value on the issuance date. Under applicable rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market, the Company cannot issue or sell more than 19.99% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the ELOC Purchase Agreement to the Purchaser under the \n\n23\n\nELOC Purchase Agreement without stockholder approval. During nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 600,000 shares of common stock at prices ranging between $4.42 and $6.86 pursuant to the ELOC Purchase Agreement and received proceeds of $3.1 million. This activity occurred in the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The Company’s other financing arrangements substantially limit our ability to use the ELOC Purchase Agreement in the future.\n\nThe Company evaluated the contract that includes the right to require the Purchaser to purchase shares of common stock in the future (“purchased put right”) considering the guidance in ASC 815-40, “Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts on an Entity’s Own Equity” (“ASC 815-40”) and concluded that it is an equity-linked contract that does not qualify for equity classification, and therefore requires fair value accounting as a derivative asset. The Company has analyzed the terms of the freestanding purchased put right and has concluded that it had insignificant value as of September 30, 2024.\n\nPreferred Stock\n\nWorkhorse has authorized 75.0 million shares of Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share. Our certificate of incorporation provides that shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Our Board of Directors is authorized to fix the voting rights, if any, designations, powers, preferences, qualification, limitations and restrictions thereof, applicable to the shares of preferred stock. As of September 30, 2024, there were no shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.\n\nWarrants\n\nIn connection with the issuance of debt and Common Stock, we issued equity-classified warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock. As of September 30, 2024 there were approximately 15.6 million 2024 Warrants outstanding.\n\n12. INCOME TAXES\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our deferred tax liability was zero. Cumulative deferred tax assets are fully reserved as there is not sufficient evidence to conclude it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets are realizable. No current liability for federal or state income taxes has been included in these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements due to the loss for the periods.\n\n13. LOSS PER SHARE\n\nBasic loss per share of Common Stock is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average shares outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-average shares of Common Stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards and warrants using the treasury stock method, and convertible notes using the if-converted method, are included when calculating the diluted net loss per share of Common Stock when their effect is dilutive.\n\nThe following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share of Common Stock, because their effect was anti-dilutive:\n\nThree Months EndedSeptember 30,| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023*| 2024| 2023*  \nStock-based awards and warrants| 16,548,518 | 504,707 | 16,548,518 | 504,707  \nConvertible notes| 10,812,454 | — | 10,812,454 | —  \n  \n* Prior periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the 1-for-20 reverse stock split effective on June 17, 2024.\n\n14. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nAccounting Standards and Pronouncements Recently Adopted\n\nThere are no accounting standards or pronouncements recently adopted impacting the Company.\n\n24\n\nAccounting Standards and Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\nASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 related to disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments and provides more detailed information about a reportable segment’s expenses. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with retrospective application required. We are assessing the effect on our annual consolidated financial statement disclosures; however, adoption will not impact our consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations.\n\nASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with retrospective application permitted. We are assessing the effect on our annual consolidated financial statement disclosures; however, adoption will not impact our consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations.\n\nAll other ASUs issued but not yet adopted were assessed and determined to be not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements or Financial Statement Disclosures.\n\n15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\nGeneral Matters\n\nThe Company is party to various negotiations and legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. The Company provides reserves for these matters when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. The Company does not disclose a range of potential loss because the likelihood of such a loss is remote. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nCSI Litigation\n\nOn April 19, 2024, Coulomb Solutions Inc. (“CSI”), a supplier to the Company of certain of the batteries used in its trucks, filed a complaint against the Company in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan (Case No. 2:24-cv-11048). In its complaint, CSI asserts two claims – a breach of contract claim and an alternative unjust enrichment claim – that are both based upon Workhorse’s alleged failure to pay amounts due under several invoices.CSI seeks to recover damages in excess of $4 million, including alleged past due amounts, interest, and collection costs.Workhorse filed its answer to the complaint on June 4, 2024.The parties are currently conducting discovery. The Company has accrued for these appropriate amounts as of September 30, 2024.\n\n16. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS \n\nThe Company has evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and disclosures through the date the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements were filed.\n\nNasdaq Delisting Notice\n\nOn October 2, 2024, the Company received a written notice from Nasdaq indicating that the Company was no longer in compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement. The Company has been provided with a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until March 31, 2025, to regain compliance with the bid price requirement. If the Company does not regain compliance by March 31, 2025, the Company may be eligible for an additional grace period, subject to certain conditions. \n\nThe Company is currently evaluating various courses of action to regain compliance. There can be no assurance that the Company will regain compliance with the bid price requirement during the 180-day compliance period ending March 31, 2025, secure an extension of the compliance period beyond March 31, 2025 or maintain compliance with any other Nasdaq listing requirement.\n\n2024 Securities Purchase Agreement\n\n25\n\nPursuant to the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement, on October 16, 2024, the Company issued and sold to the Investor a (i) 2024 Notes in the original principal amount of $1.2 million (the \"Sixth Additional Note”). The Investor has waived its right to receive 2024 Warrants in connection with the Sixth Additional Note. \n\nThe issuance and sale of the Sixth Additional Note was made in connection with, and were conditioned upon, the Waiver of certain provisions of the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement affecting the 2024 Notes and the 2024 Warrants and a related amendment to the asset purchase agreement pursuant to which the Company made its previously disclosed divestiture of its Aero business (the “Aero APA”). Pursuant to the Waiver and related amendment: (i) the Investor waived its right to receive Warrants in connection with the issuance and sale of the Sixth Additional Note, (ii) the Investor waived its right to receive Warrants in connection with the issuance and sale, if any, of additional 2024 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of up to $14.8 million, (iii) for the period commencing on October 16, 2024 and ending on and including October 16, 2025, the Investor has waived certain provisions of the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement to permit the Company to sell up to $5.0 million in shares of Common Stock pursuant to an at-the-market offering program without a price floor and without application of certain anti-dilution and participation provisions in the 2024 Notes and the 2024 Warrants, and (iv) the Company waived the obligation of an affiliate of the Investor to make certain ongoing lease payments under the Aero APA.\n\n17. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION \n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repaid a portion of the 2024 Notes with a principal amount of $22.9 million through the issuance of 16.0 million shares of common stock. This transaction involved converting the debt into equity, which does not involve a cash outflow. However, this conversion resulted in an increase in shareholders' equity (deficit) and a reduction in long-term debt, which is reflected in the equity and liabilities sections of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n26\n\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nOverview\n\nWe are an American technology company with a vision to pioneer the transition to zero-emission commercial trucks. Our primary focus is to provide sustainable and cost-effective solutions to the commercial transportation sector. We design and manufacture all-electric trucks, including the technology that optimizes the way these trucks operate. We are focused on our core competency of bringing our electric delivery truck platforms to serve the last mile delivery market.\n\nWe continue to seek opportunities to grow the business organically, and by expanding relationships with existing and new customers. We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of long-term opportunities and continue our efforts to bring product innovations to market. \n\nRecent Developments\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, FedEx Corporation issued a purchase order for 15 W56 step vans to be delivered in 2024 (the “Ordered Step Vans”). On September 27, 2024, we completed our work on the Ordered Step Vans and made the Ordered Step Vans available for the purchaser’s upfitter to complete certain final customizations of the trucks for the purchaser. In connection with the completion of our work on the Ordered Step Vans in September 2024, we received payment in full for the Ordered Step Vans. We expect the Ordered Step Vans will be upfitted and delivered to the purchaser during the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nOn October 15, 2024 our 208-inch extended wheelbase version of the W56 step van was certified to meet full FMVSS (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards) and received HVIP (Hybrid and Zero-Emission Vehicle and Bus Voucher Incentive Project) certification. We believe these certifications not only validate the truck's safety and environmental compliance but also underscore our capability of providing reliable solutions for the electric commercial truck market.\n\nGoing Concern; Financing\n\nAs discussed more fully under Note 1, Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Principles; Liquidity, Capital Resources, and Going Concern, above, and Liquidity and Capital Resources; Going Concern, below, our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of management’s intended plan over the next twelve months to improve the Company’s liquidity and working capital requirements. A vital component of such plan is the consummation of a financing to address these requirements in the short term.\n\nOn March 15, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “2024 Securities Purchase Agreement”) with an institutional investor (the “Investor”), under which we agreed to issue and sell, in one or more registered public offerings by the Company directly to the Investor, in multiple tranches over a period beginning on March 15, 2024, senior secured convertible notes (the \"2024 Notes\") for up to an aggregate principal amount of $139.0 million that are convertible into shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value of $0.001 per share (“Common Stock”) and warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock (the “2024 Warrants”). \n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we issued and sold to the Investor (i) 2024 Notes in the original principal amount of $10.0 million and (ii) 2024 Warrants to purchase up to 10.1 million shares of Common Stock. As of September 30, 2024 we had issued and sold to the Investor (i) 2024 Notes in aggregate original principal amount of $32.3 million and (ii) 2024 Warrants to purchase up to 15.6 million shares of Common Stock pursuant to the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement (following adjustment in connection with the Company's 1-for-20 Reverse Split). In addition, on October 16, 2024, we issued and sold to the Investor an additional 2024 Notes in the original principal amount of $1.2 million. The Investor waived its right to receive warrants in connection with this issuance and sale.\n\nThe 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement contemplates additional closings as of November 18, 2024 of up to $105.5 million in aggregate principal amount of additional 2024 Notes and, if our share price makes such exercise feasible, the possible receipt of proceeds from the exercise of the corresponding 2024 Warrants pursuant to the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement. However, we may not realize the full amount available under the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement. Under the terms of the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement, our ability to issue and sell additional 2024 Notes to the Investor is restricted if the Investor has not converted previous tranches of 2024 Notes into our Common Stock and sold the shares issued on conversion. Accordingly, the Investor’s ability to make such conversions and sales, and therefore our access to additional liquidity under the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement, depends on there being a robust public trading market for our Common Stock. Since consummating the Reverse Split of our Common Stock in June 2024, the Nasdaq trading volume of our Common Stock has \n\n27\n\ngenerally been lower (on a Reverse Split-adjusted basis) than it was before we consummated the Reverse Split. In addition, on October 2, 2024, the Company received a written notice (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) indicating that, because the closing bid price of the Company’s Common Stock had fallen below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, the Company was no longer in compliance with the $1.00 Minimum Bid Price Requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market (the “Bid Price Requirement”). If these conditions continue, the $105.5 million aggregate amount of 2024 Notes (as of November 18, 2024) we can issue and sell under the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement may be reduced, and the issuances and sales that we are able to make may be delayed.\n\nIf we are not able to complete the additional closings, receive proceeds from the exercise of 2024 Warrants or find another source of liquidity in the immediate future, we may be unable to continue our operations or may need to substantially reduce them. Additional information concerning the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement, the 2024 Notes, and the 2024 Warrants is set forth in Note 1 and Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nLiquidity Improvement Measures\n\nAnother vital component of management’s plan to improve our liquidity and working capital requirements is reducing our operating costs to, among other things, reduce demands on the liquidity that is available to us. Accordingly, in the first and second quarter of 2024 we took the measures described below and started to realize the full benefit of such measures during the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n•We completed a reduction in force (the “RIF”) pursuant to which we terminated approximately 20% of our total workforce, excluding direct labor. We have not incurred and do not expect to incur additional material costs in connection with the RIF. \n\n•Generating revenue by increasing sales of our trucks and other services.\n\n•Reducing expenses and limiting non-contracted capital expenditures.\n\n•Raising capital to fund operations through the issuance of debt or equity securities, including through our 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement (as defined above) and our At-the-Market Sales Agreement (“ATM Agreement”), the sale of assets, or other strategic transactions.\n\nIn addition, on April 22, 2024, we furloughed 73 employees at our Union City manufacturing facility without pay, and we have experienced voluntary attrition of personnel, including senior managers of the Company, during the third quarter of 2024. We expect the furloughs and voluntary attrition to continue to provide operational savings. We have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, material costs in connection with the furloughs. We are also currently working with certain of our vendors to extend or restructure the payment terms of past due accounts payable balances. The furloughs, salary deferrals and vendor discussions are part of our previously disclosed strategy to reduce costs. \n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we continued to reinstate certain furloughed employees to fulfill truck production requirements for the W56. However, there is still no assurance that all furloughed employees, including key personnel will be available and willing to return to work or that we will be able to replace the employees who departed voluntarily.\n\nManagement plans to continue to seek additional opportunities to reduce costs and cash expenditures in a manner intended to minimize their adverse impact on our core operations. There can be no assurance that the measures described above, or any other cost-cutting measures we may implement in the future will be sufficient to address our immediate or longer-term liquidity and working capital needs. Moreover, it is possible that such measures will have an adverse effect on our operations.\n\nAero Drone Design and Manufacturing Operations\n\nAs previously disclosed and discussed above as part of our cost-saving measures, on June 6, 2024, we completed the previously disclosed divestiture of our Aero business (the “Aero Divestiture”) to a third party. We expect the Aero Divestiture to provide monthly cost savings of approximately $0.4 million and enhance our ability to concentrate on our commercial electric truck business. Under the agreement’s earn-out provisions, the Company will receive a portion of the proceeds if the Aero business realizes positive net cash flow but these contingencies are indeterminable at this time. The loss on the sale for this business was $0.7 million of which $0.4 million was included in the Selling, general and administrative expenses and $0.3 million in Cost of sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n28\n\nNasdaq Listing Requirements \n\nAs previously disclosed, on October 2, 2024, we received notice from Nasdaq indicating that, the closing bid price for our Stock had fallen below Nasdaq’s $1.00 minimum bid price requirement (the “Minimum Bid Requirement”) for 30 consecutive trading days, and therefore we were no longer in compliance with the $1.00 Minimum Bid Requirement. In order for us to regain compliance, the closing bid price of our Common Stock must be equal to or above $1.00 for a period of 10 consecutive trading days prior to March 31, 2025.\n\nTrucks in Production\n\nWe continue to focus on product quality, manufacturing capacity and operational planning, and engineering and design to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products and future revenue growth. During the first nine months of 2024, we continued executing our strategic product roadmap for our electric truck offerings, including the production of the W4 CC, W56 and the development of the W56 208-inch wheelbase truck program in both strip chassis and step van variants. We continued to electrify the fleet of trucks being used in our Stables by Workhorse initiative, which operates FedEx Ground delivery routes in the greater Cincinnati area. The electrification of the fleet provides us with firsthand data on the benefits and challenges of independent fleet operators experience while executing last-mile delivery operations. The initiative also provides valuable insights into how our customers can plan for and manage the transition to EV operations, including how to develop adequate charging infrastructure, training and maintenance services. In addition to our ongoing production ramp in 2024-2025, we intend to continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our trucks’ performance and functionality, and by developing new truck programs, including new W56 variants. We expect to continue to benefit from ongoing electrification of the commercial truck market and in particular \"last mile delivery\" sector.\n\nRecent Trends and Market Conditions\n\nWe continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, in this tumultuous environment and we will endeavor to project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly. \n\nMarket Demand. Our sales during the first nine months of 2024 were lower than the prior year period due to slower-than-anticipated industry wide electric truck adoption rates and lack of government subsidies and incentives available to our dealers as well as slower than expected roll-out of additional power to electric grids and the resulting effect on roll-outs of electric truck charging infrastructure, nationwide. Delayed governmental approvals in certain states and slower than expected proliferation of charging stations across the country have also adversely impacted demand. However, we expect adoption rates to accelerate in 2025, driven by more stringent state and federal emissions requirements and continued government subsidies and incentives that will continue to reduce cost barriers for EV ownership, including the approval for our W56 platform for the California’s Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project (\"HVIP\") program through California Air Resource Board (\"CARB\"), providing buyers with an $85,000 base voucher per W56 truck purchased. The accelerated adoption rates are related to the enforcement of California’s Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation (“ACF Regulation”), which is contingent upon the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) granting a waiver or determining that a waiver is not necessary. Under the Clean Air Act, California holds the unique authority to request a waiver of preemption, which typically restricts states from setting their own emissions standards for new motor trucks. The EPA’s role involves a thorough review of comments and an assessment to determine if the criteria for granting a waiver are satisfied. This regulatory landscape is a significant consideration for our operations and strategic planning.\n\nCommodities. Prices for commodities remain volatile, and we expect to experience price increases for base metals and raw materials that are used in batteries for electric trucks (e.g., lithium, cobalt, and nickel) as well as steel, aluminum and other material inputs. Global demand and differences in output across sectors have generated divergence in price movements across different commodities. We expect the net impact on us overall will be higher material costs. \n\nSupply Chain. We continue to develop relationships with suppliers of key parts, components and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products such as batteries, electronics, and truck chassis that are sourced from suppliers across the world. As we continue to execute on our new truck programs, we will continue to identify supplier relationship and truck program synergies which may allow us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale. Where available, we will utilize multiple supply sources for key parts, and we will work to qualify multiple supply sources to achieve pricing efficiencies and minimize potential production risks related to supply chain. As previously disclosed, we are currently working with certain of our vendors to extend or restructure the payment terms of past due accounts payable balances. We are also currently in litigation with one of our battery suppliers, Coulomb Solutions Inc. For more information concerning this matter, see Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q. \n\n29\n\nInflation. Inflation continues to impact our operations, resulting from both supply and demand imbalances as economies continue to face constraints as well as the impact on the availability and cost of energy and other commodities as a result of the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Israel. We are seeing a near-term impact on our business due to inflationary pressure. In an effort to dampen inflationary pressures, central bank interest rates continue to be higher, which would likely raise the cost of any financing the Company may undertake in the future.\n\nGeopolitical: Our operations and results may be impacted due to uncertainty of the political environment and the new Presidential Administration. The new Presidential Administration could affect the support for the adoption of electric trucks, as well as the availability of government subsidies to fund the adoption of electric trucks and may implement additional tariffs on imports that affect us and our industry. In addition, recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions that purport to limit the authority of federal executive agencies, including the EPA, may affect our industry in ways we cannot yet predict. \n\nThe following section provides a narrative discussion about our financial condition and results of operations. The narrative should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto included in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in conjunction with our 2023 Form 10-K\n\nResults of Operations\n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the components of the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations:\n\nThree Months EndedSeptember 30,| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nSales, net of returns and allowances| $| 2,509,717 | $| 3,028,545 | $| 4,691,451 | $| 8,688,423   \nCost of sales| 6,642,549 | 6,557,358 | 21,386,676 | 20,312,854   \nGross loss| (4,132,832)| (3,528,813)| (16,695,225)| (11,624,431)  \nOperating expenses  \nSelling, general and administrative| $| 7,722,014 | $| 11,756,291 | $| 33,883,845 | $| 40,448,651   \nResearch and development| 2,313,423 | 5,771,588 | 7,834,113 | 18,056,182   \nTotal operating expenses| 10,035,437 | 17,527,879 | 41,717,958 | 58,504,833   \nLoss from operations| (14,168,269)| (21,056,692)| (58,413,183)| (70,129,264)  \nInterest income (expense), net| (8,317,813)| 410,980 | (15,109,136)| 1,466,839   \nFair value adjustment (loss) on warrants| (2,649,477)| — | (7,089,027)| —   \nOther income (loss)| — | (10,000,000)| — | (10,000,000)  \nLoss before provision for income taxes| (25,135,559)| (30,645,712)| (80,611,346)| (78,662,425)  \nProvision for income taxes| — | — | — | —   \nNet loss| $| (25,135,559)| $| (30,645,712)| $| (80,611,346)| $| (78,662,425)  \n  \nSales, net of returns and allowances\n\nSales, net of returns and allowances for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $2.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively. The decrease in sales was primarily due to the non-recurrence of a $2.3 million sales allowance reversal related to W4 CC vehicle sales recognized in the prior period and an increase in W4 CC and W56 truck sales in the current period of $1.7 million. \n\nSales, net of returns and allowances for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $4.7 million and $8.7 million, respectively. The decrease in sales was primarily due to lower W4 CC truck sales compared with the same period a year ago, which was offset by an increase in W56 truck sales, other service revenue generated from operating our Stables by Workhorse route, Drones as a Service before the Aero Divestiture and other service revenue. \n\n30\n\nCost of sales\n\nCost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $6.6 million and $6.6 million, respectively. Cost of sales was primarily flat due to increase in costs related to direct materials due to higher sales volume, which was partially offset by lower inventory reserves of $1.1 million and lower direct and indirect labor costs of $1.0 million primarily due to lower headcount as a result of employee furloughs during the period.\n\nCost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $21.4 million and $20.3 million, respectively. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to a $3.5 million increase in inventory reserves and a $2.8 million increase in depreciation expense which was partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in costs related to direct materials, $1.4 million reversal of warranty expenses previously accrued, and a decrease in consulting expenses of $1.4 million.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $7.7 million and $11.8 million, respectively. The decrease in SG&A expenses was driven by a $1.8 million decrease in employee compensation and related expenses primarily due to lower headcount, a decrease of $1.1 million in consulting expenses, a decrease in legal and professional expenses of $0.3 million and lower corporate insurances of $0.3 million.\n\nSG&A expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $33.9 million and $40.5 million, respectively. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by a $5.5 million decrease in employee compensation and related expenses due to lower headcount, a decrease in consulting expenses of $0.7 million and lower marketing expenses of $0.6 million.\n\nResearch and development expenses\n\nResearch and development (“R&D”) expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $2.3 million and $5.8 million, respectively. The decrease in R&D expenses was primarily driven by a $2.1 million decrease in employee compensation and related expenses due to lower headcount and a $0.8 million decrease in consulting expenses.\n\nR&D expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $7.8 million and $18.1 million, respectively. The decrease in R&D expenses was primarily driven by a $5.2 million decrease in employee compensation and related expenses due to lower headcount, a $1.8 million decrease in prototype expenses related to development expenses for new products which launched in 2023, a $2.3 million decrease in consulting expenses related to the W56 program, and a reduction in other expenses of $0.9 million.\n\nInterest income (expense), net\n\nNet interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $8.3 million compared to net interest income of $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to $2.9 million in financing fees related to funds received, a $5.3 million fair value net loss, partially offset by interest income of $0.4 million due to higher cash balances in the previous period.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Investor converted $8.5 million of principal into Common Stock..\n\nNet interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $15.1 million compared to net interest income $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to $6.0 million in financing fees related to funds received, partially offset by interest income of $1.5 million due to higher cash balances in the previous periods.\n\nDuring the nine months ended, September 30, 2024 the Investor converted 2024 Notes in the principal amount of $22.9 million into Common Stock and we recorded a $8.9 million fair value net loss in Interest income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nFair value adjustment (loss) on warrants\n\nThe September 30, 2024 estimated fair value of the 2024 Warrants totaled $7.2 million. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a $2.6 million and $7.0 million fair value net loss, respectively, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations related to the 2024 Warrants.\n\nOther income (loss)\n\n31\n\nOther (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $10.0 million and represents the impairment of our investment in Tropos.\n\nBenefit for income taxes\n\nBenefit for income taxes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was zero as all income tax benefits are reserved.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources; Going Concern\n\nWe have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities and issuance of debt. We have utilized this capital for R&D to fund designing, building and delivering trucks to customers and for working capital purposes.\n\nWe had sales of $4.7 million, incurred a net loss of $80.6 million and used $40.1 million of cash in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $3.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, net accounts receivable of $0.7 million, other receivables of $3.0 million, inventory, net of $43.2 million and accounts payable of $10.6 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of $7.9 million and an accumulated deficit of $832.2 million.\n\nOur ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of management’s intended plan over the next twelve months to improve our liquidity and working capital requirements. We have made progress executing on our revised strategic product roadmap for our electric truck offerings, and we expect to generate additional sales within the next twelve months which will help support our operations. Additionally, as previously disclosed, management reduced its discretionary spend related to non-contracted capital expenditures and, implemented cost-savings measures, including a 20% reduction in force, our executive officers deferring approximately 20% of their cash compensation into the third quarter of 2024, furloughing 73 employees at our Union City manufacturing facility without pay, of which 16 have already been reinstated as of September 30, 2024, and divesting our Aero business. We also experienced voluntary attrition during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which has further reduced employee compensation and related costs. As previously disclosed, we are currently working with certain of our vendors to extend or restructure the payment terms of certain past due accounts payable balances. However, if the expected sales are not generated and management is not able to control capital expenditures and other expenses, we will continue to incur substantial operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our plans or acquiring additional funding, that our projections of our future capital needs will prove accurate, or that any additional funding would be sufficient to continue operations in future years. \n\nOur future funding requirements will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\n•our ability to produce our current generation of trucks at required scale and to sell such trucks to customers;\n\n•our ability to acquire or license other technologies we may seek to pursue;\n\n•our ability to manage our growth and operational expenses; and\n\n•competing technological and market developments.\n\nTo the extent revenues from operations are insufficient to meet our liquidity requirements, our ability to continue as a going concern will be dependent on effectively raising capital through private or public placement of our equity securities, including the continued access to the additional closings of, as of November 18, 2024 up to $105.5 million in aggregate principal amount of additional 2024 Notes. However, we may not realize the full amount available under the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement. Under the terms of the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement, our ability to issue and sell additional 2024 Notes to the Investor is restricted if the Investor has not converted previous tranches of 2024 Notes into our Common Stock and sold the shares issued on conversion. Accordingly, the Investor’s ability to make such conversions and sales, and therefore our access to additional liquidity under the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement, depends on there being a robust public trading market for our Common Stock. Since consummating the Reverse Split of our Common Stock in June 2024, the Nasdaq trading volume of our Common Stock has generally been lower (on a Reverse Split-adjusted basis) than it was before we consummated the Reverse Split. If these conditions continue, the aggregate amount of 2024 Notes we can issue and sell under the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement may be reduced, and the issuances and sales that we are able to make may be delayed.\n\nIn addition, if our share price makes such exercise feasible, we may receive proceeds from the exercise of the corresponding 2024 Warrants pursuant to the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement and use of the ATM Agreement (as further described below), for which there can be no assurance we will be successful in such efforts. We will also rely on debt financing or other \n\n32\n\nsources of capital funding such as through the sale of assets to obtain sufficient financial resources to fund our operating activities. If we are unable to maintain sufficient financial resources, our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our ability to continue to develop, produce and market our new truck programs and satisfy our obligations as they become due, will be materially and adversely affected. This could affect future truck program production and sales. Failure to obtain additional financing will have a material, adverse impact on our business operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing needed to achieve our goals on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, any equity or equity-linked financings would likely have a dilutive effect on the holdings of our existing stockholders. Our current level of cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to execute our business plan. For the foreseeable future, we will incur significant operating expenses, capital expenditures and working capital funding that will deplete our cash on hand. \n\nOur ability to obtain additional financing is extremely limited under current market conditions including the significant amount of capital required, the market price of our stock and potential dilution from the issuance of any additional securities and our ability to regain compliance with the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market. If we are unable to identify other sources of funding, we may need to further adjust our operations, including and up to filing a voluntary petition for relief under the Bankruptcy Code. If this were to occur, the value available to our various stakeholders, including our creditors and stockholders, is uncertain and trading prices for our securities may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by holders of our securities in bankruptcy proceedings, if any.\n\nAs a result of all of the matters discussed above, including our losses, current liquidity level and our projected capital needs, substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months from the date of issuance of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classification of assets, liabilities, and reported expenses that may be necessary if we were unable to continue as a going concern.\n\nUnder the ATM Agreement, we may offer and sell shares of our Common Stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $175.0 million, in amounts and at times determined by management. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 0.5 million shares under the ATM Agreement for net proceeds of $2.7 million. As of September 30, 2024 we had approximately $95.6 million available through the issuance of shares of Common Stock under the ATM Agreement. Certain of our other existing financing arrangements, including our 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement, place certain conditions and restrictions on the use of our ATM Program.\n\nSummary of Cash Flows\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024| 2023  \nNet cash used in operating activities| $| (40,115,793)| $| (95,546,635)  \nNet cash used in investing activities| $| (4,027,565)| $| (16,527,317)  \nNet cash provided by financing activities| $| 11,542,249 | $| 51,662,716   \n  \nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nOur cash flows from operating activities are affected by our cash investments to support the business in R&D, manufacturing, SG&A. Our operating cash flows are also affected by our working capital needs to support fluctuations in accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in operating activities was $40.1 million and $95.5 million, respectively. The decrease in net cash used in operations was primarily attributable to a decrease in spend related to inventory and the above mentioned cost saving measures as we slowed our inventory build due to slower than anticipated sales throughout 2023 and the first half of 2024. The decrease is also attributable to a $5.0 million decline in employee compensation and related expenses, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation, resulting from our reduction in force actions. \n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\n\nCash used in investing activities related primarily to capital expenditures to upgrade our production and research and development facilities, were $4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $16.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily driven by a decline in spending in tooling and equipment related to our truck programs at our Union City, Indiana manufacturing facility.\n\n33\n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $11.5 million, which was primarily attributable to the issuances of 2024 Notes and 2024 Warrants under our 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement and of Common Stock under our ATM Program offset by the payment of our 2026 Notes.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $51.7 million, which was primarily attributable to issuances of Common Stock under our ATM Program offset by the payment of our 2023 Notes.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nA discussion of our critical accounting estimates is contained in the Form 10-K, under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nA description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 14, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n34\n\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nFor a discussion of our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks” included in the Form 10-K, under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” There have been no material changes to the information provided in the Form 10-K.\n\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was made under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer.\n\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of a previously reported material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which we describe in Part II, Item 9A of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and because of the material weakness affecting the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 described below. \n\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records in reasonable detail to accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nAs disclosed in our Form 10-K, management identified a material weakness in the design of one of our internal controls related to the review of the fair value calculation of the convertible note and warrant liability performed by a third-party valuation expert. The controls were not designed with a level of precision that would detect the use of an inappropriate input that could have a material impact on the valuation.\n\nIn addition, during the review process related to the quarter ended September 30, 2024, management identified a material weakness in the operation of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting related to the turnover of key accounting positions within the Company’s finance organization and the ability of Company accounting personnel who have recently assumed new and additional responsibilities, with the assistance of external accounting consultants, to identify, evaluate and address technical accounting and disclosure issues that affect our consolidated financial statements on a timely basis. As a result of the Company’s previously disclosed efforts to reduce costs and preserve liquidity, the Company was not able to attract, develop and retain sufficient resources to fulfill internal control responsibilities, resulting in the lack of a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate degree of knowledge and experience. Management has determined that this deficiency is related to employee turnover and insufficient internal resources in technical accounting and financial reporting impacting our internal control over financial reporting in the third quarter of 2024 and does not affect previously reported periods. \n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, other than the remediation actions described below, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n35\n\nRemediation of the Material Weakness\n\nWe have undertaken and are continuing to design and implement remediation measures intended to address the material weakness related to the review of the fair value calculation of our convertible note and warrant liability discussed above. These remediation measures are focused on our precision of review of complex valuation models performed by independent third-party valuation experts we use to value these types of complex financial instruments. The valuation procedures are to be reviewed and approved by responsible management of the Company. Under the supervision of the Audit Committee, we are working to remediate this material weakness and will continue to report regularly to the Audit Committee regarding the status of the implementation activities.\n\nWe are in the process of designing and implementing remediation measures intended to address the personnel-related material weakness discussed above. These remediation measures will be focused on ensuring that we have a sufficient number of accounting personnel and that such personnel have appropriate training and experience with our disclosure and financial reporting process. Staffing and training plans are to be reviewed and approved by responsible management of the Company. Under the supervision of the Audit Committee, responsible management will develop a comprehensive remediation plan, including a detailed plan and timetable for implementation, and will report regularly to the Audit Committee regarding the status of the implementation activities.\n\nManagement’s Conclusion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nBased on the results of its evaluation and the material weaknesses described above, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP as of September 30, 2024.\n\n36\n\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\n\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nFor a description of certain material legal proceedings, please see Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nFor a detailed discussion of risk factors affecting us, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in the current period regarding our risk factors.\n\nIf we cannot generate or obtain additional capital, we may be unable to meet the needs of our current and prospective customers or to expand our operations.\n\nA lack of sufficient capital beyond cash on hand and funds available under our financing arrangements could significantly impair our ability to take on new customers and limit the size of the orders we can take from existing customers. We had negative cash flow from operating activities of $123.0 million and $93.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and we expect to continue to have negative cash flow from operating and investing activities through 2024. Our working capital requirements and the cash flow provided by future operating activities, if any, will vary greatly from quarter to quarter, depending on the volume of business during the period and payment terms with our customers and suppliers. We may also underestimate our capital requirements and other expenditures or overestimate our future cash flows.\n\nIn the event that we receive a purchase order that exceeds our inventory, we may lack sufficient working capital to purchase the components necessary to fulfill the order on a timely basis, or at all. We also may have to repay previously owed amounts to our suppliers before they sell us new components. If we are unable to purchase components from our suppliers, our truck shipments could be prevented or delayed, which could result in a loss of sales. If we are unable to meet existing orders or to enter into new orders because of a shortage in components, we will likely lose net revenue, risk losing customers and risk harm to our reputation in the marketplace, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we may be unable to implement our long-term business plan, develop or enhance our product offerings, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures on a timely basis. In addition, a lack of additional financing could force us to substantially curtail or cease operations. As a result, our business, operating results, liquidity and financial position would be adversely affected.\n\nWe are currently out of compliance with the Nasdaq’s continuing listing requirements, and if we fail to satisfy all such applicable Nasdaq continued listing requirements, our common stock may be delisted from Nasdaq, which could adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our common stock. \n\nOur common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, which has qualitative and quantitative continued listing requirements, including corporate governance requirements, public float requirements and a $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement. Our common stock price has been and may in the future be below the minimum bid price for continued listing on Nasdaq. On October 2, 2024, we received notice from Nasdaq indicating that the closing bid price for our common stock had fallen below the minimum bid price for continued listing for 30 consecutive trading days and was no longer in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. In order to regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must be equal to or above $1.00 for a period of 10 consecutive trading days prior to March 31, 2025. In the event the Company fails to meet this requirement by such date, the Company may be eligible for an additional grace period of 180 days, so long as it meets the applicable market value of publicly held shares requirement and other applicable listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, other than the minimum bid price requirement, on the trading date prior to the deadline, and informs Nasdaq of its intent to cure this deficiency. If we fail to meet these requirements or fail to satisfy any other continued listing requirements, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. \n\nIn addition, Nasdaq has recently adopted new rules and proposed new rules that could hinder our ability to cure our deficiency and maintain the continued listing of our common stock. These new rules and rule proposals would provide for the immediate delisting with no grace period of any listed company that falls out of compliance with the minimum bid price requirement twice in a twelve-month period, provide for the immediate delisting if a listed company effects a reverse stock split that causes it to fall out of compliance with certain other listing requirements, and limits the ratio of reverse stock splits to a cumulative ratio of 1-to-250 in any two-year period. Delisting would likely have an adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock, decrease the market price of our common stock, result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers, and employees, and fewer business development opportunities, and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for our continuing operations, including our ability to issue and sell additional notes to the Investor party to the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement\n\n37\n\nUncertain global macro-economic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nElectric truck sales and production are cyclical and are materially affected by macroeconomic, geopolitical and industry conditions that are outside of our control and the control of our customers and suppliers, including monetary fiscal policy, economic recessions, inflation, deflation, interest rates, tariffs, political instability, labor relations issues, energy prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, capital and liquidity constraints, acts of war and terrorism, and natural and man-made disasters. Our operational costs are similarly impacted by such macroeconomic, geopolitical and industry conditions, which has and may continue to adversely impact our margins and profitability, such as the announcement of potential increased tariffs on imports from China and elsewhere following the U.S. presidential election which could have a significant impact on us, particularly our ability to source cost-efficient batteries for use in our trucks. Current or potential customers may delay or decrease spending on our products and services as their business and/or budgets are impacted by economic conditions. The inability of current and potential customers to pay us for our products and services may adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. In addition, deterioration of conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures\n\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses, or if we identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect our business.\n\nAs more fully described in Item 4. Controls and Procedures, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have identified a material weakness that existed as of December 31, 2023 related to our review of third-party valuation deliverables regarding ourconvertible note and warrant liability and a material weakness that existed as of September 30, 2024 related to the sufficiency and competency our accounting personnel. As a result of these material weaknesses, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2024.\n\nUnless and until these material weaknesses have been remediated, or if new material weaknesses arise in the future, material misstatements could occur and go undetected in our interim or annual consolidated financial statements, and we may be required to restate our financial statements. In addition, we may experience delays in satisfying our reporting obligations or to comply with Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations, which could result in, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions, securities litigation, limitations on our ability to access capital markets, debt rating agency downgrades or rating withdrawals, or loss in confidence of our investors, any one of which could adversely affect the valuation of our common stock and our business prospects. We can give no assurance that the measures we have taken and plan to take in the future will remediate the material weakness identified or that any additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting.\n\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\n\nNone.\n\nITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\n\nNone.\n\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\n\nNot applicable.\n\nITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION\n\nExecutive Compensation: On November 13, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the termination of the previously disclosed 20% deferral of cash compensation by our executive officers, effective for the pay period beginning on October 28, 2024. All previously deferred compensation through the pay period ending October 27, 2024 will continue to be deferred and will not be paid until the Company’s liquidity position improves.\n\nInsider Trading Arrangements\n\n38\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, none of our officers or directors adopted or terminated any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.” However, certain of our directors and officers may adopt 10b5-1 Plans or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements in the future.\n\n39\n\nITEM 6.

We have already built and shipped the first 15 trucks under this agreement and believe we will earn a larger order from FedEx in 2025. We also recently announced several new purchase orders with independent FedEx Ground contractors and are working diligently to convert the positive conversations and vehicle demos we are having with both contractors and other fleets into firm purchase orders.\n\nMr. Dauch added: “I’m excited to announce that that we have been awarded a General Services Administration (GSA) contract, which further expands our reach by enabling federal government agencies that desire to purchase our vehicles the ability to more easily procure Workhorse vehicles. We continue to see the industry slowly, but steadily, shifting towards zero-emissions, especially in California and other key regions across the country. Workhorse stands ready as a capable and reliable partner to help businesses and government owned fleets execute on their sustainability initiatives.”\n\n**Executing Strategic and Financial Actions**\n\n  * **Creating Strong Partnerships with Commercial Last-Mile Delivery Customers:** In July, Workhorse and FedEx signed a three-year Master Framework Agreement, and FedEx placed an initial order for 15 W56 step vans, which were delivered for upfit during the third quarter. Following the FedEx Forward Service Provider Summit event in early October, the Company received purchase orders for seven additional W56 electric step vans, which are expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter for completion of third-party upfit. Workhorse continues to experience increased parcel delivery fleet interest, with multiple demos planned in California and additional units in the quoting process. \n  * **Advancing EV Product Roadmap with Extended Product Offerings:** The Company’s 208-inch extended wheelbase version of the all-electric W56 step van was certified to meet full FMVSS (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards) and received HVIP (Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project) certification. The 208-inch version extends Workhorse’s product offering to meet larger cargo-volume requirements, while providing the same efficient and robust platform as the 178-inch version. For customers interested in a reduced range option, Workhorse is currently designing and validating a 140-kWh battery option for the W56 chassis which will have a range of 100 miles per charge.\n\n\n  * **Establishing Government and Cooperative Purchasing Partnerships:** Last week, Workhorse was awarded a General Services Administration (GSA) Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) contract. This milestone allows federal government agencies to streamline procurement of Workhorse vehicles. This award follows a comprehensive review of the Company’s capabilities and inspection of its manufacturing facility, underscoring the quality and reliability of the Company’s processes and products. With the addition of GSA, Workhorse is now an approved supplier under multiple cooperative purchasing agreements, including Sourcewell and the Florida Sheriff's Association Purchasing Program, which supports police departments, municipalities, and educational institutions across the United States. In addition, the Company’s vehicles are available through OMNIA Partners via its dealer, Doering Fleet Management, and the Company anticipates adding Canoe, Sourcewell's Canadian counterpart, upon completing pending certifications for Canadian vehicle sales. These partnerships reinforce the Company’s commitment to expanding access to reliable, zero-emission trucks for public sector fleets across North America.\n\n\n  * **Conserving Cash and Extending Financial Runway:** Workhorse continues to take steps to manage costs across the organization and strengthen its financial position. During the third quarter, the Company began realizing the benefits of cost- and cash-saving measures taken during the first and second quarters to improve its liquidity and working capital requirements. The Company also received additional proceeds in the third quarter from the financing agreement entered into on March 15, 2024.\n\n\n  * **Showcasing Reliability, Durability, and Real-World Capabilities on the Road:** During a delivery route testing with FedEx Express, the W56 achieved an impressive 31 MPGe (miles per gallon equivalent), compared to the national average fuel economy of 7 MPG for internal combustion engine delivery trucks. The test demonstrated the W56’s significantly lower energy consumption per mile and reduced operating costs for fleet operators, aligning with Workhorse’s own field data. The recent 1,000-mile drive by the W56 to the FedEx Forward event in Orlando, Florida, averaging 27 MPGe in adverse weather conditions showcased the reliability, real-world durability, and performance of the step-van. Based on extensive cost data collected during 12-18 months of daily operations at Stables by Workhorse (the Company’s owned and operated FedEx Ground contractor business), the investment in EV step vans has an expected payback of less than five years, without factoring in any state level incentives. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Results**\n\nSales, net of returns and allowances, for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were $2.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively. The decrease in sales was primarily due to the non-recurrence of a $2.3 million sales allowance reversal related to W4 CC vehicle sales recognized in the prior period and an increase in W4 CC and W56 truck sales in the current period of $1.8 million.\n\nCost of sales was $6.6 million in the third quarter compared to $6.6 million in the same period last year. Cost of sales was primarily flat as increased costs related to direct materials due to higher sales volume were offset by lower inventory reserves of $1.1 million and lower direct and indirect labor costs of $1.0 million primarily due to lower headcount as a result of employee furloughs during the period.\n\nSelling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses decreased to $7.7 million in the third quarter compared to $11.8 million in the same period last year. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by a $1.8 million reduction in employee compensation and related expenses due to lower headcount, a decrease of $1.1 million in consulting expenses, a $0.3 million decrease in legal and professional expenses, and lower corporate insurances of $0.3 million.\n\nResearch and development (“R&D”) expenses decreased to $2.3 million in the third quarter compared to $5.8 million in the same period last year. The decrease in R&D expenses was primarily driven by a $2.1 million decrease in employee compensation and related expenses due to lower headcount and a $0.8 million reduction in consulting expenses.\n\nNet interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $8.3 million compared to net interest income of $0.4 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to a $5.3 million fair value net loss on note conversions and $2.9 million in financing fees related to funds received.\n\nNet loss was $25.1 million compared to $30.6 million in the same period last year.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $3.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, total receivables of $3.7 million, net inventory of $43.2 million, and accounts payable of $10.5 million.\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Overview**\n\n“We continue to take steps to extend our operational runway and manage our cash flow efficiently through reducing operating costs and improving our liquidity and working capital requirements,” said Workhorse CFO Bob Ginnan. “We are confident in our ability to generate additional purchase orders and revenue from our customers while strengthening our financial position.”\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nWorkhorse management will hold a conference call today, November 14, 2024 at 6:00 p.m. Eastern time (3:00 p.m. Pacific time) to discuss these results and answer related questions.\n\nU.S. dial-in: 877-407-8289International dial-in: 201-689-8341\n\nPlease call the conference telephone number 10 minutes prior to the start time.

We expressly disclaim\nany obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with\nregard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except as required by law.\nAll references in this Report that refer to the “Company”, “Workhorse Group”, “Workhorse”, “we,” “us” or “our” are to Workhorse Group Inc.\nii\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nRecent Developments\nGoing Concern; Possible Financing\nAs discussed more fully under Risk Factors and Liquidity and Capital Resources; Going Concern, below, our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon\nsuccessful execution of management’s intended plan over the next twelve months to improve the Company’s liquidity and working capital requirements. A vital component of\nsuch plan is the consummation of a financing in the immediate future to address these requirements in the short term.\nAccordingly, the Company is in the process of negotiating with potential financing sources for a financing transaction that would make liquidity available both in the short term\nand over time (a “Possible Financing”). The Company intends to consummate a Possible Financing in the near future.\nAlthough the terms of a Possible Financing remain under negotiation, the Company currently expects that any such financing would have a cost of capital materially higher than\nthe cost of capital of its existing financing arrangements and a substantial potentially dilutive equity component, whether through a conversion feature, significant warrant\ncoverage or both. A Possible Financing may also contain terms that limit the Company’s ability to sell common stock under its ATM Agreement and ELOC Agreement and to\nincur new debt.\nThere is no assurance that any Possible Financing will be available on any terms .If we are not able to complete a Possible Financing or find another source of liquidity in the\nimmediate future, we may be unable to continue our operations or may need to substantially reduce them.\nAdditional Cost Reduction Measures\nAnother vital component of management’s intended plan over the next twelve months to improve our liquidity and working capital requirements is reducing our operating costs\nto, among other things, reduce demands on the liquidity that is available to us. Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2024 we took the measures described below.\n• We are in the process of completing a reduction in force (the “RIF”) pursuant to which we terminated approximately 20% of our total workforce, excluding direct labor.\nWe do not expect to incur material costs in connection with the RIF.\n• Each of our executive officers agreed to defer payment of approximately 20% of their cash compensation into the second quarter of 2024.\n• As described more fully below, we decided to fully transition our Aero business from a design and manufacturing drone business to Drones as a Service business. This\ntransition has resulted in, among other things, our stopping production and development of both drone product lines and the termination of employees who performed\nthe related work.\nThese measures are in addition to cost-reduction measures that we have implemented in prior periods, including those described in Note 16S, ubsequent Events, to the\nconsolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management plans to continue to seek additional opportunities to reduce costs and, in\nparticular, cash expenditures, in a manner intended to minimize their adverse impact on our core operations. There can be no assurance that the measures described above, or\nany other cost-cutting measures we may implement in the future will be sufficient to address our immediate or longer-term liquidity and working capital needs. Moreover, it is\npossible that such measures will have an adverse effect on our operations.\nNASDAQ Listing Requirements; Proposed Reverse Stock Split\nAs previously disclosed, on September 22, 2023, we received notice from Nasdaq indicating that the closing bid price for our common stock had fallen below the $1.00\nminimum bid price for continued listing for 30 consecutive trading days and was no longer in compliance with the minimum bid requirement. In order for the Company to\nregain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must be equal to or above the $1.00 minimum bid price for a period of 10 consecutive trading days prior\n1\nto March 20, 2024. Based on recent trading prices of our common stock, we believe that it is highly unlikely that we will be able to meet this requirement by that date.\nAccordingly, we intend to regain compliance by effecting a reverse split of our common stock (the “Reverse Split”) following the 2024 Annual General Meeting of our\nstockholders. We will be able to effect the Reverse Split only if our stockholders vote to approve it. It is possible that our stockholders will not approve the Reverse Split, and\nwe may not be able to regain compliance with the NASDAQ continuing listing requirements if we do not effect the Reverse Split. The Reverse Split also presents certain other\nrisks to the Company and its stockholders, including the risk of a decline in the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors,\n“We are currently out of compliance with the Nasdaq’s continuing listing requirements and if we fail to satisfy all such applicable Nasdaq continued listing requirements, our\ncommon stock may be delisted from Nasdaq, which could have an adverse impact on the liquidity and market price of our common stock, and our plan to regain compliance\nwith these requirements may have an adverse effect on the Company and its stockholders' for more information.\nOverview\nWe are an American technology company with a vision to pioneer the transition to zero-emission commercial vehicles. Our primary focus is to provide sustainable and cost-\neffective solutions to the commercial transportation sector. We design and manufacture all-electric delivery trucks and drone systems, including the technology that optimizes\nthe way these vehicles operate. We are focused on our core competency of bringing our electric delivery vehicle platforms to serve the last mile delivery market.\nWe are an American-based Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”), and our products are marketed under the Workhorse® brand. All Workhorse last-mile delivery trucks\nare assembled in our Union City, Indiana production facility. All Workhorse drone systems are designed and built in our Mason, Ohio facility.\nWe believe our all-electric commercial vehicles offer fleet operators significant benefits, which include:\n• Lower total cost-of-ownership as compared to conventional gas/diesel vehicles;\n• Improved profitability through lower maintenance costs and reduced fuel expenses;\n• Increased package deliveries per day through use of more efficient delivery methods;\n• Decreased vehicle emissions and reduced carbon footprint; and\n• Improved vehicle safety and operator experience.\nCommercial Vehicles\nWe currently manufacture Class 4 and 5/6 commercial delivery vehicles. During 2023, we launched the W56, a new truck chassis platform, which is the foundation of our\nrevised strategic product roadmap. The W56, based on long-standing Company know-how in the Class 5/6 truck chassis market, is a robust medium-duty chassis, designed for\nlast-mile delivery and high payload work-truck applications. Initially the W56 is delivered in either a stripped chassis or complete step van configuration. We intend to introduce\na longer-wheelbase and cab-chassis version of the W56. Our product roadmap also includes the WNext, which we will be our second generation, low floor, advanced content\noffering for the truck chassis market, expanding our vehicle foundation and is expected to begin production in late 2025 or 2026.\nTo accelerate time-to-market for customers seeking delivery of electric vehicles during 2023, we produced and sold Class 4 vehicles using a supplied base vehicle. Our Class 4\nvehicles are a zero-emission chassis designed to be sold in either a cab chassis version (“W4 CC”) or a step van version (“W750”) made to haul various cargo and take on both\nmid and last-mile routes. The W750 was launched into production and sale in 2023, in addition to the W4 CC, which became available for sale in 2022. Both are sold under the\nWorkhorse brand and with Workhorse after sales and support service.\nWe generally sell our vehicles through our Certified Dealer Program, which is our official network of verified dealers trained to safely maintain and repair the electric\ncomponents of our vehicles to support our customers.\nStables by Workhorse\nIn 2023, we continued to electrify our fleet of delivery vehicles being used to operate our Stables by Workhorse program, a series of FedEx Ground delivery routes in the\ngreater Cincinnati, Ohio area. Stables by Workhorse provides us with firsthand experiences of the challenges and benefits independent fleet operators experience while\nexecuting last-mile delivery operations and making the transition to electric vehicles. During 2023 we began the electrification of the Stables fleet, which provides us\n2\nfurther experience and data on the benefits and challenges of independent fleet operators experience. The entire fleet is expected to be electrified in 2024. The initiative is\ndesigned to provide valuable insights into how our customers can plan for and manage the transition to Electric Vehicle (“EV”) operations, including how to develop adequate\ncharging infrastructure, training and maintenance services and the associated total cost of EV transition and ownership.\nAero\nIn addition to our growing delivery vehicle technology portfolio, we have developed Drones as a Service (“DaaS”) data products. As part of the pilot program, we offer\nUnmanned Aerial Systems (“UAS”) services, including monitoring via drone, data procurement and analytics using Light Detection and Ranging (“LiDar”), which provides\nstakeholders the ability increase the efficiency of their land. We have successfully demonstrated our DaaS enhanced functionality working with local, state and federal\ngovernment agencies to validate other, new cases, including supporting the US Department of Agriculture's National Resource Conservation Service (“NRCS”) where we\nprovided enhanced geographical mapping and data analysis for the LiDar missions.\nWe successfully developed two product lines of small UAS, which moved into production during 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, we have made the decision to fully\ntransition from a design and manufacturing drone business to DaaS. This transition has resulted in, among other things, our stopping production and development of both\nproduct lines and the termination of employees who performed the related work. For more information, see Note 16, Subsequent Events – Aero Drone Design and\nManufacturing Operations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLocations and Facilities\nOur company headquarters and research and development facilities are located in the Greater Cincinnati area in Ohio. We manufacture and test our electric delivery trucks at\nour manufacturing facility located in Union City, Indiana. We also operate an engineering and technical design center in Wixom, Michigan as well as an engineering, technical\ndesign and production facility for our DaaS in Mason, Ohio.\nMarketing\nWe are focused on building brand awareness, generating interest in our product offerings and establishing a robust dealer network. Our recently launched, revamped website\nreflects our current branding and provides relevant educational and information content to our customers about our products. We also utilize industry events and publications to\ntarget potential customers and we leverage social media channels to engage with our various audiences. We effectively utilize product demonstration opportunities to highlight\nthe robust features and reliability of our products.\nOur commercial vehicle sales channels include our certified dealer network and direct fleet sales focused on large fleet systems throughout the country. Aero Drones as a\nService and sales are focused on various industries including agriculture, first-responders and last-mile delivery targeting government and non-government organizations alike.\nTechnology, Research and Development\nOur technology focus is on developing complete-vehicle solutions for manufacture, and on software systems to support the use and maintenance of those vehicles. Research and\ndevelopment activities are conducted in-house at our Commercial Vehicle facilities in Sharonville, OH and Wixom, MI, and at our Aero facility in Mason, OH, and are carried\nout by staff located at those facilities.\nCommercial Vehicle\nCommercial Vehicle activities are focused on the development and integration of EV powertrain, commercial chassis, and commercial truck bodies into OEM vehicles for\nproduction in our Union City, IN facility. In 2023, those activities included the development, validation, certification and production launch of the W56 strip chassis and step\nvan products, and continued improvements to our W4CC and W750 products.\nWe continue to develop and maintain our remote data telematics system that tracks the performance of all the vehicles we deploy, providing vehicle operational and service data\nto our customers and partners. We continue to work on integration of our telematics data with the internal telematics and data management systems of our clients, as well as\nexpanding our ability to present and analyze data within a proprietary Workhorse interface. In 2023 we continued the development of a 2.0 level release of our prior offering,\nwith a new software and data management architecture that is the base for Workhorse telematics and a future suite of business applications such as fleet management and\nservice and repair.\n3\nCompetition\nWe believe that our last-mile delivery EVs compete in both the internal combustion delivery vehicle space and delivery EV space. The shift in consumer behavior to home-\ndelivery, as well as shifting regulatory requirements in the commercial vehicle space, continue to place more emphasis on EV work-trucks, which leaves a significant, and\ngrowing need for zero-emissions commercial vehicles in the class 4 through 6 work-truck space where Workhorse competes. The North American last-mile delivery market is\nthe largest in the world, with a market size expected to more than double over the next decade. Yet electrification is just emerging within the segment. Workhorse commercial\nvehicles face competition from both traditional, established OEMs, who are expanding their product lines into the commercial EV space and from new-entrants, focused solely\non the commercial EV market.\nOf the 23 North American truck classifications, Advanced Clean Trucks (“ACT”) Research identified Class 4-6 as the one with the lowest total cost of ownership and fastest\npayback period compared to internal combustion engine (“ICE”) vehicles. The Workhorse team’s sole focus is to provide Class 4-6 with electric trucks. Our ability to compete\nrelies upon the ability to field high-quality, reliable, and cost-competitive vehicles that deliver lower total-cost-of-ownership benefits to customers. Our market research and\ndirect customer engagements have helped us provide value to some of the largest and most efficient last mile delivery companies in North America, through deployment of our\nE-Series, which was produced until 2018. While traditional and non-traditional OEMs are placing increased focus on the EV space, we believe the expansion of the\ndevelopment of the electric vehicle market highlights the benefits of electric vehicles relative to the internal combustion vehicles and will benefit us.\nSupply Chain\nWe continue to develop relationships with suppliers of key parts, components and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products such as batteries, electronics, and\nvehicle chassis that are sourced from suppliers across the world. As we continue to execute on our new vehicle programs, we will continue to identify supplier relationship and\nvehicle program synergies which may allow us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale. Where available, we will utilize multiple supply sources for\nkey parts, and we will work to qualify multiple supply sources to achieve pricing efficiencies and minimize potential production risks related to supply chain.\nRegulatory\nOur electric vehicles are designed to comply with required government regulations and industry standards. Government regulations regarding the manufacture, sale and\nimplementation of products and systems similar to our electric vehicles are subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes may have on our\nbusiness.\nEmission and fuel economy standards\nGovernment regulation related to climate change is in effect at the U.S. federal and state levels. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the National Highway\nTraffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) issued final rules for greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy requirements for trucks and heavy-duty engines which increased\nthe stringency of the standards for model years 2021 through 2027.\nThe rules provide emission standards for CO2 and fuel consumption standards for three main categories of vehicles: (i) combination tractors; (ii) heavy-duty pickup trucks and\nvans; and (iii) vocational vehicles. We believe Workhorse vehicles would be considered “vocational vehicles” and “heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans” under the rules.\nAccording to the EPA and NHTSA, vocational vehicles consist of a wide variety of truck and bus types, including delivery, refuse, utility, dump, cement, transit bus, shuttle\nbus, school bus, emergency vehicles, motor homes and tow trucks, and are characterized by a complex build process, with an incomplete chassis often built with an engine and\ntransmission purchased from other manufacturers, then sold to a body manufacturer.\nThe EPA and NHTSA rule also establishes multiple incentive programs for manufacturers of alternatively fueled vehicles, such as the Workhorse vehicles. Programs include an\nengine Averaging, Banking and Trading (“ABT”) program, a vehicle ABT program and additional credit programs for early adoption of standards or deployment of advanced or\ninnovative technologies. The ABT programs will allow for emission and/or fuel consumption credits to be averaged, banked or traded within defined groupings of the regulatory\nsubcategories. The additional credit programs will allow manufacturers of engines and vehicles to be eligible to generate credits if they demonstrate improvements more than\nthe standards established in the rule prior to the model year the standards become effective or if they introduce advanced or innovative technology engines or vehicles.\n4\nOn April 12, 2023, the EPA announced a proposal for more stringent standards to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from heavy-duty (“HD”) vehicles beginning in model year\n(“MY”) 2027. The new standards would be applicable to HD vocational vehicles (such as delivery trucks, refuse haulers, public utility trucks, transit, shuttle, school buses, etc.)\nand tractors (such as day cabs and sleeper cabs on tractor-trailer trucks). Specifically, the EPA is proposing stronger CO2 standards for MY 2027 HD vehicles that go beyond\nthe current standards that apply under the HD Phase 2 Greenhouse Gas program. The EPA is also proposing an additional set of CO2 standards for HD vehicles that would\nbegin to apply in MY 2028, with progressively lower standards each model year through 2032.\nThe Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity (“CoC”) issued by the EPA Federal emissions compliance. In the state of California, an Executive Order\nissued by the California Air Resource Board (“CARB”) is required for emissions compliance, examined and issued with respect to emissions and mileage requirements for our\nvehicles. The CoC is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards and the California Executive Order is required for vehicles sold in states that\nhave sought and received a waiver from the EPA to utilize California standards. The California standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles\nand engines sold in California are set by CARB. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by EPA also recognize the Executive Order for sales of vehicles.\nIn California, a Zero-emission Powertrain (“ZEP”) Certification is an additional requirement for new applicants to participate in the Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus\nVoucher Incentive Project (“HVIP”) on or after January 1, 2023. This new requirement applies to all zero-emission powertrains and the trucks and buses in which they are\ninstalled. Workhorse received Executive Order A-445-0011 for MY 2022 and MY 2021 W4CC and W750 electric vehicles. In addition, Workhorse received Executive Order\nA-445-0006 and Zero-Emission Powertrain Executive Order A-445-0005 for MY 2024 W56. All Workhorse models, W4CC, W750, and W56 are eligible for HVIP incentives\nincluding $60,000 for Class 4 vehicles, and $85,000 for Class 5/6 standard vouchers.\nIt is important to highlight the regulatory context in which we operate, particularly concerning the EPA waivers for California’s ACT and Advanced Clean Fleets (“ACF”)\nrules:\n• ACT Rule: In March 2023, the EPA granted a waiver for California's ACT rule, a key regulatory step. This rule imposes mandates on truck manufacturers as part of the\nstate’s comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions from its trucking sector.\n• ACF Rule: In November 2023, CARB submitted a request to the EPA for a waiver concerning the ACF rule. This regulation is primarily directed at the purchasers of\nvehicles, delineating mandates that complement the manufacturer-focused ACT rule.\nIt is important to note that the enforcement of California’s ACF rule is contingent upon the EPA granting a waiver or determining that a waiver is not necessary. Under the\nClean Air Act, California holds the unique authority to request a waiver of preemption, which typically restricts states from setting their own emissions standards for new motor\nvehicles. The EPA’s role involves a thorough review of comments and an assessment to determine if the criteria for granting a waiver are satisfied. This regulatory landscape is\na significant consideration for our operations and strategic planning.\nVehicle safety and testing\nThe National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the “Safety Act”) regulates motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment in the United States in two primary ways.\nFirst, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable motor vehicle safety standards established by\nNHTSA. Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly, in part because the standards tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emissions\nand fuel economy standards. Second, the Safety Act requires defects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns. A manufacturer is obligated\nto recall vehicles if it determines the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. Should we or NHTSA determine either a safety defect or noncompliance exists with respect\nto any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.\nIn the United States, the FAA regulates our aerospace vehicles. Those regulations govern two important areas: operating rules and aircraft certification rules. The FAA’s\noperating rules govern all operations of all aerial vehicles in the National Airspace System of the United States. The FAA’s certification rules help define the safety and\nreliability requirements of certain aircraft and systems. Not every aircraft and system are required to be FAA certificated, though typically certification is required for\ncommercial operations like package delivery.\nCurrent regulatory constraints, particularly those pertaining to Beyond Visual Line of Sight (“BVLOS”) operations and drone flights over populated areas, present significant\nchallenges in integrating Unmanned Aerial Systems (“UAS”) into routine logistics and package delivery services. These limitations are key factors impeding the broader\nadoption and implementation of drone technology in day-to-day delivery operations. 49 U.S.C. § 44807 grants the Secretary of Transportation the authority to\n5\nuse a risk-based approach to determine if certain unmanned aircraft systems may operate safely in the national airspace system (“NAS”) on a case-by-case basis. This grants\nUAS operators safe and legal entry into the NAS, thus improving safety.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We protect our intellectual property rights, both in the U.S. and abroad,\nthrough a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection, as well as confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants. We seek to control\naccess to, and distribution of, our proprietary information through non-disclosure agreements with our vendors and business partners. Unpatented research, development, know-\nhow, and engineering skills make a vital contribution to our business, and we pursue patent protection when we believe it is possible and consistent with our overall strategy for\nsafeguarding intellectual property.\nWe are not aware of any infringing uses or any prior claims of ownership of our trademarks that could materially affect our business. It is our policy to pursue registration of\nour primary trademarks whenever possible and to vigorously defend our patents, trademarks and other proprietary marks against infringement or other threats to the extent\npractical under applicable laws.\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”)\nWorkhorse’s mission is based on the foundation of the commercial vehicle transition to zero emissions. To do this, we embrace a world with reduced carbon emissions in both\nenergy generation and consumption. We are designing and manufacturing a key ingredient of the transportation ecosystem evolution to achieve this goal - last mile electric\ndelivery vehicles.\nWe are investing to make our facilities more efficient and sustainably designed and are also driving a continuous safety mindset by focusing on worker engagement. In addition,\nwe are focused on reducing the carbon footprint throughout our supply chain. We are committed to sourcing responsibly produced materials from suppliers who have social,\nenvironmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations.\nFinally, we believe that sound corporate governance is essential to helping us achieve our goal, including with respect to ESG. We continue to evolve a governance framework\nthat exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company. During 2023, the ESG Committee, made up of leaders from across our company,\noversaw workforce training to advance the Company's ESG priorities. The Committee provides regular presentations on ESG related initiatives to our Board of Directors, which\nguides our ESG impacts, initiatives and priorities.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 298 full-time employees. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor organization or are party to any collective bargaining\narrangement. We have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.\nWe understand that our innovation leadership is ultimately rooted in people. Competition for qualified personnel in our space is intense, and our success depends in large part on\nour ability to recruit, develop and retain a productive and engaged workforce. Accordingly, investing in our employees and their well-being, offering competitive compensation\nand benefits, promoting diversity and inclusion, adopting progressive human capital management practices and community outreach constitute core elements of our corporate\nstrategy.\nWe are in the process of completing a reduction in force (the “RIF”) pursuant to which we terminated approximately 20% of our total workforce, excluding direct labor. We do\nnot expect to incur material costs in connection with the RIF.\nGovernance. Our Board of Directors and its committees provide important oversight on certain human capital matters. The Human Resource Management and Compensation\nCommittee maintains responsibility to review, discuss and set strategic direction for various people-related business strategies, including compensation and benefit programs.\nOur collective recommendations to the Board of Directors and its committees are how we proactively manage our human capital and care for our employees in a manner that\naligns with our core values.\nOur management team administers all employment matters, such as recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation and rewards, performance management and\nprofessional development. We continuously evaluate and enhance our internal policies, process and practices to increase employee engagement and productivity.\n6\nWe have an employee hotline, providing our employees an opportunity to report matters such as safety concerns, fraud or other misconduct. All reported matters are reviewed\nin accordance with established protocols by our Legal, Human Resources and Internal Audit departments, who monitor the remediation and disposition of any reported matters.\nSupport Employee Well-being and Engagement. We support the overall well-being of our employees from a physical, emotional, financial, and social perspective. Our well-\nbeing program includes a long-standing practice of flexible paid time off, life planning benefits, wellness platforms and employee assistance programs.\nOffer Competitive Compensation and Benefits. We strive to ensure that our employees receive competitive and fair compensation and innovative benefits offerings, tying\nincentive compensation to both business and individual performance, offering competitive maternal/paternal leave policies and providing meaningful retirement and health\nbenefits.\nPromote Sense of Belonging through Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives. We promote an inclusive and diverse workplace, where all individuals are respected and feel they\nbelong regardless of their age, race, national origin, gender, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity.\nProvide Programs for Employee Recognition. We also offer rewards and recognition programs to our employees, including awards to recognize employees who best exemplify\nour values and spot awards to recognize employee contributions. We believe that these recognition programs help drive strong employee performance and retention. We\nconduct annual employee performance reviews, where each employee is evaluated by their personal manager and also conducts a self-assessment, a process which empowers\nour employees. Employee performance is assessed based on a variety of key performance metrics, including the achievement of objectives specific to the employee’s\ndepartment or role.\nCreate Opportunities for Growth and Development. We focus on creating opportunities for employee growth, development, training, and education, including opportunities to\ncultivate talent and identify candidates for new roles from within the Company and management and leadership development programs.\nAvailable Information\nWe file or furnish periodic reports and amendments thereto, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-\nK, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). In addition, the SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains\nreports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically. Our website is located at www.workhorse.com, and our reports,\namendments thereto, proxy statements and other information are also made available on our investor relations website, free of charge, at ir.workhorse.com as soon as\nreasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish such information with the SEC.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOperational Risks\nSubstantial doubt exists regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern through the twelve months following the date of the issuance of the financial\nstatements accompanying this Form 10-K.\nWe have incurred net losses of $123.9 million and $117.3 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. As a result of our\nrecurring losses from operations, accumulated deficit, projected working capital needs and delays in bringing our vehicles to market, and, accordingly, slower market demand\nthan previously expected, substantial doubt exists as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over the twelve months from the date of the issuance of the audited\nfinancial statements accompanying this Form 10-K. To the extent we are unable to satisfy these capital needs, we will need to significantly modify or terminate our operations\nand our planned business activities.\nWe are currently negotiating possible financing to meet our immediate liquidity needs, and the terms of the financing, if consummated, may have adverse effects on us and\nour stockholders.\nAs discussed in “Recent Developments,” above, a vital component of management’s plan to address our liquidity and working capital needs, and to reduce the short-term risk\nthat we may not be able to continue as a going concern, is the consummation of a financing in the immediate future to address these requirements for the short term. Although\nthere can be no assurance that a Possible Financing will be consummated and its possible terms are under negotiation, if it is consummated, we expect that it will have a\nmaterially higher cost of capital than our existing financing arrangements and contain provisions that may be\n7\ndilutive to both existing and future stockholders of the Company. A Possible Financing may also contain terms that limit the Company’s ability to sell common stock under its\nATM Agreement and ELOC and to obtain new debt financing. Further, if a Possible Financing includes a convertibility feature, warrants or both, sales by investors of the\nunderlying common stock may directly or indirectly reduce the market price of the common stock.\nMore generally, expect that we will not be able to maintain the levels of capital and operating expenditures necessary to perform our current business plan, including the\ndevelopment of our W56 variants and WNext truck chassis platforms unless we generate additional cash from operations or obtain additional financing. In light of our operating\nhistory and the expected schedule for bringing our W56 variants and WNext platforms to market, we expect that it will be necessary to obtain additional financing, through\nPossible Financing, and through our ATM Agreement. Our continued access to capital markets is essential for us to meet our current and long-term obligations, fund operations,\nand fund our strategic initiatives. We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. An interruption in our access\nto external financing could affect our business prospects and financial condition. Recent turmoil in the capital markets, including the tightening of credit and rise of interest\nrates, may cause us to face higher borrowing costs, less available capital, more stringent terms and tighter covenants. In such circumstances, if we cannot raise additional capital,\nour financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we raise additional capital through issuances of\nequity, through our ATM Agreement, ELOC or otherwise, our stockholders could experience dilution.\nWe are currently out of compliance with the Nasdaq’s continuing listing requirements and if we fail to satisfy all such applicable Nasdaq continued listing requirements,\nour common stock may be delisted from Nasdaq, which could have an adverse impact on the liquidity and market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, which has qualitative and quantitative continued listing requirements, including corporate governance\nrequirements, public float requirements and a $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement. Our common stock price has been and may in the future be below the minimum\nbid price for continued listing on Nasdaq. On September 22, 2023, we received notice from Nasdaq indicating that the closing bid price for our common stock had fallen below\nthe minimum bid price for continued listing for 30 consecutive trading days and was no longer in compliance with the minimum bid requirement. In order to regain compliance,\nthe closing bid price of our common stock must be equal to or above the minimum bid price for a period of 10 consecutive trading days prior to March 20, 2024. In the event\nthe Company fails to meet this requirement by such date, the Company may be eligible for an additional grace period of another 180 days, so long as it meets the applicable\nmarket value of publicly held shares requirement and other applicable listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, other than the minimum bid price requirement, on the\ntrading date prior to the deadline, and informs Nasdaq of its intent to cure this deficiency. If the Company fails to meet these requirements or fails to satisfy any other continued\nlisting requirements, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Delisting would likely have an adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock, decrease the\nmarket price of our common stock, result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers, and employees, and fewer business development opportunities,\nand adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for our continuing operations.\nThe unavailability, reduction, elimination or adverse application of government subsidies and, incentives and, or any failure by states or other governmental entities to\nadopt or enforce regulations, could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe believe the availability of government subsidies and incentives, including the California Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project (“HVIP”), is\nan important factor considered by our customers when purchasing our vehicles. Our growth depends in part on the availability and amounts of these subsidies and incentives.\nMany of our current and prospective customers are seeking to leverage HVIP due to its ease of access and amount of funding available per vehicle. In addition, some of our\npurchase orders have contingencies related to HVIP funding. If our vehicles, fail to qualify for the HVIP, or we experience a material delay in obtaining qualification for the\nHVIP program, our business, financial condition and results of operations would suffer. Furthermore, any reduction, elimination or discriminatory application of the HVIP or\nother government subsidies and incentives because of budgetary challenges, policy changes, the reduced need for such subsidies and incentives due to the perceived success of\nelectric vehicles or other reasons may result in the diminished price competitiveness of the alternative fuel vehicle industry.\nAs discussed in Item 1, Business – Regulatory – Emission and fuel economy standards, our strategy and business plan depend on the enforcement of state regulations, such as\nCalifornia’s Advanced Clean Fleet regulation. Any failure by states or other governmental agencies to adopt or enforce regulations related to emissions and mileage\nrequirements could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n8\nUncertain global macro-economic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nElectric vehicle sales and production are cyclical and are materially affected by macroeconomic, geopolitical and industry conditions that are outside of our control and the\ncontrol of our customers and suppliers, including monetary fiscal policy, economic recessions, inflation, deflation, interest rates, political instability, labor relations issues,\nenergy prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, capital and liquidity constraints, acts of war and terrorism, and natural and man-made disasters. Our operational\ncosts are similarly impacted by such macroeconomic, geopolitical and industry conditions, which has and may continue to adversely impact our margins and profitability.\nCurrent or potential customers may delay or decrease spending on our products and services as their business and/or budgets are impacted by economic conditions. The inability\nof current and potential customers to pay us for our products and services may adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. In addition, deterioration of conditions in\nworldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures.\nThe current conflicts in Ukraine and Israel and any resulting sanctions could have an adverse impact on our current operations.\nFurther, such conflicts are likely to lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain\ninterruptions for equipment, which could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be successful in executing our business plan, which envisions selling recently developed truck chassis and the continued provision of a\nnew delivery van to customers which commenced in late 2022. Our failure to execute our business plan would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\nposition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nDuring 2023, we launched the W56, a new truck chassis platform, which is the foundation of our revised strategic product roadmap. We also intend to introduce a longer-\nwheelbase and cab-chassis version of the W56. In addition, our product roadmap also includes the WNext, which we will be our second generation, low floor, advanced content\noffering for the truck chassis market, expanding our vehicle foundation and is expected to begin production in late 2025 or 2026. To accelerate time-to-market for customers\nseeking delivery of electric vehicles during 2023, we produced and sold Class 4 vehicles to be sold in either a cab chassis version (“W4 CC”) or a step van version (“W750”)\nmade to haul various cargo and take on both mid and last-mile routes. The W750 was launched into production and sale in 2023, in addition to the W4 CC, which became\navailable for sale in 2022.\nProduct development involves numerous risks and uncertainties. We cannot assure you that we have successfully developed our new truck platforms or that we have identified\nany potential issues in their design or use. We may be unable to launch and ramp up production as necessary, we may experience unexpected costs, delays or service burdens,\nwe may be unable to deliver such vehicles on an economical basis and our customers may not find our vehicles are acceptable for their use. Any of the foregoing would have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe may experience delays in launching and ramping up production or we may be unable to control our manufacturing costs.\nWe have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp-up delays. In addition, we may introduce in the future new or unique\nmanufacturing processes and design features for our products including enhancements under development relating to production assembly efficiency, material component\navailability, cost reduction and customer feedback. There is no guarantee we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such processes or features. We have\nrelatively limited experience to date in manufacturing electric vehicles at high volumes. To be successful, we will need to implement, maintain, and ramp-up efficient and cost-\neffective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances, high quality and output rates planned at our Union City, IN manufacturing\nfacility. We also need to hire, train, and compensate skilled employees for operations. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those experienced in the past may\narise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs. If we are not successful in\nachieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or sustaining our vehicle production ramp-ups or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets. Any\ndelay or other complication in ramping up the production of our current products or the development, manufacture, launch and production ramp-ups of our future products,\nfeatures and services, or in doing so cost-effectively and with high quality, may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.\n9\nOur results of operations have not resulted in profitability and we may not be able to achieve profitability going forward.\nWe had an accumulated deficit of $751.6 million as of December 31, 2023. Except for the year ended December 31, 2020, we have had net losses every year since our\ninception. We expect we will continue to incur net losses in 2024. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in\n“Risk Factors”, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown events. Accordingly, we may not be able to achieve or\nmaintain profitability. Our management is developing plans to alleviate the negative trends and conditions described above and there is no guarantee such plans will be\nsuccessfully implemented. Our business plan is focused on providing sustainable and cost-effective solutions to the commercial transportation sector but is still unproven. There\nis no assurance that even if we successfully implement our business plan, we will be able to curtail our losses or ever achieve profitable operations. If we incur additional\nsignificant operating losses, our stock price may significantly decline.\nWe have yet to achieve positive cash flow and, given our projected funding needs, our ability to generate positive cash flow is uncertain.\nWe had negative cash flow from operating activities of $123.0 million and $93.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We may continue to\nhave negative cash flow from operating and investing activities for 2024 as we expect to incur research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative\nexpenses and make capital expenditures in our efforts to increase sales and ramp up operations at our Union City, IN facility. Our business also will require significant amounts\nof working capital to support our growth of additional platforms. An inability to generate positive cash flow for the near term may adversely affect our ability to raise needed\ncapital for our business on reasonable terms, diminish supplier or customer willingness to enter into transactions with us, and have other adverse effects that may decrease our\nlong-term viability. There can be no assurance the Company will achieve positive cash flow in the near future or at all.\nIf our vehicles fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell our electric vehicles could be harmed.\nIf our vehicles were to contain design or manufacturing defects that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair, our ability to develop, market and sell our\nvehicles could be harmed. We currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the long-term quality, reliability and performance characteristics of our trucks,\nbattery packs and other products, particularly our new chassis platforms, the W4 CC, W750, W56 and WNext. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and\nrepair any defects in our products before commencing the sale of our vehicles.\nIn addition, the performance specifications of our vehicles may vary from our current estimates and could change over time and from vehicle to vehicle based on a number of\nfactors, including the manner in which the vehicle is used or maintained, driving conditions and weather and other environmental conditions where the vehicle is used. While we\nperform extensive internal testing on our vehicles, we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate detailed long-term quality, reliability, durability and\nperformance characteristics of our battery packs, powertrains and vehicles. There can be no assurance that any of our products will perform in accordance with our published\nspecifications, consistently or at all.\nWe currently have a limited number of customers and prospective customers, we do not have long-term agreements with existing customers, and we expect that a\nsignificant portion of our future sales will be from a limited number of customers. The loss of any of these customers could materially harm our business.\nA significant portion of our projected future revenue is expected to be generated from a limited number of dealers and fleet customers. Additionally, much of our business\nmodel is focused on building relationships with a few large dealers and fleet customers. Currently, we have no contracts with customers that include long-term commitments or\nminimum volumes to ensure future sales of vehicles. As such, a customer may take actions that negatively affect us for reasons we cannot anticipate or control, such as a\ncustomer’s financial condition, changes in the customer’s business strategy or operations, or the perceived performance or cost-effectiveness of our vehicles. In addition, as\ndescribed above, we may not be able to meet customer requirements with the new truck chassis platforms we are developing and plan to offer to them. The loss of or a reduction\nin sales or anticipated sales to our most significant customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nRegulatory requirements may have a negative impact upon our business.\nOur vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under federal, state, and local laws. In addition, these laws are subject to change. To the extent the laws change, or if we\nintroduce new vehicles in the future (including, without limitation, the new truck chassis platforms we are developing), some or all of our vehicles may not comply with\napplicable federal, state, or local\n10\nlaws. Further, certain federal, state, and local laws and industrial standards currently regulate electrical and electronics equipment. Although standards for electric vehicles are\nnot yet generally available or accepted as industry standards, our products may become subject to federal, state, and local regulation in the future. Compliance with these\nregulations could be burdensome, time consuming, and expensive.\nOur products are subject to environmental and safety compliance with various federal and state regulations, including regulations promulgated by the EPA, NHTSA, FAA and\nvarious state boards, and compliance certification is required for each new model year. NHTSA is active in requesting information from vehicle manufactures regarding\npotential product defects and safety measures. The cost of these compliance activities and the risks, delays, and expenses incurred in connection with such compliance could be\nsubstantial.\nWe may incur costs, expenses and penalties related to regulatory matters, governmental investigations, legal proceedings and other claims, which could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulations. Federal, state and local laws and regulations may change from time to time and our compliance with new or amended laws\nand regulations in the future may materially increase our costs and could adversely affect our results of operations and competitive position. In addition, violations of the laws\nand regulations to which we are subject could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, as well as prohibitions on the\nconduct of our business, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations. See Note 15, Commitment and Contingencies, to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn 2023, we settled a class action lawsuit alleging violation of the securities laws and agreed to create a settlement fund consisting of $15.0 million in cash and $20.0 million in\nshares of our common stock. This settlement could adversely affect the price of our equity securities, thereby exposing us to new securities class action and/or shareholder\nderivative litigation. New securities class action and/or shareholder derivative suits against us and/or our officers and directors could result in substantial additional costs to us\nand divert our management’s time and attention, which would otherwise be used to benefit our business.\nPandemics, epidemics, disease outbreaks and other public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have disrupted our business and operations, and future public\nhealth crises could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nPandemics, epidemics, or disease outbreaks in the U.S. or globally, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have disrupted, and may in the future, disrupt our business, which could\nmaterially affect our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations as well as future expectations. Any such events may adversely impact our global supply chain in the\nU.S., China and elsewhere. In particular, we could experience among other things: (1) continued or additional global supply disruptions, including with our third-party\nmanufacturers, upon whom we rely to provide certain parts incorporated into our vehicles; (2) labor disruptions; (3) an inability to manufacture our vehicles; (4) an inability to\nsell to our customers; (5) a decline in customer demand during and following any pandemic; (6) an impaired ability to access credit and capital markets. Any new pandemic or\nother public health crises, or future public health crises, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations going forward.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those estimates of our future performance.\nAs we begin to implement and ramp up our manufacturing capabilities, it is difficult, if not impossible, to forecast our future results based upon our historical data. Because of\nthe uncertainties related to our lack of historical operations in a highly regulated and rapidly evolving industry, we may be hindered in our ability to anticipate and adapt to\nincreases or decreases in revenues or expenses. If we make poor budgetary decisions as a result of limited historical data, we could be less profitable or incur losses.\nWe do not receive progress payments on orders of our vehicles, and if a purchaser fails to pay upon delivery, we may not be able to recoup the costs we incurred in\nproducing such vehicles.\nOur arrangements with existing customers do not provide for progress payments as we begin to fulfill orders. Customers are only required to pay us upon delivery of vehicles. If\na customer fails to take delivery of an ordered vehicle or fails to pay for\n11\nsuch vehicle, we may not receive cash to offset the production expenses of such vehicle, which could adversely affect our cash flows.\nOur business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected if we cannot reduce and adequately control the costs and expenses associated\nwith operating our business, including our material and production costs.\nWe incur significant costs and expenses related to procuring the materials, components and services required to develop and produce our electric vehicles. We continually work\non cost-down initiatives to reduce our cost structure so we may effectively compete. If we are unable to reduce our costs and expenses, our net losses will continue.\nThe demand for commercial electric vehicles depends, in part, on the continuation of current trends resulting from dependence on fossil fuels. Extended periods of low\ndiesel or other petroleum-based fuel prices could adversely affect demand for our vehicles, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and\noperating results.\nWe believe much of the present and projected demand for commercial electric vehicles results from concerns about volatility in the cost of petroleum-based fuel, the\ndependency of the United States on oil from unstable or hostile countries, government regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternative forms of\nenergy, as well as the belief that climate change results in part from the burning of fossil fuels. If the cost of petroleum-based fuel decreased significantly, the outlook for the\nlong-term supply of oil to the United States improved, the government eliminated or modified its regulations or economic incentives related to fuel efficiency and alternative\nforms of energy, or if there is a change in the perception that the burning of fossil fuels negatively impacts the environment, the demand for commercial electric vehicles could\nbe reduced, and our business and revenue may be harmed.\nDiesel and other petroleum-based fuel prices have been extremely volatile, and we believe this volatility will persist. Lower diesel or other petroleum-based fuel prices over\nextended periods of time may lower the perception in government and the private sector that cheaper, more readily available energy alternatives should be developed and\nproduced. If diesel or other petroleum-based fuel prices remain at deflated levels for extended periods of time, the demand for commercial electric vehicles may decrease, which\nwould have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur future growth is dependent upon the willingness of operators of commercial vehicle fleets to adopt electric vehicles and on our ability to produce, sell and service\nvehicles that meet their needs. This often depends upon the cost for an operator adopting electric vehicle technology as compared to the cost of traditional internal\ncombustion technology.\nOur growth is dependent upon the adoption of electric vehicles by operators of commercial vehicle fleets and on our ability to produce, sell and service vehicles that meet their\nneeds. The entry of commercial electric vehicles into the medium-duty commercial vehicle market is a relatively new development, particularly in the United States, and is\ncharacterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving government regulation, industry standards and customer views of the merits of using electric vehicles in their\nbusinesses. This process has been slow as without including the impact of government or other subsidies and incentives, the purchase prices for our commercial electric vehicles\ncurrently is higher than the purchase prices for diesel-fueled vehicles. Our growth has also been negatively impacted by the relatively low price of oil in previous years.\nOur success depends on our ability to develop and market products that are recognized and accepted as reliable, enabling and cost-effective and our ability to convince potential\ncustomers that our products and technology are an attractive alternative to existing products and technology. Prior to adopting our products and technology, some customers\nmay need to devote time and effort to testing and validating our systems. Any failure to meet these customer benchmarks could result in potential customers choosing to retain\ntheir existing vehicles or to purchase vehicles other than ours. If the market for electric vehicles in general, and our vehicles in particular, do not develop as we expect, develops\nmore slowly than we expect, or if demand for our vehicles decreases in our markets, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nIf the market for commercial electric vehicles does not develop broadly and quickly than is currently developing, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating\nresults will be adversely affected.\nAs part of our sales efforts, we must educate fleet managers as to the economical savings we believe they will achieve over the life of the vehicle. As such, we believe operators\nof commercial vehicle fleets should consider a number of factors when deciding whether to purchase our commercial electric vehicles (or commercial electric vehicles\ngenerally) or vehicles powered by internal combustion engines, particularly diesel-fueled or natural gas-fueled vehicles. We believe these factors include:\n12\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nthe difference in the initial purchase prices of commercial electric vehicles and vehicles with comparable gross vehicle weight powered by internal combustion engines,\nboth including and excluding the impact of government and other subsidies and incentives designed to promote the purchase of electric vehicles;\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nthe total cost of ownership of the vehicle over its expected life, which includes the initial purchase price and ongoing operating and maintenance costs;\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nthe availability and terms of financing options for purchases of vehicles and, for commercial electric vehicles, financing options for battery systems;\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nthe availability of tax and other governmental incentives to purchase and operate electric vehicles and future regulations requiring increased use of nonpolluting vehicles;\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\ngovernment regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy;\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nfuel prices, including volatility in the cost of diesel;\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nthe cost and availability of other alternatives to diesel fueled vehicles, such as vehicles powered by natural gas;\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\ncorporate sustainability initiatives;\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\ncommercial electric vehicle quality, performance and safety (particularly with respect to lithium-ion battery packs);\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nthe quality and availability of service for the vehicle, including the availability of replacement parts;\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nthe range over which commercial electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge;\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\naccess to charging stations and related infrastructure costs, and standardization of electric vehicle charging systems;\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nelectric grid capacity and reliability; and\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nmacroeconomic factors.\nIf, in weighing these factors, operators of commercial vehicle fleets determine there is not a compelling business justification for purchasing commercial electric vehicles,\nparticularly those we produce and sell, then the market for commercial electric vehicles may not develop as we expect or may develop more slowly than we expect, which\nwould adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, a significant number of electric vehicle suppliers have reduced their operations, been acquired on terms unfavorable to them or ceased operations in recent years,\nbecause demand for such vehicles has not increased in accordance with expectations at the time such suppliers entered the market. Accordingly, the future of the electric vehicle\nmarket, particularly the portion of the market in which we operate, is substantially uncertain. If market conditions do not improve significantly, it is unlikely that we will be able\nto continue to operate in the long term, even if we are able to address the immediate and short-term liquidity needs described in Liquidity and Capital Resources; Going Concern\nand in these Risk Factors.\nWe currently do not have and do not expect to have a significant number of long-term supply contracts with guaranteed pricing which exposes and will expose us to\nfluctuations in component, materials and equipment prices. Substantial increases in these prices would increase our operating costs and could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.\nBecause we currently do not have and do not expect to have long-term supply contracts with guaranteed pricing, we are and will be subject to fluctuations in the prices of the\nraw materials, parts and components and equipment we use in the production of our vehicles. Substantial increases in the prices for such raw materials, components and\nequipment would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices. Any attempts to increase\nthe announced or expected prices of our vehicles in response to increased costs could be viewed negatively by our customers and could adversely affect our business, financial\nposition, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.\nIf we are unable to scale our operations at our Union City, IN facility in an expedited manner from our limited low volume production to high volume production, our\nbusiness, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity will be adversely affected.\nWe are assembling our vehicles at our Union City, IN facility which has been acceptable for our historical orders. To satisfy increased demand, we will need to quickly scale\noperations in our Union City, IN facility as well as scale our supply chain including access to batteries. Such a substantial and rapid increase in operations may strain our\nmanagement capabilities. Our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected if we experience\n13\ndisruptions in our supply chain, if we cannot obtain materials of sufficient quality at reasonable prices or if we are unable to scale our Union City, IN facility.\nWe depend upon key personnel and need additional personnel. The loss of key personnel or the inability to attract additional personnel may adversely affect our business\nand results of operations.\nOur success depends on the continuing services of our executive leadership team and top management. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material and adverse\neffect on our business operations. Additionally, the success of our operations will largely depend upon our ability to successfully attract and maintain other competent and\nqualified key management personnel. As with any company with limited resources, there can be no guarantee we will be able to attract such individuals or the presence of such\nindividuals will necessarily translate into profitability for our Company. Our inability to attract and retain key personnel may materially and adversely affect our business\noperations. Any failure by our management to effectively anticipate, implement, and manage the changes required to sustain our growth would have a material adverse effect on\nour business and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial or other resources, longer operating histories and greater name recognition than\nwe do and could use their greater resources and/or name recognition to gain market share at our expense or could make it very difficult for us to establish market share.\nCompanies currently competing in the fleet logistics market offering alternative fuel medium-duty trucks include General Motors, Ford Motor Company and Freightliner. There\nare also a number of new, well capitalized entrants into the market place. Ford and Freightliner are currently selling alternative fuel fleet vehicles including hybrids and General\nMotors' subsidiary Brightdrop has recently brought a medium duty electric delivery van to market. General Motors, Ford and Freightliner have substantially more financial\nresources, established market positions, long-standing relationships with customers and dealers, and have more significant name recognition, technical, marketing, sales,\nfinancial and other resources than we do. Although we believe that HorseFly, our unmanned aerial system (“UAS”), is unique in the marketplace in that it currently does not\nhave any competitors when it comes to a UAS that works in combination with a truck, there are better-financed competitors in this emerging industry, including Google and\nAmazon. These competitors have significantly more financial resources, established market positions, long-standing relationships with customers, more significant name\nrecognition and a larger scope of resources including technical, marketing and sales than we do.\nThe resources available to our competitors to develop new products and introduce them into the marketplace exceed the resources currently available to us. As a result, our\ncompetitors may be able to compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period than we can. This intense competitive environment may require us to\nmake changes in our products, pricing, licensing, services, distribution, or marketing to develop a market position. Each of these competitors has the potential to capture\nsignificant market share in our target markets, which could have an adverse effect on our position in our industry and on our business and operating results. This competition\ncould have a negative impact on revenues, margins and/or a market share, any of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur electric vehicles compete for market share with vehicles powered by other vehicle technologies that may prove to be more attractive than ours.\nOur target market currently is serviced by manufacturers with existing customers and suppliers using proven and widely accepted fossil fuel technologies. Additionally, our\ncompetitors are working on developing technologies that may be introduced in our target market. If any of these alternative technology vehicles can provide lower fuel costs,\ngreater efficiencies, greater reliability or otherwise benefit from other factors resulting in an overall lower total cost of ownership, this may negatively affect the commercial\nsuccess of our vehicles or make our vehicles uncompetitive or obsolete.\nChanges in the market for electric vehicles could cause our products to become obsolete or lose popularity.\nThe modern electric vehicle industry is in its infancy and has experienced substantial change in the last few years. Although a significant number of suppliers entered the electric\nvehicle industry in recent years, demand for electric vehicles has been slower than forecasted by industry experts. As a result, growth in the electric vehicle industry depends on\nmany factors outside our control, including, but not limited to:\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\ncontinued development of product technology, especially batteries;\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nperceptions about electric vehicle quality, safety, design, performance and cost;\n14\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nperceptions about the total cost of ownership of electric vehicles, including the initial purchase price and operating and maintenance costs;\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nthe environmental consciousness of customers;\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nthe ability of electric vehicles to successfully compete with vehicles powered by internal combustion engines;\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nthe availability of other alternative fuel vehicles, including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; and\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nthe availability of tax and other governmental incentives to purchase and operate electric vehicles or future regulation requiring increased use of nonpolluting vehicles.\nWe cannot assume growth in the electric vehicle industry will continue. Our business will suffer if the electric vehicle industry does not grow or grows more slowly than it has\nin recent years or if we are unable to maintain the pace of industry demands.\nWe may be unable to keep up with changes in electric vehicle technology and, as a result, may suffer a decline in our business and competitive position.\nOur products and the new products we are developing under our strategic roadmap are designed for use with, and are dependent upon, existing electric vehicle technology. As\ntechnologies change, we plan to upgrade or adapt our products to continue to provide products with the latest technology. However, our products may become obsolete or our\nresearch and development efforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in or to create the necessary technology. Thus, our potential inability to adapt and develop the\nnecessary technology may harm our business and competitive position.\nThe failure of certain key suppliers to provide us with the necessary components of our products according to our schedule and at price, quality levels and volumes\nacceptable to us could have a severe and negative impact upon our business.\nWe rely and will rely on various suppliers to provide critical components and materials used in our vehicles, including our battery packs. However, we have a limited number of\ndefinitive supply agreements. Changes in business conditions, pandemics, wars, including the conflicts in Ukraine and Israel and resulting sanctions, and other factors beyond\nour control or which we do not presently anticipate could negatively affect our ability to receive components. If component suppliers become unwilling or unable to provide\ncomponents, there are a limited number of alternative suppliers who could provide them and the price for them could be substantially higher. A failure by our major suppliers to\nprovide these components could severely restrict our ability to manufacture our products and prevent us from fulfilling customer orders in a timely fashion.\nContinued disruption of supply, shortage of materials or increases in costs, in particular for battery packs or microchips, could harm our business.\nOur ability to manufacture our vehicles depends on the continued supply of battery packs, including the competent battery cells, used in our products. We have in the past\nexperienced a battery pack supply chain constraint as a result of our existing supplier's inability to keep up with volume requirements. We continue to work with our current\nsupplier to overcome these supply constraints and have also begun collaborating with an additional supplier, subject to appropriate testing, to further expand our battery pack\noptions.\nFurthermore, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased demand for consumer products, a global shortage of microchips has been reported since early 2021, and the impact\nto us is yet unknown. As a result, our ability to source semiconductor chips may be adversely affected. Impacts of the shortage may result in increased delivery lead times,\ndelays in the production of our vehicles, and increased costs to source available semiconductor chips.\nProduct liability or other claims could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe risk of product liability claims, product recalls, and associated adverse publicity is inherent in the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of electric vehicles. Although we have\nproduct liability insurance for certain of our consumer and commercial products, that insurance may be inadequate to cover all potential product claims. Any product recall or\nlawsuit seeking significant monetary damages either in excess of our coverage, or outside of our coverage, may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial\ncondition. We may not be able to secure additional product liability insurance coverage on acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed. A successful product liability\nclaim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a product recall, such as the one initiated by the Company in 2021, could generate substantial\nnegative publicity about our products and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future product candidates. We cannot provide assurance such claims and/or\nrecalls will not be made in the future.\n15\nOur success may be dependent on protecting our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on trade secret protections to protect our proprietary technology as well as several registered patents and patent applications. Our patents and patent applications relate\nto the vehicle chassis assembly, vehicle header and drive module, manifold for electric motor drive assembly, onboard generator drive system for electric vehicles and the\ndelivery drone. Our success will, in part, depend on our ability to obtain additional trademarks and patents. We are working on registering additional patents and trademarks\nwith the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Although we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants, we cannot be certain others\nwill not gain access to these trade secrets. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and technologies or otherwise gain access to our\ntrade secrets. Therefore we may be subject to disputes with our employees over ownership of any new technologies or enhancements such employees help to develop.\nWe may be exposed to liability for infringing upon the intellectual property rights of other companies.\nOur success will, in part, depend on our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. Although we have conducted searches and are not aware of any\npatents and trademarks which our products or their use might infringe, we cannot be certain that infringement has not or will not occur. We could incur substantial costs, in\naddition to the great amount of time lost and negative publicity, in defending any patent or trademark infringement suits or in asserting any patent or trademark rights, in a suit\nwith another party. In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, we may need to seek licenses to such intellectual property which could result\nin significant costs, including substantial licensing fees or royalties.\nOur business may be adversely affected by union activities.\nAlthough none of our employees are currently represented by a labor union, it is common throughout the automotive industry for many employees to belong to a union, which\ncan result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. Our employees may join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be required to become a\nunion signatory. Our production facility in Union City, Indiana was purchased from Navistar. Prior employees of Navistar were union members and our future work force at\nthis facility may be inclined to vote in favor of forming a labor union. Furthermore, we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as\nparts suppliers and trucking and freight companies, and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial\ncondition or operating results. If a work stoppage occurs, it could delay the manufacture and sale of our trucks and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects,\noperating results or financial condition. The mere fact our labor force could be unionized may harm our reputation in the eyes of some investors. Consequently, the unionization\nof our labor force could negatively impact our company.\nOur electric vehicles make use of lithium-ion battery cells, which, if not appropriately managed and controlled, have occasionally been observed to catch fire or vent smoke\nand flames. If such events occur in our electric vehicles, we could face liability associated with our warranty, for damage or injury, adverse publicity and a potential safety\nrecall, any of which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nThe battery packs in our electric vehicles use lithium-ion cells, which have been used for years in laptop computers and cell phones. On occasion, if not appropriately managed\nor subjected to environmental stresses, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials.\nHighly publicized incidents of electric vehicles, laptop computers and cell phones bursting into flames have focused consumer attention on the safety of these cells. These events\nalso have raised questions about the suitability of these lithium-ion cells for automotive applications. There can be no assurance that a field failure of our battery packs will not\noccur, which would damage the vehicle or lead to personal injury or death and may subject us to lawsuits. Furthermore, there is some risk of electrocution if individuals who\nattempt to repair battery packs on our vehicles do not follow applicable maintenance and repair protocols. Any such damage or injury would likely lead to adverse publicity and\npotentially a safety recall. Any such adverse publicity related to the suitability of lithium-ion cells for automotive applications, the social and environmental impacts of mineral\nmining or procurement associated with the constituents of lithium-ion cells, or any future incident involving lithium-ion cells, such as a vehicle or other fire could adversely\naffect our reputation, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n16\nWe face risks associated with security breaches through cyber-attacks, cyber intrusions, or otherwise, which could pose a risk to our systems, networks and services.\nWe face risks associated with cyber-attacks, including hacking, viruses, malware, denial of service attacks, ransomware or other data security breaches. The risk of a security\nbreach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as\nthe number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions around the world have increased. Our business requires the continued operation of information\nsystems and network infrastructure. In the event of a cyber-attack that we were unable to defend against or mitigate, we could have our operations and the operations of our\ncustomers and others disrupted. We could also have our financial and other information systems and network infrastructure impaired, property damaged and customer and\nemployee information stolen; experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; and be subject to increased regulation, litigation, penalties and\ndamage to their reputation. While we maintain cyber insurance providing coverages, such insurance may not cover all costs associated with the consequences of personal and\nconfidential proprietary information being compromised. A security breach or other significant disruption involving computer networks and related systems could cause\nsubstantial costs and other negative effects, including litigation, remediation costs, costs to deploy additional protection strategies, compromising of confidential information,\nand reputational damage adversely affecting investor confidence. As a result, in the event of a material cyber security breach, our results of operations could be materially,\nadversely affected.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nWe are currently out of compliance with the Nasdaq’s continuing listing requirements and if we fail to satisfy all such applicable Nasdaq continued listing requirements,\nour common stock may be delisted from Nasdaq, which could have an adverse impact on the liquidity and market price of our common stock, and our plan to regain\ncompliance with these requirements may have an adverse effect on the Company and its stockholders.\nOur common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, which has qualitative and quantitative continued listing requirements, including corporate governance\nrequirements, public float requirements and a $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement. Our common stock price has been and may in the future be below the minimum\nbid price for continued listing on Nasdaq. On September 22, 2023, we received notice from Nasdaq indicating that the closing bid price for our common stock had fallen below\nthe minimum bid price for continued listing for 30 consecutive trading days and was no longer in compliance with the minimum bid requirement. In order to regain compliance,\nthe closing bid price of our common stock must be equal to or above the minimum bid price for a period of 10 consecutive trading days prior to March 20, 2024. In the event we\nfail to meet this requirement by such date, we may be eligible for an additional grace period of another 180 days, so long as it meets the applicable market value of publicly held\nshares requirement and other applicable listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, other than the minimum bid price requirement, on the trading date prior to the deadline,\nand informs Nasdaq of its intent to cure this deficiency. If we fail to meet these requirements or fail to satisfy any other continued listing requirements, Nasdaq may take steps\nto delist our common stock. Delisting would likely have an adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock, decrease the market price of our common stock, result in the\npotential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers, and employees, and fewer business development opportunities, and adversely affect our ability to obtain\nfinancing for our continuing operations.\nWe intend to regain compliance by effecting a reverse split of our common stock (the “Reverse Split”) following the 2024 Annual General Meeting of our stockholders. We\nwill be able to effect the Reverse Split only if our stockholders vote to approve it. It is possible that our stockholders will not approve the Reverse Split, and we may not be able\nto regain compliance with the NASDAQ continuing listing requirements if we do not effect the Reverse Split. The Reverse Split also presents certain other risks to the Company\nand its stockholders, including the risk of a decline in the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock.\nIn addition, for many companies, the company’s common stock price declines following a reverse split, resulting in a resulting in a reduction of the value of the company’s\ncommon stock on an aggregate basis and, accordingly, a decline in the value of common stockholders’ investment in the Company as compared to the value of such investment\nprior to the reverse split.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness, or if we identify additional\nmaterial weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial\ncondition or results of operations, which may adversely affect our business.\nAs more fully described in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have identified a material weakness that existed as of December 31,\n2023 related to our review of third-party valuation deliverables regarding our\n17\nconvertible debt and warrant liability. As a result of this material weakness, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over\nfinancial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2023.\nUnless and until this material weakness has been remediated, or if new material weaknesses arise in the future, material misstatements could occur and go undetected in our\ninterim or annual consolidated financial statements, and we may be required to restate our financial statements. In addition, we may experience delays in satisfying our\nreporting obligations or to comply with Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations, which could result in, among other things, regulatory or enforcement\nactions, securities litigation, limitations on our ability to access capital markets, debt rating agency downgrades or rating withdrawals, or loss in confidence of our investors, any\none of which could adversely affect the valuation of our common stock and our business prospects. We can give no assurance that the measures we have taken and plan to take\nin the future will remediate the material weakness identified or that any additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain\nadequate internal control over financial reporting.\nOur stock price and trading volume may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for our stockholders.\nThe equity trading markets may experience periods of volatility, which could result in highly variable and unpredictable pricing of equity securities. The market price of our\ncommon stock could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business, our industry or our operating performance and financial condition. In addition, the trading\nvolume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. We have experienced significant volatility in the price of our stock. In addition, the\nstock markets in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations.\nWe have not paid cash dividends in the past and have no immediate plans to pay cash dividends.\nWe plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the extent we have earnings, in order to develop our products, deliver on our orders and cover operating costs and to otherwise\nbecome and remain competitive. We do not plan to pay any cash dividends with respect to our securities in the foreseeable future. We cannot assure common stockholders that\nwe would, at any time, generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend. Therefore, common\nstockholders should not expect to receive cash dividends on our common stock.\nStockholders may experience future dilution as a result of future financings.\nIn order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock, including under our ATM Agreement and ELOC, or other securities\nconvertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share in our prior offerings. We may sell shares or other securities in\nany future offering at a price per share that is lower than the price per share paid by historical investors, which would result in those newly issued shares being dilutive. In\naddition, investors purchasing shares or other securities could have rights superior to existing stockholders, which could impair the value of existing stockholders. The price per\nshare at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than\nthe price per share paid by our historical investors.\nIn addition, the expected terms of a Possible Financing may be dilutive to investors. Among other things, these terms may include convertibility of a debt instrument or\npreferred instrument into common stock at a discount to current or historical market prices, which may result in substantial dilution to our existing investors, particularly if\nimmediately before any such conversion our stock price is below the price per share paid by historical investors. Other possible terms, such as original issue discount, common\nstock-settled redemption premiums or default penalties and substantial warrant coverage, could also have a dilutive effect, especially if our common stock price remains lower\nthan the price paid by our historical investors.\nOur charter documents and Nevada law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable provisions of Nevada law may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change\nin control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders\nmight otherwise deem to be in their best interests. The provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings;\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\ndo not provide for cumulative voting rights; and\n18\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nprovide that all vacancies may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum.\nThere are limitations on director/officer liability.\nAs permitted by Nevada law, our certificate of incorporation limits the liability of our directors and officers for monetary damages for breach of a director’s or officer’s\nfiduciary duty except for liability in certain instances. As a result of our charter provision and Nevada law, stockholders may have limited rights to recover against directors or\nofficers for breach of fiduciary duty. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that we shall indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by\nlaw.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nWe utilize an internal cross-departmental approach to addressing cybersecurity risk, including input from employees, Senior Management, and our Board of Directors. A cross\nfunctional Senior Management Cybersecurity Steering Committee devotes resources to cybersecurity and risk management to adapt to the changing cybersecurity landscape and\nrespond to emerging threats in a timely and effective manner. Our cybersecurity risk management program is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology\n(“NIST”) framework, which organizes cybersecurity risks into five categories: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. We regularly assess the threat landscape and take a\nholistic view of cybersecurity risks, with a layered cybersecurity strategy based on prevention, detection, and mitigation. Our information technology (“IT”) team reviews\nenterprise risk management-level cybersecurity risks annually, and risks are incorporated into the Enterprise Risk Management Committee framework. In addition, we have a\nset of Company-wide policies and procedures concerning cybersecurity matters, which include several IT Security policies as well as other policies that directly or indirectly\nrelate to cybersecurity, which address topics related to encryption standards, antivirus protection, remote access, multifactor authentication, confidential information and the use\nof the internet, social media, email, and networked devices. These policies go through an internal review process and are approved by appropriate members of management.\nThe Company’s Director of Cybersecurity in cooperation with the Chief Information Officer is responsible for developing and implementing our information security program\nand reporting on cybersecurity matters to the Company’s internal Cybersecurity Steering Committee. Our Director of Cybersecurity has over 20 years of experience leading\ncybersecurity oversight and holds cybersecurity certifications such as the CISSP (“Certified Information Systems Security Professional”).\nWe periodically perform simulations to test employees and provide any necessary remedial training. All employees are required to complete cybersecurity training at least once\na year and have access to more frequent cybersecurity training online. We may also require employees in certain roles to complete additional role-based, specialized\ncybersecurity training. We continue to expand investments in IT security, taking a multi-layered security approach, which includes additional end-user training, improving\nsecurity defenses, network segmentation, identifying and protecting critical assets, strengthening monitoring, and alerting, and leveraging industry experts where available.\nWe regularly test defenses by performing simulations and drills at both a technical level (including through penetration tests) and by reviewing our operational policies and\nprocedures with third-party experts. At the management level, our IT security team monitors alerts and meets to discuss threat levels, trends, and remediation. Our IT team also\nregularly collects data on cybersecurity threats and risk areas and conducts a periodic risk assessment. Further, we conduct external penetration tests and maturity testing to\nassess our processes and procedures and the threat landscape. These tests and assessments are useful tools for maintaining a robust cybersecurity program to protect our\ninvestors, customers, employees, vendors, and intellectual property.\nIn addition to assessing our own cybersecurity preparedness, we also consider and evaluate cybersecurity risks associated with the use of third-party service providers. Our\nInternal Audit team conducts an annual review of third-party hosted applications with a specific focus on any sensitive data shared with third parties. In collaboration with our\nInternal Audit team, the internal business owners of the hosted applications are required to document user access reviews at least annually and provide from the vendor a\nSystem and Organization Controls (“SOC”) 1 or SOC 2 report.\n19\nThe Audit Committee and the Board actively participate in discussions with management and amongst themselves regarding cybersecurity risks. The Audit Committee’s semi-\nannual cybersecurity review also includes review of recent enhancements to the Company’s defenses and management’s progress on its cybersecurity strategic roadmap. In\naddition, the Cybersecurity Steering Committee receives quarterly cybersecurity reports, which include a review of key performance indicators, test results and related\nremediation, and may discuss recent threats and how the Company is managing those threats.\nWe face a number of cybersecurity risks in connection with our business. Although such risks have not materially affected us, including our business strategy, results of\noperations or financial condition, to date, we have, from time to time, experienced threats to our data and systems, including malware, phishing, and other types of cyber-\nattacks. For more information about the cybersecurity risks we face, see the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nWe operate facilities in Ohio, Indiana and Michigan. Our corporate headquarters and research and development facility is located in the Greater Cincinnati area in Ohio and our\nprimary manufacturing facility is located in Union City, Indiana. We also operate an engineering and technical design center in Wixom, Michigan and an engineering, technical\ndesign and production facility for our drone systems in Mason, Ohio.\nWe believe our facilities are in good operating condition and that our facilities are adequate for all present and near term uses.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFor a description of certain material legal proceedings, please see Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\nSECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “WKHS”.\nHolders of our Common Stock\nAs of February 1, 2024, we had approximately 150 shareholders of record. This does not include persons whose stock is in nominee or “street name” accounts through banks,\nbrokers and other financial institutions.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business. As a result,\nwe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board of\nDirectors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that\nour Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities and Use of Proceeds\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Company issued 228,650 shares of its common stock to Mitsubishi as payment for services rendered in connection with the\nStables by Workhorse program, relying on the exemption set forth under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2023, no shares of our common stock were repurchased by the Company.\nITEM 6. [RESERVED]\n21\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\nOverview and 2023 Highlights\nDuring 2023, we were focused on our goals of launching new vehicle platforms, increasing our vehicle production and capacity, increasing the affordability of our vehicles,\nand developing plans for our next generation of products. We continue to focus on product quality, manufacturing capacity and operational planning, as well as engineering and\ndesign to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products and future revenue growth. In addition to our ongoing production ramp in 2023, we intend to continue to\ngenerate demand and brand awareness by demonstrating our vehicles’ performance and functionality. During the period, we began executing our revised strategic product\nroadmap for our electric vehicle delivery offerings. The foundation of this plan is the development of a new truck chassis platforms, the W56, which entered production during\nthe year.\nCommercial Vehicles\nIn 2023, we launched the production of two new delivery EVs, the W750 and W56, highlighting our continued success in executing our revised strategic product roadmap for\nour electric vehicle delivery offerings. The foundation of this plan is the development of the W56 truck chassis platform. The W56 is our first fully-designed, purpose-built\nClass 5/6 model chassis platform built from the ground up, is an EV-space leading vehicle which provides a unique blend of high reliability, quality, and serviceability. The\nzero-emission delivery work truck is designed to meet the challenging demands of the commercial vehicle industry, supporting benchmark payload capacity of up to\napproximately 10,000 pounds and with a range of up to 150 miles. The W56 step van also offers a large 1,000+ cubic foot cargo box with lowered step-in and wide cabin door\nfor easier entry and exit. During 2023, we were focused on bringing our existing W56 vehicles into full compliance with Federal Motor Safety Vehicle Standards (“FMVSS”),\nwhich we achieved. Our product roadmap also includes the WNext platform, which will be our second generation, low floor, advanced content offering and is expected to begin\nproduction in late 2025 or 2026.\nIn 2023, we continued producing and selling the W4 CC and delivered the first units of the W750, despite unforeseen production and supply issues affecting the W4 CC and\nW750 vehicles, which have been resolved. The W4 CC is a Class 4 vehicle, under the Workhorse brand and with Workhorse after sales and support service, providing us with\nan accelerated time-to-market for customers seeking delivery of electric vehicles. We also launched and started selling the step van version, known as the W750, which has\napproximately 750 cubic foot capacity and will feature up to 150 miles of all-electric range, with a payload capacity of five thousand pounds.\nAero\nDuring 2023, we entered our third program with the NRCS to demonstrate our ability to provide small UAS DaaS to support NRCS efforts. We started this program as a small\npilot in 2021. After over two years of working with the NRCS, farmers and ranchers, we have developed data products that help underserved farmers and ranchers providing\nLiDar data to stakeholders in reports they can use to increase the efficiency of their land. As part of the pilot program, we offer small UAS services, including monitoring via\ndrone, data procurement and analytics, allowing expedited information delivery, increased safety, cost-effective, and increase fidelity of the data gathered, creating a more\nefficient procedure.\nIn 2023, we developed and launched the production of two product lines of small UAS. During the first quarter of 2024, we have made the decision to fully transition from a\ndesign and manufacturing drone business to DaaS. This transition resulted in, among other things, our stopping production and development of both product lines and the\ntermination of employees who performed the related work.\nCertified Dealer Program\nDuring 2023, we continued to add dealers to our Certified Dealer Program, expanding the official network of verified dealers trained to safely repair and maintain the electric\ncomponents of our vehicles into new states to support our customers. The Certified Dealer Program allows us to establish a comprehensive training program enabling dealers to\nsafely assist customers with vehicle maintenance in addition to providing strategies for vehicle deployment into their fleets. To ensure high quality vehicle maintenance,\nWorkhorse certified dealers have also made investments in electric vehicle charging infrastructure,\n22\ntooling, and building out spare parts inventory. The Certified Dealer Program is designed to provide a strong foundation of safety and reliability in our vehicles for both our\ndealers and end customers. Our California dealers are eligible to participate in the CARB HVIP as a result of our recent approval by CARB to participate as an intermediate-\nstage manufacturer.\nVehicle Credits and Certifications\nDuring 2023, we became certified and obtained several state and federal voucher and tax credit incentive programs supporting the sale of our EV products. All of our MY\n2023/2024 Class 4 - 6 products received approval under the New York Truck Voucher Incentive Program (“NYTVIP”) with voucher amounts ranging from $100,000 -\n$125,000 for eligible vehicles.\nWe also received IRS approval as a qualified manufacturer for the Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit as defined in 30D(d)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. With this approval,\nWorkhorse customers are eligible to receive up to a $40,000 credit for deliveries of all Workhorse vehicles in 2023 and beyond.\nDuring 2023, CARB approved Workhorse's application to participate in the HVIP with its W4CC and W750 work trucks. Workhorse received this approval as part of a first-of-\nits-kind program that allows vehicle modifiers to list their vehicles directly with HVIP. Workhorse will be the first company to participate in the program. These Workhorse\nvehicles are listed on the HVIP website and we have our own manufacturer's pool for the trucks. We additionally received approval for the W56 Step Van to participate in the\nHVIP program in late Q4 of 2023 and, as such, all Workhorse vehicles are now eligible for the program.\nStables by Workhorse\nDuring 2023, we continued to electrify the fleet of vehicles being used to operate the FedEx delivery route in the greater Cincinnati area of Ohio known as Stables by\nWorkhorse. The electrification of the fleet will provide us with firsthand data on of the challenges and benefits of independent fleet operators experience while executing last-\nmile delivery operations. The initiative also provides valuable insights into how our customers can plan for and manage the transition to EV, including how to develop adequate\ncharging infrastructure, training and maintenance services.\nSecurities Litigation and Shareholder Derivative Litigation\nOn July 24, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered an order granting final approval of the Stipulation of Settlement entered into by the parties\nto the Securities Litigation on January 13, 2023. Pursuant to the Stipulation of Settlement, in exchange for a release of all claims and dismissal with prejudice of the Securities\nClass Action, the Company agreed to create a settlement fund with an escrow agent (the “Settlement Fund”), consisting of $15 million in cash and $20 million in shares of\ncommon stock of the Company (the “Settlement Shares”) from which class members would receive payment.\nOn June 21, 2023, the State District Court of Nevada granted final approval of the settlement of the Shareholder Derivative Litigation. Under the terms of the settlement, the\nCompany will receive $12.5 million of the $15.0 million described above from the Company’s directors and officers insurers and will, in turn, deliver the $12.5 million in\nconnection with the settlement of the Securities Litigation. The Company has also agreed to adopt various corporate governance changes. The parties agreed to a $4.0 million\nfee to the derivative plaintiffs’ attorneys, $3.5 million of which is payable by the D&O insurers and $0.5 million of which was payable by the Company.\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, we issued 25.4 million shares of common stock in settlement of our previously disclosed securities class action litigation, pursuant to the\nstipulation of settlement. For further information regarding the Shareholder Derivative Litigation and the settlement thereof, please see Note 15, “Commitments and\nContingencies – Legal Proceedings – Shareholder Derivative Litigation” included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHigh Trail Securities Purchase Agreement and Amendment\nOn December 27, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), the Company consummated the transactions contemplated by the previously disclosed securities purchase agreement (the\n“Securities Purchase Agreement”) entered into with High Trail Special Situations LLC (the “Investor”) on December 12, 2023. On the Closing Date the Company issued and\nsold in a registered public offering by the Company directly to the Investor (the “Offering”) a (i) green senior secured convertible note for the principal amount of $20.0 million\n(the “Note”) that is convertible into common stock and (ii) warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase 25,601,639 shares of common stock. The Note was issued pursuant to an\nindenture (the “Base Indenture”) and supplemental indenture (the\n23\n“Supplemental Indenture” and together with the Base Indenture, the “Indenture”) that the Company entered into with U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as\ntrustee, on the Closing Date.\nThe Securities Purchase Agreement permits, but does not require, the Company to issue up to $20.0 million of additional pari passu notes (the “Additional Note”) on\nsubstantially the same terms as the Notes, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Securities Purchase Agreement. If the Company issues any Additional Note,\nit will also be required to issue warrants (“Additional Warrants”) on substantially the same terms as the Warrant, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the\nSecurities Purchase Agreement.\nThe Note was issued with original issue discount of 12.5%, resulting in $17.5 million of proceeds to the Company before fees and expenses. The Note’s stated maturity date is\nOctober 1, 2026, and the Note provides that the Investor may, at its option, require us to redeem up to 12.5% of the original principal amount of the Note in cash on the 1st and\n15th of each month beginning on January 1, 2024. Accordingly, we expect that the full principal amount of the Note will be recorded on our balance sheet as a short-term\nliability. The Note will be a senior secured obligation of the Company and rank senior to all unsecured debt of the Company. The Company’s obligations under the Note will be\nguaranteed by all of its subsidiaries, pursuant to a certain subsidiary guaranty entered into on the Closing Date between the Company, each of its subsidiaries and the Investor in\nits capacity as collateral agent (the “Collateral Agent”) (the “Guaranty”). The Note will initially be secured by substantially all the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries,\npursuant to a security agreement entered into between the Company, each of its subsidiaries and the Collateral Agent (the “Security Agreement”). The Note will not bear\ninterest, other than default interest, if any.\nThe Note is convertible into common stock at a conversion price equal to $0.5178 (the “Conversion Price”), subject to customary adjustments for certain corporate events. The\nInvestor may also elect to receive redemption payments in the form of common stock on the conversion terms provided in the Note. Subject to certain conditions, the Company\ncan require the Investor to convert the Note at any time if the Daily VWAP (as defined below) of the Company’s common stock exceeds 175% of the Conversion Price on each\nof the immediately preceding 20 consecutive trading days.\nThe Investor also may require us to redeem the Note in cash in full upon (i) a change of control or other fundamental change at the Company, as described in the Note, at a\npremium equal to the greater of (a) 115% of the Conversion Value (as defined below) and (b) 105% of the outstanding principal amount of the Note, plus any accrued and\nunpaid default interest, or (ii) an event of default under the terms of the Note at a premium equal to the greater of (a) 115% of the Conversion Value and (b) 115% of the\noutstanding principal amount of the Note, plus any accrued and unpaid default interest. As used herein, “Conversion Value” means the outstanding principal amount of the\nNote, plus any accrued and unpaid default interest, divided by the Conversion Price multiplied by the highest daily volume weighted average price for our common stock (the\n“Daily VWAP”) in the 30 trading days preceding the applicable triggering event.\nThe Note contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including certain limitations on debt, liens, restricted payments, asset transfers, changes in the business and\ntransactions with affiliates. It also requires the Company to at all times maintain minimum liquidity of the lesser of (i) $10.0 million and (ii) the then aggregate outstanding\nprincipal amount under the Notes and any Additional Notes in a deposit account under the control of the collateral agent. Further, it requires the Company to reserve unissued\nshares for issuance upon conversion or exercise of all Notes and Warrants, and any Additional Notes and Additional Warrants, if issued, in a number equal to the sum of (A) the\ngreater of (i) 150% of (x) the principal amount outstanding under all Notes and any Additional Notes plus all interest accruable on such outstanding principal amount through\nthe Maturity Date divided by the Daily VWAP for our common stock on such applicable determination date and (ii) the maximum number of shares issuable upon the full\nconversion of all Notes then outstanding and (B) the maximum number of shares issuable upon the full exercise of the Warrants and any Additional Warrants then outstanding.\nIn addition, the Note requires that the Company have cash and cash equivalents of at least (x) $25.0 million on December 31, 2023, (y) $13.5 million on January 31, 2024, and\n(z) of $20.0 million on February 29, 2024. In the event of a default or event of default under the Note, the Note would accrue default interest at a rate of 15.0% per annum\n(“Default Interest”) until such default is cured and all outstanding Default Interest has been paid. In addition, in the event we consummate a sale and leaseback transaction with\nrespect to the real property where our Union City plant is located, the Investor may, at its option, require us to use up to half of the proceeds we receive in such a sale leaseback\ntransaction to redeem outstanding principal under the Note.\nThe exercise price per share of common stock under the Warrant, which has since been cancelled, as discussed below, was $0.4492, which was equal to 115% of the Nasdaq\nMinimum Price on the date of the Securities Purchase Agreement, subject to adjustments for certain corporate events. The Warrant was immediately exercisable and expires\nthree years after the Closing Date. The Investor had a purchase right that allows the Investor to participate in transactions in which the Company issues or\n24\nsells certain securities or other property to holders of the Company’s common stock (the “Purchase Rights”). The Purchase Rights allowed the Investor to acquire, on the terms\nand conditions applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Investor would have been able to acquire if the Investor held the number of shares\nof common stock acquirable upon exercise of the Warrant. In the event of a Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the Warrant) that is not a change of control or corporate\nevent as described in the Warrant, the surviving entity would have been required to assume the Company’s obligations under the Warrant. In addition, if the Company had\nengaged in certain transactions that result in the holders of the common stock receiving consideration, a holder of the Warrant would have had the option to either (i) exercise\nthe Warrant prior to the consummation of such transaction and receive the consideration to be issued or distributed in connection with such transaction or (ii) cause the\nCompany to repurchase the Warrant for its then Black-Scholes Value.\nIn addition to the $7.5 million principal amount of the Note previously redeemed by the Company on the Partial Redemption Dates (as defined in the Note) provided in the\nNote, on February 29, 2024, the Company entered into a First Amendment to Green Senior Secured Convertible Note Due 2026 (the “Note Amendment”) with the Holder\npursuant to which (i) the Company redeemed $10.0 million principal amount of the Note using funds in a controlled account that had been pledged as collateral securing the\nCompany’s obligations under the Note, thereby reducing the outstanding principal amount of the Note to $2.5 million, and (ii) the parties amended the Note to remove February\n15, 2024 and March 1, 2024 as Partial Redemption Dates, permit the Company to prepay the Note at its option, subject to certain conditions, and delete the minimum liquidity\ncovenant. In connection with the Note Amendment, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) whereby the Company exchanged the Warrant\nwith the Holder for a total of 8.5 million shares of common stock, whereupon the Warrant was cancelled (the “Exchange”). The Exchange was made pursuant to the exemption\nregistration provided under Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act.\nLincoln Park Capital Purchase Agreement\nOn December 12, 2023, the Company entered into a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement” or the “ELOC”) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (the “Purchaser”)\n(each, a “Party”, and together, the “Parties”), which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, the Company may sell to the\nPurchaser up to $50.0 million of shares (the “Purchase Shares”) of common stock over the 24-month term of the Purchase Agreement. Concurrently with entering into the\nPurchase Agreement, the Company also entered into a registration rights agreement with the Purchaser, pursuant to which it agreed to provide the Purchaser with certain\nregistration rights related to the shares issued under the Purchase Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”).\nFor a period of up to 24 months after the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right, but not the obligation, on any business\nday selected by the Company (the “Purchase Date”), provided that on such day the closing sale price per-share of the common stock is above the Floor Price, as defined in the\nPurchase Agreement, to require the Purchaser to purchase up to 1.0 million shares of common stock (the “Regular Purchase Amount”) at the Purchase Price (as defined below)\nper purchase notice (each such purchase, a “Regular Purchase”) provided, however, that the limit on the Regular Purchase Amount will be increased to (i) 1.25 million, if the\nclosing sale price of the common stock on the applicable Purchase Date is not below $0.40 and (ii) 1.5 million shares, if the closing sale price of the common stock on the\napplicable Purchase Date is not below $0.50. The purchase price for Regular Purchases (the “Purchase Price”) shall be equal to 97.5% of the lower of (i) the lowest Sale Price\n(as defined in the Purchase Agreement) on the Purchase Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) for such Regular Purchase and (ii) the arithmetic average of the three (3)\nlowest Closing Sale Prices (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) for the common stock during the ten (10) consecutive business days ending on the business day immediately\npreceding such Purchase Date for such Regular Purchase (in each case, to be appropriately adjusted for any reorganization, recapitalization, non-cash dividend, stock split,\nreverse stock split or other similar transaction that occurs on or after the date of the Purchase Agreement). The Company shall have the right to submit a Regular Purchase\nnotice to the Purchaser as often as every business day. A Regular Purchase notice is delivered to the Purchaser after the market has closed (i.e., after 4:00 P.M. Eastern Time) so\nthat the Purchase Price is always fixed and known at the time the Company elects to sell shares to the Purchaser.\nIn addition to Regular Purchases and provided that the Company has directed a Regular Purchase in full, the Company in its sole discretion may require the Purchaser on each\nPurchase Date to purchase on the following business day (“Accelerated Purchase Date”) up to the lesser of (i) three (3) times the number of shares purchased pursuant to such\nRegular Purchase or (ii) an amount equal to (A) the Accelerated Purchase Share Percentage (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) multiplied by (B) the total number (or\nvolume) of shares of common stock traded on the Principal Market (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) during the period on the applicable Accelerated Purchase Date (as\ndefined in the Purchase Agreement) beginning at the Accelerated Purchase Commencement Time (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) for such Accelerated Purchase and\nending at the Accelerated Purchase Termination Time (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) for such Accelerated Purchase (the\n25\n“Accelerated Purchase”) at a purchase price equal to the lesser of 97% of (i) the closing sale price on the Accelerated Purchase Date, or (ii) the Accelerated Purchase Date’s\nvolume weighted average price (the “Accelerated Purchase Price”).\nThe Company may also direct the Purchaser, on any business day on which an Accelerated Purchase has been completed, to make additional purchases upon the same terms as\nan Accelerated Purchase (an “Additional Accelerated Purchase”).\nThe purchase price of Regular Purchases, Accelerated Purchases and Additional Accelerated Purchases and the minimum closing sale price for a Regular Purchase will be\nadjusted for any reorganization, recapitalization, non-cash dividend, stock split or other similar transaction occurring during the business days used to compute the purchase\nprice. The aggregate number of shares that the Company can sell to the Purchaser (including the Commitment Shares) at or below the price of $0.3906 per share under the\nPurchase Agreement may in no case exceed 52,151,507 shares (subject to adjustment as described above) of common stock (which is equal to approximately 19.99% of the\nshares of the common stock outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the Purchase Agreement) (the “Exchange Cap”), unless shareholder approval is obtained to issue\nPurchase Shares above the Exchange Cap, in which case the Exchange Cap will no longer apply, in accordance with Nasdaq Capital Market rules.\nThe Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, closing conditions, indemnification and termination provisions. The Company is not\npermitted to make sales under the Purchase Agreement during the pendency of certain “Suspension Events,” including the unavailability of an effective registration statement\nfor the sale of Purchase Shares by the Company or the Purchaser.\nThe Purchase Agreement may be terminated by the Company at any time, at its sole discretion, without any cost or penalty, by giving one business day’s notice to the Purchaser\nto terminate the Purchase Agreement. The Purchaser has covenanted not to cause or engage in any manner whatsoever, any direct or indirect short selling or hedging of the\ncommon stock. In connection with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, the Company issued 3,775,105 shares of common stock to the Purchaser as a fee for its\ncommitment to purchase shares of common stock under the Purchase Agreement (the “Commitment Shares”).\nThere are no restrictions on future financings, rights of first refusal, participation rights, penalties or liquidated damages in the Purchase Agreement or Registration Rights\nAgreement, other than a prohibition (with certain limited exceptions) on entering into specified Variable Rate Transactions (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) for the\nperiod specified in the Purchase Agreement.\nThe issuance of the Purchase Shares and Commitment Shares have been registered pursuant to the Company’s effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-\n273357) (the “Registration Statement”), and the related base prospectus included in the Registration Statement, as supplemented by a prospectus supplement to be filed on or\naround the Commencement Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement).\nThe Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement contain customary representations and warranties, covenants and indemnification provisions that the parties made\nto, and solely for the benefit of, each other in the context of all of the terms and conditions of such agreements and in the context of the specific relationship between the parties\nthereto. The provisions of the Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement, including any representations and warranties contained therein, are not for the benefit\nof any party other than the parties thereto and are not intended as documents for investors and the public to obtain factual information about the current state of affairs of the\nparties thereto. Rather, investors and the public should look to other disclosures contained in the Company’s annual, quarterly and current reports it may file with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission.\nInvestment in Tropos Technologies, Inc\nWe have a minority ownership investment in Tropos Technologies, Inc. (“Tropos”) which was obtained during the third quarter of 2022 in exchange for a cash payment of $5.0\nmillion and a $5.0 million contribution of non-cash consideration representing a deposit from Tropos for future assembly services under an Assembly Services Agreement.\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, we determined that our investment in Tropos was impaired based on the economic conditions and uncertainties that have significantly affected\nTropos' performance and financial position. The impairment charge recognized for our investment is $10.0 million, which represents the difference between the original cost of\nthe investment and its fair value as of the impairment assessment date. Despite the impairment, we continued to perform assembly services.\n26\nManagement Opportunities, Challenges, Risks and 2024 Outlook\nWe continue to seek opportunities to grow the business organically, and by expanding relationships with existing and new customers. We believe we are well positioned to take\nadvantage of long-term opportunities and continue our efforts to bring product innovations to market.\nRecent Trends and Market Conditions\nWe continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and we will have to accurately project demand and\ninfrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly. For more detailed descriptions of the impact and risks to our\nbusiness, please see certain risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMarket Demand. Sales performance during 2023 was down largely due to slower-than-anticipated industry wide electric vehicle adoption rates and lack of government\nsubsidies and incentives available to our dealers as well as slower than expected roll-out of additional power to electric grids and the resulting effect on roll-outs of electric\nvehicle charging infrastructure, nationwide. However, we expect adoption rates to accelerate through 2024 driven by more stringent state and federal emissions requirements\nand continued government subsidies and incentives that will continue to reduce cost barriers for EV ownership, including the approval for our W56 platform for the HVIP\nprogram through CARB, providing an $85,000 base voucher per W56 vehicle purchased.\nCommodities. Prices for commodities remain volatile, and we expect to experience price increases for base metals and raw materials that are used in batteries for electric\nvehicles (e.g., lithium, cobalt, and nickel) as well as steel, aluminum and other material inputs. Global demand and differences in output across sectors have generated\ndivergence in price movements across different commodities. We expect the net impact on us overall will be higher material costs.\nInflation. Inflation continues to impact our operations, resulting from both supply and demand imbalances as economies continue to face constraints as well as the impact on the\navailability and cost of energy and other commodities as a result of the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Israel. We are seeing a near-term impact on our business due to\ninflationary pressure. In an effort to dampen inflationary pressures, central banks have continued to raise interest rates which will likely raise the cost of any financing the\nCompany may undertake in the future.\nThe following section provides a narrative discussion of our financial condition and results of operations. The comments should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and related Notes thereto included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nOur consolidated statements of operations financial information is as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nSales, net of returns and allowances $ 13,094,752 $ 5,023,072\nCost of sales 38,350,545 37,672,308\nGross loss (25,255,793) (32,649,236)\nOperating expenses\nSelling, general and administrative 55,574,740 73,220,088\nResearch and development 24,467,933 23,213,540\nTotal operating expenses 80,042,673 96,433,628\nLoss from operations (105,298,466) (129,082,864)\nInterest expense, net (8,731,247) (1,837,882)\nOther (loss) income (10,000,000) 13,646,528\nLoss before for income taxes (124,029,713) (117,274,218)\nBenefit from income taxes (110,524) —\nNet loss $ (123,919,189) $ (117,274,218)\n27\nRevenue\nSales increased $8.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in W4 CC volumes. The\nW750 and W56 products, which launched in 2023, Stables by Workhorse and drones as a service also contributed to the increase.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales includes direct and indirect materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, shipping and logistics costs, and\nreserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of sales also includes charges to write down the carrying amount of tooling and machinery when it exceeds the fair value of the\nasset or asset group, charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand\ninventory in excess of forecasted demand.\nCost of sales increased $0.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased\nproduction and overhead costs to support higher sales volumes related to new vehicle platforms and an increase in employee compensation and related expenses compared to\n2022 levels. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in inventory reserves, adjustments and disposals, which was driven by the disposition of C-Series inventory in 2022.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses generally consist of personnel and facilities costs related to our sales, marketing, executive, finance, human resources,\ninformation technology and legal organizations as well as fees for professional and contract services and litigation settlements.\nSG&A expenses decreased $17.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was driven by a $25.2 million\ndecrease in expenses attributable to the securities and derivative litigation settlements and legal expenses recognized in the same period last year. This decrease was partially\noffset by a $3.0 million increase in employee compensation and related expenses, including non-cash stock-based compensation expense, a $2.1 million increase in professional\nand other services expenses, a $0.9 million impairment of our leased Aero facility and a $0.6 million increase in corporate insurance expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development (“R&D”) expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research, manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test\norganizations, prototyping expense, and contract and professional services.\nR&D expenses increased $1.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe increase was primarily driven by an increase of $1.4 million in employee compensation and related expenses and a $0.8 million increase in development expenses for new\nproducts. These increases were partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in consulting expenses.\nOther Loss (Income)\nOther loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $10.0 million as compared to $13.6 million other income for the year ended December 31, 2022. Other loss in the current\nperiod represents the impairment of our investment in Tropos. Other income in the prior year represents proceeds from the sale of C-Series inventory that was previously fully\nreserved.\nInterest Expense, Net\nNet interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $8.7 million as compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net interest expense in the\ncurrent year was driven by a fair value adjustment of our convertible notes and warrants of $8.3 million and $2.1 million fees paid in connection with the Securities Purchase\nAgreement and Equity Line of Credit Purchase Agreement (“ELOC”), offset by interest earned on cash balances in our money market investment accounts. Net interest expense\nin the prior year was primarily related to $1.4 million of fair value adjustments, $0.3 million of contractual interest expense, and $0.4 million of loss on conversion of our\nformer convertible notes, which were exchanged for shares of our common stock during 2022.\n28\nProvision for Income Tax\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has taxable losses and therefore no provision for income tax has been recorded. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, we did receive $(0.1) million for the return of a prior year tax provision.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources; Going Concern\nWe had $13.1 million of sales for the year ended December 31, 2023 .As of December 31, 2023, we had total working capital of $40.5 million, including $35.8 million in cash,\ncash equivalents and restricted cash, and accumulated deficit of $751.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred a loss from operations of $105.3 million\nand used $123.0 million of cash in operating activities.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of management’s intended plan over the next twelve months to improve the Company’s\nliquidity and manage working capital requirements. A vital component of such plan is the consummation of a financing in the immediate future to address these requirements in\nthe short term.\nAccordingly, the Company is in the process of negotiating with potential financing sources for a financing transaction that would make liquidity available both in the short term\nand over time. The Company intends to consummate a Possible Financing in the near future.\nAlthough the terms of a Possible Financing remain under negotiation, the Company currently expects that any such financing would have a cost of capital materially higher than\nthe cost of capital of its existing financing arrangements and a substantial potentially dilutive equity component, whether through a conversion feature, significant warrant\ncoverage or both. A Possible Financing may also contain terms that limit the Company’s ability to sell common stock under its ATM Agreement and ELOC Agreement and to\nincur new debt.\nThere is no assurance that any Possible Financing will be available on any terms. If we are not able to complete a Possible Financing or find another source of liquidity in the\nimmediate future, we may be unable to continue our operations or may need to substantially reduce them.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of management’s intended plan over the next twelve months to improve the Company’s\nliquidity and working capital requirements. We have made significant progress executing on our revised strategic product roadmap for our electric vehicle offerings, and we\nexpect to generate additional sales within the next twelve months which will help support our operations. Additionally, management plans to reduce its discretionary spend\nrelated to non-contracted capital expenditures and other expenses. However, if the expected sales are not generated and management is not able to control capital expenditures\nand other expenses, we will continue to incur substantial operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in\nimplementing our plans or acquiring additional funding, that our projections of our future capital needs will prove accurate, or that any additional funding would be sufficient to\ncontinue operations in future years.\nOur future funding requirements will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to:\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nour ability to produce our current generation of vehicles at required scale and to sell such vehicles to customers;\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nour ability to acquire or license other technologies we may seek to pursue;\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nour ability to manage our growth and operational expenses; and\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\ncompeting technological and market developments.\nTo the extent revenues from operations are insufficient to meet our liquidity requirements, our ability to continue as a going concern will be dependent on effectively raising\ncapital through private or public placement of our equity securities, including the continued use of the ATM Agreement (as further described below), for which there can be no\nassurance we will be successful in such efforts. We will also rely on debt financing or other sources of capital funding such as through the sale of assets to obtain sufficient\nfinancial resources to fund our operating activities. If we are unable to maintain sufficient financial resources, our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well\nas our ability to continue to develop, produce and market our new vehicle programs and satisfy our obligations as they become due, will be materially and adversely affected.\nThis could affect future vehicle program production and sales. Failure to obtain additional financing will have a material, adverse impact on our business operations. There can\nbe no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing needed to\n29\nachieve our goals on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, any equity or equity linked financings would likely have a dilutive effect on the holdings of our existing\nstockholders. The Company’s current level of cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to execute our business plan. For the foreseeable future, we will incur significant\noperating expenses, capital expenditures and working capital funding that will deplete our cash on hand.\nOur ability to obtain additional financing is extremely limited under current market conditions including the significant amount of capital required, the Nasdaq Listing\nRequirements, the market price of our stock and potential dilution from the issuance of any additional securities. If we are unable to identify other sources of funding, we may\nneed to further adjust our operations, including and up to filing a voluntary petition for relief under the Bankruptcy Code. If this were to occur, the value available to our various\nstakeholders, including our creditors and stockholders, is uncertain and trading prices for our securities may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by\nholders of our securities in bankruptcy proceedings, if any.\nAs a result of all of the matters discussed above, including our losses, current liquidity level and our projected capital needs, substantial doubt exists about the Company’s\nability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months from the date of issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial\nstatements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classification of assets, liabilities, and reported expenses that may be necessary if the Company were\nunable to continue as a going concern.\nUnder the ATM Agreement, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $175.0 million, in amounts and at times determined by\nmanagement. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we issued 89.3 million shares under the ATM Agreement for net proceeds of $63.5 million. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, we issued 4.9 million shares under the ATM Agreement for net proceeds of $12.9 million. As of December 31, 2023 we had approximately $85.6 million\navailable through the issuance of shares of common stock under the ATM Agreement.\nOn December 12, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) under which the Company issued $20.0 million\nprincipal amount of green senior convertible notes and warrants to purchase 25,601,639 shares of common stock. The convertible notes were issued with an original issue\ndiscount of 12.5%. The Company paid fees in connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement of $0.6 million, resulting in net proceeds of $16.9 million.\nIf consummated, a Possible Financing could impose significant restrictions on our ability to sell shares of our common stock under the ATM Agreement and the ELOC\nAgreement.\nOn December 12, 2023, the Company also entered into an equity line of credit purchase agreement (the “ELOC Purchase Agreement”) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC\n(the “Purchaser”) under which the Company may sell to the Purchaser up to $50.0 million of shares of common stock over the 24-month term of the ELOC Purchase\nAgreement. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company did not sell any shares of common stock pursuant to the ELOC Purchase Agreement.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we maintained an investment in a bank money market fund. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to\nliquidity and capital preservation. Wherever possible, we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk. We will continue to monitor the impact of\nthe changes in the conditions of the credit and financial markets to our investment portfolio and assess if future changes in our investment strategy are necessary.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (123,024,049) $ (93,818,664)\nNet cash used in investing activities (18,687,451) (20,019,519)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 78,281,114 11,467,090\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur cash flows from operating activities are affected by our cash investments to support the business in research and development, manufacturing, selling, general and\nadministration. Our operating cash flows are also affected by our working capital needs to support fluctuations in inventory, personnel expenses, accounts payable and other\ncurrent assets and liabilities.\n30\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, net cash used in operating activities was $123.0 million and $93.8 million, respectively. The increase in net cash used in\noperations was primarily attributable to an increase in spend related to initial inventory builds as we continue to ramp up our production of the W4 CC, W750 and W56 vehicle\nprograms.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures to upgrade our administrative, research, and production\nfacilities, which were $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Cash flows used in investing activities for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 also included a $5.0 million cash payment made in connection with our investment in Tropos, which is described in Note 5, Contract\nManufacturing Services and Investment in Tropos.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was $78.3 million compared to $11.5 million in 2022. Net cash provided by financing\nactivities in 2023 was primarily attributable to the issuance of common stock under our ATM Agreement which provided net proceeds of approximately $62.2 million,\ncompared to net proceeds of approximately $12.9 million in the prior year.\nCash Requirements\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of\nour products. However, due to contractual terms, variability in the precise growth curves of our development and production ramps, and opportunities to renegotiate pricing, we\ngenerally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts beyond the short term, and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period\nis difficult to accurately project.\nWe currently expect our capital expenditures to upgrade our manufacturing equipment and tooling to be between $5.0 and $10.0 million in 2024.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition,\nchanges in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the\naccounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could\nhave used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThere are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above.\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The preparation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. We base our estimates on\nhistorical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, actual results could differ from\nthose estimates. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our\nfuture financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.\nInventory Valuation\nNature of Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We write-down inventory for any excess or obsolete inventories or when we believe the\nnet realizable value of inventories is less than the carrying value.\n31\nAssumptions and Approach Used: We review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory.\nThis requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our inventory based on market conditions. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory\nis established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. The following are key\nassumptions we used in establishing inventory reserves:\n• Business projections: We make assumptions about the demand for our products in the marketplace. These assumptions drive our planning assumptions for volume, mix,\nand pricing. A change in our planned production volumes can materially impact the estimate of excess and obsolete inventories.\n• Economic projections: Assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding sales and pricing estimates for our\nvehicles. Additionally, these assumptions affect our ability to sell inventories on hand in the open market. These assumptions include sales volume, inflation, and prices\nof raw materials. A change in economic conditions can materially impact the estimate of the net realizable value of inventories.\nShould our estimates of future inventory usage or selling prices change, additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required. A small change in our\nestimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results. Refer to Note 2, Inventory, to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding\ninventory valuation.\nFair Value of Warrant Liability\nNature of Estimates Required: We accounted for the warrant in accordance with the guidance contained in topic ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, (“ASC 480”),\nunder which the warrant is required to be accounted for as a liability. Accordingly, the Company classified the warrant as a liability at fair value upon issuance and will adjust\nthe instrument to fair value at each reporting period until settled or the contract expires. The change in fair value of the warrant will be recognized in our statement of operations.\nAssumptions and Approach Used: The fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is widely used for valuing warrants. The significant\nassumptions used in the model are as follows:\n• Volatility: The volatility used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model was estimated based on historical prices for the Company’s common stock with a look-back\nperiod equal to the time difference between the issuance date and maturity date for the Warrant. A significant increase in the volatility of the market price of the\nCompany’s common stock, in isolation, would result in a significantly higher fair value; and a significant decrease in volatility would result in a significantly lower fair\nvalue.\nA change in assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the warrant could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. Refer to Note 7,D ebt ,and Note\n10, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements regarding the warrant.\nFair Value of Convertible Notes\nNature of Estimates Required: As permitted under ASC 825, Financial Instruments, (“ASC 825”), we elected the fair value option to account for our convertible notes. We\nrecord changes in fair value of the convertible notes in Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations, and changes in fair value of the convertible notes\nattributable to credit risk in Other comprehensive loss. The primary reason for electing the fair value option is for simplification and cost-benefit considerations of accounting for\nthe convertible notes (the hybrid financial instrument) at fair value in its entirety versus bifurcation of the embedded derivatives.\nAssumptions and Approach Used: The fair value is determined using a binomial lattice valuation model, which is widely used for valuing convertible notes. The significant\nassumptions used in the model are as follows:\n• Volatility: The volatility used in the binomial lattice valuation model was estimated based on historical prices for the Company’s common stock with a look-back period\nof one year. A significant increase in the volatility of the market price of the Company’s common stock, in isolation, would result in a significantly higher fair value; and\na significant decrease in volatility would result in a significantly lower fair value.\n32\n• Credit spread: The credit spread used in the binomial lattice model was estimated based on a synthetic credit rating assessed for the Company in the valuation as of the\nissuance date. Generally, as the credit spread increases, the fair value decreases, and conversely, as the credit spread decreases, the fair value of the convertible notes\nincreases.\nA change in assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the convertible notes could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. Refer to Note 7D, ebt,\nand Note 10, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the convertible notes.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nAsset groups are tested at the level of the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or\ngroups of assets. Asset groupings for impairment analysis are reevaluated when events occur, such as changes in organizational structure and management reporting.\nNature of Estimates Required: We test our long-lived asset groups when changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. Events that trigger a test\nfor recoverability include material adverse changes in projected revenues or expenses, present cash flow losses combined with a history of cash flow losses and a forecast that\ndemonstrates significant continuing losses, significant negative industry or economic trends (including a substantial shift in consumer preference), a current expectation that a\nlong-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life, a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used or in its\nphysical condition, or when there is a change in the asset grouping. In addition, investing in new, emerging products or services may require substantial upfront investment,\nwhich may result in initial forecasted negative cash flows in the near term. In these instances, near-term negative cash flows on their own may not be indicative of a triggering\nevent for evaluation of impairment. In such circumstances, we also conduct a qualitative evaluation of the business growth trajectory, which includes updating our assessment of\nwhen positive cash flows are expected to be generated, confirming whether established milestones are being achieved, and assessing our ability and intent to continue to access\nrequired funding to execute the plan. If this evaluation indicates a triggering event has occurred, a test for recoverability is performed.\nWhen a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed, comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group. If the\nundiscounted forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the asset group’s fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow method. To\nthe extent available, we will also consider third-party valuations of our long-lived assets that were prepared for other business purposes. An impairment charge is recognized for\nthe amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used, the adjusted\ncarrying amounts of those assets are depreciated over their remaining useful life.\nAssumptions and Approach Used: The fair value of an asset group is determined from the perspective of a market-participant considering, among other things, appropriate\ndiscount rates, valuation techniques, the most advantageous market, and assumptions about the highest and best use of the asset group.\nWe measure the fair value of an asset group based on market prices (i.e., the amount for which the asset could be sold to a third party) when available. When market prices are\nnot available, we generally estimate the fair value of the asset group using the income approach and/or the market approach. The income approach uses cash flow projections.\nInherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plan forecasts, expected growth\nrates, and cost of capital, similar to those a market participant would use to assess fair value. We also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions and other data.\nMany of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods.\nChanges in assumptions or estimates can materially affect the fair value measurement of an asset group and, therefore, can affect the test results. The following are key\nassumptions we use in making cash flow projections:\n• Business projections: We make assumptions about the demand for our products in the marketplace. These assumptions drive our planning assumptions for volume, mix,\nand pricing.\n(cid:0)(cid:1) Long-term growth rate: A growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business and is added to the present value of the debt-free interim cash flows. The\ngrowth rate is the expected rate at which an asset group’s earnings stream is projected to grow beyond the planning period.\n33\n(cid:0)(cid:1) Discount rate: When measuring possible impairment, future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted-average cost of capital that we\nanticipate a potential market participant would use. Weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall risk-adjusted pre-tax rate of return expected by equity\nand debt holders of a business enterprise.\n(cid:0)(cid:1) Economic projections: Assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding industry sales and pricing estimates for\nour vehicles. These macroeconomic assumptions include, but are not limited to, industry sales volumes, inflation, interest rates, and prices of raw materials (e.g.,\ncommodities).\nDuring 2023, we identified triggering events related to certain asset groups. In each situation in which we experienced a triggering event during the year, we tested our long-\nlived assets for impairment using our internal economic and business projections, and determined that the carrying values of the long-lived assets were recoverable. If, in future\nquarters, our economic or business projections were to change as a result of an update to our plans, a deterioration of the economic or business environment, a significant\nadverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, or an expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end\nof its useful life, we would undertake additional testing, as appropriate, which could result in an impairment of long-lived assets.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 12, Recent Pronouncements, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly\nincreasing risk. Some of the securities in which we invest may have market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value amount of the\ninvestment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then-prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the\nmarket value amount of our investment will decline. To minimize this risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in a variety of securities,\nincluding money market funds and government and non-government debt securities and the maturities of each of these instruments is less than one year. In 2023, we maintained\nan investment portfolio primarily in money market funds. Due to the primarily short-term nature and low interest rate yields of these investments, we believe we do not have a\nmaterial exposure to interest rate risk and market risk arising from our investments. Therefore, no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided.\nWe transact business primarily in the United States. Accordingly, we have not had any significant exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations.\nFor further information about our equity investments, please refer to Note 5,C ontract Manufacturing Services and Investment in Tropos, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n34\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID Number 248) F-2\nConsolidated Financial Statements:\nConsolidated Balance Sheets F-4\nConsolidated Statements of Operations F-5\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss F-6\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity F-7\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows F-8\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements F-9\nF-1\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Shareholders\nWorkhorse Group Inc.\nOpinion on the financial statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Workhorse Group Inc. (a Nevada corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December\n31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31,\n2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the\nCompany incurred a net loss of $123.9 million and used $123.0 million of cash in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2023, and as of that date, the\nCompany had total working capital of $40.5 million, including $25.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, and an accumulated deficit of $751.6 million. These conditions,\nalong with the other matters as set forth in Note 1, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these\nmatters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical audit matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are\nnot, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nInventory Reserve\nAs described further in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, adjustments are made to inventory for any excess or obsolete inventories or when the net realizable value\nof inventories is less than the carrying value. The Company reviews inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale\nof the inventory. This requires the Company to determine the estimated selling price of inventory based on planned usage and market conditions. We identified the inventory\nreserve as a critical audit matter.\nF-2\nThe principal considerations for our determination that the inventory reserve represents a critical audit matter is that the assessment of the valuation of inventory is complex and\nincludes estimates of business and economic forecasts. The estimates are subjective and require the Company to consider significant assumptions such as market demand for\ntheir vehicles, planning assumptions for volume, mix and pricing, and how economic conditions might affect the ability to meet those sales projections, all of which are subject\nto significant uncertainty and therefore, require significant auditor judgment.\nOur audit procedures related to the inventory reserve included the following, among others:\n• We obtained management’s inventory reserve analysis, tested its mathematical accuracy, and tested the completeness and accuracy of the relevant data used in the\nanalysis.\n• We evaluated the appropriateness of management’s sales forecast, considering both positive and negative factors, including historical trends, as it relates to those sales\nprojections.\n• We obtained relevant industry outlook data and evaluated whether management’s analysis appropriately considered the relevant data.\n• We evaluated the sensitivity of excess and obsolete inventory reserve percentages applied to defined categories of on-hand raw materials and evaluated consistency and\nappropriateness of reserve percentages applied along with other inputs and assumptions used throughout the analysis.\n• We evaluated the appropriateness of the estimated selling prices of finished goods and ensured those selling prices, less costs to sell, exceeded the cost of on-hand\ninventory.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2018.\nCincinnati, Ohio\nMarch 12, 2024\nF-3\nWorkhorse Group

OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\nOverview\nWorkhorse Group Inc. (“Workhorse”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is an American technology company with a vision to pioneer the transition to zero-emission\ncommercial vehicles. We design, develop, manufacture and sell fully electric ground and air-based electric vehicles.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Workhorse Group Inc. and its subsidiaries, with all intercompany transactions and balances having been\neliminated. The Company prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the rules and\nregulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and, in the Company's opinion, reflect all adjustments, including normal recurring items that\nare necessary.\nGoing Concern and Liquidity\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applicable to a going concern. The going concern basis of presentation\nassumes that the Company will continue in operation one year after the date these consolidated financial statements are issued and will be able to realize assets and discharge its\nliabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classification of\nassets, liabilities, and reported expenses that may be necessary if the Company were unable to continue as a going concern.\nPursuant to the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standard Board's (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial\nStatements - Going Concern (“ASC 205-40”), management must evaluate whether there are conditions and events, considered in aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about\nthe Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date these consolidated financial statements are issued. In accordance with ASC 205-40,\nmanagement’s analysis can only include the potential mitigating impact of management’s plans that have not been fully implemented as of the issuance date if (a) it is probable\nthat management’s plans will be effectively implemented on a timely basis, and (b) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will alleviate the relevant conditions or\nevents that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe had sales of $13.1 million, incurred a net loss of $123.9 million and used $123.0 million of cash in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2023. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company had total working capital of $40.5 million, including $25.8 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and an accumulated deficit of\n$751.6 million.\nAs a result of our recurring losses from operations, accumulated deficit, projected capital needs, and delays in bringing our vehicles to market and lower than expected market\ndemand, substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance date of the accompanying consolidated financial\nstatements. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of management’s intended plan over the next twelve months to improve the\nCompany’s liquidity and working capital, which includes, but is not limited to:\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nGenerating revenue by increasing sales of our vehicles and other services.\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nReducing expenses and limiting non-contracted capital expenditures.\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nRaising capital to fund operations through the issuance of debt or equity securities, including through our At-the-Market Sales Agreement (“ATM Agreement”), the sale\nof assets, or other strategic transactions.\nIt is essential that we have access to capital as we bring our existing line of vehicles to market, scale up production and sales of such vehicles and continue to develop our next\ngeneration of vehicles. There is no assurance that we will be successful in implementing management’s plans to generate liquidity to fund these activities or other aspects of our\nshort and long-term strategy, that our projections of our future capital needs will prove accurate or that any additional funding would be available or sufficient to continue\noperations in future periods.\nF-9\nTo the extent revenues from operations are insufficient to meet our liquidity requirements, our ability to continue as a going concern will be dependent on effectively raising\ncapital through private or public placement of our equity securities, including the continued use of the ATM Agreement (as further described below), for which there can be no\nassurance we will be successful in such efforts. We will also rely on debt financing or other sources of capital funding such as through the sale of assets to obtain sufficient\nfinancial resources to fund our operating activities. If we are unable to maintain sufficient financial resources, our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well\nas our ability to continue to develop, produce and market our new vehicle programs and satisfy our obligations as they become due, will be materially and adversely affected.\nThis could affect future vehicle program production and sales. Failure to obtain additional financing will have a material, adverse impact on our business operations. There can\nbe no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing needed to achieve our goals on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, any equity or equity linked financings would\nlikely have a dilutive effect on the holdings of our existing stockholders. The Company’s current level of cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to execute our business\nplan. For the foreseeable future, we will incur significant operating expenses, capital expenditures and working capital funding that will deplete our cash on hand. These\nconditions raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nOur ability to obtain additional financing is extremely limited under current market conditions including the significant amount of capital required, the Nasdaq Listing\nRequirements, the market price of our stock and potential dilution from the issuance of any additional securities. If we are unable to identify other sources of funding, we may\nneed to further adjust our operations and seek protection by filing a voluntary petition for relief under the Bankruptcy Code. If this were to occur, the value available to our\nvarious stakeholders, including our creditors and stockholders, is uncertain and trading prices for our securities may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any,\nby holders of our securities in bankruptcy proceedings, if any.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\nrevenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. The estimates used for, but not limited to, sales return reserves, income taxes, the collectability\nof accounts receivable, inventory valuation, warranties, leases, fair value of long-lived assets and fair value of financial instruments.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly-liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nRestricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents subject to contractual restrictions and not readily available are classified as restricted cash. Our restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash held to\nservice certain payments under secured debt facilities. In addition, restricted cash includes cash held as collateral for real estate leases. We record restricted cash in the\nconsolidated balance sheets and determine current or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction.\nOur total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows, was as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nCash and cash equivalents $ 25,845,915 $ 99,276,301\nRestricted cash 10,000,000 —\nTotal as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows $ 35,845,915 $ 99,276,301\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and services. We evaluate the collectability of\nreceivables each reporting period and record an allowance for credit losses to\nF-10\npresent the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in selling, general and administrative\nexpense.\nConcentration of Risk\nCredit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and accounts receivable. Our cash balances\nare primarily on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions or invested in money market funds. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of December\n31, 2023, no entity represented 10% or more of our total receivables balance. As of December 31, 2022, one entity represented 10% or more of our total receivables balance.\nSupply Risk\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at\nprices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventory cost includes cost of raw material, labor and overhead. Manufactured inventories are valued at\nstandard cost, which approximates actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based on assumptions about\ncurrent and future demand forecasts. If inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the\nestimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis\nfor that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\nShould our estimates of future inventory usage or selling prices change, additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required. A small change in our\nestimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nProperty, plant and equipment, net, including leasehold improvements, are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally computed using the\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:\nBuildings and improvements 15 - 39 years\nLand improvements 15 years\nEquipment and vehicles 3 - 7 years\nTooling 5 years\nComputer equipment and software 3 - 5 years\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related leases.\nUpon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheets, and the\nresulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statements of operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred while major improvements that\nincrease the functionality, output or expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified useful life.\nF-11\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an\nasset or asset group may not be fully recoverable. Events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in projected revenues and expenses, present cash\nflow losses combined with a history of cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates significant continuing losses, significant negative industry or economic trends, a current\nexpectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life, a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is\nused or in its physical condition, or when there is a change in the asset grouping. When an indicator of impairment is present, the Company assesses the risk of impairment\nbased on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist against the carrying value of the asset group. Impairment exists\nwhen the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by those assets. The Company records an impairment charge for the\ndifference between the carrying value of the asset group and its estimated fair market value. Depending on the asset, estimated fair market value may be determined either by\nuse of a discounted cash flow model or by reference to estimated selling values of assets in similar condition.\nDuring 2023, we identified triggering events related to certain asset groups. In each situation in which we experienced a triggering event during the year, we tested our long-\nlived assets for impairment using our internal economic and business projections, and determined that the carrying values of the long-lived assets were recoverable. If, in future\nquarters, our economic or business projections were to change as a result of an update to our plans, a deterioration of the economic or business environment, a significant\nadverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, or an expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end\nof its useful life, we would undertake additional testing, as appropriate, which could result in an impairment of long-lived assets. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, we have recognized no impairments of long-lived assets.\nCapitalization of Software Costs\nWe capitalize costs incurred in the development of internal use software, during the application development stage to property, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated\nbalance sheets. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over\ntheir estimated useful life of three to five years.\nWe evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis, and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the\nrecoverability of these assets. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we have recognized no impairments of capitalized software costs.\nInvestment\nAs permitted under ASC 321, Equity Securities, we recorded our investment in Tropos, an equity investment without a readily determinable fair value, at cost minus\nimpairment. We assessed our investment for impairment each reporting period to determine if the fair value of the investment declined below its cost basis and if the impairment\nwas other-than-temporary.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we have recognized impairment losses of $10.0 million and zero, respectively. For additional information regarding the\ninvestment and related impairment, see to Note 5, Contract Manufacturing Services and Investment in Tropos.\nWarranty Liability\nWe generally provide a manufacturer's warranty on all new vehicles we sell. We record a warranty liability for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the\nprojected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. The amount of warranty liability accrued reflects management’s best estimate of the nature,\nfrequency, and costs of future claims. Historically, the cost of fulfilling the warranty obligations has principally involved replacement parts, towing and transportation costs,\nlabor and sometimes travel for any field retrofit campaigns. Our estimates are based on historical experience, the extent of pre-production testing, the number of units involved\nand the extent of features/components included in product models.\nF-12\nAlthough we believe the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in our warranty\nliability accrual that could be material. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nBalance, beginning of year $ 2,207,674 $ 4,583,916\nAccrual for warranty(1) 766,112 (987,701)\nWarranty costs incurred (1,071,139) (1,388,541)\nBalance, end of year $ 1,902,647 $ 2,207,674\n(1)The decrease to the warranty liability accrual in 2022 primary relates to a decreased volume of vehicles covered under warranty as well as a lower liability per vehicle as\ncompared to 2021.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company follows the accounting guidance in ASC Topic 820 for its fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. A\nthree-level valuation hierarchy, based upon observable and unobservable inputs, is used for fair value measurements. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from\nindependent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions based on the best evidence available. These two types of inputs create the following fair value\nhierarchy: Level 1 – Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or\nsimilar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are observable; and Level 3 – Instruments whose significant inputs are\nunobservable.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under a method that requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary\ndifferences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. Authoritative guidance also requires deferred income tax assets, which include state tax credit\ncarryforwards, operating loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences, be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of\nthe deferred income tax assets will not be realized.\nWe evaluate the likelihood of realizing our deferred income tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The\nfactors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income, the projected reversal of temporary differences and available tax planning\nstrategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred income tax assets.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities. The\ndetermination is based on the technical merits of the position and presumes that each uncertain tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full\nknowledge of all relevant information. Although management believes the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not\nbe different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue by major source:\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nVehicles $ 11,327,702 $ 4,385,975\nServices, parts and accessories 1,767,050 637,097\nTotal revenues $ 13,094,752 $ 5,023,072\nF-13\nVehicles\nRevenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied; generally this occurs when we transfer control of our vehicles. Revenue is\nmeasured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. For the majority of vehicles, we transfer control and\nrecognize a sale when we ship the product from our manufacturing facility to our customer (dealers and distributors). The amount of consideration we receive and revenue we\nrecognize varies with changes in incentives and return rights we offer to our customers. When we give our dealers the right to return eligible vehicles, we estimate the expected\nreturns based on an analysis of historical experience, current market conditions, and other measures. We receive cash equal to the invoice price for most vehicle sales and we do\nnot have any material significant payment terms as payment is received at or shortly after the point of sale.\nSales and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. The expected costs associated with our base warranties and field\nservice actions are recognized as expense when the products are sold (see Note 6, Accrued Liabilities and Other Current Liabilities). We have elected to recognize the cost for\nfreight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts, or accessories has transferred to the customer as an expense in Cost of sales.\nServices, Parts and Accessories\nServices, parts and accessories revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts, and assembly services. It also includes revenue generated\nfrom operating our Stables by Workhorse route, Drones As A Service, and other service revenue. We recognize revenue related to sales of service, parts and other accessories\nwhen we transfer control of the items. For the majority of vehicles, parts, and accessories, we transfer control and recognize a sale when we ship the product from our\nmanufacturing facility to our customer (dealers and distributors). We recognize service revenue upon the transfer of control to the customer, which is generally when at the time\nthe service is completed.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, two entities represented1 0% or more of our total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2022, one entity represented1 0% or more\nof our total revenues.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue related to our Assembly Services Agreement with Tropos Technologies, Inc. consisted of the following:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nDeferred revenue, beginning of period $ 5,380,000 $ —\nAdditions — 5,380,000\nNet changes in liability (485,669) —\nRevenue recognized (180,000) —\nDeferred revenue, end of period $ 4,714,331 $ 5,380,000\nLess: current portion 4,714,331 3,375,000\nLong-term deferred revenue, end of period $ — $ 2,005,000\nSee Note 5, Contract Manufacturing Services and Investment in Tropos, for further discussion of deferred revenue.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales include direct and indirect materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, shipping and logistics costs, and\nreserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of sales also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value\nand to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research, prototyping expense, contract and professional services, and\namortized equipment expense. R&D costs are expensed as incurred. R&D costs for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $24.5 million and $23.2 million,\nrespectively.\nF-14\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are recorded in Selling, general, and administrative in the consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred .During the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022, advertising costs recognized were $1.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) is comprised of adjustments to the fair value of our convertible notes due to changes in credit risk.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options, restricted stock awards (“RSA”) and performance share units (“PSUs”) granted to employees. The fair value\nof stock option awards with only service conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing\nmodel requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair\nvalue of RSAs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an\nemployee is required to provide services in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of\nactual forfeitures in the period.\nThe fair value of market-vested awards is based on a Monte-Carlo simulation that estimates the fair value based on the Company's stock price activity relative to a defined\ncomparative group of companies, expected term of the award, risk-free interest rate, expected dividends, and the expected volatility of the stock of the Company and those in the\ncomparative group. The grant date fair value per share of market-vested awards already reflects the probability of achieving the market condition, and is therefore used to record\nthe expense on a straight-line basis over the performance period regardless of actual achievement.\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognizable over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones\nwhen the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\nAs we issue additional employee stock-based awards over time and as we incorporate additional market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly\ndifferent volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will\nrecognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nDefined Contribution Plan\nWe have a 401(k) savings plan that is intended to qualify as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Beginning in January 2021, we\nbegan to match 100% of each employee’s contributions up to a maximum of 6% of the employee’s eligible compensation, vested immediately. During the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $1.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively, of expenses related to employer contributions for the 401(k) savings plan.\nNet Loss per Share of Common Stock\nBasic loss per share of common stock is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive shares,\nwhich are based on the weighted-average shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock\nmethod or the if-converted method, as applicable, are included when calculating the diluted net loss per share of common stock when their effect is dilutive.\nF-15\nThe following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share of common stock, because their effect was\nanti-dilutive:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nStock-based awards and equity-classified warrants 9,497,133 6,159,285\nConvertible notes 38,624,952 —\nWarrants1 8,500,000 —\n1Represents shares issued upon exchange of the warrants on March 1, 2024. See Note 7,D ebt, and Note 16, Subsequent Events, for more information regarding the warrants.\n2. INVENTORY\nOur inventory consisted of the following:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nRaw materials $ 32,682,324 $ 42,500,878\nWork in process 2,892,329 25,210,131\nFinished goods(1) 18,309,829 301,645\n53,884,482 68,012,654\nLess: inventory reserves (8,476,290) (59,162,512)\nInventory, net $ 45,408,192 $ 8,850,142\n(1) Finished goods inventory includes new vehicles available for sale.\nWe reserve inventory for any excess or obsolete inventories or when we believe the net realizable value of inventories is less than the carrying value. During the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded net write-downs of $6.8 million and $19.5 million, respectively, in Cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The\nyear over year decrease to inventory reserves was primarily driven by our efforts to sell and dispose of C-Series inventory which had been fully reserved as of December 31,\n2022 following the Company's decision to discontinue the program. The sale and disposal activity did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations during\nthe year ended December 31, 2023.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a gain of $13.6 million, net of $0.5 million of selling costs, related to the sale of C-Series inventory. The gain on sale\nwas recorded in Other (loss) income in the consolidated statements of operations. The selling costs of $0.5 million represent a commission paid to a related party who was a\nformer executive of the Company.\n3. PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets consisted of the following:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nPrepaid purchases $ 7,908,087 $ 34,611,649\nLess: prepaid purchases reserve (1,999,068) (22,163,338)\nPrepaid purchases, net 5,909,019 12,448,311\nPrepaid insurance 1,283,146 1,198,769\nOther 908,997 505,401\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets $ 8,101,162 $ 14,152,481\nF-16\nPrepaid purchases consist of deposits made to our suppliers for non-recurring engineering costs and production parts. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, net prepaid purchases\nprimarily consisted of deposits for direct materials associated with our W4 CC and W750 vehicles.\nThe year over year decrease to prepaid purchases reserves was primarily driven by write-offs related to the C-Series vehicle program, which did not have a material impact on\nthe Company's results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n4. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET\nProperty, plant and equipment, net consists of the following:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nLand and improvements $ 2,130,542 $ 875,182\nBuildings and improvements 12,677,544 8,167,736\nEquipment and vehicles 23,081,818 8,183,089\nTooling 8,044,563 689,286\nConstruction in progress 1,104,010 9,027,020\n47,038,477 26,942,313\nLess: accumulated depreciation (9,161,522) (5,441,218)\nProperty, plant and equipment, net $ 37,876,955 $ 21,501,095\nConstruction in progress is primarily comprised of equipment and tooling related to the manufacturing of our products, and construction and expansion of our facilities.\nCompleted assets are transferred to their respective asset classes, and depreciation begins when an asset is ready for its intended use.\nDepreciation expense during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $4.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively.\n5. CONTRACT MANUFACTURING SERVICES AND INVESTMENT IN TROPOS\nWe had a minority ownership investment in Tropos Technologies, Inc. (“Tropos”). The investment was obtained during the third quarter of 2022 in exchange for a cash payment\nof $5.0 million and a $5.0 million contribution of non-cash consideration representing a deposit from Tropos for future assembly services under an Assembly Services\nAgreement. The $5.0 million non-cash consideration was recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as revenue over time as assembly service performance obligations are\nsatisfied.\nWe recorded our investment at cost less impairment, if applicable. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 321, Investments - Equity Securities, we assessed our investment for\nimpairment at each reporting period to determine if the fair value declined below its cost basis and if the impairment is other-than-temporary.\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, we determined that our investment in Tropos was impaired based on the economic conditions and uncertainties that have significantly affected\nTropos' performance and financial position. The impairment is considered other-than-temporary as the decline in fair value of the investment is not expected to recover in the\nforeseeable future.\nThe impairment charge recognized for our investment is $10.0 million, which represents the difference between the original cost of the investment and its fair value as of the\nimpairment assessment date. The impairment loss was recognized in Other (loss) income in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe impairment of our investment did not release the Company from its obligation to perform assembly services under the agreement. Therefore, the Company continues to\nperform assembly services and carry the balance of deferred revenue on its consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, deferred revenue related to the Assembly Services Agreement was $4.7 million and $5.4 million, respectively.\nF-17\n6. ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES\nAccrued liabilities and other current liabilities consisted of the following:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nSecurities litigation settlement $ — $ 35,000,000\nCompensation and related costs 2,083,808 4,967,187\nOther 2,778,932 6,240,244\nAccrued liabilities and other current liabilities $ 4,862,740 $ 46,207,431\n7. DEBT\nA reconciliation of the fair value of the convertible notes is as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nFair value of convertible notes, beginning of year $ — $ 24,705,000\nFair value of convertible notes issued during year 13,695,789 —\nChange in fair value of convertible notes (1) 6,484,311 367,357\nFair value of convertible notes exchanged for common stock — (25,072,357)\nFair value of convertible notes, end of year $ 20,180,100 $ —\n(1) The Company recognizes changes in fair value of convertible notes for common stock inI nterest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nGreen Senior Convertible Notes Due 2026\nOn December 12, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) under which the Company issued, pursuant to an\nindenture and supplemental indenture (the “Indenture”), $20.0 million principal amount of green senior convertible notes (the “2026 Notes”) due October 1, 2026. The 2026\nNotes are a senior secured obligation of the Company and ranked senior to all unsecured debt of the Company. The 2026 Notes are guaranteed by all the Company’s current\nsubsidiaries and are secured by substantially all the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. The 2026 Notes were issued with an original issue discount of 12.5%. In the\nevent of a default under the Indenture, the 2026 Notes would accrue default interest at a rate of 15.0% per annum (the “Default Interest”) until such default is cured and all\noutstanding Default Interest has been paid. The 2026 Notes do not bear interest other than the Default Interest. The 2026 notes are convertible into 38.6 million shares of\ncommon stock at a rate of $0.5178 per share, subject to change for anti-dilution adjustments and adjustments for certain corporate events.\nThe Company paid fees in connection with the issuance of the 2026 Notes of $0.6 million, resulting in net proceeds of $16.9 million. We have elected to account for the 2026\nNotes using the fair value option under GAAP. All direct costs related to the issuance of our convertible notes were recognized in Interest expense in the consolidated statements\nof operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe 2026 Notes contain certain covenants, including limitations on liens, additional indebtedness, investments, dividends and other restricted payments, changes in the\nbusiness, transactions with affiliates, and customary events of default. The Company is also required to at all times maintain minimum liquidity of the lesser of $10.0 million\nand the then aggregate outstanding principal amount under the 2026 Notes in a deposit account under the control of the collateral agent. In addition, the 2026 Notes requires\nthat the Company have cash and cash equivalents of at least $25.0 million on December 31, 2023, $13.5 million on January 31, 2024, and of $20.0 million on February 29,\n2024. In the event we consummate a sale and leaseback transaction with respect to the real property where our Union City, IN plant is located, the holder of the 2026 Notes may,\nat its option, require us to use up to half of the proceeds we receive in such a sale leaseback transaction to redeem outstanding principal under the 2026 Notes. For additional\ninformation regarding the sale of our Union City plant, refer to Note 16, Subsequent Events, to our consolidated financial statements.\nF-18\nAs of December 31, 2023, the contractual principal balance of the 2026 Notes was $20.0 million and the fair value was $20.2 million. During the year ended December 31,\n2023, we recorded a $6.5 million fair value adjustment in Interest expense in the statements of operations related to the 2026 Notes. No fair value adjustments related to the 2026\nNotes attributable to changes in credit risk were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2023. Going forward, any future fair value adjustments attributable to changes in\ncredit risk will be recorded in Other comprehensive loss.\nThe estimated fair value of the 2026 Notes upon issuance on December 12, 2023 was $13.7 million. The fair value was computed using a Binomial Lattice Model which\nincorporates significant inputs that are not observable in the market, and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. The unobservable inputs utilized for measuring the fair value of\nthe 2026 Notes reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the Note as of the issuance date and subsequent reporting period.\nWe determined the fair value by using the following key inputs to the Binomial Lattice Model:\nIssuance Date December 12, 2023\nMaturity Date October 1, 2026\nPrincipal Balance as of the Valuation Date $ 20,000,000\nRisk-Free Rate (Annual) 5.3 %\nImplied Yield 10.45 %\nVolatility (Annual) 80.00 %\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company is in compliance with the debt terms and associated covenant under the 2026 Notes. The holder may, at its option, require the Company\nto redeem up to 12.5% of the original principal amount of the 2026 Notes in cash on the first and fifteenth of each month beginning January 1, 2024. Subsequent to December\n31, 2023, the Company has repaid $7.5 million of the initial principal balance upon request of the holder. On February 29, 2024, the Company entered into a First Amendment\nto Green Senior Secured Convertible Note Due 2026 (the “2026 Notes Amendment”) with the holder. In connection with the 2026 Notes Amendment, the Company redeemed\n$10.0 million principal amount of the 2026 Notes, thereby reducing the outstanding principal amount of the Note to $2.5 million. Therefore, given the Company has made\npartial redemption payments and expects the holder to require repayment of the 2026 Notes in full within 12 months, the Company classified the 2026 Notes as current in the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nWarrants Exercisable Prior to December 2026\nOn December 12, 2023, as part of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company issued warrants (the “2026 Warrants”) to purchase 25,601,639 shares of common stock at\nan exercise price of $0.4492 per share. The 2026 Warrants may be exercised by the holder immediately upon issuance and prior to December 12, 2026. No fractional shares will\nbe issued upon exercise of the 2026 Warrants. Upon a change of control or corporate event (as defined in the warrant agreement), the holder may request that the Company\nrepurchase the 2026 Warrants for cash in an amount equal to the Black Scholes Value (as defined in the warrant agreement). A Black Scholes Value settlement is meant to\ncompensate the holder of the warrant for lost time value related to a forced early exercise upon the contingent event. As the 2026 Warrants are recorded at fair value and\nmeasured pursuant to a Black Scholes option pricing model, the carrying value approximates the amount that the Company would have to pay in a Black Scholes Value\nsettlement.\nThe fair value of the components of the Securities Purchase Agreement was allocated between the 2026 Notes and 2026 Warrants. As of December 12, 2023 (the initial\nrecognition) and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the 2026 Warrants was $3.8 million and $5.6 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we\nrecorded a $1.8 million fair value adjustment in Interest expense in the statements of operations related to the 2026 Notes. The fair value of the 2026 Warrants was measured\nusing the Black Scholes model approach. Significant inputs to the model at December 12, 2023 and December 31, 2023 are as follows:\nF-19\nInitial Recognition on\nValuation Assumptions December 31, 2023 December 12, 2023\nStock Price $ 0.36 $ 0.37\nStrike Price $ 0.4492 $ 0.4492\nVolatility (annual) 98.0 % 98.0 %\nRisk-Free Rate 5.3 % 5.3 %\nEstimated time to expiration (years) 3 3\nDividend Yield 0.0 % 0.0 %\n4.0% Senior Secured Convertible Notes Due 2024\nOn October 14, 2020 the Company issued $200.0 million par value convertible notes (the “2024 Notes”) due October 14, 2024. The 2024 Notes were a senior secured\nobligation of the Company, and ranked senior to all unsecured debt of the Company. The 2024 Notes were guaranteed by all the Company’s current and future subsidiaries and\nwere secured by substantially all the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. Interest was payable quarterly beginning on January 15, 2021 at a rate of 4.0% per annum. The\n2024 Notes were convertible at a rate of $35.29 per share, subject to change for anti-dilution adjustments and adjustments for certain corporate events.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company entered into securities exchange agreements with certain holders of its 2024 Notes, to exchange $172.5 million in principal amount\nof the notes for 27.7 million shares of common stock. In the second quarter of 2022, the remaining $27.5 million in aggregate principal of the 2024 Notes was exchanged for\n7.8 million shares of common stock. The number of shares issued was calculated by dividing $29.4 million, which represents 107% of the principal amount of the notes, plus\n$0.3 million of interest accrued on the notes, by the average of the daily volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) for the1 0 days immediately preceding April 21, 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized a loss of $1.8 million, which included a $0.4 million fair value adjustment and a $1.4 million adjustment\nrelated to the amount previously recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. The total loss was recorded in Interest expense in the consolidated statements of\noperations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, cash paid for contractual interest on the 2024 Notes was $0.3 million.\nAfter the exchanges described above, the indenture and related security agreement under which the 2024 Notes were issued were terminated.\nFloorplan Line of Credit\nOn August 10, 2023, we entered into a Floorplan and Security Agreement (the “Floorplan LOC”) with Mitsubishi HC Capital America, Inc. under which we obtained a\nrevolving floorplan line of credit with a maximum borrowing limit of $5.0 million.\nThe intended use of the Floorplan LOC was to finance the acquisition of inventory used in production of our W4 CC and W750 vehicles. The terms of the Floorplan LOC\nincluded interest charged on the outstanding borrowings and other fees and covenants. Interest was to be charged at a variable rate based on a reference interest rate, such as the\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), plus 4.86%.\nIn connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement described above, we terminated the Floorplan and Security Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we\ndid not draw on or incur any charges related to the Floorplan LOC.\n8. LEASES\nWe have entered into various operating and finance lease agreements for offices, manufacturing and warehouse facilities. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains\na lease, at inception and record the leases in our financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for our use by the\nlessor.\nWe have elected not to disclose in the consolidated balance sheets leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at lease inception that do not contain a purchase option or\nrenewal term provision we are reasonably certain to exercise. All other lease right-of-use assets (“ROU”) and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease\npayments over the lease term at commencement date. Because most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, we used our incremental\nF-20\nborrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\nOur leases may include options to extend the lease term for up to5 years. Some of our leases also include options to terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease\nterm. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, we entered into a lease agreement for additional office and warehouse space. We obtained a Letter of Credit (“LOC”) in the amount of\n$0.5 million to secure the lease, which bears interest at five percent per annum. Under the terms of the agreement, the landlord may use the whole or any part of the LOC for the\npayment of any amount as to which we are in default or to compensate the landlord for certain specified losses or damage.\nThe Company assesses the carrying value of its ROU assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may\nnot be recoverable. Such indicators may include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, changes in the\nbusiness climate or legal factors, and changes in the expected use of the leased asset. The assessment of whether a ROU asset is impaired involves management's judgment,\nincluding considerations of future cash flows, market conditions, and other relevant factors.\nIf impairment indicators are identified, the Company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the leased asset. These estimates\nconsider factors such as anticipated future operating results, market conditions, and other relevant factors. If the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying\namount of the ROU asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the ROU asset. The fair value is determined\nbased on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis, market comparable transactions, and other appropriate methods.\nImpairment losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company determines the level at which the impairment loss is recognized based on whether\nit expects to retain or dispose of the ROU asset. If the Company expects to retain the ROU asset, the impairment loss is recognized as an adjustment to the carrying amount of\nthe ROU asset, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated depreciation and amortization. If the Company expects to dispose of the ROU asset, the impairment loss is\nrecognized in Selling, general and administrative expense in the statements of operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company identified indicators of impairment due to slower than expected market adoption and conducted an impairment test on\nits ROU assets in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The fair value less costs to sublease was determined based on market prices for similar assets, while the\nvalue in use was calculated using discounted cash flow projections. As a result of these assessments, we recognized an impairment loss of $0.9 million related to the ROU asset\nfor our Aero facility located in Mason, Ohio, which is recorded in the Selling, general and administrative expense in the statements of operations.\nLease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as cost of sales or operating expenses depending on the nature of the lease right-of-\nuse asset. Amortization of finance lease assets is recognized over the lease term as cost of sales or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset. Interest\nexpense on finance lease liabilities is recognized over the lease term within Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe components of lease expense are as follows within our consolidated statements of operations:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nShort-term lease expense $ 281,802 $ 589,969\nOperating lease expense 2,338,266 1,782,332\nTotal lease expense $ 2,620,068 $ 2,372,301\nF-21\nLease right-of-use assets consisted of the following:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nOperating leases $ 4,174,800 $ 5,884,865\nFinance leases 5,621,181 5,821,938\nTotal lease right-of-use assets $ 9,795,981 $ 11,706,803\nLease liabilities consisted of the following:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nOperating leases $ 6,292,954 $ 6,977,896\nFinance leases 2,548,184 3,147,198\nTotal lease liabilities 8,841,138 10,125,094\nLess: current portion (3,560,612) (1,285,032)\nLong-term portion $ 5,280,526 $ 8,840,062\nOther information related to leases is as follows:\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nWeighted-average remaining lease term\nOperating leases 4.0 years 6.0 years\nFinancing leases 1.0 year 2.0 years\nWeighted-average interest rate\nOperating leases 10.0 % 10.0 %\nFinancing leases 10.0 % 10.0 %\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases where we are the lessee is as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash outflows from operating leases $ 1,349,021 $ 770,642\nOperating cash outflows from finance leases (interest payments) 280,430 369,976\nFinancing cash outflows from finance leases 879,444 857,516\nLeased assets obtained in exchange for finance lease liabilities — 6,022,694\nLeased assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities — 5,631,558\nF-22\nAs of December 31, 2023, the maturities of our operating and finance lease liabilities (excluding short-term leases) are as follows:\nOperating Finance\nLeases Leases\n2024 $ 1,589,805 $ 2,752,862\n2025 1,458,783 —\n2026 1,503,069 —\n2027 1,316,387 —\n2028 1,230,385 —\nThereafter 1,067,207 —\nTotal minimum lease payments 8,165,636 2,752,862\nLess: Interest 1,872,682 204,678\nPresent value of lease obligations 6,292,954 2,548,184\nLess: Current portion 1,012,428 2,548,184\nLong-term portion of lease obligations $ 5,280,526 $ —\n9. INCOME TAXES\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has taxable losses primarily due to operations and thus hasn o current federal tax expense recorded. We\ncontinue to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023.\nThe U.S. components of loss before income taxes and a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax with the provision for income taxes follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nCurrent:\nFederal $ — $ —\nState and Local (110,524) —\nTotal Current (110,524) —\nDeferred:\nFederal — —\nState and Local — —\nTotal Deferred — —\nTotal benefit from income taxes $ (110,524) $ —\nF-23\nThe reconciliation of taxes at the federal statutory rate to our provision for income taxes was as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nFederal tax benefit at statutory rates 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState and local tax at statutory rates 1.0 % — %\nFair value adjustments on convertible notes (1.4)% (0.3)%\nStock-based compensation deductions (1.0)% (1.7)%\nResearch and development credits (0.6)% 0.3 %\nOther permanent differences and credits (0.4)% (0.5)%\nOther temporary deferred tax asset differences 0.6 % — %\nFederal net operating loss adjustment (0.3)% — %\nChange in valuation allowance (18.8)% (18.8)%\nTotal tax benefit 0.1 % — %\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts\nused for income tax purposes. When realization of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not to occur, the benefit related to the deductible temporary differences attributable\nto operations is recognized as a reduction of income tax expense. As of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect\nits view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our ability to realize our net deferred tax asset is not more likely than not to occur\nand the valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax asset to zero.\nSignificant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nDecember 31\n2023 2022\nDeferred Tax Assets (Liabilities):\nAccrued expenses and reserves $ 567,850 $ 4,528,418\nWarranty reserve 1,625,861 470,342\nInventory and prepaid purchase reserves 2,268,452 17,326,397\nInvestment impairment 2,165,513 —\nEquity compensation 1,538,179 (328,410)\nProperty, plant and equipment (5,060,439) (1,955,842)\nResearch and experimental costs 8,236,863 4,435,891\nCharitable contributions 13,427 —\nLease right-of-use assets (2,044,257) (2,515,792)\nLease liability 1,832,809 2,175,883\nIssuance fees on convertible notes — 343,886\nFederal tax credits 4,299,750 5,099,750\nNet operating loss 103,518,448 66,112,929\nTotal Deferred Tax Assets 118,962,456 95,693,452\nValuation Allowance (118,962,456) (95,693,452)\nTotal Deferred Tax Assets (Liabilities), net of valuation allowance $ — $ —\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an increase to the valuation allowance of $23.3 million as a component of income tax expense.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has $17.2 million of federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carry-forward deferred tax assets which expire through 2038.\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has approximately $84.3 million and $47.0 million, respectively, of federal NOL deferred tax assets which\ncarry-forward\nF-24\nindefinitely, and approximately $2.0 million and $0.9 million, respectively, of state and local NOL carry-forward deferred tax assets which expire through 2037. The NOL\ncarry-forwards may be limited in certain circumstances, including ownership changes.\nUnder the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue\nService and state tax authorities. Certain tax attributes are subject to an annual limitation as a result of certain cumulative changes in ownership interest of significant\nshareholders which could constitute a change of ownership as defined under Internal Revenue Code Section 382. The Company completed a full analysis of historical\nownership changes and determined that a portion of the NOLs to-date have a limitation on future deductibility. Approximately $8.4 million of NOLs incurred prior to 2014 will\nbe unable to offset future taxable income and have been reserved via a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the expected realizable amount.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits:\n2023 2022\nUnrecognized tax benefits - January 1 $ 805,392 $ 805,392\nGross increases - tax positions in prior period — —\nGross decreases - tax positions in prior period — —\nGross increases - tax positions in current period — —\nSettlement — —\nLapse of statute of limitations — —\nUnrecognized tax benefits - December 31 $ 805,392 $ 805,392\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, due to the Company’s continued\nlosses, no amounts of interest and penalties have been recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. If the unrecognized tax benefits were reversed, a deferred tax\nasset and corresponding valuation allowance would be recorded, and thus the reversal would have no impact on the effective rate.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions and local jurisdictions. Generally, the Company’s 2019 through 2022 tax years\nremain open and subject to examination by federal, state and local taxing authorities. However, federal, state, and local net operating losses from 2009 through 2022 are subject\nto review by taxing authorities in the year utilized.\n10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nWe estimate the fair value of the 2026 Notes and 2026 Warrants using commonly accepted valuation methodologies upon issuance and at each reporting date. Considerable\njudgment was required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the Company’s estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts\nthat the Company, or holders of the instruments, could realize in a current market exchange. Significant assumptions used in the fair value model included estimates of the\nredemption dates, credit spreads and the market price and volatility of the Company’s common stock. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could\nhave a material effect on the estimated fair values.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nIncentive Stock Plans\nWe maintain, as approved by the board of directors and the stockholders, the 2017 Incentive Stock Plan, the 2019 Incentive Stock Plan and the 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan\n(collectively, the “Plans”) providing for the issuance of stock-based awards to employees, officers, directors or consultants of the Company. Non-qualified stock options may\nonly be granted with an\nF-25\nexercise price equal to the market value of our common stock on the grant date. Shares reserved for stock awards under the plans total1 7.5 million. Total shares remaining\navailable for stock incentive grants under the Plans totaled approximately 3.0 million as of December 31, 2023. We have granted new stock options, restricted stock awards\n(“RSAs”), restricted stock units, and performance share units (“PSUs”) under the Plans.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nStock options $ 973,520 $ 978,696\nRestricted stock awards 9,138,800 7,767,114\nPerformance share units 3,309,815 2,714,401\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 13,422,135 $ 11,460,211\nStock Options\nDuring 2023, activity for stock options was as follows:\nWeighted\nWeighted Average\nAverage Remaining Contractual\nShares Exercise Price Life (Years)\nOutstanding, beginning of period 423,626 $ 7.6 6.7\nExercised (50,200) $ 1.1 —\nExpired (80,997) $ 1.7 —\nOutstanding, end of period 292,429 $ 10.3 8.0\nExercisable, end of period 197,618 $ 10.3 8.0\nAs of December 31, 2023, unrecognized compensation expense was $1.0 million for unvested options, which is expected to be recognized over the next year. During 2023, no\nnew stock options were granted.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nGranted restricted stock awards generally vest ratably over a three-year service period. The fair value of vested RSAs for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were\n$2.4 million and $2.7 million, respectively.\nDuring 2023, activity for RSAs was as follows:\nWeighted Average\nNumber of Unvested Grant Date Fair\nShares Value per Share\nUnvested restricted stock as of December 31, 2022 3,525,331 $ 4.9\nGranted 3,994,707 1.5\nVested (1,972,089) 4.2\nForfeited (419,426) 2.8\nUnvested restricted stock as of December 31, 2023 5,128,523 $ 2.6\nAs of December 31, 2023, unrecognized compensation expense was $9.2 million for unvested restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over the next1 .9 years.\nF-26\nPerformance Share Units\nAs of December 31, 2023, the number of unvested PSUs was3 .0 million. The vesting of PSUs is conditioned upon achievement of certain performance objectives over\nperformance periods ending December 31, 2024 and 2025 as defined in each award agreement. Fifty percent of the PSUs vest based upon the Company’s total shareholder\nreturn (“TSR”) as compared to a group of peer companies, and fifty percent of the PSUs vest based upon our performance on certain measures including a cumulative adjusted\nEBITDA target (“EBITDA PSUs”). Depending on the actual achievement of the performance objectives, the grantee may earn between 0% and 200% of the target PSUs.\nDuring 2023, activity for PSUs with a TSR metric was as follows:\nWeighted Average\nNumber of Unvested Grant Date Fair\nShares Value per Share\nBalance, December 31, 2022 738,751 $ 11.79\nGranted 966,342 1.88\nForfeited (33,417) 6.28\nBalance, December 31, 2023 1,671,676 $ 6.17\nInputs and assumptions used to calculate the fair value at grant date through a Monte-Carlo simulation were as follows:\n2023 2022\nFair value per stock award $ 1.88 $ 11.79\nGrant date stock price $ 1.09 $ 2.83\nAssumptions:\nWorkhorse's stock price expected volatility (a) 109 % 117 %\nRisk-free interest rate 3.77 % 0.69 %\n(a) Expected volatility based on 2.7 years of daily closing share price changes.\nAs of December 31, 2023, unrecognized compensation expense was $4.0 million, which is expected to be recognized over the next 1.3 years.\nDuring 2023, activity for EBITDA PSUs was as follows:\nNumber of Unvested\nShares\nBalance, December 31, 2022 432,546\nGranted 966,342\nForfeited (33,416)\nBalance, December 31, 2023 1,365,472\nThe fair value of performance share units is calculated based on the stock price on the date of grant. The stock-based compensation expense recognized each period is dependent\nupon our estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately vest based on the achievement of EBITDA-based performance conditions. Future stock-based compensation\nexpense for unvested EBITDA PSUs will be based on the fair value of the awards as of the grant date, which has not yet occurred, as the cumulative adjusted EBITDA target\ncondition is not yet defined.\nF-27\n12. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards\nASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial\ninstruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable supportable forecasts. We adopted this standard effective January 1,\n2023. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations.\nASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, which simplifies the\naccounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 470-20, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for convertible instruments.\nThe ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or\nthat do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no longer required to be separated from the host contract. The convertible\ndebt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost. This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instruments to\nbe typically closer to the coupon interest rate when applying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for\nconvertible debt instruments, the most significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for diluted EPS calculation, and no longer allowing the net\nshare settlement method. The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how an entity must determine whether a contract qualifies for a scope\nexception from derivative accounting. The amendments to Topic 815-40 change the scope of contracts that are recognized as assets or liabilities. We adopted this standard\neffective January 1, 2022. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations.\nAccounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted\nASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 related to disclosures about a public\nentity’s reportable segments and provides more detailed information about a reportable segment’s expenses. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with retrospective application required. We are assessing the effect on our annual consolidated\nfinancial statement disclosures; however, adoption will not impact our consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations.\nASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax\ndisclosures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with retrospective application permitted. We are assessing the effect on our\nannual consolidated financial statement disclosures; however, adoption will not impact our consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations.\nAll other ASUs issued but not yet adopted were assessed and determined to be not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements or financial statement disclosures.\n13. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nSecurities Litigation Settlement\nOn September 1, 2023, we issued 25.4 million shares of common stock with an aggregate value of $20.0 million in connection with the settlement of the Securities Litigation as\ndescribed below in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies. The number of shares was based on the market price per share of our common stock on August 31, 2023. This\ntransaction was recorded as a noncash operating activity.\nAs a result of the settlement, we no longer have any obligation related to the securities litigation and, as such, the $15.0 million insurance receivable previously recorded in\nOther Receivable and $35.0 million legal reserve previously recorded in Accrued and Other Current Liabilities were zero as of December 31, 2023.\nATM Sales Agreement\nOn March 10, 2022, we entered into an ATM Sales Agreement, under which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to\n$175.0 million.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we issued8 9.3 million and 4.9 million shares, respectively, under the ATM Agreement for net proceeds of $62.2 million\nand $12.9 million, respectively. Commissions paid in connection with the\nF-28\nissuances under the ATM Agreement are recorded as a reduction of the share proceeds. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred commissions of\n$1.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The remaining aggregate sales available under the ATM Agreement was $96.9 million as of December 31, 2023.\nEquity Line of Credit\nOn December 12, 2023, the Company entered into an equity line of credit purchase agreement (the “ELOC Purchase Agreement”) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (the\n“Purchaser”) which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, the Company may sell to the Purchaser up to $50.0 million of\nshares of common stock over the 24-month term of the ELOC Purchase Agreement. Concurrently with entering into the ELOC Purchase Agreement, the Company also entered\ninto a registration rights agreement (the “ELOC Registration Rights Agreement”) with the Purchaser, whereby the issuance of the shares pursuant to the ELOC Purchase\nAgreement were registered pursuant to the Company’s effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, and the related base prospectus included in the registration statement,\nas supplemented by a prospectus supplement filed on December 27, 2023.\nThe Company may direct the Purchaser, at its sole discretion, and subject to certain conditions, to purchase up to1 .0 million shares of common stock on any business day (a\n“Regular Purchase”). The amount of a Regular Purchase may be increased under certain circumstances to 1.25 million shares if the closing price is not below $0.40 and up to\n1.5 million if the closing price is not below $0.50 provided the Purchaser’s committed obligation under any single Regular Purchase shall not exceed $2.0 million. The purchase\nprice for Regular Purchases (the “Purchase Price”) shall be equal to 97.5% of the lower of the lowest sale price of common stock on the Purchase Date for such Regular\nPurchase and the arithmetic average of the three lowest closing sale prices for the common stock during the ten consecutive business days ending on the business day\nimmediately prior to the Purchase Date, with a floor of $0.10. In the event the Company issues the full amount allowed under a Regular Purchase on any given business day, we\nmay also direct the Purchaser to purchase additional amounts as accelerated purchases. The purchase price for the accelerated and additional accelerated purchases shall be equal\nto the lesser of 97.0% of such day’s the VWAP of the common stock on the principal market and the closing sale price of the common stock on such day.\nIn connection with the ELOC Purchase Agreement and ELOC Registration Rights Agreement, the Company paid a non-cash commitment fee to the Purchaser in the amount of\n3,775,105 shares of common stock of the Company (valued at $1.5 million). The Company reflected the commitment fee as an expense in Interest expense in the consolidated\nstatements of operations based on the fair value on the issuance date.\nUnder applicable rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market, the Company cannot issue or sell more than 19.99% of the shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to\nthe execution of the ELOC Purchase Agreement to the Purchaser under the ELOC Purchase Agreement without stockholder approval.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, excluding the additional commitment shares issued to the Purchaser disclosed above, the Company didn ot sell any shares of\ncommon stock pursuant to the ELOC Purchase Agreement. Subsequent to December 31, 2023 through the date of this filing, the Company sold 12.0 million shares of common\nstock at prices ranging between $0.2210 and $0.3430 pursuant to the ELOC Purchase Agreement and received proceeds of $3.1 million.\nThe Company evaluated the contract that includes the right to require the Purchaser to purchase shares of common stock in the future (“purchased put right”) considering the\nguidance in ASC 815-40, “Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts on an Entity’s Own Equity” (“ASC 815-40”) and concluded that it is an equity-linked contract that does not\nqualify for equity classification, and therefore requires fair value accounting as a derivative asset. The Company has analyzed the terms of the freestanding purchased put right\nand has concluded that it has insignificant value as of December 31, 2023.\nPreferred Stock\nWorkhorse has authorized 75.0 million shares of Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share. Our certificate of incorporation provides that shares of preferred stock\nmay be issued from time to time in one or more series. Our Board of Directors is authorized to fix the voting rights, if any, designations, powers, preferences, qualification,\nlimitations and restrictions thereof, applicable to the shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were no shares of Series A Preferred\nStock issued and outstanding.\nF-29\nCommon Stock\nThe Company has one class of common stock, par value $0.001 per share. Each share of our common stock is entitled too ne vote on all matters submitted to stockholders.\nOn September 1, 2023, we obtained approval from our stockholders to amendment our articles of incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock, par value\n$0.001 per share, authorized for issuance thereunder to 450.0 million.\nWarrants\nIn connection with the issuance of debt, common stock and preferred stock, we issued equity-classified warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. As of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, there were approximately 1.0 million warrants outstanding.\nSuccess Fees\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we issued3 44,997 and 244,035 shares of common stock, respectively, for payment of professional service fees, valued at\n$0.4 million and $0.6 million, respectively.\n14. RELATED PARTIES\nWe obtain our general liability, property and casualty, and directors and officers liability insurance through AssuredPartners NL, LLC (“Assured”). Gerald Budde, a former\nDirector of the Company, is currently the Chief Financial Officer of Accretive Insurance Solutions Inc. (“Accretive”). Assured and Accretive are both subsidiaries of\nAssuredPartners Capital, Inc. The placement of insurance was completed by an Assured agent and Mr. Budde did not participate in any decisions about insurance, nor was he\npaid any portion of the brokerage fee. Assured earned brokerage fees of approximately $0.3 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\n15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nGeneral Matters\nThe Company is party to various negotiations and legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. The Company provides reserves for these matters when a loss is\nprobable and reasonably estimable. The Company does not disclose a range of potential loss because the likelihood of such a loss is remote. In the opinion of management, the\nultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.\nLegal Proceedings\nOn October 24, 2022, the Company entered into a binding term sheet to resolve the putative class action (the “Securities Class Action”) brought in the Central District of\nCalifornia (Case No.2:21-cv-02072) on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s securities from March 10, 2020 through May 10, 2021. On January 13, 2023, the parties\nexecuted a Stipulation of Settlement setting forth the terms of the settlement of the class action and resolution of all claims.\nOn July 28, 2023 (the “Judgment Date”), the Court entered an order (the “Order”) granting final approval of the Stipulation of Settlement, resolving the Securities Class Action.\nPursuant to the Stipulation of Settlement, in exchange for a release of all claims and dismissal with prejudice of the Securities Class Action, the Company agreed to create a\nsettlement fund with an escrow agent (the “Settlement Fund”), consisting of $15.0 million in cash and $20.0 million in shares of common stock of the Company (the\n“Settlement Shares”) from which class members will receive payment. The escrow agent may sell the Settlement Shares and deposit the proceeds from such sales into the\nSettlement Fund or may distribute the Settlement Shares to class members.\nPursuant to the Stipulation of Settlement, the number of Settlement Shares to be issued was based on the VWAP of the Company’s common stock for the1 5 trading days\nimmediately preceding the Judgment Date. The VWAP would be adjusted if, at market close on the trading day before the date the Company deposits the Settlement Shares, the\nmarket price per share of the Company’s common stock deviated more than 25% above or below the VWAP Price. Upon such deviation, the number of Settlement Shares\nwould be adjusted, upward or downward, such that the aggregate value of the Settlement Shares equals $20.0 million. Consistent with the foregoing, the Company issued\n25,380,711 shares of its common stock into the Settlement Fund as Settlement Shares in September 2023, which is considered a non-cash transaction.\nF-30\nFor additional information regarding the Securities Class Action, see Note 17, “Commitments and Contingencies – Legal Proceedings – Securities Litigation” included in Item\n8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n16. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThe Company has evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and disclosures through the date the accompanying consolidated financial statements were filed.\nSale of Manufacturing Facility and Campus\nOn January 31, 2024, a subsidiary of Workhorse entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Sale Agreement”) with William Repny LLC (the “Purchaser”) for the sale of\nits Union City, IN manufacturing facility and campus, excluding any equipment or fixtures used in manufacturing operations (the “Property”), for a purchase price, before fees\nand expenses, of approximately $34.5 million.\nPursuant to the Sale Agreement, the Company will lease back the Property from the Purchaser under a triple-net lease agreement (the “Lease”) for an initial term of2 0 years.\nThe Company will have the option to renew the Lease for three additional 10-year renewal terms, subject to the terms of the Lease.\nUnder the Lease, the Company will pay base annual rent of approximately $3.4 million for the Property, subject to an annual increase of 3% during the initial term of the lease\nand certain additional increases during any renewal term. In addition to rent, the Company will be responsible for all costs and expenses related to the Property, including,\nwithout limitation, maintenance, operation, repair and replacement of buildings and improvements, utility charges, insurance premiums and real estate taxes and assessments.\nThe closing is subject to Purchaser performing satisfactory due diligence on the Property, obtaining financing and other customary closing conditions. There is no assurance at\nthis time that the Purchaser will purchase the Property. The Company plans to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nAero Drone Design and Manufacturing Operations\nAs previously disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2023 filed with the SEC on November 14, 2023, we announced our decision\nto evaluate a broad range of strategic alternatives for our drone vehicles which may include a sale, strategic partnership, another transaction, or the continued execution of our\nstrategic plan for the drone vehicle production. On February 20, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a plan to cease the production operations of our drone design and\nmanufacturing business and transition to only operating our Drones As A Service business. The decision to cease operation of our drone design and manufacturing product line\nwas not considered a strategic shift having major effects on operations and therefore does not meet the criteria to qualify as a discontinued operation.\nFirst Amendment to Green Senior Secured Convertible Note Due 2026\nSubsequent to December 31, 2023, the Company has repaid $7.5 million of the initial principal balance upon request of the holder. On February 29, 2024, the Company entered\ninto a First Amendment to Green Senior Secured Convertible Note Due 2026 (the “2026 Notes Amendment”) with the holder. In connection with the 2026 Notes Amendment,\nthe Company redeemed $10.0 million principal amount of the 2026 Notes, thereby reducing the outstanding principal amount of the 2026 Notes to $2.5 million. The 2026 Notes\nAmendment also removed the February 15, 2024 and March 1, 2024 partial redemption dates, deleted the minimum liquidity covenant, and amended the 2026 Notes to permit\nthe Company to prepay the 2026 Notes at its option, subject to certain conditions.\nExchange Agreement\nIn connection with the 2026 Notes Amendment, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) to exchange the 2026 Warrants for a total of 8.5\nmillion shares of common stock for a total value of $2.9 million, whereupon the Warrant was cancelled (the “Exchange”). The Company recorded a gain of $2.7 million in\nconnection with the Exchange in the first quarter of 2024.\nF-31\nAdditional Cost Reduction Measures\nAnother vital component of management’s intended plan over the next twelve months to improve our liquidity and working capital requirements is reducing our operating costs\nto, among other things, reduce demands on the liquidity that is available to us. Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2024 we took the measures described below.\n• We are in the process of completing a reduction in force (the “RIF”) pursuant to which we terminated approximately 20% of our total workforce, excluding direct labor.\nWe do not expect to incur material costs in connection with the RIF.\n• Each of our executive officers agreed to defer payment of approximately 20% of their cash compensation into the second quarter of 2024.\n• As described above, we decided to fully transition our Aero business from a design and manufacturing drone business to Drones as a Service business. This transition\nhas resulted in, among other things, our stopping production and development of both drone product lines and the termination of employees who performed the related\nwork.\nManagement plans to continue to seek additional opportunities to reduce costs and, in particular, cash expenditures, in a manner intended to minimize their adverse impact on\nour core operations. Management also plans to significantly reduce capital expenditures and only allocate capital for manufacturing equipment and tooling. There can be no\nassurance that the measures described above, or any other cost-cutting measures we may implement in the future will be sufficient to address our immediate or longer-term\nliquidity and working capital needs. Moreover, it is possible that such measures will have an adverse effect on our operations.\nF-32\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported within the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls\nand procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report was made under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer.\nBased upon this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures\nwere not effective as of such date due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, as described below.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-\n15(f) and 15d-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records in reasonable detail to accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and\n(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including Workhorse’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) (the\n“Framework”) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).\nThere are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of any system of internal controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or\noverriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective internal controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control\nobjectives.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nDuring the audit process related to the year ended December 31, 2023, Management identified a material weakness in the design of one of the Company's internal controls\nrelated to the review of the fair value calculation of the convertible note and warrant liability performed by a third-party valuation expert. The controls were not designed with a\nlevel of precision that would detect the use of an inappropriate input that could have a material impact on the valuation.\nBased on the results of its evaluation and the material weakness described above, Management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not\neffective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance\nwith GAAP as of December 31, 2023.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting.\n35\nRemediation of the Material Weakness\nWe are in the process of designing and implementing remediation measures intended to address the material weakness discussed above. These remediation measures will be\nfocused on our precision of review of the binomial lattice model performed by independent third-party valuation experts we use to value these types of complex financial\ninstruments. The valuation procedures are to be reviewed and approved by responsible management of the Company. Under the supervision of the Audit Committee,\nresponsible management will develop a comprehensive remediation plan, including a detailed plan and timetable for implementation, and will report regularly to the Audit\nCommittee regarding the status of the implementation activities.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nOn March 11, 2024, each of our executive officers (including each of our Named Executive Officers) voluntarily agreed to defer receipt of 20% of their annual base salary for\npay periods beginning on March 4, 2024 and ending three months thereafter. In addition, each of our directors agreed to defer receipt of monthly cash retainers for the second\nquarter until July 1, 2024. Our executive officers and directors agreed to the deferrals to reflect their commitment to the Company and to align their compensation with the\nbroader actions we are taking to reduce costs. All executive officers and affected directors are expected to receive such deferred compensation following the deferral period.\nITEM 9C.

Grant of Restricted Share Unit Award. In accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions of (a) the Workhorse Group\nInc. 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as it may be amended from time to time (the “Plan”), and (b) this Restricted Share Unit Award\nAgreement (the “Agreement”), Workhorse Group Inc. (the “Company”) grants to the Grantee identified on Schedule 1 attached hereto (the\n“Grantee”) an Award under the Plan for the number of Restricted Share Units set forth on Schedule 1 (the “Restricted Share Units”), which\nRestricted Share Units will be subject to the terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations of this Agreement. The Restricted Share Units\nawarded under this Agreement will be deemed to have been granted on the date set forth on Schedule 1 (the “Grant Date”) and will constitute\na Full Value Award for purposes of the Plan. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement will have the meanings set forth in the\nPlan. The Restricted Share Units will be credited to a separate notional account maintained for the Grantee on the books and records of the\nCompany. Schedule 1 and all Exhibits hereto are incorporated into and form a part of this Agreement.\n2. Vesting and Forfeiture of Restricted Share Units.\na. All Restricted Share Units shall be unvested unless and until they become vested and nonforfeitable on the applicable\nVesting Date as set forth in Schedule 1 provided, in any case, that the Grantee’s Termination Date has not occurred prior to the applicable\nVesting Date. All Restricted Share Units that are not vested upon the Grantee’s Termination Date shall immediately expire and shall be\nforfeited and the Grantee shall have no further rights thereto.\nb. Except as otherwise determined by the Committee in the exercise of its discretion under the Plan and except as otherwise\nexpressly provided in this Agreement, if the Grantee’s Termination Date occurs for any reason at any time prior to the applicable Vesting Date,\nany Restricted Share Units that are not vested as of the Termination Date will be automatically forfeited upon the Termination Date, the\nGrantee will have no further rights under or with respect to such Restricted Share Units, and the Company will have no further obligations to\nthe Grantee under this Agreement or otherwise with respect to such Restricted Share Units.\nc. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 2(a) or 2(b), except as otherwise provided herein or as provided by the\nBoard or Committee in accordance with its authority under the Plan, in the event that the Grantee’s Termination Date occurs prior to a Vesting\nDate as the result of the Grantee’s not standing for re-election to the Board or the Grantee’s death or Disability, as of the Termination Date the\nGrantee will be vested in that number of Restricted Share Units equal to the pro rata portion (based on the number of Board meetings attended\nby the Grantee between the Grant Date and the Termination Date, including any meeting occurring on the Termination Date, as compared to\nthe total number of meetings scheduled for the calendar year in which the Termination Date occurs) of the Restricted Share Units that would\nhave become vested as of the Vesting Date had the Grantee’s Termination Date not occurred prior to the Vesting Date and the Termination\nDate shall be the “Vesting Date” of the Restricted Share Units that vest as of the Termination Date pursuant to this subsection 2(c). All other\nRestricted Share Units that are not vested as of the Termination Date will be forfeited as of the Grantee’s Termination Date in accordance with\nsubsection 2(b).\n1\nd. In the event that a Change in Control occurs prior to a Vesting Date, the provisions of Section 8 of the Plan will apply to\nthe vesting and settlement of the outstanding Restricted Share Units.\n3. Settlement. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Award, Restricted Share Units that become vested in accordance with\nSection 2 shall be paid and settled as of the applicable Vesting Date (and no more than thirty (30) days thereafter). The date on which payment\nand settlement occurs is referred to as the “Settlement Date.” Settlement of vested Restricted Share Units on a Settlement Date shall be made\nin the form of shares of Stock with one share of Stock being issued in settlement of each vested Restricted Share Unit and the Company will\nenter the Grantee's name on the books and records of the Company as the shareholder of record with respect to the shares of Stock delivered to\nthe Grantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board or Committee, in its sole discretion and for any reason, may elect to settle the vested\nRestricted Share Units (in whole or in part) in cash, in an amount equal to the fair market value (determined as of the Settlement Date) of the\nnumber of shares of Stock represented by the Restricted Share Units that are vested and payable as of the Settlement Date and which the Board\nor Committee elects to settle in cash. Upon the settlement of any vested Restricted Share Unit, the Restricted Share Unit shall be cancelled.\n4. Restrictions. Subject to any exceptions set forth in this Agreement or the Plan, until such time as the Restricted Share Units are\nsettled in accordance with Section 3, the Restricted Share Units or the rights relating thereto may not be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached,\nsold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by the Grantee. Any attempt to assign, alienate, pledge, attach, sell or otherwise transfer or\nencumber the Restricted Share Units or the rights relating thereto will be wholly ineffective and, if any such attempt is made, the Restricted\nShare Units will be forfeited by the Grantee and all of the Grantee’s rights to such units will immediately terminate without any payment or\nconsideration by the Company.\n5. Rights as Shareholder; Dividend Equivalents.\na. The Grantee will not have any rights of a shareholder with respect to the shares of Stock underlying the Restricted Share\nUnits unless and until the Restricted Share Units vest and are settled by the issuance of such shares of Stock.\nb. Upon and following the settlement of the Restricted Share Units in shares of Stock, the Grantee will be the record owner\nof the Stock underlying the Restricted Share Units unless and until such Stock is sold or otherwise disposed of, and as record owner will be\nentitled to all rights of a shareholder of the Company (including voting rights).\nc. The Grantee will not be entitled to any dividend equivalents with respect to the Restricted Share Units to reflect any\ndividends payable on shares of Stock.\n6. Tax Withholding. The Company and its Affiliates will deduct from any vesting or settlement of the Grantee’s Restricted Share\nUnits or from any other payment to the Grantee, including wages, any Federal, state, local or provincial tax or charge that is then required to be\ndeducted under applicable law with respect to the vesting or settlement of the Restricted Share Units or other payment or as determined by the\nCommittee to be appropriate under a program for withholding. The Company’s obligation to deliver Stock or cash, as applicable, in settlement\nof the vested Restricted Share Units will be subject to the Grantee’s satisfaction of all applicable federal, state, and local income and\nemployment tax withholding obligations. If tax withholding attributable to the vesting or settlement of the vested Restricted Share Units is\nrequired by the Company, then, at the Board’s discretion, the Company may satisfy such tax obligations by reducing the number of shares of\nStock otherwise deliverable (if the units are to be settled in Stock) or by accepting the delivery to the Company of shares of Stock previously\nowned and\n2\nunencumbered by the Grantee. Any withholding with respect to cash payments will be made by a reduction of the cash payment otherwise to be\npaid to the Grantee. The Company will also have the right to withhold from any salary, bonus or other payments due the Grantee the amount\nnecessary to satisfy any tax withholding obligations related to the vesting or settlement of the vested Restricted Share Units.\n7. Heirs and Successors. If any benefits deliverable to the Grantee under this Agreement have not been delivered at the time of the\nGrantee’s death, such benefits will be delivered to the legal representative of the estate of the Grantee.\n8. Compliance with Law. The issuance and delivery of shares of Stock pursuant to this Agreement will be subject to compliance by\nthe Company and the Grantee with all applicable requirements of federal and state securities laws and with all applicable requirements of any\nstock exchange on which the Stock may be listed. No Stock will be issued pursuant to this Agreement unless and until any then applicable\nrequirements of state or federal laws and regulatory agencies have been fully complied with to the satisfaction of the Company and its counsel.\nThe Grantee understands that the Company is under no obligation to register the Stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission, any\nstate securities commission, or any stock exchange to effect such compliance.\n9. Administration. The authority to administer and interpret this Award and this Agreement will be vested in the Committee, and\nthe Committee will have all powers with respect to this Award and this Agreement as it has with respect to the Plan. Any interpretation of this\nAward or this Agreement by the Committee and any decision made by it with respect to this Award or this Agreement is final and binding on\nall persons.\n10. Adjustments. The number of Restricted Share Units awarded pursuant to this Award may be adjusted by the Committee in\naccordance with the Plan to reflect certain corporate transactions which affect the number, type or value of the Restricted Share Units.\n11. No Right to Continued Employment or Service. Nothing contained in the Plan or in this Agreement, nor any action taken by the\nBoard, will confer upon the Grantee any right with respect to continuation of employment by or service with the Company as an employee,\nofficer or director nor interfere in any way with the right of the Company to terminate the Grantee’s employment or other service as an\nemployee, officer or director at any time with or without Cause.\n12. Governing Law; Venue; Dispute. This Agreement has been granted, executed and delivered in the State of Ohio, and the\ninterpretation and enforcement will be governed by the laws thereof without regard to conflict of laws principles, and subject to the exclusive\njurisdiction of the courts therein.

The resolution of such dispute by the Board will be final, binding and conclusive on the Grantee and the Company.\n13. Notices. Any notice or document required to be filed with the Committee or the Grantee under the Plan or this Agreement will\nbe properly filed if delivered in person, (including by e-mail notification with receipt requested), mailed by registered mail, postage prepaid, or\nsent by nationally recognized courier service to the Grantee at the Grantee’s most current address on file with the Company and, if to the Board\nor Committee, in care of the Company at its principal executive offices to the attention of the Company’s Chief Legal Officer or Chief Human\nResources Officer. The Company may, by advance written notice to affected persons, revise such notice procedure from time to time. Any\nnotice required under the Plan or this Agreement (other than a notice of election) may be waived by the person entitled to notice.\n3\n14. Plan Governs; Other Terms. The Award evidenced by this Agreement is granted pursuant to the Plan, and this Award and this\nAgreement are in all respects governed by the Plan and subject to all of the terms and provisions thereof, whether such terms and provisions\nare incorporated in this Agreement by reference or are expressly cited. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, (a)\nthis Award is subject to the Company’s recoupment or clawback policies as applicable and as in effect from time to time, and (b) nothing in this\nAgreement supersedes or limits the Committee’s authority under the Plan.\n15. Successors and Assigns. The Company may assign any of its rights under this Agreement. This Agreement will be binding upon\nand inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Company. Subject to the restrictions on assignment and transfer set forth herein,\nthis Agreement will be binding upon the Grantee and the Grantee’s beneficiaries, executors, administrators and the person(s) to whom the\nRestricted Share Units may be transferred by will or the laws of descent or distribution.\n16. Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of the Plan or this Agreement will not affect the validity or\nenforceability of any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, and each provision of the Plan and this Agreement will be severable and\nenforceable to the extent permitted by law.\n17. Discretionary Nature of Plan. The Plan is discretionary and may be amended, cancelled or terminated by the Board at any time,\nin its discretion. The grant of the Restricted Share Units pursuant to this Agreement does not create any contractual right or other right to\nreceive any Restricted Share Units or other Grants in the future. Future grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Board or the\nCommittee. Any amendment, modification, or termination of the Plan will not constitute a change or impairment of the terms and conditions of\nthe Grantee’s employment or other service with the Company.\n18. Amendment. The Board has the right to amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or cancel the Plan, prospectively or retroactively;\nprovided, that, no such amendment will alter or impair the Grantee’s material rights and obligations under this Agreement without the\nGrantee’s written consent.\n19. Section 409A of the Code. It is intended that any payments with respect to Restricted Share Units will either be exempt from or\ncomply with section 409A of the Code. The provisions of this Agreement will be construed and interpreted in accordance with section 409A of\nthe Code. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any payment or benefit hereunder is subject to section\n409A of the Code, and if such payment or benefit is to be paid or provided on account of the Grantee’s termination of employment (or other\nseparation from service):\na. and if the Grantee is a specified employee (within the meaning of section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the Code) and if any such payment\nor benefit is required to be made or provided prior to the first day of the seventh month following the Grantee’s separation\nfrom service or termination of employment, such payment or benefit will be delayed until the first day of the seventh month\nfollowing the Grantee’s termination of employment or separation from service; and\nb. the determination as to whether the Grantee has had a termination of employment (or separation from service) will be made in\naccordance with the provisions of section 409A of the Code and the guidance issued thereunder without application of any\nalternative levels of reductions of bona fide services permitted thereunder.\n4\n.\n5\nSchedule 1\nRestricted Share Unit Agreement\nName of Grantee: ___________________\nNumber of Restricted Share Units: __________\nGrant Date: _____________, [2024]\nVesting Date: Subject to accelerated vesting and/or forfeiture in accordance with Section 2 of the Restricted Share Unit Award\nAgreement, the Restricted Share Units shall become vested [on the six (6) month anniversary of the Grant Date] (the “Vesting Date”) for\npurposes of the Award.\nWorkhorse Group Inc. 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan\nRESTRICTED SHARE UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT\n1.

In the event that a Change in Control occurs prior to a Vesting Date, the provisions of Section 8 of the Plan will apply to\nthe vesting and settlement of the outstanding Restricted Share Units.\ne. In the event that any of the terms contained in this Section 3 or this Agreement conflict with any employment agreement\nin effect between the Company or any of its Affiliates and the Grantee, then the terms of the employment agreement will govern if such terms\nare more favorable to the Grantee.\n4. Settlement. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Award, Restricted Share Units that become vested in accordance with\nSection 3 shall be paid and settled as of the applicable Vesting Date (and no more than thirty (30) days thereafter). The date on which payment\nand settlement occurs is referred to as the “Settlement Date.” Settlement of vested Restricted Share Units on a Settlement Date shall be made\nin the form of shares of Stock with one share of Stock being issued in settlement of each vested Restricted Share Unit and the Company will\nenter the Grantee's name on the books and records of the Company as the shareholder of record with respect to the shares of Stock delivered to\nthe Grantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board or Committee, in its sole discretion and for any reason, may elect to settle the vested\nRestricted Share Units (in whole or in part) in cash, in an amount equal to the fair market value (determined as of the Settlement Date) of the\nnumber of shares of Stock represented by the Restricted Share Units that are vested and payable as of the Settlement Date and which the Board\nor Committee elects to settle in cash. Upon the settlement of any vested Restricted Share Unit, the Restricted Share Unit shall be cancelled.\n5. Restrictions. Subject to any exceptions set forth in this Agreement or the Plan, until such time as the Restricted Share Units are\nsettled in accordance with Section 4, the Restricted Share Units or the rights relating thereto may not be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached,\nsold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by the Grantee. Any attempt to assign, alienate, pledge, attach, sell or otherwise transfer or\nencumber the Restricted Share Units or the rights relating thereto will be wholly ineffective and, if any such attempt is made, the Restricted\nShare Units will be forfeited by the Grantee and all of the Grantee’s rights to such units will immediately terminate without any payment or\nconsideration by the Company.\n6. Rights as Shareholder; Dividend Equivalents.\na. The Grantee will not have any rights of a shareholder with respect to the shares of Stock underlying the Restricted Share\nUnits unless and until the Restricted Share Units vest and are settled by the issuance of such shares of Stock.\nb. Upon and following the settlement of the Restricted Share Units in shares of Stock, the Grantee will be the record owner\nof the Stock underlying the Restricted Share Units\n2\nunless and until such Stock is sold or otherwise disposed of, and as record owner will be entitled to all rights of a shareholder of the Company\n(including voting rights).\nc. The Grantee will not be entitled to any dividend equivalents with respect to the Restricted Share Units to reflect any\ndividends payable on shares of Stock.\n7. Tax Withholding. The Company and its Affiliates will deduct from any vesting or settlement of the Grantee’s Restricted Share\nUnits or from any other payment to the Grantee, including wages, any Federal, state, local or provincial tax or charge that is then required to be\ndeducted under applicable law with respect to the vesting or settlement of the Restricted Share Units or other payment or as determined by the\nCommittee to be appropriate under a program for withholding. The Company’s obligation to deliver Stock or cash, as applicable, in settlement\nof the vested Restricted Share Units will be subject to the Grantee’s satisfaction of all applicable federal, state, and local income and\nemployment tax withholding obligations. If tax withholding attributable to the vesting or settlement of the vested Restricted Share Units is\nrequired by the Company, then, at the Board’s discretion, the Company may satisfy such tax obligations by reducing the number of shares of\nStock otherwise deliverable (if the units are to be settled in Stock) or by accepting the delivery to the Company of shares of Stock previously\nowned and unencumbered by the Grantee. Any withholding with respect to cash payments will be made by a reduction of the cash payment\notherwise to be paid to the Grantee. The Company will also have the right to withhold from any salary, bonus or other payments due the\nGrantee the amount necessary to satisfy any tax withholding obligations related to the vesting or settlement of the vested Restricted Share\nUnits.\n8. Conditions of Granting Award. The Grantee understands and agrees that, as a condition to the Company granting the Restricted\nShare Units under this Agreement, by the Acceptance Date, the Grantee must execute and deliver an Employee Non-Compete Agreement in\nthe form specified by the Company (the “Non-Compete Agreement”). The Grantee further understands that the Non-Compete Agreement\nwill become effective upon the Grantee’s execution and delivery thereof and that it will remain in effect for the period described therein, which\nperiod would include a period following the Grantee’s Termination Date irrespective of whether or not the Grantee becomes vested in the\nRestricted Share Units in accordance with this Agreement. In the Company’s sole discretion, the Company may accept as a Non-Compete\nAgreement for purposes of this Agreement an executed employee non-compete agreement that is otherwise on file with the Company as of the\nGrant Date.\n9. Heirs and Successors. If any benefits deliverable to the Grantee under this Agreement have not been delivered at the time of the\nGrantee’s death, such benefits will be delivered to the legal representative of the estate of the Grantee.\n10.

No Stock will be issued pursuant to this Agreement unless and until any then applicable\nrequirements of state or federal laws and regulatory agencies have been fully complied with to the satisfaction of the Company and its counsel.\nThe Grantee understands that the Company is under no obligation to register the Stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission, any\nstate securities commission, or any stock exchange to effect such compliance.\n11.

The resolution of such dispute by the Board will be final, binding and conclusive on the Grantee and the Company.\n15. Notices.

The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of the Plan or this Agreement will not affect the validity or\nenforceability of any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, and each provision of the Plan and this Agreement will be severable and\nenforceable to the extent permitted by law.\n19. Discretionary Nature of Plan. The Plan is discretionary and may be amended, cancelled or terminated by the Board at any time,\nin its discretion.

(the “Company”) has established this policy which provides for the\nrecoupment of certain executive compensation in the event of an accounting restatement resulting from material noncompliance with financial\nreporting requirements under the federal securities laws (the “Policy”) in order to comply with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market or such other national securities exchange on which the\nCompany’s securities are then listed (the “Principal Exchange”).\n1. Administration\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Board or, if so designated by the Board, the Human Resource Management and Compensation\nCommittee, in which case references herein to the Board shall be deemed references to the Human Resource Management and Compensation\nCommittee. Any determinations made by the Board shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.\n2. Covered Executives\nThis Policy applies to the Company’s current and former executive officers, as determined by the Board in accordance with Section 10D of\nthe Exchange Act and the Principal Exchange listing standards, and such other senior executives who may from time to time be deemed\nsubject to the Policy by the Board (“Covered Executives”).\n3. Recoupment; Accounting Restatement\nIn the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements due to material noncompliance by\nthe Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, the Board will require reimbursement or forfeiture of any\nexcess Incentive Compensation received by any Covered Executive during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date\non which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement, including any required restatement that:\n(a) corrects an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements; or\n(b) corrects an error not material to previously issued financial statements, but that would result in a material misstatement if:\n(i) the error was left uncorrected in the current period; or\n(ii) the error correction was recognized in the current period.\n4. Incentive Compensation\nFor purposes of this Policy, “Incentive Compensation” means any of the following; provided that, such compensation is granted, earned, or\nvested based wholly or in part on the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure:\n(a) annual bonuses and other short- and long-term cash incentives;\n(b) stock options;\n(c) stock appreciation rights;\n(d) restricted stock;\n(e) restricted stock units;\n(f) performance shares; and/or\n(g) performance units.\n“Financial Reporting Measure” means (i) any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used\nin preparing financial statements, or any measure derived wholly or in part from the financial information, such as revenues, EBITDA, or net\nincome, (ii) stock price and total shareholder return and (iii) measures of liquidity, return and earnings. For the avoidance of doubt, a\nFinancial Reporting Measure need not be presented in the Company’s financial statements or included in a filing with the Securities and\nExchange Commission.\n5. Excess Incentive Compensation: Amount Subject to Recovery\nThe amount to be recovered will be the excess of the Incentive Compensation paid to the Covered Executive based on the erroneous data\nover the Incentive Compensation that would have been paid to the Covered Executive had it been based on the restated results, computed\nwithout regard to any taxes paid, as determined by the Board.\nIf the Board cannot determine the amount of excess Incentive Compensation received by the Covered Executive directly from the\ninformation in the accounting restatement, then it will (a) make its determination based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the\naccounting restatement and (b) maintain documentation of the determination of such reasonable estimate and provide the relevant\ndocumentation as required to the Principal Exchange.\n6. Method of Recoupment\nThe Board will determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recouping Incentive Compensation hereunder which may include, without\nlimitation:\n(a) requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive Compensation previously paid;\n(b) seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition of any equity-based awards;\n(c) offsetting the recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Covered Executive;\n(d) cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or\n(e) taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Board.\n7. No Indemnification\nThe Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executives against the loss of any incorrectly awarded Incentive Compensation.\n2\n8. Interpretation\nThe Board is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the\nadministration of this Policy. It is intended that this Policy be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Section 10D\nof the Exchange Act and any applicable rules or standards adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Principal Exchange.\n9. Effective Date\nThis Policy shall be effective as of the date first written above; provided, it shall apply to Incentive Compensation that is approved, awarded\nor granted to Covered Executives on or after October 2, 2023 (the “Effective Date”).\n10.Amendment; Termination\nThe Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to reflect final\nregulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 10D of the Exchange Act and to comply with any rules or\nstandards adopted by the Principal Exchange. The Board may terminate this Policy at any time.\n11.Other Recoupment Rights\nThe Board intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The Board may require that any employment agreement,\nequity award agreement, or similar agreement entered into on or after the Effective Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit\nthereunder, require a Covered Executive to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in\naddition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any\nsimilar policy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the\nCompany.\n12.Impracticability\nThe Board shall recover any excess Incentive Compensation in accordance with this Policy unless the Board determines that recovery would\nbe impracticable and either of the following two conditions is met: (a) the Board has determined that the direct expenses, such as reasonable\nlegal expenses and consulting fees, paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered (and the\nCompany has made a reasonable attempt to recover the excess Incentive Compensation, documented such attempt(s) to recover, and\nprovided such documentation to the Principal Exchange); or (b) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan,\nunder which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section\n411(a) of the Code.\n13.Successors\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other\nlegal representatives.\n3"
