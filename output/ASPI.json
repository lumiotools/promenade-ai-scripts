NASDAQ: ASPI (\"ASP Isotopes” or the “Company”), an advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes for the production of isotopes for use in multiple industries, today announced that it has completed the construction of a Silicon-28 enrichment facility in Pretoria, South Africa. The completion of the facility is broadly in line with previously communicated timelines. Today the Company started the commissioning phase of the facility’s construction and start-up, in preparation for supplying commercial quantities of Silicon-28 during 1H 2025.\n\nASP Isotopes expects highly enriched Silicon-28 to be required by manufacturers of next-generation semiconductors. Naturally occurring Silicon has three isotopes – 28, 29 and 30. The 29 isotope has a ½ positive spin, which is an intrinsic form of angular momentum carried by elementary particles. In contrast, highly enriched Silicon-28 is spin-free where qubits are protected from sources of decoherence that causes loss of quantum information(1). In addition to its potential to process superior information such as qubits, it is believed that highly enriched Silicon-28 can conduct heat 150% more efficiently(2) than natural Silicon, which will potentially allow for chips to become smaller, faster and cooler.\n\nASP Isotopes’ proprietary technology can enrich isotopes of low atomic mass (such as silane (SiH4), molecular mass of 32), as well as isotopes of heavier masses. Other companies developing methods to enrich silicon generally either enrich silicon tetrafluoride (SiF4) or a halo silane. Neither of these chemicals can be used directly by a semiconductor company and require chemical converting processes that potentially harm the purity of the final product. By processing silane directly, the Company believes that its finished product will be a higher quality and may be used by semiconductor companies without the need for additional chemical conversion processes.\n\n“ _To create faster, smaller next-generation semiconductors, the world is likely going to require materials that are currently not available in commercial quantities_ ”, said Paul Mann, ASP Isotopes’ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “ _ASP Isotopes is currently working on many isotopically pure elements that we believe will help semiconductor companies create the chips that the world will require in the future to enable technologies such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence_ ”.\n\nThe Company has already signed two supply agreements with U.S.-based customers for highly enriched Silicon-28. The first is with a U.S.-based semiconductor company. The second is with a U.S.-based industrial gas company. The Company is currently in discussions with multiple other potential customers for the supply of highly enriched Silicon-28 and expects to sign more agreements during the next six months. The Company had previously communicated that the Silicon-28 enrichment facility would be capable of enriching over 10 Kg of Silicon-28, per annum, enriched to 99.995%. During the construction of the facility, the Company decided to expand the name plate capacity and based on pre-commissioning data the Company now believes that the plant will be capable of enriching over 50kg of Silicon-28, per annum, enriched to 99.995%.\n\nBecause of the size and scope of the enrichment facility, and in compliance with South Africa’s obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the facility is managed under a comprehensive safeguard agreement (CSA) with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), whose representatives have visited and inspected the facility. Assuming the demand for Silicon-28 grows, the Company now expects to build multiple Silicon-28 enrichment facilities of larger nameplate capacity in multiple countries including Iceland and the United States.\n\nThis state-of-the-art facility contains several proprietary components, designed and engineered by ASP Isotopes. These include hermetically sealed, oil-free, helium-tight centrifugal compressors, pressure actuated relief (PAR) valves, molar mass meters and laminar flow meters. While the Company is unlikely to ever apply for a patent on the entire enrichment process, the Company expects to submit patent applications on several of the components contained within the facility, that have been designed and fabricated by ASP Isotopes.\n\n(1) [Isotopically Enriched Layers for Quantum Computers Formed by 28Si Implantation and Layer Exchange, Schneider, E and England, J; ACS Appl.

NASDAQ: ASPI (\"ASP Isotopes” or the “Company”), an advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes for the production of isotopes for use in multiple industries, today announced that it has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with The South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (Necsa) to collaborate on the research, development and ultimately the commercial production of advanced nuclear fuels.\n\nNecsa is a state-owned company established by the Republic of South Africa Nuclear Energy Act in 1999 with a mandate to undertake and promote research and development in the field of nuclear energy and radiation sciences. Necsa is also responsible for processing source material, and co-operating with other institutions on nuclear and related matters.\n\nThe proposed structure under discussion for the delivery of the objectives of the MOU contemplates the formation of a new entity in South Africa with a board of directors consisting of at least two representatives from ASPI and Necsa. Discussions between the parties during the last three years have focused on advancing new nuclear fuel to cater especially for small modular reactors as a start and eventually the construction of a nuclear fuel facility for the production of HALEU.\n\nIt is anticipated that the research, development and ultimate construction of a HALEU production facility will take place at Pelindaba, which is situated approximately 22 miles west of Pretoria, South Africa. Pelindaba is South Africa’s main nuclear research center and is the home of the 20MW research nuclear reactor, SAFARI-1, which over the last several years has become one of the world’s largest suppliers of Molybdenum-99 and other radioisotopes.\n\nThe MOU was signed at a signing ceremony that took place at Pelindaba on November 14, 2024. Mr Paul Mann, Chairman and CEO of ASP Isotopes, signed on behalf of ASP Isotopes and Mr Loyiso Tyabashe, Group CEO of Necsa, signed on behalf of Necsa. The signing ceremony was attended by representatives of the South African Government and included the participation of Minister Kgosientsho Ramokgopa, South Africa’s newly appointed Minister of Electricity and Energy.\n\nDuring the signing ceremony, Necsa GCEO, Mr Loyiso Tyabashe remarked, “ _The memorandum signifies the commitment of both Necsa and ASP Isotopes to bring essential nuclear fuels to the world. It is particularly important for South Africa as nuclear technology is set to take its rightful place in ensuring energy security thus enabling economic growth, decarbonisation and much-needed jobs. The MOU paves the way for Necsa to re-establish its_ _capability for nuclear_ _fuel production and supply. I believe that this collaboration will enhance the technological capabilities of both parties and foster a long-lasting and mutually beneficial partnership in the field of nuclear technology_ ”\n\nPaul Mann, Chairman and CEO of ASP Isotopes, and Chairman and CEO of QLE commented that “ _Over the last several decades, scientists at South Africa’s leading Universities and more recently at ASP Isotopes have developed some of the world's most advanced isotope enrichment technologies. Nuclear fuel has one of the most severely compromised supply chains_ _of any material in the World. The World is in urgent need of additional suppliers_. _This partnership with Necsa will enable us to accelerate the construction of an advanced nuclear fuel facility._ ” He continued “ _This proposed partnership with Necsa is designed to re-establish South Africa as a leader in Nuclear Engineering producing the advanced nuclear fuels that the world requires to prevent climate change. It will also mobilize hundreds of workers in local regions to build and operate the new manufacturing plant and support thousands of direct and indirect jobs across a nationwide manufacturing supply chain_.”\n\nASPI recently entered into a Term Sheet with TerraPower LLC which contemplates TerraPower providing funding for the construction of a HALEU Facility and TerraPower purchasing HALEU produced at the facility.\n\nDuring the next 30 years, global energy consumption will likely double(1). To meet 2050 climate goals, this must occur with a zero increase in carbon emissions. The advanced nuclear fuels required during the next 50 years are expected to differ significantly from those used in the last 50 years. Specifically, many small modular and advanced reactors in the future are expected to require HALEU. The Company has received interest from potential customers who collectively require over $37 billion of HALEU between the present day and 2037, at current market prices(2).\n\nThe Company believes that its enrichment technologies can be deployed in a new HALEU facility for considerably lower capital costs, and in much less time, compared to the construction of an enrichment facility using a traditional centrifuge process. The Company has already constructed or is in the process of constructing three isotope enrichment facilities in South Africa. The first facility is expected to enrich Carbon-14 for use in healthcare and agrochemicals. The second facility is expected to enrich Silicon-28, which the Company believes will enable faster, more efficient semiconductors for use in artificial intelligence and quantum computing. The third facility is expected to enrich Ytterbium-176, a critically important raw material used in the production of radio-oncology therapies.\n\n**About ASP Isotopes Inc.**\n\nASP Isotopes Inc. is a development stage advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes to produce isotopes for use in multiple industries. The Company employs proprietary technology, the Aerodynamic Separation Process (“ASP technology”). The Company’s initial focus is on producing and commercializing highly enriched isotopes for the healthcare and technology industries. The Company also plans to enrich isotopes for the nuclear energy sector using Quantum Enrichment technology that the Company is developing. The Company has isotope enrichment facilities in Pretoria, South Africa, dedicated to the enrichment of isotopes of elements with a low atomic mass (light isotopes).\n\nThere is a growing demand for isotopes such as Silicon-28 for enabling quantum computing; Molybdenum-100, Molybdenum-98, Zinc-68, Ytterbium-176, and Nickel-64 for new, emerging healthcare applications, as well as Chlorine-37, Lithium-6, Lithium-7 and Uranium-235 for green energy applications. The ASP Technology (Aerodynamic Separation Process) is ideal for enriching low and heavy atomic mass molecules.

Isotopes are\nforms of a chemical element with specific properties.\n• Atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of\nneutrons are known as isotopes. Isotopes exhibit nearly identical\nchemical properties but differ in mass, leading to variations in their\nphysical properties.

All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\n\nIn some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “should,” “would,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Some of the key factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations include:\n\n•\n\nour ability to achieve or sustain positive cash flows from operations or profitability;\n\n•\n\nour ability to complete the construction of, commission and successfully operate isotope enrichment plants in a cost-effective manner;\n\n•\n\nour ability to meet, and to continue to meet, applicable regulatory requirements for the use of the isotopes we may produce using the ASP technology or the Quantum Enrichment process;\n\n•\n\nour ability to obtain regulatory approvals for the production and distribution of isotopes;\n\n•\n\nour ability to comply on an ongoing basis with the numerous regulatory requirements applicable to the ASP technology, the Quantum Enrichment process and our enrichment facilities in South Africa;\n\n•\n\nthe introduction, market acceptance and success of Mo-100 that we may produce using ASP technology as an alternative and potentially more convenient production route for Tc-99m;\n\n•\n\nthe success or profitability of our future offtake arrangements with respect to various isotopes that we may produce using ASP technology or the Quantum Enrichment process;\n\n•\n\na failure of demand for various isotopes that we may produce using ASP technology or the Quantum Enrichment process;\n\n•\n\nour future capital requirements and sources and uses of cash;\n\n•\n\nour ability to obtain funding for our operations and future growth;\n\n•\n\nthe extensive costs, time and uncertainty associated with new technology development;\n\n•\n\nour ability to implement and maintain effective internal controls;\n\n•\n\ndevelopments and projections relating to our competitors and industry;\n\n•\n\nthe ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, including our acquisition of assets of Molybdos (Pty) Limited in the “business rescue” auction, the assets and intellectual property we acquired from Klydon Proprietary Ltd, and our investment in PET Labs Pharmaceuticals;\n\n•\n\nproblems with the performance of the ASP technology or the Quantum Enrichment process in the enrichment of isotopes;\n\n•\n\nour dependence on a limited number of third-party suppliers for certain components;\n\n•\n\nour inability to adapt to changing technology and diagnostic landscape, such as the emergence of new diagnostic scanners or tracers;\n\n•\n\nour expected dependence on a limited number of key customers for isotopes that we may produce using ASP technology or the Quantum Enrichment process;\n\n•\n\nour inability to protect our intellectual property and the risk of claims that we have infringed on the intellectual property of others;\n\n•\n\nour inability to compete effectively;\n\n•\n\nrisks associated with the current economic environment;\n\n•\n\nrisks associated with our international operations;\n\n•\n\nour credit counterparty risks;\n\n•\n\ngeopolitical risk and changes in applicable laws or regulations;\n\n•\n\nour inability to adequately protect our technology infrastructure;\n\n•\n\nour inability to hire or retain skilled employees and the loss of any of our key personnel;\n\n•\n\noperational risk;\n\n•\n\ncosts and other risks associated with becoming a reporting company and becoming subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and\n\n•\n\nother factors that are described in “Risk Factors,” on page 38.\n\n3\n\nThese statements relate to future events or to our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, those set forth in Part I, Item 1A - “Risk Factors” below and for the reasons described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q reflects our current view with respect to future events and is subject to these and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions relating to our operations, results of operations, industry, and future growth. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available in the future.\n\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q also contains estimates, projections, and other information concerning our industry, our business, and the potential markets for certain isotopes, including data regarding the estimated size of those markets, their projected growth rates, and the incidence of certain medical conditions. Information that is based on estimates, forecasts, projections, or similar methodologies is inherently subject to uncertainties, and actual events or circumstances may differ materially from events and circumstances reflected in this information. Unless otherwise expressly stated, we obtained these industry, business, market, and other data from reports, research surveys, studies, and similar data prepared by third parties, industry, medical and general publications, government data, and similar sources. In some cases, we do not expressly refer to the sources from which these data are derived.\n\nExcept where the context otherwise requires, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, “we,” “us,” “our,” “ASP Isotopes,” and the “Company” refer to ASP Isotopes Inc. and, where appropriate, its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nTrademarks\n\nAll trademarks, service marks, and trade names included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are the property of their respective owners.

Organization\n\nDescription of Business\n\nASP Isotopes Inc. was incorporated in the state of Delaware on September 13, 2021, and has its principal operations in Washington, DC. ASP Isotopes Inc.’s subsidiary ASP Isotopes Guernsey Limited (“ASP Guernsey”), has its principal operations in Guernsey. ASP Guernsey’s subsidiary, ASP Isotopes South Africa Proprietary Limited (“ASP South Africa”), has its principal operations in South Africa. ASP Rentals Proprietary Limited (“ASP Rentals”), a variable interest entity (“VIE”) of ASP South Africa, has its principal operations in South Africa. Enlightened Isotopes (Pty) Ltd (“Enlightened Isotopes”), a 80% owned subsidiary of ASP South Africa, was formed in March 2023 and began operations in January 2024. ASP Isotopes UK Ltd (“ASP UK”), a subsidiary of ASP Guernsey, was incorporated in July 2022. ASPI South Africa Asset Finance Proprietary Limited (\"ASP SA Asset Finance”), a subsidiary of ASP South Africa, was incorporated in July 2024. PET Labs Global Nuclear Medicine SEZC (“PET Labs Global”), a subsidiary of ASP Guernsey, was incorporated in June 2024 in the Cayman Islands. PET Labs Pharmaceuticals Proprietary Limited (“PET Labs”), a 51% owned subsidiary of ASP Isotopes Inc. operates in South Africa. ASP Isotopes Inc.’s subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC, was formed in the state of Delaware in September 2023 and began operations in February 2024. Quantum Leap Energy LLC’s subsidiary Quantum Leap Energy Proprietary Limited (“Quantum Leap Energy South Africa”), has its operations in South Africa. ASP Isotopes Inc., its subsidiaries and ASP Rentals are collectively referred to as “the Company” throughout these consolidated statements.\n\nThe Company is a development stage advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes that, if successful, will allow for the enrichment of natural isotopes into higher concentration products, which could be used in several industries. The Company’s proprietary technology, the Aerodynamic Separation Process (“ASP technology”), originally developed by Klydon Proprietary Ltd (“Klydon”), is designed to enable the production of isotopes used in several industries. The Company’s initial focus is on the production and commercialization of enriched Carbon-14 (“C-14”), Molybdenum-100 (“Mo-100”) and Silicon-28 (“Si-28”). The Company has completed an isotope enrichment plant for the enrichment of C-14 located in Pretoria, South Africa and we expect to start commercial supply of C-14 in the first quarter of 2025, assuming timely delivery of the feedstock from the Company's customer. The Company anticipates completion and commissioning of a multi-isotope enrichment plant in Pretoria, South Africa in the fourth quarter 2024, and the Company expects to start initial commercial supply of Si-28 in early 2025. In addition, the Company has started planning additional isotope enrichment plants. The Company believes the C-14 it may develop using the ASP technology may be used in the development of new pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. The Company believes that the Mo-100 it may develop using the ASP technology has significant potential advantages for use in the preparation of nuclear imaging agents by radiopharmacies and others in the medical industry. The Company believes the Si-28 it may develop using the ASP technology may be used to develop advanced semiconductors and in quantum computing. In addition, the Company is considering the future development of the ASP technology for the separation of Zinc-68, Xenon-129/136 for potential use in the healthcare end market, Germanium 70/72/74 for possible use in the semiconductor end market, and Chlorine-37 for potential use in the nuclear energy end market.\n\nThe Company is also developing quantum enrichment technology to produce enriched Ytterbium-176 (“Yb-176”), Nickel-64, Lithium6, Lithium-7 and Uranium-235 (“U-235”). Quantum enrichment is an advanced isotope enrichment technique that is currently in development that uses lasers. The Company believes the U-235 that it may develop using quantum enrichment technology may be commercialized as a nuclear fuel component for use in the new generation of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU)-fueled small modular reactors that are now under development for commercial and government uses. The construction of the Company's first quantum enrichment facility was completed in August 2024, and the Company produced the first semi-finished material of enriched Yb-176 during the commissioning phase of the plant in October 2024. The Company expects to be able to achieve a 99.75% enrichment for Yb-176 and offer highly enriched Yb-176 for commercial sale during 2025. The Company also expects to proceed with the plans to construct Nickel-64 and Lithium- 6/7 quantum enrichment plants with targeted production during 2025.\n\nLiquidity\n\nThe Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since its inception. The Company incurred net losses of $23,201,675 and $12,123,907 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nThe Company currently expects that its cash and cash equivalents of $51,571,540 as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital requirements for more than 12 months from the date the financial statements are issued. In November 2024, the Company issued an additional 2,754,250 shares of common stock in a public offering at a public offering price of $6.75 per share for net proceeds of approximately $17,100,000. The Company anticipates it will need to continue to raise capital through additional equity and/or debt financings and/or collaborative development agreements to fund its operations.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will achieve or sustain positive cash flows from operations or profitability. The Company is in the process of seeking additional debt and equity financing. However, such funding may not be available on a timely basis on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, the Company may be required to scale back or discontinue the advancement of product candidates, reduce headcount, reorganize, merge with another entity, or cease operations.\n\n2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nUnaudited Financial Information\n\nThe Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"), and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. In the Company’s opinion, the information furnished reflects all adjustments, all of which are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the reported interim periods. The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued to provide additional evidence relative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or any other interim period. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n10\n\nBasis of Presentation and Use of Estimates\n\nThe Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and disclosure in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The most significant estimates in the Company’s consolidated financial statements relate to stock-based compensation expense, the accounting for the acquisition of PET Labs and fair value measurement of the convertible notes payable and warrants. Although these estimates are based on the Company’s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may materially differ from these estimates and assumptions.\n\nPrinciples of consolidation\n\nThe Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ASP Isotopes Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the 80% owned Enlightened Isotopes, the 51% owned PET Labs and the 42% owned VIE ASP Rentals. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nCurrency and currency translation\n\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the Company’s reporting currency. The functional currency of ASP Isotopes Inc. and ASP Guernsey is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries ASP South Africa and Quantum Leap Energy South Africa is the South African Rand. The functional currency of the 80% owned Enlighted Isotopes, the 51% owned PET Labs and the 42% owned VIE ASP Rentals is the South African Rand. Adjustments that arise from exchange rate changes on transactions of each group entity denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Assets and liabilities of the entities with functional currency of South African Rand are recorded in South African Rand and translated into the U.S. dollar reporting currency of the Company at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses of the entities with functional currency of South African Rand are recorded in South African Rand and translated into the U.S. dollar reporting currency of the Company at the average exchange rate prevailing during the reporting period. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded separately in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.\n\nConcentration of Credit Risk and other Risks\n\nCash balances maintained at U.S. financial institutions may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limit of $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank for each account ownership category. Although the Company currently believes that the financial institutions with whom it does business, will be able to fulfill their commitments to the Company, there is no assurance that those institutions will be able to continue to do so. The Company has not experienced any credit losses associated with its balances in such accounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\nThe Company's foreign subsidiaries held cash of approximately $2,062,000 and $1,963,000 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which is included in cash on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company's strategic plan does not require the repatriation of foreign cash in order to fund its operations in the U.S., and it is the Company's current intention to indefinitely reinvest its foreign cash outside of the U.S. If the Company were to repatriate foreign cash to the U.S., the Company would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes in accordance with applicable U.S. tax rules and regulations as a result of the repatriation.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value and may include money market funds, U.S. Treasury and U.S. government-sponsored agency securities, corporate debt, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. The Company had cash equivalents of $186,229 in the form of money market funds as of September 30, 2024. The Company had no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023.\n\nSegment Information\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company managed its operations as a single segment, specialist isotopes and related services. Beginning in 2024, primarily as a result of increased business activities of its subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC, the Company has two operating segments: (i) nuclear fuels, and (ii) specialist isotopes and related services.\n\nThe nuclear fuels segment is focused on research and development of technologies and methods used to produce high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) and Lithium-6 for the advanced nuclear fuels target end market.\n\nThe specialist isotopes and related services segment is focused on research and development of technologies and methods used to separate high-value, low-volume isotopes (such as C-14, Mo-100 and Si-28) for highly specialized target end markets other than advanced nuclear fuels, including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, nuclear medical imaging and semiconductors, as well as services related to these isotopes, and this segment includes PET Labs.\n\nThe financial information is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources. The Company’s CODM is its chief executive officer.\n\nThe Company manages assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as the assets are shared or commingled. Therefore, the chief operating decision maker does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, asset information is not reported on a segment basis.\n\n11\n\nSelect information from the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n\nRevenues | Net Loss Before Allocation to Noncontrolling Interest  \n---|---  \nThree Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30,  \nSegment | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nSpecialist isotopes and related services | $ | 1,087,695 | $ | — | $ | (3,722,764 | ) | $ | (4,222,483 | )  \nNuclear fuels | — | — | (3,632,625 | ) | —  \n$ | 1,087,695 | $ | — | $ | (7,355,389 | ) | $ | (4,222,483 | )  \n  \nSelect information from the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n\nRevenues | Net Loss Before Allocation to Noncontrolling Interest  \n---|---  \nNine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30,  \nSegment | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nSpecialist isotopes and related services | $ | 2,950,348 | $ | — | $ | (14,637,771 | ) | $ | (12,123,907 | )  \nNuclear fuels | — | — | (8,563,904 | ) | —  \n$ | 2,950,348 | $ | — | $ | (23,201,675 | ) | $ | (12,123,907 | )  \n  \nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nAccounting guidance defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the accounting guidance establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\n\nLevel 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\n\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\n\nThe Company’s share liability (Note 12) is measured as a Level 1 fair value on a recurring basis. There was no share liability as of December 31, 2023. The Company’s share liability was $416,652 as of September 30, 2024. The Company’s convertible notes payable (Note 6) is measured as a Level 3 fair value on a recurring basis and was $31,778,742 as of September 30, 2024. There were no transfers among Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 categories in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The following table provides a reconciliation of the Company’s liabilities measured as a Level 3 at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs:\n\nConvertible Notes Payable  \n---  \nBalance as of December 31, 2023 | —  \nFair value at issuance | 26,558,143  \nFair value adjustment | 5,220,599  \nSettlement of liability | —  \nBalance as of September 30, 2024 | $ | 31,778,742  \n  \nThe carrying amounts of accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes payable are considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the short-term nature of those instruments.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe Company’s revenue relates to PET Labs, in which the Company acquired 51% ownership on October 31, 2023 (Note 11). The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). The Company enters into transactions with radiopharmacy companies that are within the scope of ASC 606. The terms of these transactions include payment for delivery of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning in South Africa.\n\nUnder ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.\n\nThe Company evaluates a transaction’s performance obligations to determine if promised goods or services in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and are considered distinct when (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources and (ii) the promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. In assessing whether promised goods or services are distinct, the Company considers whether the goods or services are integral or dependent to other goods or services in the contract.\n\nThe Company determines the transaction price based on the agreed government rates for the promised goods in the contract.\n\n12\n\nThe consideration is recognized as revenue when control is transferred for the related goods.\n\nThe Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The Company receives payments from its customers based on billing schedules established in each contract. Upfront payments and fees are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt or when due until the Company performs its obligations under these arrangements. Amounts are recorded as accounts receivable when the Company’s right to consideration is unconditional.\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nAccounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. An allowance for expected credit losses is estimated for those accounts receivable considered to be uncollectible based upon historical experience and management's evaluation of outstanding accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for expected credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable, and changes in such are classified as selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company assesses collectability by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when the Company identifies specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, the Company considers historical collectability based on past due status and make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. The Company also considers customer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Bad debts are written off against the allowance when identified. As of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023 there was no allowance for expected credit losses.\n\nInventory\n\nThe Company uses the first in, first out inventory method to account for its inventory. As of September 30, 2024, inventory consists of raw materials and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. There was no inventory as of December 31, 2023.\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment include costs of assets constructed, purchased or leased under a finance lease, related delivery and installation costs and interest incurred on significant capital projects during their construction periods. Expenditures for renewals and betterments also are capitalized, but expenditures for normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with yearly planned major maintenance are generally deferred and amortized over 12 months or until the same major maintenance activities must be repeated, whichever is shorter. The cost and accumulated depreciation applicable to assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts, and gains or losses thereon are included in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss.\n\nThe Company assigns the useful lives of its property and equipment based upon its internal engineering estimates, which are reviewed periodically. The estimated useful lives of the Company's property and equipment range from 3 to 10 years, or the shorter of the useful life or remaining life of the lease for leasehold improvements. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method.\n\nConstruction in progress (Note 4) is carried at cost and consists of specifically identifiable direct and indirect development and construction costs. While under construction, costs of the property are included in construction in progress until the property is placed in service, at which time costs are transferred to the appropriate property and equipment account, including, but not limited to, leasehold improvements or other such accounts.\n\nProperty and equipment acquired in the acquisition of PET Labs was measured at fair value on October 31, 2023. The fair value forms the new basis of these assets and is depreciated over the remaining estimated useful lives of the related assets.\n\nBusiness Combination and Asset Acquisitions\n\nThe Company evaluates acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions to assess whether or not the transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition by first applying a screen to determine if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If the screen is met, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If the screen is not met, further determination is required as to whether or not the Company has acquired inputs and processes that have the ability to create outputs, which would meet the requirements of a business. If determined to be a business combination, the Company accounts for the transaction under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805 Business Combinations (\"ASC 805\"), which requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the fair value of all assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and establishes the acquisition date as the fair value measurement point. Accordingly, the Company recognizes assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including contingent assets and liabilities, and non-controlling interest in the acquiree based on the fair value estimates as of the date of acquisition. In accordance with ASC 805, the Company recognizes and measures goodwill as of the acquisition date, as the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identified net assets acquired.\n\nThe consideration for the Company’s business acquisitions may include future payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of a particular event or events. The obligations for such contingent consideration payments are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. The contingent consideration obligations are then evaluated each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, other than changes due to payments, are recognized as a gain or loss and recorded within change in the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration liabilities in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\n\nIf determined to be an asset acquisition, the Company accounts for the transaction under ASC 805-50, which requires the acquiring entity in an asset acquisition to recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the cost to the acquiring entity on a relative fair value basis, which includes transaction costs in addition to consideration given. No gain or loss is recognized as of the date of acquisition unless the fair value of non-cash assets given as consideration differs from the assets’ carrying amounts on the acquiring entity’s books. Consideration transferred that is non-cash will be measured based on either the cost (which shall be measured based on the fair value of the consideration given) or the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever is more reliably measurable. Goodwill is not recognized in an asset acquisition and any excess consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated to the identifiable assets based on relative fair values.\n\n13\n\nContingent consideration payments in asset acquisitions are recognized when the contingency is resolved and the consideration is paid or becomes payable (unless the contingent consideration meets the definition of a derivative, in which case the amount becomes part of the basis in the asset acquired). Upon recognition of the contingent consideration payment, the amount is included in the cost of the acquired asset or group of assets.\n\nGoodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the amount of consideration paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired as a result of the Company’s business acquisitions accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized and is subject to impairment testing at a reporting unit level on an annual basis or when a triggering event occurs that may indicate the carrying value of the goodwill is impaired. An entity is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. Further testing is only required if the entity determines, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company will perform its annual test for goodwill as of October 31.\n\nVariable Interest Entities\n\nThe Company accounts for the investments it makes in certain legal entities in which equity investors do not have (1) sufficient equity at risk for the legal entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or (2) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk do not have either the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the legal entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance, or (3) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the legal entity or the right to receive expected residual returns of the legal entity. These certain legal entities are referred to as “variable interest entities” or “VIEs.”\n\nThe Company would consolidate the results of any such entity in which it determined that it had a controlling financial interest. The Company would have a “controlling financial interest” in such an entity if the Company had both the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb the losses of, or right to receive benefits from, the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE. On a quarterly basis, the Company will reassess whether it has a controlling financial interest in any investments it has in these certain legal entities.\n\nConvertible Notes Payable\n\nConvertible notes payable are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments (\"ASC 825\"). Upon issuance the Company has elected the fair value option to account for the convertible notes payable. Changes in fair value during the reporting period are recognized in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.\n\nLeases\n\nLeases are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases (\"ASC 842\"). At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on specific facts and circumstances, the existence of an identified asset(s), if any, and the Company’s control over the use of the identified asset(s), if applicable. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets are recorded based on the present value of future lease payments over the expected lease term. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As such, the Company will utilize the incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment, and considering the region in which the ROU asset and liabilities are located.\n\nThe Company has elected to combine lease and non-lease components as a single component. Operating leases are recognized on the balance sheet as ROU lease assets, lease liabilities current and lease liabilities non-current. Fixed rents are included in the calculation of the lease balances, while variable costs paid for certain operating and pass-through costs are excluded. Lease expense is recognized over the expected term on a straight-line basis.\n\nFinance leases are recognized on the balance sheet as property and equipment, finance lease liabilities current and finance lease liabilities non-current. Finance lease ROU assets and the related lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. The finance lease ROU assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term with the related interest expense of the lease liability payment recognized over the lease term using the effective interest method.\n\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\n\nLong-lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment. The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. The Company did not recognize any impairment losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.\n\nResearch and Development Costs\n\nResearch and development costs consist primarily of fees paid to consultants, license fees and facilities costs. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Costs\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, including stock-based compensation expense, related to the Company's executive, finance, business development, legal, human resources and support functions. Other\n\n14\n\ngeneral and administrative expenses include professional fees for auditing, tax, consulting and patent-related services, rent and utilities and insurance.\n\nStock-based Compensation Expense\n\nStock-based compensation expense represents the cost of the grant date fair value of employee stock awards recognized over the requisite service period of the awards (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis. The Company estimates the fair value of each stock-based award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model incorporates various assumptions, such as the value of the underlying common stock, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield, and expected life of the options. Forfeitures are recognized as a reduction of stock-based compensation expense as they occur.\n\nThe Company also awards restricted stock to employees and directors. Restricted stock is generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the completion of the vesting restrictions. The Company expenses the cost of the restricted stock, which is determined to be the fair market value of the shares of common stock underlying the restricted stock at the date of grant, ratably over the period during which the vesting restrictions lapse.\n\nStock-based compensation expense is classified in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the same manner in which the award recipients’ payroll costs are classified or in which the award recipients’ service payments are classified.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences associated with differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as measured by the enacted tax rates, which are expected to be in effect when these differences reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\n\nPrior to the acquisition of 51% of PET Labs in October 2023, the Company had generated net losses since inception and accordingly had not recorded a provision for income taxes. Subsequent to the acquisition of 51% of PET Labs, the Company records the provision for income taxes for the activity from PET Labs operations.\n\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10, Uncertainty in Income Taxes, or ASC 740-10. The Company has not recognized a liability for any uncertain tax positions. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits has not been provided since there is no unrecognized benefit since the date of adoption. The Company has not recognized interest expense or penalties as a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10. If there were an unrecognized tax benefit, the Company would recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in income tax expense.\n\nThe Company has identified the United States, South Africa and Guernsey as its major tax jurisdictions. Refer to Note 15 for further details.\n\nComprehensive Loss\n\nComprehensive loss is defined as a change in equity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. The Company’s comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and the effect of currency translation adjustments.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThe Company has reviewed recently issued accounting pronouncements and plans to adopt those that are applicable to it. The Company does not expect the adoption of any recently issued pronouncements to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position.\n\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU\") 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (\"ASU 2023-07\"). ASU 2023-07 will improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses on an interim and annual basis. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s condensed financial statements at adoption date.\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (“ASU 2024-03”) and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. ASU 2024-03 requires disclosures about specific types of expenses included in the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement as well as disclosures about selling expenses. The Company is still assessing the impact of adopting this standard.\n\n3. Revenue\n\nIn connection with the Company's acquisition of 51% ownership of PET Labs in October 2023, the Company manufactures and sells nuclear medical doses for PET scanning in South Africa. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized revenue of $1,087,695 and $2,950,348, respectively. Since the acquisition did not occur until October 2023, there is no accounts receivable as of January 1, 2023 and no revenue was recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe following table presents changes in the Company’s accounts receivable for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\n\nBalance as ofDecember 31,2023 | Additions | Deductions | Balance as ofSeptember 30,2024  \n---|---|---|---  \nAccounts receivable | $ | 216,504 | $ | 2,950,348 | $ | (2,606,423 | ) | $ | 560,429  \n  \n15\n\n4.

The Company is currently building two other plants in Pretoria, South Africa: a multi-isotope plant and a laser isotope separation plan using quantum enrichment technology. Costs incurred for the other two plants are considered construction in progress because the work is not complete as of September 30, 2024. Costs incurred for the plants as of December 31, 2023 are considered construction in progress. There was no depreciation expense as it relates to the construction in progress for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Notes Payable\n\nConvertible Notes Payable\n\nIn March 2024, the Company issued convertible notes payable (“March 2024 Convertible Notes”) totaling $21,063,748 and received aggregate cash of $20,550,000. One of the notes totaling $513,748 was issued to the placement agent in lieu of cash issuance costs. Issuance costs paid in cash totaling $521,423 and the value of the note issued upon issuance to the placement agent were expensed in selling, general and administrative costs in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nIn June 2024, the Company issued additional convertible notes payable (“June 2024 Convertible Notes”) totaling $5,494,395 and received aggregate cash of $5,386,228. One of the notes totaling $108,167 was issued to the placement agent in lieu of cash issuance costs and was expensed in selling, general and administrative costs in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Issuance costs paid in cash were negligible. The March 2024 Convertible Notes and the June 2024 Convertible Notes are collectively the “Convertible Notes”.\n\nThe Convertible Notes are payable on demand in March 2029 and bear an annual interest rate of 6% through March 7, 2025 and 8% thereafter. Upon a qualified financing event the Convertible Notes convert into the shares issued in that qualified financing event at a price per share equal to 80% of the share price issued subject to a valuation cap. Upon a qualified transaction, the noteholders may elect to receive either 1.5x the principal and accrued interest balance in cash or convert into common shares.\n\nThe Convertible Notes are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet at their fair values. The fair value of the March Convertible Notes on the date of issuance was $21,063,748. The fair value of the June Convertible Notes on the date of issuance was $5,494,395. The fair value of the Convertible Notes as of September 30, 2024 has been determined to be $31,778,742 and the resultant change in fair value of $5,220,599 has been recorded in other income and expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The resultant change in fair value for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of $2,692,073 has been recorded in other income and expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The fair value of the Convertible Notes as of June 30, 2024 has been determined to be $29,086,669 and the resultant change in fair value of $2,528,526 has been recorded in other income and expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations comprehensive loss for the six months ended June 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the total principal and accrued interest of the Convertible Notes is $27,380,563 of which $822,420 is from the interest.\n\nPromissory Note Payable\n\nDuring 2021, the Company executed a promissory note payable with an aggregate principal balance of $33,500 (25,000 GBP). The note was due after a period of two months, followed by mutually agreed upon monthly extensions, and does not bear interest. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the promissory note payable balance was $33,446 and $31,827, respectively, and continues to be automatically extended on a monthly basis.\n\nIn November 2023, the Company executed a promissory note payable with a finance company to fund its directors and officers insurance policy for $526,282. This note bore interest at an annual rate of 8.74% with six monthly payments beginning in December \n\n16\n\n2023. The note was repaid in full in May 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded interest expense of $11,247. As of December 31, 2023, the promissory note payable balance was $438,569.\n\n7. Deferred Revenues\n\nIn June 2023, the Company entered into a Supply Agreement with a customer for the delivery of Molybdenum-100 and Molybdenum-98 beginning in 2024. In conjunction with the Supply Agreement, the Company received $882,000 in September 2023, as an advance towards future revenue. The Company has recorded $882,000 as deferred revenue on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. There was no deferred revenue recorded as of January 1, 2023 and September 30, 2023.\n\n8. Commitments and Contingencies\n\nPurchase of Cyclotron\n\nIn November 2023, the cyclotron that the Company ordered was shipped. As of December 31, 2023, the equipment had not been delivered; however, the Company was obligated to purchase this equipment and recorded the full cost of $1,653,000 in other noncurrent assets and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023.\n\nIn March 2024, the cyclotron was received by the Company and is recorded as property and equipment. The financing company has paid the vendor. The Company financed the cost of this equipment and it is recorded in finance lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024.\n\nKlydon Proprietary Limited\n\nIn November 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with Klydon Proprietary Limited (“Klydon”) to design and build a plant to enrich Molybdenum in South Africa (the \"Turnkey Contract\"). The initial phase of the project included the building of a plant that can support the production of at least 5kgs of Mo-100. The contracted cost for this phase was $6,800,000. The second phase of the project included the production to be increased to 20kgs of Mo-100 with an additional cost of $6,000,000.\n\nKlydon performed a portion of the services required under the Turnkey Contract; however, some services were incomplete and many of the services were not completed within the time frame required. As a result, Klydon and ASP South Africa entered into an Acknowledgement of Debt Agreement dated November 30, 2022, whereby Klydon (i) agreed to pledge its assets (the “Pledged Assets”) to ASP South Africa to secure its performance of the Turnkey Contract by December 31, 2022, and (ii) acknowledged that ASP South Africa would suffer damages in the amount of $6,050,000 (“Damage Amount”) should it fail to perform. Under the Acknowledgement of Debt Agreement, the Pledged Assets would serve as collateral for Klydon’s obligation to pay the Damage Amount should Klydon fail to perform. In connection therewith, also on November 30, 2022, ASP South Africa and Klydon entered into a Deed of Security Agreement whereby, if Klydon failed to complete its obligations under the Turnkey Contract by December 31, 2022, all of Klydon’s rights of any nature to and interests of any nature in the Pledged Assets would be transferred to ASP South Africa. Klydon failed to complete its obligations under the Turnkey Contract by December 31, 2022, however, the Company did not perfect its interests in the assets until April 4, 2023. The Company did not believe that the amounts owed by Klydon were realizable, nor did the Company know the timing of any recovery payments. Therefore, a loss recovery receivable was not recorded at any time prior to April 4, 2023.\n\nOn April 4, 2023, the Company perfected its interest under the Acknowledgement of Debt Agreement, pursuant to which the Company acquired certain intellectual property from Klydon (“Klydon Settlement”). In addition, the Company acquired Klydon's interest in four entities which are inactive and in the process of being dissolved. The Company has concluded that the Klydon Settlement is accounted for as an asset acquisition under ASC 805 since the assets acquired were concentrated in a single identifiable asset from a related party. In conjunction with the Klydon Settlement, the Company recorded an increase to additional paid-in capital for the settlement of all liabilities owed to Klydon at the time of settlement totaling $626,223.\n\nTwo individuals who are officers and board members of Klydon, one who is now an officer of ASP Isotopes Inc. and the other who is now a scientific advisor of ASP Isotopes Inc., received warrants to purchase common stock of the Company and therefore are considered related parties. See Notes 10 and 12.\n\nShare Purchase Agreement relating to PET Labs\n\nOn October 31, 2023, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Nucleonics Imaging Proprietary Limited, a company incorporated in the Republic of South Africa (the “Seller”), relating to the purchase and sale of ordinary shares in the issued share capital of Pet Labs. PET Labs is a South African radiopharmaceutical operations company, dedicated to nuclear medicine and the science of radiopharmaceutical production.\n\nUnder the Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to purchase from the Seller 51 ordinary shares in the issued share capital of PET Labs (the “Initial Sale Shares”) (representing 51% of the issued share capital of PET Labs) and has an option to purchase from the Seller the remaining 49 ordinary shares in the issued share capital of PET Labs (the “Option Shares”) (representing the remaining 49% of the issued share capital of PET Labs). The Company agreed to pay to the Seller an aggregate of $2,000,000 for the Initial Sale Shares, of which aggregate amount of $500,000 was payable on the completion of the sale of the Initial Sale Shares and $1,500,000 is payable on demand after one calendar year from the agreement date. In January 2024, the Company agreed to pay $264,750 to the Seller. The balance due for the Initial Sale Shares as of September 30, 2024 is $1,235,250 and is recorded in other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. If the Company exercises its option to purchase the Option Shares (which option is exercisable from the agreement date until January 31, 2027, provided that the Initial Sale Shares have been paid for in full), the Company has agreed to pay $2,200,000 for the Option Shares.\n\nPET Labs Global\n\nIn August 2024, PET Labs Global entered into a three-year service agreement with Cayman Enterprise City and is licensed to operate from within the Cayman Islands’ Special Economic Zone (“SEZ”). The service fee includes among other things the right to use certain office space and associated facilities within the SEZ. The Company has applied the guidance in ASC 842 and determined that this agreement is not a leasing arrangement. Management has determined that based on the nature of the combined services the expense\n\n17\n\nshould be recognized as incurred. The Company recorded fees under this agreement totaling $10,583 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nContingencies\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. The Company accrues liabilities for such matters when future expenditures are probable and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated.\n\nOn October 25, 2022, the Company received a letter from a law firm acting on behalf of Norsk medisinsk syklotronsenter AS (“NMS”), asserting, among other things, that the grant of a license to the ASP technology to the Company by Klydon violates a pre-existing exclusive sub-license to the ASP technology granted to Radfarma. The asserted claims, arbitration and/or litigation could include claims against the Company, the Company’s licensor (Klydon), or Klydon’s present or former sub-licensors alleging infringement of intellectual property rights with respect to the ASP technology on which our company relies. The Company recorded legal costs totaling $78,304 which was paid to Klydon’s attorneys to settle this claim. As of December 31, 2023, Radfarma has relinquished all claims and ASP Isotopes owns the rights to the licenses originally held by Klydon and acquired by ASP Isotopes.\n\n9. Leases\n\nThe Company accounts for facility leases in accordance with ASC 842 (Note 2). The Company is party to five facility leases in South Africa for office, manufacturing and laboratory space.\n\nA lease for office and laboratory space in Pretoria, South Africa commenced in October 2021 with the initial term set to expire in December 2030. The Company has applied the guidance in ASC 842 and has determined that it should be classified as an operating lease. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate for this lease is 7.5% based on the remaining lease term of the applicable lease. Consequently, a ROU lease asset of $952,521 with a corresponding lease liability of $952,521 based on the present value of the minimum rental payments of such lease was recorded at the inception of the lease.\n\nA lease for additional production space in Pretoria, South Africa commenced in April 2023 with the initial term set to expire in March 2024. Effective February 1, 2024, this lease was amended such that the new term begins on February 1, 2024 and expires in February 2026. Prior to the amendment, the Company had applied the guidance in ASC 842 and determined that this lease was a short term lease and expensed the monthly payments as incurred. The Company has applied the guidance in ASC 842 to the amended lease and has determined that it should be classified as an operating lease. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate for this lease is 10.6% based on the lease term of the applicable lease. Consequently, a ROU lease asset of $364,458 with a corresponding lease liability of $364,458 based on the present value of the minimum rental payments of such lease was recorded at the inception of the lease.\n\nA lease for laboratory space in Pretoria, South Africa commenced in November 2023 with the initial term set to expire in October 2026. The Company has applied the guidance in ASC 842 and has determined that it should be classified as an operating lease. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate for this lease is 13.16% based on the remaining lease term of the applicable lease. Consequently, a ROU lease asset of $70,607 with a corresponding lease liability of $70,607 based on the present value of the minimum rental payments of such lease was recorded at the inception of the lease.\n\nA lease for office and production space in Pretoria, South Africa commenced prior to October 31, 2023 with the initial term set to expire in March 2026. The Company has applied the guidance in ASC 842 and has determined that it should be classified as an operating lease effective on the date of ASP Isotopes' acquisition of 51% of PET Labs. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is approximately 12.875% based on the expected remaining lease term of the applicable lease. Consequently, a ROU lease asset of $592,304 which reflects an $84,858 unfavorable adjustment based on the fair value of the lease terms and a corresponding lease liability of $677,163 based on the present value of the minimum rental payments of such lease was recorded at the date of ASP Isotopes acquisition of 51% of PET Labs. Dr. Gerdus Kemp, an officer of PET Labs and an employee of ASP UK, is the sole owner of the facility under this lease agreement.\n\nA summary of long leases in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 is as follows:\n\nROU Asset | Operating Lease Liability - Current | Operating Lease Liability – Non-Current | Total Operating Lease Liability  \n---|---|---|---  \nLease:  \nOffice and laboratory, Pretoria, South Africa | $ | 607,996 | $ | 66,207 | $ | 624,625 | $ | 690,832  \nAdditional production, Pretoria, South Africa | 277,439 | 191,491 | 85,948 | 277,439  \nLaboratory, Pretoria, South Africa | 55,520 | 24,496 | 32,913 | 57,409  \nOffice and production, Pretoria, South Africa | 419,874 | 307,263 | 169,033 | 476,296  \nTotal | $ | 1,360,829 | $ | 589,457 | $ | 912,519 | $ | 1,501,976  \n  \nA summary of long-term leases in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 is as follows:\n\nROU Asset | Operating Lease Liability - Current | Operating Lease Liability – Non-Current | Total Operating Lease Liability  \n---|---|---|---  \nLease:  \nOffice and laboratory, Pretoria, South Africa | $ | 626,548 | $ | 53,504 | $ | 637,348 | $ | 690,852  \nLaboratory, Pretoria, South Africa | 68,089 | 19,608 | 48,805 | 68,413  \nOffice and production, Pretoria, South Africa | 564,064 | 263,452 | 380,494 | 643,946  \nTotal | $ | 1,258,701 | $ | 336,564 | $ | 1,066,647 | $ | 1,403,211  \n  \nA lease for additional production space in Pretoria, South Africa commenced prior to October 31, 2023 with the initial term expiring in March 2024 and the Company is maintaining the lease under the agreed upon monthly extensions.

License Agreements\n\nIn September 2021, ASP South Africa licensed certain intellectual property from Klydon for the development, production distribution, marketing and sale of Mo-100. The license had a term of 999 years, unless terminated earlier by either party under certain provisions. Two individuals who are officers and board members of Klydon received warrants to purchase common stock of the Company (See Note 12). Effective July 26, 2022, the parties agreed to terminate the Mo-100 license, which was superseded and replaced by a new license agreement (described below).\n\nIn January 2022, ASP South Africa licensed certain intellectual property from Klydon for the development, production distribution, marketing and sale of uranium isotope U-235 (“U-235”). The license had a term of 999 years, unless terminated earlier by either party under certain provisions. The Company paid an upfront fee of $100,000, which was expensed to research and development expense. The Company was required to pay a nominal royalty per Kg of product sold plus 10% royalties on product net profits over the term of the contract. One of the officers, who is also a board member of Klydon, became a board member and consultant of ASP Isotopes Inc. and an employee of ASP Guernsey in January 2022. Effective July 26, 2022, the parties agreed to terminate the U-235 license, which was superseded and replaced by a new license agreement (described below).\n\nIn July 2022, ASP UK entered into a license agreement with Klydon, as licensor, pursuant to which ASP Isotopes UK Ltd acquired from Klydon an exclusive license to use, develop, modify, improve, subcontract and sublicense certain intellectual property rights relating to the ASP technology for the production, distribution, marketing and sale of all isotopes produced using the ASP technology (the “Klydon license agreement”). The Klydon license agreement superseded and replaced the Mo-100 license and U-235 license described in Note 8 above. The Klydon license agreement is royalty-free, has a term of 999 years and is worldwide for the development of the ASP technology and the distribution, marketing and sale of isotopes. Future production of isotopes is limited to member countries of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. In connection with the Klydon license agreement the Company agreed to make an upfront payment of $100,000 (to be included within the payments the Company makes under the Turnkey Contract) and deferred payments of $300,000 over 24 months, which was expensed to research and development expense.\n\nIn July 2022, ASP South Africa acquired assets comprising a dormant Silicon-28 aerodynamic separation processing plant from Klydon for ZAR 6,000,000 (which at the then current exchange rate was approximately $354,000), which was recorded to property and equipment, would have been payable to Klydon on the later of 180 days of the acquisition and the date on which the assets generate any revenues of any nature.\n\nOn April 4, 2023, the Company perfected its interest under the Acknowledgement of Debt Agreement (see Note 8), pursuant to which the Company acquired certain intellectual property from Klydon (“Klydon Settlement”). The Company concluded that the Klydon Acquisition is accounted for under ASC 805, Business Combinations as an asset acquisition since the assets acquired were concentrated in a single identifiable asset from a related party. In conjunction with the Klydon Settlement, the Company recorded an increase to additional paid-in capital for the settlement of all liabilities owed to Klydon at the time of settlement totaling $626,223.\n\n11. Acquisitions\n\nPET Labs\n\nIn October 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of PET Labs. The acquisition is intended to accelerate the distribution of the Company’s pipeline. The acquisition of PET Labs has been accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Company acquired 51% of the common shares issued and outstanding for total purchase consideration of $2,000,000 in cash of which $500,000 was paid up front. In January 2024, the Company made a partial payment of $264,750 and the balance of $1,235,250 is expected to be paid in the second half of 2024 and is recorded in other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.\n\nIn addition to the purchase consideration, the Company has an option to purchase the remaining 49% of the issued and outstanding shares for an agreed consideration totaling $2,200,000. No consideration or value relating to this option was recognized as it was not considered probable at the time of acquisition and as of September 30, 2024.\n\nDr. Gerdus Kemp is an officer of PET Labs and, effective November 1, 2023, an employee of ASP UK. In addition, Dr. Kemp controls the remaining 49% ownership of PET Labs.\n\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed:\n\nConsideration  \n---  \nCash | $ | 500,000  \nPresent value of balance due | 1,395,348  \n$ | 1,895,348  \nRecognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed  \n---  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 378,152  \nAccounts receivable | 460,165  \nOther current assets | 184,457  \nProperty and equipment | 821,926  \nRight of use assets | 592,304  \nFinancial liabilities | (1,248,699 | )  \nRight of use liabilities | (677,163 | )  \nTotal identifiable net assets | 511,142  \nNoncontrolling interest | (1,821,021 | )  \nGoodwill | 3,205,227  \n$ | 1,895,348  \n  \n20\n\nGoodwill arising from the acquisition as of October 31, 2023 of $3,205,227 was attributable mainly to buyer specific synergies expected to arise from the acquisition. No goodwill from this acquisition is deductible for income tax purposes.\n\nThe Company considered the contractual value of accounts receivable to be the same as the fair value and the full amount was collected.\n\nThe results of PET Labs have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition.\n\nThe Company accounts for business combinations in accordance with ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805), which requires an acquirer to retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination during the measurement period (which represents a period not to exceed one year from the date of the acquisition), in the reporting period in which the adjustment is determined, as well as present separately on the face of the income statement or as a disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.\n\nThe changes to the carrying value of goodwill is as follows:\n\nBalance as of October 31, 2023 (acquisition date) | $ | 3,205,227  \n---|---|---  \nTranslation adjustment | 61,876  \nBalance as of December 31, 2023 | 3,267,103  \nTranslation adjustment | 194,356  \nBalance as of September 30, 2024 | $ | 3,461,459  \n  \nASP Rentals\n\nIn December 2023, ASP South Africa entered into a Shareholders Agreement (“ASP Rentals Shareholders Agreement”) with ASP Rentals, a newly formed equipment financing service provider formed for the sole purpose of providing financing to ASP South Africa for its significant asset purchases in South Africa. In accordance with the terms of the ASP Rentals Shareholders Agreement, ASP Rentals issued 24% of its capital stock to ASP South Africa for total consideration of ZAR 3,300,829 (which at the exchange rate as of December 31, 2023 was $180,387) and the remaining 76% of its capital stock was issued to two third party entities for combined consideration of ZAR 13,203,317 (which at the exchange rate as of December 31, 2023 was $721,548). \n\nIn June 2024, ASP Rentals issued additional capital stock to support additional financing to ASP South Africa and PET Labs. Per the terms of the ASP Rentals Shareholder Agreement, ASP Rentals issued 20% of the new capital to ASP South Africa for total consideration of ZAR 3,671,412 (which at the exchange rate as of June 30, 2024 was $201,994) and the remaining 80% of the new capital to one of the two original third party entities for a combined consideration of ZAR 18,357,063 (which at the exchange rate as of June 30, 2024 was $1,009,969).\n\nIn August 2024, ASP Rentals issued additional capital stock to support additional financing to PET Labs.

ASP South Africa will only be entitled to dividend distributions upon the two third party entities receiving a designated return on their investment.\n\nIn conjunction with the ASP Rental Shareholders Agreement, ASP South Africa and PET Labs have both entered into an Asset Sale Agreement and an Asset Rental Agreement with ASP Rentals in order to facilitate the financing of equipment recently purchased by ASP South Africa and PET Labs. As a result of the transactions contemplated by these agreements, collectively, ASP Rentals is considered a variable interest entity. In addition, since the only function of ASP Rentals is to provide financing to ASP South Africa and PET Labs, ASP Isotopes is considered to be the primary beneficiary of ASP Rentals. Therefore, ASP Rentals has been consolidated in accordance with ASC 810.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the ASP Rentals Shareholders Agreement, as of December 31, 2023 ASP South Africa was obligated to acquire and ASP Rentals was obligated to issue 24% of the common shares of ASP Rentals to be issued and outstanding for total purchase consideration of ZAR 3,300,829 (which at the exchange rate as of December 31, 2023 was $180,387).

As of September 30, 2024, 2,100,000 shares remain available for future grant under the 2024 Plan.\n\nStock Options\n\nThe following table sets forth the activity for the Company’s stock options during the periods presented:\n\nNumber ofOptions | Weighted-AverageExercise Priceper Share | WeightedAverageRemainingContractualTerm (in Years) | AggregateIntrinsicValue  \n---|---|---|---  \nOutstanding as of December 31, 2023 | 2,766,000 | $ | 1.91 | 8.4 | $ | 231,000  \nGranted | — | $ | —  \nForfeited | (35,000 | ) | $ | 2.00  \nOutstanding as of September 30, 2024 | 2,731,000 | $ | 1.90 | 7.6 | $ | 2,392,680  \nExercisable as of September 30, 2024 | 2,174,302 | $ | 1.88 | 7.6 | $ | 1,957,708  \nVested or expected to vest as of September 30, 2024 | 2,731,000 | $ | 1.90 | 7.6 | $ | 2,392,680  \n  \nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, no options were granted.\n\n24\n\nThe Company recorded stock-based compensation expense from options of $196,987 and $207,253 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense from options of $588,018 and $773,238 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, there was $661,361 of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock-based compensation arrangements granted under the Plan, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 0.7 years.\n\nStock Awards\n\nIn October 2021, the Company issued 1,500,000 shares of restricted common stock to its Chief Executive Officer. The number of shares that vest is dependent on achieving certain performance conditions and dependent market conditions upon the third anniversary from the date of grant. The Company determined that the fair value of this award was $0.25 per share for a total value of $375,000. The Company determined the performance condition probable and recognized stock-based compensation expense of $375,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company recorded stock-based compensation expense from stock awards totaling $1,871,103 and $1,864,537 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense from stock awards totaling $5,711,742 and $5,817,338 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, there is $7,425,197 of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the non-vested portion of restricted stock awards that is expected to be recognized over the next year.\n\nThe following table summarizes vesting of restricted common stock:\n\nNumber ofShares | WeightedAverage GrantDate Fair ValuePer Share  \n---|---  \nUnvested as of December 31, 2023 | 4,489,186 | $ | 1.42  \nGranted | 2,078,466 | $ | 2.23  \nVested | (2,503,420 | ) | $ | 1.33  \nForfeited and retired | (325,000 | ) | $ | 1.19  \nUnvested as of September 30, 2024 | 3,739,232 | $ | 2.05  \n  \nStock-based Compensation Expense\n\nStock-based compensation expense for all stock awards recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss is as follows:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nSelling, general and administrative | $ | 1,985,471 | $ | 1,978,904 | $ | 6,052,357 | $ | 6,311,890  \nResearch and development | 82,619 | 92,886 | 247,403 | 278,686  \nTotal | $ | 2,068,090 | $ | 2,071,790 | $ | 6,299,760 | $ | 6,590,576  \n  \n14. Net Loss Per Share\n\nThe Company has reported losses since inception and has computed basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding for the period, without consideration for potentially dilutive securities. The Company computes diluted net loss per share of Common Stock after giving consideration to all potentially dilutive shares of common stock, including options to purchase common stock and warrants to purchase common stock, outstanding during the period determined using the treasury-stock and if-converted methods, except where the effect of including such securities would be antidilutive. Because the Company has reported net losses since inception, these potential shares of Common Stock have been anti-dilutive and basic and diluted loss per share were the same for all periods presented.\n\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nNumerator:  \nNet loss attributable to ASP Isotopes Inc. shareholders before deemed dividend on warrant to purchase common stock | $ | (7,271,239 | ) | $ | (4,222,483 | ) | $ | (23,152,249 | ) | $ | (12,123,907 | )  \nDeemed dividend on warrant to purchase common stock | — | — | (2,779,659 | ) | —  \nNet loss attributable to ASP Isotopes Inc. shareholders | $ | (7,271,239 | ) | $ | (4,222,483 | ) | $ | (25,931,908 | ) | $ | (12,123,907 | )  \nDenominator:  \nWeighted average common stock outstanding, basic and diluted | 61,532,172 | 31,147,749 | 51,779,067 | 29,954,321  \nNet loss per share, basic and diluted | $ | (0.12 | ) | $ | (0.14 | ) | $ | (0.50 | ) | $ | (0.40 | )  \n  \n25\n\nThe following table sets forth the potentially dilutive securities that have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because to include them would be anti-dilutive:\n\nAs of September 30,  \n---  \n2024 | 2023  \nOptions to purchase common stock | 2,731,000 | 2,814,333  \nWarrants to purchase common stock | 1,446,519 | 3,386,076  \nUnvested restricted stock | 3,739,232 | 6,415,874  \nTotal shares of common stock equivalents | 7,916,751 | 12,616,283  \n  \n15. Income Taxes\n\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.2%. The Company had no income tax expense due to operating losses incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as the Company had a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset. The effective tax rate for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 varied from the federal statutory rate primarily due to losses in jurisdictions for which a valuation allowance is recorded.\n\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.2%. The Company had no income tax expense due to operating losses incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as the Company had a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 varied from the federal statutory rate primarily due to losses in jurisdictions for which a valuation allowance is recorded.\n\nThe Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized. The Company’s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company had no accrual for interest and penalties on the Company’s balance sheets and has not recognized interest and/or penalties in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. As of September 30, 2024, there were no uncertain tax positions.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company did not recognize any interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits. Due to net operating losses incurred, tax years from inception remain open to examination by the Federal and State taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. The Company is not currently under Internal Revenue Services (IRS), state or local tax examination.\n\nOwnership changes, as defined in the IRC, may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income pursuant to IRC Section 382 or similar provisions. Subsequent ownership changes could further affect the limitation in future years. The Company has not completed a study to assess whether a change of control has occurred or whether there have been multiple changes of control since the Company’s formation due to the significant complexity and cost associated with such study and because there could be additional changes in control in the future. As a result, the Company is not able to estimate the effect of the change in control, if any, on the Company’s ability to utilize net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards in the future.\n\n16. Subsequent Events\n\nThe Company has evaluated subsequent events through November 13, 2024, the date on which the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements were issued and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that require disclosure except as noted in Note 12.\n\n26\n\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the section entitled “Risk Factors,” our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. You should carefully read the section entitled “Risk Factors” to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward- looking statements. Please also see the section entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”\n\nOverview\n\nWe are a development stage advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes that, if successful, will allow for the enrichment of natural isotopes into higher concentration products, which could be used in several industries. Our proprietary technology, the Aerodynamic Separation Process (“ASP technology”), originally developed by Klydon Proprietary Ltd (“Klydon”), is designed to enable the production of isotopes used in several industries. Our initial focus is on the production and commercialization of enriched Carbon-14 (“C-14”), Molybdenum-100 (“Mo-100”) and Silicon-28 (“Si-28”). We have completed an isotope enrichment plant for the enrichment of C-14 located in Pretoria, South Africa and we expect to start commercial supply of C-14 in the first quarter of 2025 assuming timely delivery of the feedstock from the Company’s customer. We anticipate completion and commissioning of a multi-isotope enrichment plant in Pretoria, South Africa in the fourth quarter of 2024, and we expect to start initial commercial supply of Si-28 in early 2025. In addition, we have started planning additional isotope enrichment plants. We believe the C-14 we may produce using the ASP technology could be used in the development of new pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. We believe the Mo-100 we may produce using the ASP technology could have significant potential advantages for use in the preparation of nuclear imaging agents by radiopharmacies and others in the medical industry. We believe the Si-28 we may produce using the ASP technology may be used to create advanced semiconductors and in quantum computing. In addition, we are considering the future development of the ASP technology for the separation of Zinc-68, Xenon-129/136 for potential use in the healthcare end market, Germanium 70/72/74 for possible use in the semiconductor end market, and Chlorine -37 for potential use in the nuclear energy end market.\n\nWe are also developing Quantum Enrichment technology to produce enriched Ytterbium-176 (“Yb-176”), Nickel-64, Lithium 6, Lithium7 and Uranium-235 (“U-235”). Quantum enrichment is an advanced isotope enrichment technique that is currently in development that uses lasers. We believe that the U-235 we may produce using quantum enrichment technology may be commercialized as a nuclear fuel component for use in the new generation of HALEU- fueled small modular reactors that are now under development for commercial and government uses. The construction of our first quantum enrichment facility was completed in August 2024, and we produced the first semi-finished material of enriched Yb-176 during the commissioning phase of the plant in October 2024. We expect to be able to achieve a 99.75% enrichment for Yb-176 and offer highly enriched Yb-176 for commercial sale during 2025. We also expect to proceed with the plans to construct Nickel-64 and Lithium- 6/7 quantum enrichment plants with targeted production during 2025.\n\nOur Subsidiaries\n\nWe operate principally through our subsidiaries. ASP Isotopes Guernsey Limited (the holding company for subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands, South Africa, Iceland and the United Kingdom) is focused on the development and commercialization of high-value, low-volume isotopes for highly specialized end markets (such as C-14, Mo-100, and Si-28). ASP Isotopes UK Ltd is the owner of our technology.\n\nIn September 2023, we formed Quantum Leap Energy LLC, or “QLE,” which also has subsidiaries in the United Kingdom (Quantum Leap Energy Limited) and South Africa (Quantum Leap Energy (Pty) Limited), to focus on the development and commercialization of advanced nuclear fuels such as HALEU and Lithium-6.\n\nIn addition, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into a strategic relationship with Pet Labs Pharmaceuticals (Pty) Limited (PET Labs) by acquiring a 51% ownership stake in PET Labs. We anticipate this transaction will allow us to enter the downstream medical isotope production and distribution market. Beginning in 2024, primarily as a result of the increased business activities of QLE, we have two operating segments: (i) nuclear fuels, and (ii) specialist isotopes and related services.\n\nAlthough no assurance can be given, we plan to spin-out QLE as a separate public company and list the shares of QLE on a U.S. national exchange and distribute a portion of QLE’s common equity to ASPI’s stockholders as of a to-be-determined future record date, in each case subject to obtaining applicable approvals and consents and complying with applicable rules and regulations and public market trading and listing requirements. The regulatory landscape and supply chain for nuclear fuel production differs significantly from that of medical isotopes, hence we and QLE have different business models and we believe that both companies would benefit if QLE is independently managed and financed.\n\nIn connection with the anticipated spin-out, in February 2024, we entered into a number of agreements with QLE, including a License Agreement, pursuant to which QLE has licensed from us the rights to technologies and methods used to separate Uranium 235 and Lithium 6 (including but not limited to the quantum enrichment and ASP technologies) in exchange for a perpetual royalty in the amount of 10% of all future QLE revenues, and an EPC Services Framework Agreement, pursuant to which we will provide services for the engineering, procurement and construction of one or more turnkey Uranium-235 and Lithium-6 enrichment facilities in locations to be identified by QLE and owned or leased by QLE, and commissioning, start-up and test services for each such facility, subject to the receipt of all applicable regulatory approvals, permits, licenses, authorizations, registrations, certificates, consents, orders, variances and similar rights. In addition, in February 2024, we assigned to QLE certain existing memoranda of understanding with U.S.-based small modular reactor companies for the use of Quantum Enrichment for the production of High-Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU). The MOUs provide for substantial financial support for the development of HALEU production facilities that should be capable of supplying metric ton quantities of HALEU by 2027.\n\n27\n\nHigh-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) Production\n\nIn October 2024, we entered into a term sheet with TerraPower, LLC related to the construction of a uranium enrichment facility capable of producing HALEU and the future supply of HALEU to TerraPower. The term sheet contemplates the parties entering into a definitive agreement, pursuant to which TerraPower would provide funding for the construction of a HALEU production facility. In addition, the parties anticipate entering into a long-term supply agreement for HALEU expected to be produced at this facility, pursuant to which the customer would purchase all HALEU produced at the facility over a 10-year period after the expected completion of the facility in 2027. It is anticipated that the definitive agreements will be assigned to QLE. Except for binding periods of exclusivity, during which we will not negotiate with third parties for the supply of HALEU or work on another ASP technology-based uranium enrichment facility, the term sheet is non-binding and there is no assurance that the parties will enter into definitive agreements.\n\nIn November 2024, we entered into a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with The South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (Necsa) to collaborate on the research, development and ultimately the commercial production of advanced nuclear fuels. Necsa is a state-owned company established by the Republic of South Africa Nuclear Energy Act in 1999 with a mandate to undertake and promote research and development in the field of nuclear energy and radiation sciences. Necsa is also responsible for processing source material, and co-operating with other institutions on nuclear and related matters. The proposed structure under discussion for the delivery of the objectives of the MOU contemplates the formation of a new entity in South Africa with a board of directors consisting of at least two representatives from the Company and Necsa. Discussions between the parties during the last three years have focused on advancing new nuclear fuel to cater especially for small modular reactors as a start and eventually the construction of a nuclear fuel facility for the production of HALEU. It is anticipated that the research, development and ultimate construction of a HALEU production facility will take place at Pelindaba in Pretoria, South Africa. Pelindaba is South Africa’s main nuclear research center and is the home of the 20MW research nuclear reactor, SAFARI-1, which over the last several years has become one of the world’s largest suppliers of Molybdenum-99 and other radioisotopes.\n\nFinancings\n\nOn November 15, 2022, we completed an IPO of our common stock and issued and sold 1,250,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $4.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $3.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\n\nIn March 2023, we issued 3,164,557 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $1.58 per share and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,164,557 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $1.75 per share for gross proceeds of $5.0 million. We incurred $506,390 in cash issuance costs and issued warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 221,519 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $1.975 per share to the placement agent with an initial fair value of $179,116.\n\nIn October 2023, we entered into Securities Purchase Agreements with certain institutional and other accredited investors and certain directors of ours to issue and sell an aggregate of 9,952,510 shares of our common stock, for aggregate cash consideration of $9,129,495, as follows: (i) 8,459,093 shares to investors at a purchase price per share of $0.9105, (ii) 1,190,239 shares to investors at a purchase price per share of $0.9548, and (iii) 303,178 shares to directors at a purchase price per share of $0.96. We incurred issuance costs equivalent to 5% of the gross proceeds from new investors which was settled in stock through the issuance of 472,582 shares to the placement agent and additional cash issuance costs totaling $57,083.\n\nIn March 2024, our wholly owned subsidiary Quantum Leap Energy received gross proceeds of $20,550,000 through the issuance of Convertible Promissory Notes with a stated interest rate of 6% for the first year and 8% thereafter. The maturity date of the Convertible Promissory Notes is March 7, 2029. The Convertible Promissory Notes automatically convert into common shares upon Quantum Leap Energy’s closing of an IPO or other qualifying public transaction at 80% of the share price taking into consideration a valuation cap.\n\nIn April 2024, we received approximately $5.5 million from the issuance of 3,164,557 shares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants.\n\nIn July 2024, we issued 13,800,000 in a public offering at a public offering price of $2.50 per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately $32.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.\n\nIn October 2024, a warrant to purchase 151,741 shares of common stock was exercised and the Company received gross proceeds of $299,688.\n\nIn November 2024, the Company issued an additional 2,754,250 shares of common stock in a public offering at a public offering price of $6.75 per share for aggregate gross proceeds totaling approximately $18,600,000. The estimated issuance costs, including commissions and expenses, are expected to be approximately $1,455,000.\n\nAcquisition of 51% of PET Labs\n\nIn October 2023, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Nucleonics Imaging Proprietary Limited, a company incorporated in South Africa, to purchase 51% of the ordinary shares in Nucleonics’ wholly-owned subsidiary, Pet Labs Pharmaceuticals Proprietary Limited (\"Pet Labs\"), a company incorporated in South Africa and dedicated to nuclear medicine and the science of radiopharmaceutical production.\n\nPer the Share Purchase Agreement, we have agreed to pay a total of $2,000,000 for the shares in two installments. The first installment of $500,000 was paid in November 2023. In January 2024, we paid $264,750 towards the balance due. The remaining balance of $1,235,250 is due upon demand any time after October 31, 2024 and is expected to be paid in November 2024.\n\nAcquisition of Assets and Agreements with Klydon\n\nTo date, we have purchased certain assets of Molybdos Proprietary Limited, a South Africa company (Molybdos), and entered into a number of agreements with Klydon (Pty) Limited, a South Africa company (Klydon). Below is a summary of the key terms for our former licenses and other agreements with Klydon.\n\n28\n\nAcquisition of Molybdos Assets. On September 30, 2021, our subsidiary, ASP Isotopes South Africa (Proprietary) Limited (“ASP South Africa”), participated in and was declared the winner of a competitive auction process under Section 45 of the South Africa Consumer Protection Act, 2008 related to the sale and assignment of the assets of Molybdos (the “Molybdos Business Rescue Auction”). On October 12, 2021, ASP South Africa acquired the assets of Molybdos for ZAR 11,000,000 (which at the then current exchange rate was approximately $734,000), plus value added tax (VAT) levied by the government of South Africa at the rate of 15% and auctioneers’ commission at the rate of 10%.\n\nAcquisition of Silicon-28 Plant Assets. On July 26, 2022, we acquired assets comprising a dormant Silicon-28 aerodynamic separation processing plant from Klydon for ZAR 6,000,000 (which at the then current exchange rate was approximately $364,000), which will be payable to Klydon on the later of 180 days of the acquisition and the date on which the assets generate any revenues of any nature.\n\nExclusive Mo-100 License (superseded and replaced by new license (see “Omnibus Klydon License” below)). On September 30, 2021, ASP South Africa, as licensee, entered into a license with Klydon, as licensor, pursuant to which ASP South Africa acquired from Klydon an exclusive license to use, subcontract and sublicense certain intellectual property rights relating to the ASP technology for the development and/or otherwise disposing of the ASP technology and production, distribution, marketing and or sale of Mo-100 isotope produced using the ASP technology (as amended on June 8, 2022, the “Mo-100 license”). The intellectual property rights granted to us through the Mo-100 license included all existing and/or future proprietary rights of Klydon relating to the ASP technology, whether or not such rights have been registered, including the copyright, designs, know-how, patents and trademarks (although Klydon currently has no such patents, patent applications or copyrights). The exclusive Mo-100 license was royalty-free, had a term of 999 years and was for the global development of the ASP Technology and production of the Mo-100 Isotope and global for the distribution, marketing and sale of the Mo-100 Isotope. No upfront or other payment was made or is owed in connection with the Mo-100 license. Klydon had the right to terminate the exclusivity of the Mo-100 license in the event that the licensee ceased carrying on activities of Mo-100 enrichment for a period longer than 24 consecutive months. Klydon had no other rights to terminate the Mo-100 license. Effective July 26, 2022, the parties agreed to terminate the Mo-100 license, which was superseded and replaced by a new license agreement (described under the heading “Omnibus Klydon License” below).\n\nExclusive U-235 License (superseded and replaced by new license (see “Omnibus Klydon License” below)). On January 25, 2022, ASP South Africa, as licensee, entered into a license with Klydon, as licensor, pursuant to which ASP South Africa acquired from Klydon an exclusive license to use, subcontract and sublicense certain intellectual property rights relating to the ASP technology for the development and/or otherwise disposing of the ASP technology and production, distribution, marketing and or sale of U-235 produced using the ASP (as so amended, the “U-235 license”). The intellectual property rights granted to us through the U-235 license included all existing and/or future proprietary rights of Klydon relating to the ASP technology, whether or not such rights have been registered, including the copyright, designs, know-how, patents and trademarks (although Klydon currently has no such patents, patent applications or copyrights). The exclusive U-235 license had a term of 999 years and was for the global development of the ASP technology and production of U-235 and global for the distribution, marketing and sale of U-235. In connection with the U-235 license we made an upfront payment of $100,000 and agreed to pay certain royalties (the greater of $50 per k.g. of U-235 and 10% of profits) and a 33% sublicensing revenue share of any cash consideration we may receive for any sublicenses we may grant. Klydon had the right to terminate the exclusivity of the U-235 license in the event that the licensee ceased carrying on activities of U-235 enrichment for a period longer than 24 consecutive months. Klydon had no other rights to terminate the U-235 license. Effective July 26, 2022, the parties agreed to terminate the U-235 license, which was superseded and replaced by a new license agreement (described under the heading “Omnibus Klydon License” below).\n\nOmnibus Klydon License. On July 26, 2022, ASP Isotopes UK Ltd (\"ASP UK\"), as licensee, entered into a license agreement with Klydon, as licensor, pursuant to which ASP UK acquired from Klydon an exclusive license to use, develop, modify, improve, subcontract and sublicense certain intellectual property rights relating to the ASP technology for the production, distribution, marketing and sale of all isotopes produced using the ASP technology (the “Klydon license agreement”). The intellectual property rights granted to us through the Klydon license agreement included all existing and/or future proprietary rights of Klydon relating to the ASP technology, whether or not such rights have been registered, including the copyright, designs, know-how, patents and trademarks (although Klydon currently has no such patents, patent applications or copyrights). The Klydon license agreement was royalty-free, had a term of 999 years and was worldwide for the development of the ASP technology and the distribution, marketing and sale of isotopes. Future production of isotopes is limited to member countries of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. In connection with the Klydon license agreement, we agreed to make an upfront payment of $100,000 (to be included within the payments we made under the Turnkey Contract (described below) and deferred payments of $300,000 over 24 months. Effective April 4, 2023, pursuant to the Acknowledgement of Debt Agreement described below, we acquired the ASP technology, among other things, from Klydon, and the Klydon license agreement is no longer in effect.\n\nTurnkey Contract.On November 1, 2021, ASP South Africa and Klydon, as the contractor, entered into a contract under which Klydon has been appointed to supply to ASP South Africa a complete turnkey isotope enrichment plant (the “Turnkey Contract”). The activities to be undertaken or performed by Klydon include: taking control of the assets acquired in the Molybdos Business Rescue Auction; the design of an isotope enrichment facility; the supply of components, equipment and labor required for the construction; the installation, testing and commissioning of the isotope enrichment plant; securing all required approvals, regulatory authorizations and other required consents for the operation of the plant; providing training to local ASP Isotopes South Africa (Proprietary) Limited personnel to enable them to operate the plant going forward; and providing warranties in relation to the performance targets of the plant which are required to be met. Klydon was responsible for liaising with the relevant South African authorities, including the South African Non Proliferation Council, the Nuclear Suppliers Group and International Atomic Energy Agency to ensure that the Turnkey Contract and the isotope enrichment plant are compliant with international laws and guidelines.\n\nAcknowledgement of Debt Agreement. Klydon performed a portion of the services required under the Turnkey Contract described above; however, services were incomplete and many of the services were not completed within the time frame required. As a result, Klydon and ASP South Africa entered into an Acknowledgement of Debt Agreement dated November 30, 2022, whereby Klydon (i) agreed to pledge its assets (the “Pledged Assets”) to ASP South Africa to secure its performance of the Turnkey Contract by December 31, 2022, and (ii) acknowledged that ASP South Africa would suffer damages in the amount of $6,050,000 (“Damage Amount”) should it fail to perform. Under the Acknowledgement of Debt Agreement, the Pledged Assets would serve as collateral for Klydon’s obligation to pay the Damage Amount should Klydon fail to perform. In connection therewith, also on November 30, 2022, ASP South Africa and Klydon entered into a Deed of Security Agreement whereby, if Klydon failed to complete its obligations under the Turnkey Contract by December 31, 2022, all of Klydon’s rights of any nature to and interests of any nature in the Pledged Assets would be transferred to ASP South Africa. Klydon failed to complete its obligations under the Turnkey Contract by December 31, 2022.\n\n29\n\nOn April 4, 2023, we perfected our interests in the assets under the Acknowledgement of Debt Agreement, pursuant to which we acquired the Pledged Assets, including certain intellectual property, from Klydon and settled all amounts due to Klydon, including the ZAR 6,000,000 for the acquisition of the Silicon-28 plant assets.\n\nOther Commercial Agreements\n\nBelow is a summary of the key terms of our other commercial agreements.\n\nLease for Molybdenum Processing Plant. On October 12, 2021, ASP South Africa entered into an agreement of lease with the landlord of the facility located at 33 Eland Street, Koedoespoort Industrial, Pretoria where we operate our Molybdenum processing plant where gaseous Molybdenum compound will be treated (which process comprises several stages of compression and expansion during which the product is purified). The term of the lease ends on December 31, 2030.\n\nLease for additional production space. On April 1, 2023, ASP South Africa entered into an agreement of lease with the landlord of facility located in Pretoria where we plan to perform production activities. The initial term of the lease was set to end on March 31, 2024. We entered into a new agreement of lease with the landlord. The terms of the new lease ends on February 28, 2026.\n\nLease for additional laboratory space. On November 1, 2023, ASP South Africa entered into an agreement of lease with the landlord of the facility located in Pretoria where we perform research and development activities. The term of the lease ends on October 30, 2026.\n\nLease for PET Labs operations. Commencing with our acquisition of PET Labs in October 2023, this facility has an initial term set to expire in March 2026 with automatic monthly extensions thereafter. This space is used for office and production activities.\n\nLease for additional PET Labs operations. Commencing with our acquisition of PET Labs in October 2023, this facility had an initial term which expired in December 2023 and is currently under automatic monthly extensions. This space is used for production activities.\n\nPolitical Risk Insurance Policy with Optio Group. On October 25, 2021, ASP Guernsey entered into a contract of insurance to cover against political risk and expropriation, to off-set the risk of events detrimental to the company occurring in the Republic of South Africa for a period of three years. The insurer is Optio Group Limited which is 100% underwritten by one or more syndicates at Lloyd’s of London. The specific risks covered in the policy are: (i) permanent and total abandonment of operations, (ii) deprivation of assets or shareholding, (iii) physical damage due to political violence, (iv) non-transfer or inconvertibility, (v) business interruption, (vi) non-honouring of arbitration award, and (vii) crisis management support. The limit of cover is equal to or in excess of the projected amount of investment required to complete the initial stage of the first planned Molybdenum enrichment plant. The limit of cover is capable of being increased and extended by mutual agreement with the insurer.\n\nComponents of Results of Operations\n\nRevenue\n\nEffective with the acquisition of 51% of PET Labs, the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning.\n\nCost of Goods Sold\n\nCost of goods sold associated with the sale of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning consist of labor, delivery and materials.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nOur operating expenses consist of (i) research and development expenses and (ii) selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of direct and indirect costs incurred in connection with the development activities for our future isotopes.\n\nDirect costs include:\n\n•\n\nexternal research and development expenses; and\n\n•\n\ncosts related to designing the development processes of isotope production.\n\nIndirect costs include:\n\n•\n\npersonnel-related costs, which include salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and other employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel engaged in research and development functions; and\n\n•\n\nfacilities and other various expenses.\n\nResearch and development expenses are recognized as incurred and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods or services are received.\n\nAs described above, Klydon charged us for expenses associated with these research and development functions under the Turnkey Contract. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our future isotopes. We cannot determine with certainty the timing of initiation, the duration or the completion costs of development activities. Actual development timelines, the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations.\n\n30\n\nWe may need to raise substantial additional capital in the future. In addition, we cannot forecast which future isotopes may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements.\n\nOur research and development expenses may vary significantly based on a variety of factors, such as:\n\n•\n\nthe scope, rate of progress, expense and results of our development activities;\n\n•\n\nthe phase of development of our future isotopes;\n\n•\n\nthe timing, receipt, and terms of any approvals from applicable regulatory authorities including the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities;\n\n•\n\nsignificant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance;\n\n•\n\nthe cost and timing of designing the development processes of isotope production;\n\n•\n\nthe extent to which we establish additional strategic collaborations or other arrangements; and\n\n•\n\nthe impact of any business interruptions to our operations or to those of the third parties with whom we work.\n\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our future isotopes could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that future isotope.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, which include salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and other employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel in executive, sales, finance and other administrative functions. Other significant costs include legal fees relating to corporate matters, professional fees for accounting and consulting services and facility-related costs.\n\nWe expect that our ongoing selling, general and administrative expenses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future to support our increased research and development activities and increased costs of operating as a public company and in building our internal resources. These increased costs will include increased expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance premiums and investor and public relations costs associated with operating as a public company.\n\nSegment Information\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we managed our operations as a single segment, specialist isotopes and related services. Beginning in 2024, primarily as a result of the increased business activities of our subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC, we have two operating segments: (i) nuclear fuels, and (ii) specialist isotopes and related services.\n\nThe nuclear fuels segment is focused on research and development of technologies and methods used to produce high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) and Lithium-6 for the advanced nuclear fuels target end market.\n\nThe specialist isotopes and related services segment is focused on research and development of technologies and methods used to separate high-value, low-volume isotopes (such as C-14, Mo-100 and Si-28) for highly specialized target end markets other than advanced nuclear fuels, including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, nuclear medical imaging and semiconductors, as well as services related to these isotopes, and this segment includes PET Labs.\n\nThe financial information is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources. Our CODM is our chief executive officer.\n\nWe manage assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as the assets are shared or commingled. Therefore, the chief operating decision maker does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, asset information is not reported on a segment basis.\n\nSelect information from the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n\nRevenues | Net Loss Before Allocation to Noncontrolling Interest  \n---|---  \nThree Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30,  \nSegment | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nSpecialist isotopes and related services | $ | 1,087,695 | $ | — | $ | (3,722,764 | ) | $ | (4,222,483 | )  \nNuclear fuels | — | — | (3,632,625 | ) | —  \n$ | 1,087,695 | $ | — | $ | (7,355,389 | ) | $ | (4,222,483 | )  \n  \nSelect information from the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n\nRevenues | Net Loss Before Allocation to Noncontrolling Interest  \n---|---  \nNine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30,  \nSegment | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nSpecialist isotopes and related services | $ | 2,950,348 | $ | — | $ | (14,637,771 | ) | $ | (12,123,907 | )  \nNuclear fuels | — | — | (8,563,904 | ) | —  \n$ | 2,950,348 | $ | — | $ | (23,201,675 | ) | $ | (12,123,907 | )  \n  \n31\n\nResults of Operations\n\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024 | 2023  \nRevenue | $ | 1,087,695 | $ | —  \nCost of goods sold | 793,714 | —  \nGross profit | 293,981 | —  \nOperating expenses:  \nResearch and development | 1,034,446 | 239,199  \nSelling, general and administrative | 4,693,158 | 3,707,311  \nTotal operating expenses | 5,727,604 | 3,946,510  \nOther (expense) income:  \nForeign exchange transaction loss | (131,247 | ) | —  \nChange in fair value of share liability | 381,969 | (279,425 | )  \nChange in fair value of convertible notes payable | (2,692,073 | ) | —  \nInterest income | 602,181 | 3,452  \nInterest expense | (90,966 | ) | —  \nTotal other (expense) income | (1,930,136 | ) | (275,973 | )  \nLoss before income tax expense | $ | (7,363,759 | ) | $ | (4,222,483 | )  \n  \nRevenue and Cost of Goods Sold\n\nEffective with the acquisition of 51% of PET Labs, we have recognized revenue from the sale of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning for the two month period since the acquisition was effective on October 31, 2023 and December 31, 2023 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, we have recognized the related cost of goods sold, operating expenses and other income and expenses of PET Labs for the same periods. No revenue or cost of goods sold was recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024 | 2023  \nIndirect costs:  \nPersonnel-related costs | $ | 368,515 | $ | 113,336  \nConsulting and professional | 316,157 | 50,000  \nFacility and other expenses | 349,774 | 75,863  \nTotal research and development expenses | $ | 1,034,446 | $ | 239,199  \n  \nResearch and development expenses were $1,034,446 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. These expenses include $368,515 of personnel-related costs, including $82,619 in stock-based compensation expense, $316,157 in consulting and professional costs and $349,774 in facility and other expenses.\n\nResearch and development expenses were $239,199 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. These expenses include $113,336 of personnel-related costs, including $92,886 in stock-based compensation expense, and $50,000 in consulting and professional costs, and $75,863 in facility and other expenses.\n\nThe increase in personnel-related costs is primarily attributable to the increase in headcount. The increase in consulting and professional costs is due to increased outsourced development activity for new specialty isotopes. The increase in facility and other is due to increase in space dedicated to development.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $4,693,158 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. These expenses include $2,985,744 of personnel-related costs, including $1,985,471 in stock-based compensation expense, $1,063,595 of professional services and legal related fees and $643,819 in facility and other corporate expenses.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $3,707,311 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. These expenses include $2,484,637 of personnel-related costs, including $1,978,904 in stock-based compensation expense, $669,118 of professional services and legal related fees and $553,556 in facility and other corporate expenses.\n\nThe increase in personnel-related costs is due to an increase in headcount and salaries. The increase in professional services and legal related fees is primarily attributable to the timing of corporate activity. The increase in facility and other corporate expenses is primarily attributable to the expansion of our operations in 2024.\n\nOther Income and Expense\n\nOther expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $1,930,136, which includes a loss of $2,692,073 due to change in fair value of the convertible notes payable issued in March and June 2024, partially offset by interest income of $602,181.and a gain of $381,969 due to change in fair value of share liability.\n\n32\n\nOther expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was $275,973, which includes a $279,425 change in the fair value of the share liability related to the shares issuable to a placement agent and other consultants.\n\nComparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024 | 2023  \nRevenue | $ | 2,950,348 | $ | —  \nCost of goods sold | 1,956,473 | —  \nGross profit | 993,875 | —  \nOperating expenses:  \nResearch and development | 1,722,882 | 699,413  \nSelling, general and administrative | 17,976,882 | 11,319,465  \nTotal operating expenses | 19,699,764 | 12,018,878  \nOther (expense) income:  \nForeign exchange transaction loss | (129,443 | ) | (935 | )  \nChange in fair value of share liability | 327,969 | (109,040 | )  \nChange in fair value of convertible notes payable | (5,220,599 | ) | —  \nInterest income | 657,899 | 4,946  \nInterest expense | (173,832 | ) | —  \nTotal other (expense) income | (4,538,006 | ) | (105,029 | )  \nLoss before income tax expense | $ | (23,243,895 | ) | $ | (12,123,907 | )  \n  \nRevenue and Cost of Goods Sold\n\nEffective with the acquisition of 51% of PET Labs, we have recognized revenue from the sale of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning for the two month period since the acquisition was effective on October 31, 2023 and December 31, 2023 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, we have recognized the related cost of goods sold, operating expenses and other income and expenses of PET Labs for the same periods. No revenue or cost of goods sold was recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024 | 2023  \nIndirect costs:  \nPersonnel-related costs | $ | 673,140 | $ | 369,136  \nLicense fees | — | —  \nConsulting and professional | 490,647 | 150,000  \nFacility and other expenses | 559,095 | 180,277  \nTotal research and development expenses | $ | 1,722,882 | $ | 699,413  \n  \nResearch and development expenses were $1,722,882 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These expenses include $673,140 of personnel-related costs, including $247,403 in stock-based compensation expense, $490,647 in consulting and professional, and $559,095 in facility and other expenses.\n\nResearch and development expenses were $699,413 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These expenses include $369,136 of personnel-related costs, including $278,686 in stock-based compensation expense, $150,000 in consulting expenses and $180,277 in facility and other expenses.\n\nThe increase in personnel-related costs is mainly due to the increase in headcount and related costs. The increase in consulting and professional is due to increased outsourced development activity for new specialty isotopes. The increase in facility is due to increase in space dedicated to development.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $17,976,882 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These expenses include $9,048,993 of personnel-related costs, including $6,052,357 in stock-based compensation expense, $4,720,772 of professional services and legal related fees and $4,207,117 in facility and other corporate expenses.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $11,319,465 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These expenses include $7,720,997 of personnel-related costs, including $6,311,890 in stock-based compensation expense, $2,165,926 of professional services and legal related fees and $1,432,542 in facility and other corporate expenses.\n\nThe increase in personnel-related costs is due to an increase in headcount and salaries. The increase in professional services and legal related fees is mainly due to the timing of corporate activity. The increase in facility and other corporate expenses is mainly due to the expansion of our operations in 2024 and commission and fee expenses related to the issuance of convertible notes payable.\n\nOther Income and Expense\n\nOther expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $4,538,006, which includes a loss of $5,220,599 due to change in fair value of the convertible notes payable issued in March and June 2024, partially offset by $657,899 of interest income and a gain of $327,969 due to change in fair value of share liability.\n\n33\n\nOther expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $105,029, which includes a $109,040 change in the fair value of the share liability related to the shares issuable to a placement agent and other consultants.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nSources of Liquidity\n\nWe have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing net losses for the foreseeable future. We have principally financed our operations to date through the issuance of our common stock, including our IPO, subsequent common stock offerings and the issuance of convertible notes payable. In July 2024, we issued 13,800,000 in a public offering at a public offering price of $2.50 per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately $32.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. In November 2024, we issued an additional 2,754,250 shares of common stock in a public offering at a public offering price of $6.75 per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately $17.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $51,571,540. We have not generated any revenue from the sale of our enriched isotopes, and our ability to generate product revenue from the sale of enriched isotopes sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our current or future enriched isotopes.\n\nEffective with the acquisition of 51% of PET Labs Pharmaceuticals on October 31, 2023, we have begun to recognize revenue from the sale of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning in South Africa. Our ability to generate product revenue from the sale of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful expansion of production capabilities and commercialization of the results of that expansion.\n\nFuture Funding Requirements\n\nBased on our current operating plan, we estimate that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next 12 months from the date the financial statements are issued. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of developing isotopes is costly, and the timing of progress and expenses in these development activities is uncertain.\n\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\n•\n\nthe type, number, scope, progress, expansions, results, costs and timing of, our development activities for our future isotopes;\n\n•\n\nthe outcome, timing and costs of regulatory review of our future isotopes;\n\n•\n\nthe costs and timing of manufacturing for our future isotopes;\n\n•\n\nour efforts to enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel to satisfy our obligations as a public company, including enhanced internal controls over financial reporting;\n\n•\n\nthe costs associated with hiring additional personnel and consultants as our preclinical and clinical activities increase;\n\n•\n\nthe costs and timing of establishing or securing sales and marketing and distribution capabilities, whether alone or with third parties, to commercialize future isotopes for which we may obtain regulatory approval, if any;\n\n•\n\nour ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share and revenue for any approved products;\n\n•\n\nthe terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements;\n\n•\n\nthe costs of obtaining, expanding, maintaining and enforcing our patent and other intellectual property rights; and\n\n•\n\ncosts associated with any products or technologies that we may in-license or acquire.\n\nDeveloping isotopes is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never achieve the necessary results required or obtain applicable regulatory approval for any isotopes or generate revenue from the sale of any future isotopes (assuming applicable regulatory approval is received). In addition, our future isotopes (assuming applicable regulatory approval is received) may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of isotopes that we expect to be commercially available in substantial quantities in the last quarter of 2024. If we receive permits and licenses to enrich U-235 (which in itself is highly uncertain), we do not expect U-235 to be commercially available for at least several years, if ever. As a result, we may need substantial additional financing to support our continuing operations and further the development of and commercialization of our future isotopes.\n\nExpansion of the production and distribution of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that may take years to complete. As a result, we may need substantial additional financing to support our continuing operations and further the development of and commercialization of future nuclear medical doses for PET scanning.\n\nUntil such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our future isotopes or nuclear medical doses for PET scanning, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through public or private equity or debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, increased interest rates, inflationary pressures, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. The financial markets and the global economy may also be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences\n\n34\n\nthat adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our future isotopes, future revenue streams or research programs or may have to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our future isotopes even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market such isotopes ourselves.\n\nCash Flows\n\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024 | 2023  \nNet cash provided by (used in):  \nOperating activities | $ | (12,935,554 | ) | $ | (3,355,171 | )  \nInvesting activities | (8,352,422 | ) | (1,190,157 | )  \nFinancing activities | 64,841,207 | 4,493,610  \nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents | $ | 43,553,231 | $ | (51,718 | )  \n  \nOperating Activities\n\nNet cash used in operating activities was $12,935,554 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and was primarily due to our net loss of $23,201,675, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense of $6,299,760, non-cash issuance costs for the convertible notes payable of $621,915, amortization of right-of-use asset of $343,473, depreciation expense of $425,630, issuance of common stock to a consultant with a fair value of $783,200, change in fair values for the convertible notes payable of $5,220,599 and a $3,071,004 change in our operating assets and liabilities.\n\nNet cash used in operating activities was $3,355,171 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and was primarily due to our net loss of $12,123,907, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense of $6,590,576, expense related to the issuance of common stock to consultants of $669,700, a change in fair value of share liability of $109,040 and amortization of right-of-use asset of $49,173, partially offset by a $1,349,278 change in our operating assets and liabilities.\n\nInvesting Activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $8,352,422 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and was comprised of the purchases of machinery and equipment, vehicles and construction in progress.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1,190,157 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and was comprised of additional construction in progress.\n\nFinancing Activities\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $64,841,207 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and was comprised primarily of gross proceeds of $34,500,000 from issuance of common stock, gross proceeds of $25,936,228 from the issuance of convertible notes payable, proceeds of $5,537,975 from the issuance of common stock for a warrant exercise, contributions from noncontrolling interest in VIE of $891,479, proceeds from collection of receivable from noncontrolling interest in VIE of $706,774, partially offset by costs to issue common stock of $2,194,041, payments of $438,569 on the note payable related to a financed corporate insurance policy, payment of principal portion of finance leases of $38,347 and distribution to noncontrolling interest in VIE of $60,292.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $4,493,610 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and was comprised primarily of net proceeds of $4,493,610 from the sale and issuance of 3,164,557 shares of our common stock in March 2023.\n\n35\n\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n\nWe lease our main facility in Pretoria, South Africa under a lease with a base monthly rent payment of approximately $8,000 with a term expiring on December 31, 2030. We also lease additional space in Pretoria, South Africa under a lease with a base monthly rent payment of approximately $16,000 with a term that expires on February 28, 2026. We also lease additional space in Pretoria, South Africa under a lease with a base monthly rent payment of approximately $2,000 with a term expiring on October 30, 2026.\n\nPET Labs operates in a facility in Pretoria, South Africa is under a lease with a base monthly rent payment of approximately $28,000 with a term expiring on March 30, 2026 with automatic monthly extension afterwards. PET Labs also rents space at a local hospital in Pretoria, South Africa for which there was a lease with a base monthly rent payment of approximately $5,000 which expired on December 31, 2023 and is currently in automatic monthly extensions.\n\nIn addition, we enter into contracts in the normal course of business with vendors for services and products for operating purposes. These contracts do not contain any minimum purchase commitments and generally provide for termination after a notice period and, therefore, are not considered long-term contractual obligations. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided and expenses incurred up to the date of cancellation.\n\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\n\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements which discusses new accounting pronouncements.\n\n36\n\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\n\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item.\n\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, mean controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company on the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nManagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgement in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as a result of a material weakness identified in our internal control over financial reporting, as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K (as amended) for the year ended December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. In order to remediate the material weakness, management expects to hire additional accounting and finance resources or consultants with public company experience.\n\nChanges in Internal Control\n\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Effective July 1, 2024, we hired a new Chief Financial Officer in order to address the internal control environment.\n\n37\n\nPART II-OTHER INFORMATION\n\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\n\nFrom time to time, we may be a party to litigation or subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings.\n\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, including under the heading “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” the risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects that we believe are most important for you to consider are discussed in “Part II, Item 1A—Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 10, 2024 and as amended by Forms 10-K/A filed with the SEC on April 29, 2024 and July 1, 2024. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (as amended) are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. There are no material changes to the Risk Factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (as amended).\n\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\n\nNone.\n\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.\n\nNone.\n\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\n\nNone.\n\nItem 5. Other Information.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of ours adopted or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\n\n38\n\nItem 6.

All statements other than statements of\nhistorical fact contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and\nplans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other\nimportant factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or\nimplied by the forward-looking statements.\nIn some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “should,” “would,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “target,”\n“projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. The forward-looking\nstatements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections\nabout future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements speak only as\nof the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and\nelsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or\nquantified, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements\nmay not be achieved or occur and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Some of the key factors that could cause actual\nresults to differ from our expectations include:\n•our ability to achieve or sustain positive cash flows from operations or profitability;\n•our ability to complete the construction of, commission and successfully operate isotope enrichment plants in a cost-effective manner;\n•our ability to meet, and to continue to meet, applicable regulatory requirements for the use of the isotopes we may produce using the ASP technology or the Quantum\nEnrichment process;\n•our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for the production and distribution of isotopes;\n•our ability to comply on an ongoing basis with the numerous regulatory requirements applicable to the ASP technology, the Quantum Enrichment process and our enrichment\nfacilities in South Africa;\n•the introduction, market acceptance and success of Mo-100 that we may produce using ASP technology as an alternative and potentially more convenient production route for\nTc-99m;\n•the success or profitability of our future offtake arrangements with respect to various isotopes that we may produce using ASP technology or the Quantum Enrichment process;\n•a failure of demand for various isotopes that we may produce using ASP technology or the Quantum Enrichment process;\n•our future capital requirements and sources and uses of cash;\n•our ability to obtain funding for our operations and future growth;\n•the extensive costs, time and uncertainty associated with new technology development;\n•our ability to implement and maintain effective internal controls;\n•developments and projections relating to our competitors and industry;\n•the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, including our acquisition of assets of Molybdos (Pty) Limited in the “business rescue” auction, the assets and\nintellectual property we acquired from Klydon Proprietary Ltd, and our investment in PET Labs Pharmaceuticals;\n•problems with the performance of the ASP technology or the Quantum Enrichment process in the enrichment of isotopes;\n•our dependence on a limited number of third-party suppliers for certain components;\n•our inability to adapt to changing technology and diagnostic landscape, such as the emergence of new diagnostic scanners or tracers;\n•our expected dependence on a limited number of key customers for isotopes that we may produce using ASP technology or the Quantum Enrichment process;\n•our inability to protect our intellectual property and the risk of claims that we have infringed on the intellectual property of others;\n•our inability to compete effectively;\n•risks associated with the current economic environment;\n•risks associated with our international operations;\n•our credit counterparty risks;\n•geopolitical risk and changes in applicable laws or regulations;\n•our inability to adequately protect our technology infrastructure;\n•our inability to hire or retain skilled employees and the loss of any of our key personnel;\n•operational risk;\n•costs and other risks associated with becoming a reporting company and becoming subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and\n•other factors that are described in “Risk Factors,” on page 38.\n3\nThese statements relate to future events or to our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause\nour actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking\nstatements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, those set forth in Part I, Item 1A - “Risk Factors”\nbelow and for the reasons described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q reflects our\ncurrent view with respect to future events and is subject to these and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions relating to our operations, results of operations, industry, and\nfuture growth. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to\nupdate or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available in the future.\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q also contains estimates, projections, and other information concerning our industry, our business, and the potential markets for\ncertain isotopes, including data regarding the estimated size of those markets, their projected growth rates, and the incidence of certain medical conditions. Information that is\nbased on estimates, forecasts, projections, or similar methodologies is inherently subject to uncertainties, and actual events or circumstances may differ materially from events\nand circumstances reflected in this information. Unless otherwise expressly stated, we obtained these industry, business, market, and other data from reports, research surveys,\nstudies, and similar data prepared by third parties, industry, medical and general publications, government data, and similar sources. In some cases, we do not expressly refer to\nthe sources from which these data are derived.\nExcept where the context otherwise requires, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, “we,” “us,” “our,” “ASP Isotopes,” and the “Company” refer to ASP Isotopes Inc.\nand, where appropriate, its consolidated subsidiaries.\nTrademarks\nAll trademarks, service marks, and trade names included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are the property of their respective owners. Solely for convenience, the\ntrademarks and trade names in this report may be referred to without the ® and ™ symbols, but such references should not be construed as any indicator that their respective\nowners will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, their rights thereto.\n4\nPART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 1.

Organization\nDescription of Business\nASP Isotopes Inc. was incorporated in the state of Delaware on September 13, 2021, and has its principal operations in Washington, DC. ASP Isotopes Inc.’s\nsubsidiary ASP Isotopes Guernsey Limited (“ASP Guernsey”), has its principal operations in Guernsey. ASP Guernsey’s subsidiary, ASP Isotopes South Africa Proprietary\nLimited (“ASP South Africa”), has its principal operations in South Africa. ASP Rentals Proprietary Limited (“ASP Rentals”), a variable interest entity (“VIE”) of ASP South\nAfrica, has its principal operations in South Africa. Enlightened Isotopes (Pty) Ltd (“Enlightened Isotopes”), a 80% owned subsidiary of ASP South Africa, was formed in\nMarch 2023 and began operations in January 2024. ASP Isotopes UK Ltd (“ASP UK”), a subsidiary of ASP Guernsey, was incorporated in July 2022. ASPI South Africa\nAsset Finance Proprietary Limited (\"ASP SA Asset Finance”), a subsidiary of ASP South Africa, was incorporated in July 2024. PET Labs Global Nuclear Medicine SEZC\n(“PET Labs Global”), a subsidiary of ASP Guernsey, was incorporated in June 2024 in the Cayman Islands. PET Labs Pharmaceuticals Proprietary Limited (“PET Labs”), a\n51% owned subsidiary of ASP Isotopes Inc. operates in South Africa. ASP Isotopes Inc.’s subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC, was formed in the state of Delaware in\nSeptember 2023 and began operations in February 2024. Quantum Leap Energy LLC’s subsidiary Quantum Leap Energy Proprietary Limited (“Quantum Leap Energy South\nAfrica”), has its operations in South Africa. ASP Isotopes Inc., its subsidiaries and ASP Rentals are collectively referred to as “the Company” throughout these consolidated\nstatements.\nThe Company is a development stage advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes that, if successful, will allow for the\nenrichment of natural isotopes into higher concentration products, which could be used in several industries. The Company’s proprietary technology, the Aerodynamic\nSeparation Process (“ASP technology”), originally developed by Klydon Proprietary Ltd (“Klydon”), is designed to enable the production of isotopes used in several\nindustries. The Company’s initial focus is on the production and commercialization of enriched Carbon-14 (“C-14”), Molybdenum-100 (“Mo-100”) and Silicon-28 (“Si-28”).\nThe Company has completed an isotope enrichment plant for the enrichment of C-14 located in Pretoria, South Africa and we expect to start commercial supply of C-14 in the\nfirst quarter of 2025, assuming timely delivery of the feedstock from the Company's customer. The Company anticipates completion and commissioning of a multi-isotope\nenrichment plant in Pretoria, South Africa in the fourth quarter 2024, and the Company expects to start initial commercial supply of Si-28 in early 2025. In addition, the\nCompany has started planning additional isotope enrichment plants. The Company believes the C-14 it may develop using the ASP technology may be used in the\ndevelopment of new pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. The Company believes that the Mo-100 it may develop using the ASP technology has significant potential\nadvantages for use in the preparation of nuclear imaging agents by radiopharmacies and others in the medical industry. The Company believes the Si-28 it may develop using\nthe ASP technology may be used to develop advanced semiconductors and in quantum computing. In addition, the Company is considering the future development of the ASP\ntechnology for the separation of Zinc-68, Xenon-129/136 for potential use in the healthcare end market, Germanium 70/72/74 for possible use in the semiconductor end\nmarket, and Chlorine-37 for potential use in the nuclear energy end market.\nThe Company is also developing quantum enrichment technology to produce enriched Ytterbium-176 (“Yb-176”), Nickel-64, Lithium6, Lithium-7 and Uranium-235\n(“U-235”). Quantum enrichment is an advanced isotope enrichment technique that is currently in development that uses lasers. The Company believes the U-235 that it may\ndevelop using quantum enrichment technology may be commercialized as a nuclear fuel component for use in the new generation of high-assay low-enriched uranium\n(HALEU)-fueled small modular reactors that are now under development for commercial and government uses. The construction of the Company's first quantum enrichment\nfacility was completed in August 2024, and the Company produced the first semi-finished material of enriched Yb-176 during the commissioning phase of the plant in\nOctober 2024. The Company expects to be able to achieve a 99.75% enrichment for Yb-176 and offer highly enriched Yb-176 for commercial sale during 2025. The\nCompany also expects to proceed with the plans to construct Nickel-64 and Lithium- 6/7 quantum enrichment plants with targeted production during 2025.\nLiquidity\nThe Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since its inception. The Company incurred net losses of $23,201,675 and\n$12,123,907 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Company currently expects that its cash and cash equivalents of $51,571,540 as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and\ncapital requirements for more than 12 months from the date the financial statements are issued. In November 2024, the Company issued an additional 2,754,250 shares of\ncommon stock in a public offering at a public offering price of $6.75 per share for net proceeds of approximately $17,100,000. The Company anticipates it will need to\ncontinue to raise capital through additional equity and/or debt financings and/or collaborative development agreements to fund its operations.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will achieve or sustain positive cash flows from operations or profitability. The Company is in the process of seeking\nadditional debt and equity financing. However, such funding may not be available on a timely basis on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. If the Company is unable to\nraise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, the Company may be required to scale back or discontinue the advancement of product candidates, reduce\nheadcount, reorganize, merge with another entity, or cease operations.\n2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nUnaudited Financial Information\nThe Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"), and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. In the Company’s\nopinion, the information furnished reflects all adjustments, all of which are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and\nresults of operations for the reported interim periods. The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial\nstatements are issued to provide additional evidence relative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure. The results of operations for interim\nperiods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or any other interim period. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\nshould be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n10\nBasis of Presentation and Use of Estimates\nThe Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the Company’s condensed\nconsolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and\ndisclosure in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The most significant estimates in the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements relate to stock-based compensation expense, the accounting for the acquisition of PET Labs and fair value measurement of the convertible notes payable and\nwarrants. Although these estimates are based on the Company’s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may materially differ\nfrom these estimates and assumptions.\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ASP Isotopes Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the 80% owned Enlightened\nIsotopes, the 51% owned PET Labs and the 42% owned VIE ASP Rentals. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCurrency and currency translation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the Company’s reporting currency. The functional currency of ASP Isotopes Inc. and\nASP Guernsey is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries ASP South Africa and Quantum Leap Energy South Africa is the South African\nRand. The functional currency of the 80% owned Enlighted Isotopes, the 51% owned PET Labs and the 42% owned VIE ASP Rentals is the South African Rand.\nAdjustments that arise from exchange rate changes on transactions of each group entity denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in other\nincome and expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Assets and liabilities of the entities with functional currency of South African Rand\nare recorded in South African Rand and translated into the U.S. dollar reporting currency of the Company at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and\nexpenses of the entities with functional currency of South African Rand are recorded in South African Rand and translated into the U.S. dollar reporting currency of the\nCompany at the average exchange rate prevailing during the reporting period. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded separately in stockholders’ equity as a\ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.\nConcentration of Credit Risk and other Risks\nCash balances maintained at U.S. financial institutions may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limit of $250,000 per depositor,\nper insured bank for each account ownership category. Although the Company currently believes that the financial institutions with whom it does business, will be able to\nfulfill their commitments to the Company, there is no assurance that those institutions will be able to continue to do so. The Company has not experienced any credit losses\nassociated with its balances in such accounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe Company's foreign subsidiaries held cash of approximately $2,062,000 and $1,963,000 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which\nis included in cash on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company's strategic plan does not require the repatriation of foreign cash in order to fund its operations in the\nU.S., and it is the Company's current intention to indefinitely reinvest its foreign cash outside of the U.S. If the Company were to repatriate foreign cash to the U.S., the\nCompany would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes in accordance with applicable U.S. tax rules and regulations as a result of the repatriation.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash\nequivalents are stated at fair value and may include money market funds, U.S. Treasury and U.S. government-sponsored agency securities, corporate debt, commercial\npaper and certificates of deposit. The Company had cash equivalents of $186,229 in the form of money market funds as of September 30, 2024. The Company had no cash\nequivalents as of December 31, 2023.\nSegment Information\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company managed its operations as a single segment, specialist isotopes and related services. Beginning in 2024, primarily as a\nresult of increased business activities of its subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC, the Company has two operating segments: (i) nuclear fuels, and (ii) specialist isotopes\nand related services.\nThe nuclear fuels segment is focused on research and development of technologies and methods used to produce high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) and\nLithium-6 for the advanced nuclear fuels target end market.\nThe specialist isotopes and related services segment is focused on research and development of technologies and methods used to separate high-value, low-volume\nisotopes (such as C-14, Mo-100 and Si-28) for highly specialized target end markets other than advanced nuclear fuels, including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals,\nnuclear medical imaging and semiconductors, as well as services related to these isotopes, and this segment includes PET Labs.\nThe financial information is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources. The Company’s CODM is\nits chief executive officer.\nThe Company manages assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as the assets are shared or commingled. Therefore, the chief operating decision\nmaker does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, asset information is not reported on a segment basis.\n11\nSelect information from the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as\nfollows:\nNet Loss Before\nRevenues Allocation to Noncontrolling Interest\nThree Months Ended September 30, Three Months Ended September 30,\nSegment 2024 2023 2024 2023\nSpecialist isotopes and related services $ 1,087,695 $ — $ (3,722,764) $ (4,222,483)\nNuclear fuels — — (3,632,625) —\n$ 1,087,695 $ — $ (7,355,389) $ (4,222,483)\nSelect information from the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\nNet Loss Before\nRevenues Allocation to Noncontrolling Interest\nNine Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\nSegment 2024 2023 2024 2023\nSpecialist isotopes and related services $ 2,950,348 $ — $ (14,637,771) $ (12,123,907)\nNuclear fuels — — (8,563,904) —\n$ 2,950,348 $ — $ (23,201,675) $ (12,123,907)\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nAccounting guidance defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability\ncategory measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an\nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based\non assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the accounting guidance establishes a three-\ntier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\nLevel 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe Company’s share liability (Note 12) is measured as a Level 1 fair value on a recurring basis. There was no share liability as of December 31, 2023. The\nCompany’s share liability was $416,652 as of September 30, 2024. The Company’s convertible notes payable (Note 6) is measured as a Level 3 fair value on a recurring\nbasis and was $31,778,742 as of September 30, 2024. There were no transfers among Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 categories in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the Company’s liabilities measured as a Level 3 at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs:\nConvertible\nNotes Payable\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 —\nFair value at issuance 26,558,143\nFair value adjustment 5,220,599\nSettlement of liability —\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ 31,778,742\nThe carrying amounts of accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes payable are considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the\nshort-term nature of those instruments.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company’s revenue relates to PET Labs, in which the Company acquired 51% ownership on October 31, 2023 (Note 11). The Company recognizes revenue in\naccordance with Accounting Standard Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). The Company enters into transactions with\nradiopharmacy companies that are within the scope of ASC 606. The terms of these transactions include payment for delivery of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning in\nSouth Africa.\nUnder ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which\nthe entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be\nwithin the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of\nwhether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction\nprice, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as)\nthe Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect consideration\nit is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.\nThe Company evaluates a transaction’s performance obligations to determine if promised goods or services in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the\ncustomer and are considered distinct when (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources and (ii) the\npromised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. In assessing whether promised goods or services are distinct, the Company considers\nwhether the goods or services are integral or dependent to other goods or services in the contract.\nThe Company determines the transaction price based on the agreed government rates for the promised goods in the contract.\n12\nThe consideration is recognized as revenue when control is transferred for the related goods.\nThe Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The\nCompany receives payments from its customers based on billing schedules established in each contract. Upfront payments and fees are recorded as deferred revenue upon\nreceipt or when due until the Company performs its obligations under these arrangements. Amounts are recorded as accounts receivable when the Company’s right to\nconsideration is unconditional.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. An allowance for expected credit losses is estimated for\nthose accounts receivable considered to be uncollectible based upon historical experience and management's evaluation of outstanding accounts receivable. The Company\nmaintains an allowance for expected credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable, and changes in such are classified as selling,\ngeneral and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company assesses collectability by reviewing accounts\nreceivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when the Company identifies specific customers with known disputes or\ncollectability issues. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, the Company considers historical collectability based on past due status and make\njudgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. The Company also considers customer-specific information, current market\nconditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Bad debts are written off against the allowance when identified. As of September 30,\n2024, December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023 there was no allowance for expected credit losses.\nInventory\nThe Company uses the first in, first out inventory method to account for its inventory. As of September 30, 2024, inventory consists of raw materials and is stated at the\nlower of cost or net realizable value. There was no inventory as of December 31, 2023.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment include costs of assets constructed, purchased or leased under a finance lease, related delivery and installation costs and interest incurred on\nsignificant capital projects during their construction periods. Expenditures for renewals and betterments also are capitalized, but expenditures for normal repairs and\nmaintenance are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with yearly planned major maintenance are generally deferred and amortized over 12 months or until the same\nmajor maintenance activities must be repeated, whichever is shorter. The cost and accumulated depreciation applicable to assets retired or sold are removed from the\nrespective accounts, and gains or losses thereon are included in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss.\nThe Company assigns the useful lives of its property and equipment based upon its internal engineering estimates, which are reviewed periodically. The estimated\nuseful lives of the Company's property and equipment range from 3 to 10 years, or the shorter of the useful life or remaining life of the lease for leasehold improvements.\nDepreciation is recorded using the straight-line method.\nConstruction in progress (Note 4) is carried at cost and consists of specifically identifiable direct and indirect development and construction costs. While under\nconstruction, costs of the property are included in construction in progress until the property is placed in service, at which time costs are transferred to the appropriate\nproperty and equipment account, including, but not limited to, leasehold improvements or other such accounts.\nProperty and equipment acquired in the acquisition of PET Labs was measured at fair value on October 31, 2023. The fair value forms the new basis of these assets\nand is depreciated over the remaining estimated useful lives of the related assets.\nBusiness Combination and Asset Acquisitions\nThe Company evaluates acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions to assess whether or not the transaction should be accounted for as a business\ncombination or asset acquisition by first applying a screen to determine if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable\nasset or group of similar identifiable assets. If the screen is met, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If the screen is not met, further determination is\nrequired as to whether or not the Company has acquired inputs and processes that have the ability to create outputs, which would meet the requirements of a business. If\ndetermined to be a business combination, the Company accounts for the transaction under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805 Business\nCombinations (\"ASC 805\"), which requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the fair value of all assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-\ncontrolling interest in the acquiree and establishes the acquisition date as the fair value measurement point. Accordingly, the Company recognizes assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed in business combinations, including contingent assets and liabilities, and non-controlling interest in the acquiree based on the fair value estimates as of the\ndate of acquisition. In accordance with ASC 805, the Company recognizes and measures goodwill as of the acquisition date, as the excess of the fair value of the\nconsideration paid over the fair value of the identified net assets acquired.\nThe consideration for the Company’s business acquisitions may include future payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of a particular event or events. The\nobligations for such contingent consideration payments are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. The contingent consideration obligations are then evaluated each\nreporting period. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, other than changes due to payments, are recognized as a gain or loss and recorded within change in\nthe fair value of deferred and contingent consideration liabilities in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\nIf determined to be an asset acquisition, the Company accounts for the transaction under ASC 805-50, which requires the acquiring entity in an asset acquisition to\nrecognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the cost to the acquiring entity on a relative fair value basis, which includes transaction costs in addition to\nconsideration given. No gain or loss is recognized as of the date of acquisition unless the fair value of non-cash assets given as consideration differs from the assets’ carrying\namounts on the acquiring entity’s books. Consideration transferred that is non-cash will be measured based on either the cost (which shall be measured based on the fair\nvalue of the consideration given) or the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever is more reliably measurable. Goodwill is not recognized in an\nasset acquisition and any excess consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated to the identifiable assets based on relative fair values.\n13\nContingent consideration payments in asset acquisitions are recognized when the contingency is resolved and the consideration is paid or becomes payable (unless\nthe contingent consideration meets the definition of a derivative, in which case the amount becomes part of the basis in the asset acquired). Upon recognition of the\ncontingent consideration payment, the amount is included in the cost of the acquired asset or group of assets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the amount of consideration paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired as a result of the Company’s business acquisitions accounted\nfor using the acquisition method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized and is subject to impairment testing at a reporting unit level on an annual basis or when a\ntriggering event occurs that may indicate the carrying value of the goodwill is impaired. An entity is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative\nimpairment test is necessary. Further testing is only required if the entity determines, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of\nthe reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company will perform its annual test for goodwill as of October 31.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company accounts for the investments it makes in certain legal entities in which equity investors do not have (1) sufficient equity at risk for the legal entity to\nfinance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or (2) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk do not have either the power, through\nvoting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the legal entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance, or (3) the obligation to absorb the\nexpected losses of the legal entity or the right to receive expected residual returns of the legal entity. These certain legal entities are referred to as “variable interest entities”\nor “VIEs.”\nThe Company would consolidate the results of any such entity in which it determined that it had a controlling financial interest. The Company would have a\n“controlling financial interest” in such an entity if the Company had both the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance\nand the obligation to absorb the losses of, or right to receive benefits from, the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE. On a quarterly basis, the Company will\nreassess whether it has a controlling financial interest in any investments it has in these certain legal entities.\nConvertible Notes Payable\nConvertible notes payable are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments (\"ASC 825\"). Upon issuance the Company has elected the\nfair value option to account for the convertible notes payable. Changes in fair value during the reporting period are recognized in other income (expense) in the consolidated\nstatement of operations and comprehensive loss.\nLeases\nLeases are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases (\"ASC 842\"). At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the\narrangement is or contains a lease based on specific facts and circumstances, the existence of an identified asset(s), if any, and the Company’s control over the use of the\nidentified asset(s), if applicable. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets are recorded based on the present value of future lease\npayments over the expected lease term. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As such, the Company will utilize the incremental\nborrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment,\nand considering the region in which the ROU asset and liabilities are located.\nThe Company has elected to combine lease and non-lease components as a single component. Operating leases are recognized on the balance sheet as ROU lease\nassets, lease liabilities current and lease liabilities non-current. Fixed rents are included in the calculation of the lease balances, while variable costs paid for certain\noperating and pass-through costs are excluded. Lease expense is recognized over the expected term on a straight-line basis.\nFinance leases are recognized on the balance sheet as property and equipment, finance lease liabilities current and finance lease liabilities non-current. Finance lease\nROU assets and the related lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. The\nfinance lease ROU assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term with the related interest expense of the lease liability payment recognized over the lease\nterm using the effective interest method.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment. The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount\nof an asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is\nmeasured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. The Company did not recognize any impairment losses for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs consist primarily of fees paid to consultants, license fees and facilities costs. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and\nservices that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than\nwhen the payment is made. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nSelling, General and Administrative Costs\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, including stock-based compensation expense, related to the\nCompany's executive, finance, business development, legal, human resources and support functions. Other\n14\ngeneral and administrative expenses include professional fees for auditing, tax, consulting and patent-related services, rent and utilities and insurance.\nStock-based Compensation Expense\nStock-based compensation expense represents the cost of the grant date fair value of employee stock awards recognized over the requisite service period of the\nawards (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis. The Company estimates the fair value of each stock-based award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes\noption pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model incorporates various assumptions, such as the value of the underlying common stock, the risk-free interest\nrate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield, and expected life of the options. Forfeitures are recognized as a reduction of stock-based compensation expense as they\noccur.\nThe Company also awards restricted stock to employees and directors. Restricted stock is generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the\ncompletion of the vesting restrictions. The Company expenses the cost of the restricted stock, which is determined to be the fair market value of the shares of common stock\nunderlying the restricted stock at the date of grant, ratably over the period during which the vesting restrictions lapse.\nStock-based compensation expense is classified in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the same manner in which the award recipients’ payroll\ncosts are classified or in which the award recipients’ service payments are classified.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences associated with differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and\nliabilities, as measured by the enacted tax rates, which are expected to be in effect when these differences reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nPrior to the acquisition of 51% of PET Labs in October 2023, the Company had generated net losses since inception and accordingly had not recorded a provision\nfor income taxes. Subsequent to the acquisition of 51% of PET Labs, the Company records the provision for income taxes for the activity from PET Labs operations.\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10, Uncertainty in Income Taxes, or ASC 740-10. The Company has not recognized a liability for any uncertain\ntax positions. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits has not been provided since there is no unrecognized benefit since the date\nof adoption. The Company has not recognized interest expense or penalties as a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10. If there were an unrecognized tax benefit, the\nCompany would recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in income tax expense.\nThe Company has identified the United States, South Africa and Guernsey as its major tax jurisdictions. Refer to Note 15 for further details.\nComprehensive Loss\nComprehensive loss is defined as a change in equity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. The Company’s\ncomprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and the effect of currency translation adjustments.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company has reviewed recently issued accounting pronouncements and plans to adopt those that are applicable to it. The Company does not expect the\nadoption of any recently issued pronouncements to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position.\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU\") 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280):\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (\"ASU 2023-07\"). ASU 2023-07 will improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced\ndisclosures about significant segment expenses on an interim and annual basis. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim\nperiods after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s condensed\nfinancial statements at adoption date.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (“ASU 2024-03”) and is effective for annual reporting periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. ASU 2024-03 requires disclosures about specific types of expenses\nincluded in the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement as well as disclosures about selling expenses. The Company is still assessing the impact of\nadopting this standard.\n3. Revenue\nIn connection with the Company's acquisition of 51% ownership of PET Labs in October 2023, the Company manufactures and sells nuclear medical doses for PET\nscanning in South Africa. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized revenue of $1,087,695 and $2,950,348, respectively. Since the\nacquisition did not occur until October 2023, there is no accounts receivable as of January 1, 2023 and no revenue was recognized for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nThe following table presents changes in the Company’s accounts receivable for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nBalance as of Balance as of\nDecember 31, September 30,\n2023 Additions Deductions 2024\nAccounts receivable $ 216,504 $ 2,950,348 $ (2,606,423) $ 560,429\n15\n4. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted of the following:\nUseful Lives September 30, December 31,\n(Years) 2024 2023\nConstruction in progress - $ 14,227,486 $ 9,108,923\nTools, machinery and equipment 3 - 10 8,598,704 1,458,654\nComputer equipment 3 - 4\n114,231 60,447\nVehicles 5 257,158 39,849\nSoftware 5 1,737 1,639\nOffice furniture 7 144,213 59,588\nLeasehold improvements 5 126,134 21,446\nProperty and equipment, at cost 23,469,663 10,750,546\nLess accumulated depreciation (485,371) (37,707)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 22,984,292 $ 10,712,839\nThe Carbon-14 plant (which is included within tools, machinery and equipment) was completed in June 2024 and depreciation began in July 2024. The Company is\ncurrently building two other plants in Pretoria, South Africa: a multi-isotope plant and a laser isotope separation plan using quantum enrichment technology. Costs incurred\nfor the other two plants are considered construction in progress because the work is not complete as of September 30, 2024. Costs incurred for the plants as of December 31,\n2023 are considered construction in progress. There was no depreciation expense as it relates to the construction in progress for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023. Depreciation expense for all other asset categories was $175,916 and $802 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDepreciation expense for all other categories was $425,630 and $969 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n5. Accrued Expenses\nAccrued expenses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nAccrued professional $ 503,386 $ 447,295\nAccrued salaries and other employee costs 1,169,277 845,344\nAccrued other 89,759 18,606\nTotal accrued expenses $ 1,762,422 $ 1,311,245\n6. Notes Payable\nConvertible Notes Payable\nIn March 2024, the Company issued convertible notes payable (“March 2024 Convertible Notes”) totaling $21,063,748 and received aggregate cash of $20,550,000.\nOne of the notes totaling $513,748 was issued to the placement agent in lieu of cash issuance costs. Issuance costs paid in cash totaling $521,423 and the value of the note\nissued upon issuance to the placement agent were expensed in selling, general and administrative costs in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and\ncomprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nIn June 2024, the Company issued additional convertible notes payable (“June 2024 Convertible Notes”) totaling $5,494,395 and received aggregate cash of\n$5,386,228. One of the notes totaling $108,167 was issued to the placement agent in lieu of cash issuance costs and was expensed in selling, general and administrative costs\nin the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Issuance costs paid in cash were negligible.\nThe March 2024 Convertible Notes and the June 2024 Convertible Notes are collectively the “Convertible Notes”.\nThe Convertible Notes are payable on demand in March 2029 and bear an annual interest rate of 6% through March 7, 2025 and 8% thereafter. Upon a qualified\nfinancing event the Convertible Notes convert into the shares issued in that qualified financing event at a price per share equal to 80% of the share price issued subject to a\nvaluation cap. Upon a qualified transaction, the noteholders may elect to receive either 1.5x the principal and accrued interest balance in cash or convert into common shares.\nThe Convertible Notes are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet at their fair values. The fair value of the March Convertible Notes on the date of\nissuance was $21,063,748. The fair value of the June Convertible Notes on the date of issuance was $5,494,395. The fair value of the Convertible Notes as of September 30,\n2024 has been determined to be $31,778,742 and the resultant change in fair value of $5,220,599 has been recorded in other income and expense in the condensed\nconsolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The resultant change in fair value for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 of $2,692,073 has been recorded in other income and expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The fair value of the\nConvertible Notes as of June 30, 2024 has been determined to be $29,086,669 and the resultant change in fair value of $2,528,526 has been recorded in other income and\nexpense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations comprehensive loss for the six months ended June 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the total principal and\naccrued interest of the Convertible Notes is $27,380,563 of which $822,420 is from the interest.\nPromissory Note Payable\nDuring 2021, the Company executed a promissory note payable with an aggregate principal balance of $33,500 (25,000 GBP). The note was due after a period of two\nmonths, followed by mutually agreed upon monthly extensions, and does not bear interest. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the promissory note payable\nbalance was $33,446 and $31,827, respectively, and continues to be automatically extended on a monthly basis.\nIn November 2023, the Company executed a promissory note payable with a finance company to fund its directors and officers insurance policy for $526,282. This\nnote bore interest at an annual rate of 8.74% with six monthly payments beginning in December\n16\n2023. The note was repaid in full in May 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded interest expense of $11,247. As of December 31,\n2023, the promissory note payable balance was $438,569.\n7. Deferred Revenues\nIn June 2023, the Company entered into a Supply Agreement with a customer for the delivery of Molybdenum-100 and Molybdenum-98 beginning in 2024. In\nconjunction with the Supply Agreement, the Company received $882,000 in September 2023, as an advance towards future revenue. The Company has recorded $882,000 as\ndeferred revenue on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. There was no deferred revenue recorded as of January 1, 2023 and September 30,\n2023.\n8. Commitments and Contingencies\nPurchase of Cyclotron\nIn November 2023, the cyclotron that the Company ordered was shipped. As of December 31, 2023, the equipment had not been delivered; however, the Company\nwas obligated to purchase this equipment and recorded the full cost of $1,653,000 in other noncurrent assets and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet\nas of December 31, 2023.\nIn March 2024, the cyclotron was received by the Company and is recorded as property and equipment. The financing company has paid the vendor. The Company\nfinanced the cost of this equipment and it is recorded in finance lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024.\nKlydon Proprietary Limited\nIn November 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with Klydon Proprietary Limited (“Klydon”) to design and build a plant to enrich Molybdenum in South\nAfrica (the \"Turnkey Contract\"). The initial phase of the project included the building of a plant that can support the production of at least 5kgs of Mo-100. The contracted\ncost for this phase was $6,800,000. The second phase of the project included the production to be increased to 20kgs of Mo-100 with an additional cost of $6,000,000.\nKlydon performed a portion of the services required under the Turnkey Contract; however, some services were incomplete and many of the services were not\ncompleted within the time frame required. As a result, Klydon and ASP South Africa entered into an Acknowledgement of Debt Agreement dated November 30, 2022,\nwhereby Klydon (i) agreed to pledge its assets (the “Pledged Assets”) to ASP South Africa to secure its performance of the Turnkey Contract by December 31, 2022, and (ii)\nacknowledged that ASP South Africa would suffer damages in the amount of $6,050,000 (“Damage Amount”) should it fail to perform. Under the Acknowledgement of Debt\nAgreement, the Pledged Assets would serve as collateral for Klydon’s obligation to pay the Damage Amount should Klydon fail to perform. In connection therewith, also on\nNovember 30, 2022, ASP South Africa and Klydon entered into a Deed of Security Agreement whereby, if Klydon failed to complete its obligations under the Turnkey\nContract by December 31, 2022, all of Klydon’s rights of any nature to and interests of any nature in the Pledged Assets would be transferred to ASP South Africa. Klydon\nfailed to complete its obligations under the Turnkey Contract by December 31, 2022, however, the Company did not perfect its interests in the assets until April 4, 2023. The\nCompany did not believe that the amounts owed by Klydon were realizable, nor did the Company know the timing of any recovery payments. Therefore, a loss recovery\nreceivable was not recorded at any time prior to April 4, 2023.\nOn April 4, 2023, the Company perfected its interest under the Acknowledgement of Debt Agreement, pursuant to which the Company acquired certain intellectual\nproperty from Klydon (“Klydon Settlement”). In addition, the Company acquired Klydon's interest in four entities which are inactive and in the process of being dissolved.\nThe Company has concluded that the Klydon Settlement is accounted for as an asset acquisition under ASC 805 since the assets acquired were concentrated in a single\nidentifiable asset from a related party. In conjunction with the Klydon Settlement, the Company recorded an increase to additional paid-in capital for the settlement of all\nliabilities owed to Klydon at the time of settlement totaling $626,223.\nTwo individuals who are officers and board members of Klydon, one who is now an officer of ASP Isotopes Inc. and the other who is now a scientific advisor of ASP\nIsotopes Inc., received warrants to purchase common stock of the Company and therefore are considered related parties. See Notes 10 and 12.\nShare Purchase Agreement relating to PET Labs\nOn October 31, 2023, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Nucleonics Imaging Proprietary Limited, a company incorporated in the Republic\nof South Africa (the “Seller”), relating to the purchase and sale of ordinary shares in the issued share capital of Pet Labs.

Issuance costs, including commissions and expenses totaled $2,194,041.\nIn November 2024, the Company issued an additional 2,754,250 shares of common stock in a public offering at a public offering price of $6.75 per share for\naggregate gross proceeds totaling approximately $18,600,000. The estimated issuance costs, including commissions and expenses, are expected to be approximately\n$1,455,000.\nCommon Stock Warrants\nIn September 2023, the Company issued warrants to purchase 3,386,076 shares of common stock. The fair value of these warrants was determined to be $2,882,621\nand estimated based on the Black-Scholes model, using the following assumptions:\nExpected volatility 60.3%\nWeighted-average risk-free rate 3.44%\nExpected term in years 5.5\nExpected dividend yield -%\nIn April 2024, a warrant to purchase 3,164,557 shares of common stock was exercised and the Company received gross proceeds of $5,537,975. As an inducement for\nthe warrant holder to exercise in cash, a warrant to purchase 1,225,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.90 per share was issued to that same warrant holder\nfor no consideration (“Inducement Warrant”). The Inducement Warrant vests in October 2024 and expires in October 2029. The Company evaluated the terms of the\nInducement Warrant and determined that it should be accounted for as an equity-based warrant. The Company also evaluated the circumstances of the award and determined\nthat the inducement should be treated as a deemed dividend.\nThe fair value of the Inducement Warrant was determined to be $2,779,659 and estimated based on the Black-Scholes model, using the following assumptions:\n23\nExpected volatility 73.5%\nWeighted-average risk-free rate 4.37%\nExpected term in years 5.5\nExpected dividend yield -%\nThe fair value of the Inducement Warrant is considered a deemed dividend and the amount is reflected in the calculation of earnings (loss) per share on a basic and\ndiluted basis.\nIn conjunction with the exercise of the warrant in April 2024, the Company is now obligated to issue to an underwriter, a warrant to purchase 221,519 shares of\ncommon stock (“Commission Warrant”) in addition to a cash payment totaling $387,658. The Company evaluated the terms of the Commission Warrant and determined that\nit should be accounted for as an equity-based warrant. The fair value of the Commission Warrant was determined to be $657,871 and estimated based on the Black-Scholes\nmodel, using the following assumptions:\nExpected volatility 73.5%\nWeighted-average risk-free rate 4.60%\nExpected term in years 5.5\nExpected dividend yield -%\nAs of September 30, 2024, neither the cash payment nor the issuance of the Commission Warrant has been settled and therefore the cash payment due is included in\naccrued expenses and the fair value of the warrant is included in share liability on the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of the Commission Warrant as of September\n30, 2024 was $416,652. The resulting change in fair value of share liability was a gain of $241,219 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nIn October 2024, a warrant to purchase 151,741 shares of common stock was exercised and the Company received gross proceeds of $299,688.\n13.

The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense from options of $588,018 and $773,238 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. As of September 30, 2024, there was $661,361 of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock-based compensation\narrangements granted under the Plan, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 0.7 years.\nStock Awards\nIn October 2021, the Company issued 1,500,000 shares of restricted common stock to its Chief Executive Officer. The number of shares that vest is dependent on\nachieving certain performance conditions and dependent market conditions upon the third anniversary from the date of grant. The Company determined that the fair value of\nthis award was $0.25 per share for a total value of $375,000. The Company determined the performance condition probable and recognized stock-based compensation expense\nof $375,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe Company recorded stock-based compensation expense from stock awards totaling $1,871,103 and $1,864,537 for the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively.

As of September 30, 2024, there is $7,425,197 of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the non-vested\nportion of restricted stock awards that is expected to be recognized over the next year.\nThe following table summarizes vesting of restricted common stock:\nWeighted\nAverage Grant\nDate Fair\nNumber of Value\nShares Per Share\nUnvested as of December 31, 2023 4,489,186 $ 1.42\nGranted 2,078,466 $ 2.23\nVested (2,503,420) $ 1.33\nForfeited and retired (325,000) $ 1.19\nUnvested as of September 30, 2024 3,739,232 $ 2.05\nStock-based Compensation Expense\nStock-based compensation expense for all stock awards recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss is as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSelling, general and administrative $ 1,985,471 $ 1,978,904 $ 6,052,357 $ 6,311,890\nResearch and development 82,619 92,886 247,403 278,686\nTotal $ 2,068,090 $ 2,071,790 $ 6,299,760 $ 6,590,576\n14. Net Loss Per Share\nThe Company has reported losses since inception and has computed basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders by dividing net loss attributable to\ncommon stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding for the period, without consideration for potentially dilutive securities. The\nCompany computes diluted net loss per share of Common Stock after giving consideration to all potentially dilutive shares of common stock, including options to purchase\ncommon stock and warrants to purchase common stock, outstanding during the period determined using the treasury-stock and if-converted methods, except where the effect\nof including such securities would be antidilutive. Because the Company has reported net losses since inception, these potential shares of Common Stock have been anti-\ndilutive and basic and diluted loss per share were the same for all periods presented.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet loss attributable to ASP Isotopes Inc. shareholders\nbefore deemed dividend on warrant to purchase common\nstock $ (7,271,239) $ (4,222,483) $ (23,152,249) $ (12,123,907)\nDeemed dividend on warrant to purchase common stock — — (2,779,659) —\nNet loss attributable to ASP Isotopes Inc. shareholders $ (7,271,239) $ (4,222,483) $ (25,931,908) $ (12,123,907)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average common stock outstanding, basic and\ndiluted 61,532,172 31,147,749 51,779,067 29,954,321\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted $ (0.12) $ (0.14) $ (0.50) $ (0.40)\n25\nThe following table sets forth the potentially dilutive securities that have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because to include them\nwould be anti-dilutive:\nAs of September 30,\n2024 2023\nOptions to purchase common stock 2,731,000 2,814,333\nWarrants to purchase common stock 1,446,519 3,386,076\nUnvested restricted stock 3,739,232 6,415,874\nTotal shares of common stock equivalents 7,916,751 12,616,283\n15. Income Taxes\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.2%. The Company had no income tax expense due to operating losses\nincurred for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as the Company had a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset. The effective tax rate for the three\nmonth period ended September 30, 2024 varied from the federal statutory rate primarily due to losses in jurisdictions for which a valuation allowance is recorded.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.2%. The Company had no income tax expense due to operating losses incurred\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as the Company had a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 varied from the federal statutory rate primarily due to losses in jurisdictions for which a valuation allowance is recorded.\nThe Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including\nresolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be\nrecognized. The Company’s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company had no accrual for interest and\npenalties on the Company’s balance sheets and has not recognized interest and/or penalties in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Subsequent\nchanges in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution\nof an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. As of September 30, 2024, there were no uncertain tax\npositions.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company did not recognize any interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits. Due to net operating losses incurred,\ntax years from inception remain open to examination by the Federal and State taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. The Company is not currently under\nInternal Revenue Services (IRS), state or local tax examination.\nOwnership changes, as defined in the IRC, may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income\npursuant to IRC Section 382 or similar provisions. Subsequent ownership changes could further affect the limitation in future years. The Company has not completed a study\nto assess whether a change of control has occurred or whether there have been multiple changes of control since the Company’s formation due to the significant complexity\nand cost associated with such study and because there could be additional changes in control in the future. As a result, the Company is not able to estimate the effect of the\nchange in control, if any, on the Company’s ability to utilize net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards in the future.\n16. Subsequent Events\nThe Company has evaluated subsequent events through November 13, 2024, the date on which the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements were\nissued and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that require disclosure except as noted in Note 12.\n26\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed consolidated financial\nstatements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this\nQuarterly Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks\nand uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the section entitled “Risk Factors,” our actual results could differ materially from the results\ndescribed in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. You should carefully read the section entitled “Risk Factors” to\ngain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward- looking statements. Please also see the section entitled\n“Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”\nOverview\nWe are a development stage advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes that, if successful, will allow for the enrichment of\nnatural isotopes into higher concentration products, which could be used in several industries. Our proprietary technology, the Aerodynamic Separation Process (“ASP\ntechnology”), originally developed by Klydon Proprietary Ltd (“Klydon”), is designed to enable the production of isotopes used in several industries. Our initial focus is on the\nproduction and commercialization of enriched Carbon-14 (“C-14”), Molybdenum-100 (“Mo-100”) and Silicon-28 (“Si-28”). We have completed an isotope enrichment plant\nfor the enrichment of C-14 located in Pretoria, South Africa and we expect to start commercial supply of C-14 in the first quarter of 2025 assuming timely delivery of the\nfeedstock from the Company’s customer. We anticipate completion and commissioning of a multi-isotope enrichment plant in Pretoria, South Africa in the fourth quarter of\n2024, and we expect to start initial commercial supply of Si-28 in early 2025. In addition, we have started planning additional isotope enrichment plants. We believe the C-14\nwe may produce using the ASP technology could be used in the development of new pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. We believe the Mo-100 we may produce using the\nASP technology could have significant potential advantages for use in the preparation of nuclear imaging agents by radiopharmacies and others in the medical industry. We\nbelieve the Si-28 we may produce using the ASP technology may be used to create advanced semiconductors and in quantum computing. In addition, we are considering the\nfuture development of the ASP technology for the separation of Zinc-68, Xenon-129/136 for potential use in the healthcare end market, Germanium 70/72/74 for possible use in\nthe semiconductor end market, and Chlorine -37 for potential use in the nuclear energy end market.\nWe are also developing Quantum Enrichment technology to produce enriched Ytterbium-176 (“Yb-176”), Nickel-64, Lithium 6, Lithium7 and Uranium-235 (“U-235”).\nQuantum enrichment is an advanced isotope enrichment technique that is currently in development that uses lasers. We believe that the U-235 we may produce using quantum\nenrichment technology may be commercialized as a nuclear fuel component for use in the new generation of HALEU- fueled small modular reactors that are now under\ndevelopment for commercial and government uses. The construction of our first quantum enrichment facility was completed in August 2024, and we produced the first semi-\nfinished material of enriched Yb-176 during the commissioning phase of the plant in October 2024. We expect to be able to achieve a 99.75% enrichment for Yb-176 and offer\nhighly enriched Yb-176 for commercial sale during 2025. We also expect to proceed with the plans to construct Nickel-64 and Lithium- 6/7 quantum enrichment plants with\ntargeted production during 2025.\nOur Subsidiaries\nWe operate principally through our subsidiaries. ASP Isotopes Guernsey Limited (the holding company for subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands, South Africa, Iceland\nand the United Kingdom) is focused on the development and commercialization of high-value, low-volume isotopes for highly specialized end markets (such as C-14, Mo-100,\nand Si-28). ASP Isotopes UK Ltd is the owner of our technology.\nIn September 2023, we formed Quantum Leap Energy LLC, or “QLE,” which also has subsidiaries in the United Kingdom (Quantum Leap Energy Limited) and South\nAfrica (Quantum Leap Energy (Pty) Limited), to focus on the development and commercialization of advanced nuclear fuels such as HALEU and Lithium-6.\nIn addition, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into a strategic relationship with Pet Labs Pharmaceuticals (Pty) Limited (PET Labs) by acquiring a 51%\nownership stake in PET Labs. We anticipate this transaction will allow us to enter the downstream medical isotope production and distribution market. Beginning in 2024,\nprimarily as a result of the increased business activities of QLE, we have two operating segments: (i) nuclear fuels, and (ii) specialist isotopes and related services.\nAlthough no assurance can be given, we plan to spin-out QLE as a separate public company and list the shares of QLE on a U.S. national exchange and distribute a\nportion of QLE’s common equity to ASPI’s stockholders as of a to-be-determined future record date, in each case subject to obtaining applicable approvals and consents and\ncomplying with applicable rules and regulations and public market trading and listing requirements. The regulatory landscape and supply chain for nuclear fuel production\ndiffers significantly from that of medical isotopes, hence we and QLE have different business models and we believe that both companies would benefit if QLE is\nindependently managed and financed.\nIn connection with the anticipated spin-out, in February 2024, we entered into a number of agreements with QLE, including a License Agreement, pursuant to which\nQLE has licensed from us the rights to technologies and methods used to separate Uranium 235 and Lithium 6 (including but not limited to the quantum enrichment and ASP\ntechnologies) in exchange for a perpetual royalty in the amount of 10% of all future QLE revenues, and an EPC Services Framework Agreement, pursuant to which we will\nprovide services for the engineering, procurement and construction of one or more turnkey Uranium-235 and Lithium-6 enrichment facilities in locations to be identified by\nQLE and owned or leased by QLE, and commissioning, start-up and test services for each such facility, subject to the receipt of all applicable regulatory approvals, permits,\nlicenses, authorizations, registrations, certificates, consents, orders, variances and similar rights. In addition, in February 2024, we assigned to QLE certain existing memoranda\nof understanding with U.S.-based small modular reactor companies for the use of Quantum Enrichment for the production of High-Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU).\nThe MOUs provide for substantial financial support for the development of HALEU production facilities that should be capable of supplying metric ton quantities of HALEU\nby 2027.\n27\nHigh-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) Production\nIn October 2024, we entered into a term sheet with TerraPower, LLC related to the construction of a uranium enrichment facility capable of producing HALEU and the\nfuture supply of HALEU to TerraPower. The term sheet contemplates the parties entering into a definitive agreement, pursuant to which TerraPower would provide funding for\nthe construction of a HALEU production facility. In addition, the parties anticipate entering into a long-term supply agreement for HALEU expected to be produced at this\nfacility, pursuant to which the customer would purchase all HALEU produced at the facility over a 10-year period after the expected completion of the facility in 2027. It is\nanticipated that the definitive agreements will be assigned to QLE. Except for binding periods of exclusivity, during which we will not negotiate with third parties for the supply\nof HALEU or work on another ASP technology-based uranium enrichment facility, the term sheet is non-binding and there is no assurance that the parties will enter into\ndefinitive agreements.\nIn November 2024, we entered into a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with The South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (Necsa) to collaborate on the\nresearch, development and ultimately the commercial production of advanced nuclear fuels. Necsa is a state-owned company established by the Republic of South Africa\nNuclear Energy Act in 1999 with a mandate to undertake and promote research and development in the field of nuclear energy and radiation sciences. Necsa is also responsible\nfor processing source material, and co-operating with other institutions on nuclear and related matters. The proposed structure under discussion for the delivery of the objectives\nof the MOU contemplates the formation of a new entity in South Africa with a board of directors consisting of at least two representatives from the Company and Necsa.\nDiscussions between the parties during the last three years have focused on advancing new nuclear fuel to cater especially for small modular reactors as a start and eventually\nthe construction of a nuclear fuel facility for the production of HALEU. It is anticipated that the research, development and ultimate construction of a HALEU production\nfacility will take place at Pelindaba in Pretoria, South Africa. Pelindaba is South Africa’s main nuclear research center and is the home of the 20MW research nuclear reactor,\nSAFARI-1, which over the last several years has become one of the world’s largest suppliers of Molybdenum-99 and other radioisotopes.\nFinancings\nOn November 15, 2022, we completed an IPO of our common stock and issued and sold 1,250,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $4.00 per\nshare, resulting in net proceeds of $3.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\nIn March 2023, we issued 3,164,557 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $1.58 per share and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,164,557 shares\nof our common stock with an exercise price of $1.75 per share for gross proceeds of $5.0 million.

The Klydon license agreement was royalty-free, had a term of 999 years and was worldwide for the development of the ASP technology and the distribution,\nmarketing and sale of isotopes. Future production of isotopes is limited to member countries of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. In connection with the Klydon license agreement,\nwe agreed to make an upfront payment of $100,000 (to be included within the payments we made under the Turnkey Contract (described below) and deferred payments of\n$300,000 over 24 months. Effective April 4, 2023, pursuant to the Acknowledgement of Debt Agreement described below, we acquired the ASP technology, among other\nthings, from Klydon, and the Klydon license agreement is no longer in effect.\nTurnkey Contract. On November 1, 2021, ASP South Africa and Klydon, as the contractor, entered into a contract under which Klydon has been appointed to supply to\nASP South Africa a complete turnkey isotope enrichment plant (the “Turnkey Contract”). The activities to be undertaken or performed by Klydon include: taking control of the\nassets acquired in the Molybdos Business Rescue Auction; the design of an isotope enrichment facility; the supply of components, equipment and labor required for the\nconstruction; the installation, testing and commissioning of the isotope enrichment plant; securing all required approvals, regulatory authorizations and other required consents\nfor the operation of the plant; providing training to local ASP Isotopes South Africa (Proprietary) Limited personnel to enable them to operate the plant going forward; and\nproviding warranties in relation to the performance targets of the plant which are required to be met. Klydon was responsible for liaising with the relevant South African\nauthorities, including the South African Non Proliferation Council, the Nuclear Suppliers Group and International Atomic Energy Agency to ensure that the Turnkey Contract\nand the isotope enrichment plant are compliant with international laws and guidelines.\nAcknowledgement of Debt Agreement. Klydon performed a portion of the services required under the Turnkey Contract described above; however, services were\nincomplete and many of the services were not completed within the time frame required. As a result, Klydon and ASP South Africa entered into an Acknowledgement of Debt\nAgreement dated November 30, 2022, whereby Klydon (i) agreed to pledge its assets (the “Pledged Assets”) to ASP South Africa to secure its performance of the Turnkey\nContract by December 31, 2022, and (ii) acknowledged that ASP South Africa would suffer damages in the amount of $6,050,000 (“Damage Amount”) should it fail to\nperform. Under the Acknowledgement of Debt Agreement, the Pledged Assets would serve as collateral for Klydon’s obligation to pay the Damage Amount should Klydon fail\nto perform. In connection therewith, also on November 30, 2022, ASP South Africa and Klydon entered into a Deed of Security Agreement whereby, if Klydon failed to\ncomplete its obligations under the Turnkey Contract by December 31, 2022, all of Klydon’s rights of any nature to and interests of any nature in the Pledged Assets would be\ntransferred to ASP South Africa. Klydon failed to complete its obligations under the Turnkey Contract by December 31, 2022.\n29\nOn April 4, 2023, we perfected our interests in the assets under the Acknowledgement of Debt Agreement, pursuant to which we acquired the Pledged Assets, including\ncertain intellectual property, from Klydon and settled all amounts due to Klydon, including the ZAR 6,000,000 for the acquisition of the Silicon-28 plant assets.\nOther Commercial Agreements\nBelow is a summary of the key terms of our other commercial agreements.\nLease for Molybdenum Processing Plant. On October 12, 2021, ASP South Africa entered into an agreement of lease with the landlord of the facility located at 33\nEland Street, Koedoespoort Industrial, Pretoria where we operate our Molybdenum processing plant where gaseous Molybdenum compound will be treated (which process\ncomprises several stages of compression and expansion during which the product is purified). The term of the lease ends on December 31, 2030.\nLease for additional production space. On April 1, 2023, ASP South Africa entered into an agreement of lease with the landlord of facility located in Pretoria where we\nplan to perform production activities. The initial term of the lease was set to end on March 31, 2024. We entered into a new agreement of lease with the landlord. The terms of\nthe new lease ends on February 28, 2026.\nLease for additional laboratory space. On November 1, 2023, ASP South Africa entered into an agreement of lease with the landlord of the facility located in Pretoria\nwhere we perform research and development activities. The term of the lease ends on October 30, 2026.\nLease for PET Labs operations. Commencing with our acquisition of PET Labs in October 2023, this facility has an initial term set to expire in March 2026 with\nautomatic monthly extensions thereafter. This space is used for office and production activities.\nLease for additional PET Labs operations. Commencing with our acquisition of PET Labs in October 2023, this facility had an initial term which expired in December\n2023 and is currently under automatic monthly extensions. This space is used for production activities.\nPolitical Risk Insurance Policy with Optio Group. On October 25, 2021, ASP Guernsey entered into a contract of insurance to cover against political risk and\nexpropriation, to off-set the risk of events detrimental to the company occurring in the Republic of South Africa for a period of three years. The insurer is Optio Group Limited\nwhich is 100% underwritten by one or more syndicates at Lloyd’s of London. The specific risks covered in the policy are: (i) permanent and total abandonment of operations,\n(ii) deprivation of assets or shareholding, (iii) physical damage due to political violence, (iv) non-transfer or inconvertibility, (v) business interruption, (vi) non-honouring of\narbitration award, and (vii) crisis management support. The limit of cover is equal to or in excess of the projected amount of investment required to complete the initial stage of\nthe first planned Molybdenum enrichment plant. The limit of cover is capable of being increased and extended by mutual agreement with the insurer.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nEffective with the acquisition of 51% of PET Labs, the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold associated with the sale of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning consist of labor, delivery and materials.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of (i) research and development expenses and (ii) selling, general and administrative expenses.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of direct and indirect costs incurred in connection with the development activities for our future isotopes.\nDirect costs include:\n•external research and development expenses; and\n•costs related to designing the development processes of isotope production.\nIndirect costs include:\n•personnel-related costs, which include salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and other employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense,\nfor personnel engaged in research and development functions; and\n•facilities and other various expenses.\nResearch and development expenses are recognized as incurred and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are\ncapitalized until the goods or services are received.\nAs described above, Klydon charged us for expenses associated with these research and development functions under the Turnkey Contract. We expect that our research\nand development expenses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our future isotopes. We cannot determine with certainty the\ntiming of initiation, the duration or the completion costs of development activities. Actual development timelines, the probability of success and development costs can differ\nmaterially from expectations.\n30\nWe may need to raise substantial additional capital in the future. In addition, we cannot forecast which future isotopes may be subject to future collaborations, when\nsuch arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements.\nOur research and development expenses may vary significantly based on a variety of factors, such as:\n•the scope, rate of progress, expense and results of our development activities;\n•the phase of development of our future isotopes;\n•the timing, receipt, and terms of any approvals from applicable regulatory authorities including the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities;\n•significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance;\n•the cost and timing of designing the development processes of isotope production;\n•the extent to which we establish additional strategic collaborations or other arrangements; and\n•the impact of any business interruptions to our operations or to those of the third parties with whom we work.\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our future isotopes could significantly change the costs and timing\nassociated with the development of that future isotope.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, which include salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and other employee-\nrelated costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel in executive, sales, finance and other administrative functions. Other significant costs include legal\nfees relating to corporate matters, professional fees for accounting and consulting services and facility-related costs.\nWe expect that our ongoing selling, general and administrative expenses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future to support our increased research and\ndevelopment activities and increased costs of operating as a public company and in building our internal resources. These increased costs will include increased expenses related\nto audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance premiums\nand investor and public relations costs associated with operating as a public company.\nSegment Information\nAs of December 31, 2023, we managed our operations as a single segment, specialist isotopes and related services. Beginning in 2024, primarily as a result of the\nincreased business activities of our subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC, we have two operating segments: (i) nuclear fuels, and (ii) specialist isotopes and related services.\nThe nuclear fuels segment is focused on research and development of technologies and methods used to produce high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) and\nLithium-6 for the advanced nuclear fuels target end market.\nThe specialist isotopes and related services segment is focused on research and development of technologies and methods used to separate high-value, low-volume\nisotopes (such as C-14, Mo-100 and Si-28) for highly specialized target end markets other than advanced nuclear fuels, including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, nuclear\nmedical imaging and semiconductors, as well as services related to these isotopes, and this segment includes PET Labs.\nThe financial information is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources. Our CODM is our chief\nexecutive officer.\nWe manage assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as the assets are shared or commingled. Therefore, the chief operating decision maker does not\nregularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, asset information is not reported on a segment basis.\nSelect information from the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\nNet Loss Before Allocation to Noncontrolling\nRevenues Interest\nThree Months Ended September 30, Three Months Ended September 30,\nSegment 2024 2023 2024 2023\nSpecialist isotopes and related services $ 1,087,695 $ — $ (3,722,764) $ (4,222,483)\nNuclear fuels — — ) —\n(3,632,625\n$ 1,087,695 $ — $ (7,355,389) $ (4,222,483)\nSelect information from the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\nNet Loss Before Allocation to Noncontrolling\nRevenues Interest\nNine Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\nSegment 2024 2023 2024 2023\nSpecialist isotopes and related services $ 2,950,348 $ — $ (14,637,771) $ (12,123,907)\nNuclear fuels (8,563,904\n— — ) —\n$ 2,950,348 $ — $ (23,201,675) $ (12,123,907)\n31\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nRevenue $ 1,087,695 $ —\nCost of goods sold 793,714 —\nGross profit 293,981 —\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development 1,034,446 239,199\nSelling, general and administrative 4,693,158 3,707,311\nTotal operating expenses 5,727,604 3,946,510\nOther (expense) income:\nForeign exchange transaction loss (131,247) —\nChange in fair value of share liability 381,969 (279,425)\nChange in fair value of convertible notes payable (2,692,073) —\nInterest income 602,181 3,452\nInterest expense (90,966) —\nTotal other (expense) income (1,930,136) (275,973)\nLoss before income tax expense $ (7,363,759) $ (4,222,483)\nRevenue and Cost of Goods Sold\nEffective with the acquisition of 51% of PET Labs, we have recognized revenue from the sale of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning for the two month period since\nthe acquisition was effective on October 31, 2023 and December 31, 2023 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

These expenses include $369,136 of personnel-related costs,\nincluding $278,686 in stock-based compensation expense, $150,000 in consulting expenses and $180,277 in facility and other expenses.\nThe increase in personnel-related costs is mainly due to the increase in headcount and related costs. The increase in consulting and professional is due to increased\noutsourced development activity for new specialty isotopes. The increase in facility is due to increase in space dedicated to development.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $17,976,882 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These expenses include $9,048,993 of personnel-related\ncosts, including $6,052,357 in stock-based compensation expense, $4,720,772 of professional services and legal related fees and $4,207,117 in facility and other corporate\nexpenses.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $11,319,465 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These expenses include $7,720,997 of personnel-related\ncosts, including $6,311,890 in stock-based compensation expense, $2,165,926 of professional services and legal related fees and $1,432,542 in facility and other corporate\nexpenses.\nThe increase in personnel-related costs is due to an increase in headcount and salaries. The increase in professional services and legal related fees is mainly due to the\ntiming of corporate activity. The increase in facility and other corporate expenses is mainly due to the expansion of our operations in 2024 and commission and fee expenses\nrelated to the issuance of convertible notes payable.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $4,538,006, which includes a loss of $5,220,599 due to change in fair value of the convertible notes\npayable issued in March and June 2024, partially offset by $657,899 of interest income and a gain of $327,969 due to change in fair value of share liability.\n33\nOther expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $105,029, which includes a $109,040 change in the fair value of the share liability related to the\nshares issuable to a placement agent and other consultants.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nWe have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing net losses for the\nforeseeable future. We have principally financed our operations to date through the issuance of our common stock, including our IPO, subsequent common stock offerings and\nthe issuance of convertible notes payable. In July 2024, we issued 13,800,000 in a public offering at a public offering price of $2.50 per share resulting in net proceeds of\napproximately $32.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. In November 2024, we issued an additional 2,754,250 shares of\ncommon stock in a public offering at a public offering price of $6.75 per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately $17.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts,\ncommissions and offering expenses.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $51,571,540. We have not generated any revenue from the sale of our enriched isotopes, and our ability\nto generate product revenue from the sale of enriched isotopes sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of\none or more of our current or future enriched isotopes.\nEffective with the acquisition of 51% of PET Labs Pharmaceuticals on October 31, 2023, we have begun to recognize revenue from the sale of nuclear medical doses for\nPET scanning in South Africa. Our ability to generate product revenue from the sale of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on\nthe successful expansion of production capabilities and commercialization of the results of that expansion.\nFuture Funding Requirements\nBased on our current operating plan, we estimate that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure\nrequirements through at least the next 12 months from the date the financial statements are issued. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial\nresources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based\nthis estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of developing isotopes is\ncostly, and the timing of progress and expenses in these development activities is uncertain.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n•the type, number, scope, progress, expansions, results, costs and timing of, our development activities for our future isotopes;\n•the outcome, timing and costs of regulatory review of our future isotopes;\n•the costs and timing of manufacturing for our future isotopes;\n•our efforts to enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel to satisfy our obligations as a public company, including enhanced internal controls over\nfinancial reporting;\n•the costs associated with hiring additional personnel and consultants as our preclinical and clinical activities increase;\n•the costs and timing of establishing or securing sales and marketing and distribution capabilities, whether alone or with third parties, to commercialize future\nisotopes for which we may obtain regulatory approval, if any;\n•our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share and revenue for any\napproved products;\n•the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements;\n•the costs of obtaining, expanding, maintaining and enforcing our patent and other intellectual property rights; and\n•costs associated with any products or technologies that we may in-license or acquire.\nDeveloping isotopes is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never achieve the necessary results required or\nobtain applicable regulatory approval for any isotopes or generate revenue from the sale of any future isotopes (assuming applicable regulatory approval is received). In\naddition, our future isotopes (assuming applicable regulatory approval is received) may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from\nsales of isotopes that we expect to be commercially available in substantial quantities in the last quarter of 2024. If we receive permits and licenses to enrich U-235 (which in\nitself is highly uncertain), we do not expect U-235 to be commercially available for at least several years, if ever. As a result, we may need substantial additional financing to\nsupport our continuing operations and further the development of and commercialization of our future isotopes.\nExpansion of the production and distribution of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that may take years to\ncomplete. As a result, we may need substantial additional financing to support our continuing operations and further the development of and commercialization of future\nnuclear medical doses for PET scanning.\nUntil such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our future isotopes or nuclear medical doses for PET scanning, if ever, we expect to finance our\ncash needs through public or private equity or debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. However, we\nmay be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely\nimpacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide\nresulting severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, increased interest rates, inflationary pressures, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth,\nincreases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. The financial markets and the global economy may also be adversely affected by the current or\nanticipated impact of military conflict. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our\nstockholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences\n34\nthat adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or\nrestricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, or\nother similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our future isotopes, future revenue streams or research programs or may have to grant\nlicenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings\nwhen needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our\nfuture isotopes even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market such isotopes ourselves.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ (12,935,554) $ (3,355,171)\nInvesting activities (8,352,422) (1,190,157)\nFinancing activities 64,841,207 4,493,610\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 43,553,231 $ (51,718)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $12,935,554 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and was primarily due to our net loss of $23,201,675, adjusted for\nstock-based compensation expense of $6,299,760, non-cash issuance costs for the convertible notes payable of $621,915, amortization of right-of-use asset of $343,473,\ndepreciation expense of $425,630, issuance of common stock to a consultant with a fair value of $783,200, change in fair values for the convertible notes payable of $5,220,599\nand a $3,071,004 change in our operating assets and liabilities.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $3,355,171 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and was primarily due to our net loss of $12,123,907, adjusted for\nstock-based compensation expense of $6,590,576, expense related to the issuance of common stock to consultants of $669,700, a change in fair value of share liability of\n$109,040 and amortization of right-of-use asset of $49,173, partially offset by a $1,349,278 change in our operating assets and liabilities.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $8,352,422 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and was comprised of the purchases of machinery and equipment,\nvehicles and construction in progress.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1,190,157 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and was comprised of additional construction in progress.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $64,841,207 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and was comprised primarily of gross proceeds of\n$34,500,000 from issuance of common stock, gross proceeds of $25,936,228 from the issuance of convertible notes payable, proceeds of $5,537,975 from the issuance of\ncommon stock for a warrant exercise, contributions from noncontrolling interest in VIE of $891,479, proceeds from collection of receivable from noncontrolling interest in VIE\nof $706,774, partially offset by costs to issue common stock of $2,194,041, payments of $438,569 on the note payable related to a financed corporate insurance policy, payment\nof principal portion of finance leases of $38,347 and distribution to noncontrolling interest in VIE of $60,292.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $4,493,610 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and was comprised primarily of net proceeds of $4,493,610\nfrom the sale and issuance of 3,164,557 shares of our common stock in March 2023.\n35\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe lease our main facility in Pretoria, South Africa under a lease with a base monthly rent payment of approximately $8,000 with a term expiring on December 31,\n2030. We also lease additional space in Pretoria, South Africa under a lease with a base monthly rent payment of approximately $16,000 with a term that expires on February\n28, 2026.

These contracts do not contain any\nminimum purchase commitments and generally provide for termination after a notice period and, therefore, are not considered long-term contractual obligations. Payments due\nupon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided and expenses incurred up to the date of cancellation.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements which discusses new accounting pronouncements.\n36\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures as of March 31, 2024. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, mean controls and other\nprocedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls include, without limitation, controls and procedures\ndesigned to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company on the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to\nmanagement, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their\nobjectives, and management necessarily applies its judgement in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as a result of a material weakness\nidentified in our internal control over financial reporting, as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K (as amended) for the year ended December 31, 2023, our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. In order to remediate the material weakness, management expects to hire additional accounting\nand finance resources or consultants with public company experience.\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during our\nmost recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Effective July 1,\n2024, we hired a new Chief Financial Officer in order to address the internal control environment.\n37\nPART II-OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nFrom time to time, we may be a party to litigation or subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be\npredicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the\noutcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. We are not currently a party\nto any material legal proceedings.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, including under the heading “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” the risks and\nuncertainties which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects that we believe are most important for you to\nconsider are discussed in “Part II, Item 1A—Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 10, 2024\nand as amended by Forms 10-K/A filed with the SEC on April 29, 2024 and July 1, 2024. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2023 (as amended) are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our\nbusiness operations. There are no material changes to the Risk Factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (as amended).\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nNone.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNone.\nItem 5. Other Information.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of ours adopted or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1\ntrading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\n38\nItem 6.

As used herein, the “Effective Date” of this Agreement shall mean July 1, 2024 or such earlier date as\nmutually agreed to by Executive and the Company.\nW I T N E S S E T H:\nWHEREAS, the Executive desires to be employed by the Company as its Chief Financial Officer and the Company wishes to employ the Executive in such\ncapacity commencing on and as of the Effective Date.\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and their respective covenants and agreements contained in this document, the Company and the Executive\nhereby agree as follows:\n1.Employment and Duties. The Company agrees to employ, and the Executive agrees to serve as, the Chief Financial Officer of the Company. In such capacity, the\nExecutive shall have such duties, authorities and responsibilities commensurate with the duties, authorities and responsibilities customary to this position and such other duties\nand responsibilities as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and/or the Board of Directors of the Company (“Board”) may from time to time assign to the Executive.\nThe Executive shall devote her full business time and attention to the Company and its subsidiaries. Nothing in this Section 1 shall prohibit the\nExecutive from: (A) serving as a director or member of any other board, committee thereof of any other entity or organization; (B) delivering lectures, fulfilling speaking\nengagements, and any writing or publication relating to her area of expertise; (C) serving as a director or trustee of any governmental, charitable or educational organization; or\n(D) engaging in additional activities in connection with personal investments and community affairs, including, without limitation, professional or charitable or similar\norganization committees, boards, memberships or similar associations or affiliations, provided, however, in each case, such activities (1) do not interfere with the Executive’s\nduties, authorities and responsibilities as the Chief Financial Officer of the Company; (2) are not in competition with the business and affairs of the Company; or (3) are subject\nto approval in advance by the Board.\n2.Term. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for a period of one (1) year following the Effective Date and shall be\nautomatically renewed for successive one (1) year periods thereafter unless either party provides the other party with written notice of her or its intention not to renew this\nAgreement at least three (3) months prior to the expiration of the initial term or any renewal term of this Agreement, or until terminated in accordance with the provisions of\nSection 10 of this Agreement. “Employment Period” shall mean the period of Executive’s actual employment with the Company during the initial one (1)-year term plus one\n(1)-year renewals, if any.\n3.Place of Employment. The Executive’s services shall be performed at such location or locations as the Executive and the Chief Executive Officer shall determine,\nby mutual agreement. The Executive acknowledges that a significant amount of travel may be required.\n4.Base Salary. The Company agrees to pay the Executive a base salary (“Base Salary”) of US$400,000 per annum. Annual adjustments after the first year of the\nEmployment Period shall be determined by the Board. The Base Salary shall be paid in periodic installments in accordance with the Company’s regular payroll practices and\nsubject to required withholding and deductions.\n5.Incentive Compensation and Bonuses.\n(a)Annual Bonus: For each fiscal year during the term of employment, the Executive shall be eligible to receive a bonus (the “Annual Bonus”), if any, in\nthe target amount of fifty percent (50%) of Base Salary, with the amount of such bonus determined from time to time by the Compensation Committee or the Board in its\ndiscretion. The Annual Bonus, if any, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive promptly after determination that the relevant targets, if any, have been met, it being\nunderstood that the attainment of any financial targets associated with any bonus shall not be determined until following the completion of the Company’s annual audit and\npublic announcement of such results. Annual Bonuses may be paid in a mixture of cash and Common Stock, the ratio of which will be determined by the Compensation\nCommittee or the Board in its discretion. The number of shares granted in the Common Stock portion of the Annual Bonus (if any) shall be determined by dividing the value of\nthe Common Stock portion of the Annual Bonus by either (i) the fair market value per share of Common Stock, as determined in good faith by the Board, or (ii) the closing sale\nprice of the Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the applicable payment date, as reported by the principal trading market for the Common Stock.\n(b)Equity Awards and Incentive Compensation: During the term of employment, the Executive shall be eligible to participate in any equity-based\nincentive compensation plan or program adopted by the Company (such awards under such plan or program, the “Share Awards”) as the Compensation Committee or Board\nmay from time to time determine.

Effective as of the Effective Date, the Board of Directors of the Company shall, as a material inducement to the\nExecutive’s commencement of employment, award 400,000 shares of common stock which shall vest (subject to compliance with the vesting conditions set forth in the\nCompany’s 2024 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan and applicable award agreement) in eight equal semi-annual installments over a four-year period beginning on the six-\nmonth anniversary of the Effective Date.\n6.Severance Compensation:\nUpon termination of employment for any reason other than the Executive’s voluntary resignation pursuant to Section 10(e)(i) or termination for Cause\npursuant to Section 10(c), the Executive shall receive her Accrued Benefits (as defined in Section 10(e)(i)) and will also be entitled to (A) a pro rata portion of the Executive’s\nBase Salary up to the date of termination, (B) all Share Awards earned and vested prior to the date of termination. With respect to any Share Awards held by the Executive as of\nher death, Disability or termination without Cause after the initial one (1)-year term, that are not vested and exercisable as of such date, the Company shall fully accelerate the\nvesting and exercisability of such Share Awards, so that all such Share Awards shall be fully vested and exercisable as of the Executive’s termination, such options (as well as\nany Share Awards that previously became vested and exercisable) to remain exercisable, notwithstanding anything in any other agreement governing such options, until the\nearlier of (X) a period of one (1) year after the Executive’s termination or (Y) the original term of the option, if such Share Awards are an option. For the avoidance of doubt,\nthe provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall not be applicable in the event of the Executive’s voluntary resignation pursuant to Section 10(e)(i) or if the Company\nterminates this Agreement and the Executive’s employment with the Company without Cause during the initial one (1)-year term.\nThe Executive may continue coverage with respect to the Company’s group health plans as permitted by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget\nReconciliation Act of 1985 (“COBRA”) for himself and each of her “Qualified Beneficiaries” as defined by COBRA (“COBRA Coverage”). Upon the Executive’s termination\nof employment for any reason other than Executive’s voluntary resignation pursuant to Section 10(e)(i) or termination for Cause pursuant to Section 10(c), the Company shall\nreimburse the amount of any COBRA premium paid for COBRA Coverage timely elected by and for the Executive and any Qualified Beneficiary of the Executive, and not\notherwise reimbursed, during the period that ends on the earliest of (x) the date the Executive or the Qualified Beneficiary, as the case may be, ceases to be eligible for COBRA\nCoverage, (y) the last day of the consecutive eighteen (18) month period following the date of the Executive’s termination of employment and (z) the date the Executive or the\nQualified Beneficiary, as the case may be, is covered by another group health plan. To reimburse any COBRA premium payment under this paragraph, the Company must\nreceive documentation of the COBRA premium payment within ninety (90) days of its payment.\nThe payment to the Executive of any amounts or benefits arising as a result of the termination of the Executive’s employment are conditional upon the\nexecution by the Executive of a full and final release of all claims and possible claims, in a form acceptable to the Company. Such full and final release shall include provisions\nrequiring the affirmation of the continuance of the Employee's obligations following the end of her employment as\n2\noutlined in this Agreement.\n7.Expenses. The Executive shall be entitled to prompt reimbursement by the Company for all reasonable ordinary and necessary travel, entertainment, and other\nexpenses incurred by the Executive while employed (in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the Company for its senior executive officers) in the\nperformance of her duties and responsibilities under this Agreement; provided, that the Executive shall properly account for such expenses in accordance with Company\npolicies and procedures.\n8.Other Benefits. During the term of this Agreement, the Executive shall be eligible to participate in incentive, stock purchase, savings, retirement (401(k)), and\nwelfare benefit plans, including, without limitation, health, medical, dental, vision, life (including accidental death and dismemberment) and disability insurance plans\n(collectively, “Benefit Plans”), in substantially the same manner and at substantially the same levels as the Company makes such opportunities available to the Company’s\nmanagerial or salaried executive employees and/or its senior executives.\nThe Company shall pay one hundred percent (100%) of the cost for any group medical, vision and/or dental coverage elected by and for the Executive\nand one hundred (100%) of the additional incremental cost for any group medical, vision and/or dental coverage elected by the Executive for the Executive’s family.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Company reserves the right to impose an employee contribution requirement for health insurance premiums, and (ii) to extent payment of\nsuch cost will result in a violation of the nondiscrimination rules of Section 105(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or any statute or\nregulation of similar effect, then the parties shall negotiate in good faith an alternative arrangement that places the Executive in substantially the same after-tax position. In\naddition, the Company reserves the right to change its employee benefit plan design and administration.\nThe Executive shall be entitled to air travel, as is reasonable and necessary for the performance of her duties and responsibilities, in accordance with the\nCompany’s policies as approved by the Board.\n9.Vacation. During the term of this Agreement, the Executive shall be entitled to accrue, on a pro rata basis, twenty (20) paid vacation days per year. Vacation shall\nbe taken at such times as are mutually convenient to the Executive and the Company and no more than ten (10) consecutive days shall be taken at any one time without\nCompany approval in advance. The Executive shall not be entitled to carry over any accrued, unused vacation days from year to year.\n10.Termination of Employment:\n(a)Death. If the Executive dies during the Employment Period, this Agreement and the Executive’s employment with the Company shall automatically\nterminate on such date and the Company’s obligations to the Executive’s estate and to the Executive’s Qualified Beneficiaries shall be those set forth in Section 6 regarding\nseverance compensation.\n(b)Disability. If during the term of this Agreement the Executive shall be prevented from performing her essential functions hereunder to the full extent\nrequired by the Company by reason of Disability (as defined below), this Agreement and the Executive’s employment with the Company shall automatically terminate. The\nCompany’s obligation to the Executive under such circumstances shall be those set forth in Section 6 regarding severance compensation.

Business\nOverview\nWe are a development stage advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes that, if successful, will allow for the enrichment of\nnatural isotopes into higher concentration products, which could be used in several industries. Our proprietary technology, the Aerodynamic Separation Process (“ASP\ntechnology”), originally developed by Klydon Proprietary Ltd (“Klydon”), is designed to enable the production of isotopes used in several industries. Our initial focus is on the\nproduction and commercialization of enriched Carbon-14 (“C-14”), Molybdenum-100 (“Mo-100”) and Silicon-28 (“Si-28”). We have commissioned an isotope enrichment\nplant for the enrichment of C-14 located in Pretoria, South Africa, which will be ready for production upon the final installation of essential components. We anticipate\ncompletion and commissioning of a multi-isotope enrichment plant in Pretoria, South Africa in mid-2024. In addition, we have started planning additional isotope enrichment\nplants. We believe the C-14 we may produce using the ASP technology could be used in the development of new pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. We believe the Mo-100\nwe may produce using the ASP technology could have significant potential advantages for use in the preparation of nuclear imaging agents by radiopharmacies and others in the\nmedical industry. We believe the Si-28 we may produce using the ASP technology may be used to create advanced semiconductors and in quantum computing. In addition, we\nare considering the future development of the ASP technology for the separation of Zinc-68, Xenon-129/136 for potential use in the healthcare end market, Germanium\n70/72/74 for possible use in the semiconductor end market, and Chlorine -37 for potential use in the nuclear energy end market.\nWe are also developing Quantum Enrichment technology to produce enriched Ytterbium-176, Nickel-64, Lithium 6, Lithium7 and Uranium-235 (“U-235”). Quantum\nenrichment is an advanced isotope enrichment technique that is currently in development that uses lasers. We believe that the U-235 we may produce using quantum\nenrichment technology may be commercialized as a nuclear fuel component for use in the new generation of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU)-fueled small modular\nreactors that are now under development for commercial and government uses.\n4\nTable of Contents\nThe aerodynamic separation technique has its origins in the South African uranium enrichment program in the 1980s, and the ASP technology has been developed\nduring the last 18 years by the scientists at Klydon. In Klydon’s testing, the ASP technology has demonstrated efficacy and commercial scalability in enriching oxygen-18 and\nsilicon-28. ASP Isotopes Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in September 2021 to acquire assets and license intellectual property rights related to the production of Mo-100\nusing the ASP technology. In January 2022, we also licensed intellectual property rights associated with the production of U-235 using the ASP technology. In July 2022, we\nlicensed intellectual property rights related to the production of all isotopes using the ASP technology. In April 2023, we acquired certain intellectual property assets of Klydon.\nWe operate principally through subsidiaries: ASP Isotopes Guernsey Limited (the holding company of ASP Isotopes South Africa (Proprietary) Limited and\nEnlightened Isotopes (Pty) Ltd), which will be focused on the development and commercialization of high-value, low-volume isotopes for highly specialized end markets (such\nas C-14, Mo-100, and Si-28). In September 2023, we formed a new subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC, which also has a subsidiary in the United Kingdom (Quantum Leap\nEnergy Ltd), to focus on the development and commercialization of advanced nuclear fuels such as HALEU and Lithium-6. ASP Isotopes UK Ltd is the owner of our\ntechnology. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into a strategic relationship with Pet Labs Pharmaceuticals Proprietary Limited (PET Labs) by acquiring a 51%\nownership stake in PET Labs. We anticipate this transaction will allow us to enter the downstream medical isotope production and distribution market.\nOur corporate structure and ownership of our subsidiaries is set forth in the chart below:\nRecent Events and Key Milestones\nOffering of Convertible Notes of Quantum Leap Energy LLC\nOn February 29, 2024, our wholly owned subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC (“QLE”), entered into a Convertible Note Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase\nAgreement”) with certain institutional and individual investors (collectively, the “Purchasers”), to issue and sell to the Purchasers convertible promissory notes of QLE (the\n“QLE Notes”) in an offering to non-U.S. persons outside of the United States under Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The closing\nof the offering of QLE Notes occurred on March 7, 2024 and resulted in gross proceeds to QLE of approximately $20.5 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from the\nQLE Notes offering for planning, development and construction of QLE’s laser enrichment production facilities and for other general corporate purposes.\nWe engaged Ocean Wall Limited (the “Placement Agent”) to act as QLE’s sole placement agent in connection with the offering of QLE Notes, pursuant to a placement\nagency agreement (the “Placement Agent Agreement”), dated as of February 29, 2024, between the Company, QLE and the Placement Agent. Pursuant to the Placement Agent\nAgreement, QLE agreed to pay the Placement Agent a fee equal to 5.0% of the gross proceeds received by QLE from the sale of QLE Notes, which was paid 50% in cash and\n50% in the form of a convertible promissory note in substantially the same form and with substantially the same terms as the QLE Notes.\n5\nTable of Contents\nIn connection with the offering of QLE Notes, on February 29, 2024, QLE and the Purchasers entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights\nAgreement”). Under the Registration Rights Agreement, all units or shares of QLE common equity issuable upon conversion of the QLE Notes will be deemed “Registrable\nSecurities.” Under the Registration Rights Agreement holders of the QLE Notes have been granted certain long-form and short-form demand registration rights with respect to\nthe Registrable Securities, including the right to demand an initial public offering (IPO) if QLE has not gone public within five years of the date of the agreement. In addition,\nholders of the QLE Notes have been granted piggyback registration rights with respect to the Registrable Securities. Certain cash penalties will apply to QLE in the event of\nregistration failures, as described in the Registration Rights Agreement.\nIntercompany Agreements between ASP Isotopes Inc. and Quantum Leap Energy LLC\nIn anticipation of the closing of the offering of QLE Notes, the Company: (1) caused ASP Isotopes UK Limited to enter into a License Agreement, dated as of February\n16, 2024, among ASP Isotopes UK Limited, as licensor, and QLE and Quantum Leap Energy Limited (QLE’s UK subsidiary), as licensee, pursuant to which, among other\nthings, the licensee has licensed from the Company the rights to technologies and methods used to separate Uranium-235 and Lithium-6 (including but not limited to the\nquantum enrichment and ASP technologies) in exchange for a royalty payment in the amount of 10% of QLE revenues (the “License Agreement”); (2) entered into an EPC\nServices Framework Agreement, dated as of February 16, 2024, with QLE, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company has agreed to provide services for the\nengineering, procurement and construction of one or more turnkey Uranium-235 and Lithium-6 enrichment facilities in locations to be identified by QLE and owned or leased\nby QLE, and to commission, start-up and test each such facility, in each case subject to the receipt of all applicable regulatory approvals, permits, licenses, authorizations,\nregistrations, certificates, consents, orders, variances and similar rights (the “EPC Services Agreement”); and (3) effective as of February 16, 2024, assigned to QLE certain\nexisting memoranda of understandings between the Company and certain small modular reactor companies.\nShare Purchase Agreement relating to PET Labs\nOn October 31, 2023, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Nucleonics Imaging Proprietary Limited, a company incorporated in the Republic of South\nAfrica (the “Seller”), relating to the purchase and sale of ordinary shares in the issued share capital of Pet Labs Pharmaceuticals Proprietary Limited, a company incorporated in\nthe Republic of South Africa (“PET Labs”). PET Labs is a South African radiopharmaceutical operations company, dedicated to nuclear medicine and the science of\nradiopharmaceutical production.\nUnder the Purchase Agreement, we have agreed to purchase from the Seller 51 ordinary shares in the issued share capital of PET Labs (the “Initial Sale Shares”)\n(representing 51% of the issued share capital of PET Labs) and we have an option to purchase from the Seller the remaining 49 ordinary shares in the issued share capital of\nPET Labs (the “Option Shares”) (representing the remaining 49% of the issued share capital of PET Labs). We agreed to pay to the Seller an aggregate of $2,000,000 for the\nInitial Sale Shares, of which aggregate amount $500,000 was paid on the completion of the sale of the Initial Sale Shares and $1,500,000 is payable on demand after one\ncalendar year from the agreement date. If we exercise our option to purchase the Option Shares (which option is exercisable from the agreement date until January 31, 2027,\nprovided that the Initial Sale Shares have been paid for in full), we have agreed to pay an additional $2,200,000 for the Option Shares.\nCompany-Owned ASP Plants\nIn October 2021 and July 2022, we acquired two incomplete ASP plants in Pretoria, South Africa. In September 2021, we obtained the required licenses from the\nnuclear regulators, including the Non-proliferation Council of South Africa, to complete construction of the plants. We have commissioned the isotope enrichment plant for the\nenrichment of C-14, which will be ready for production upon the final installation of essential components. We anticipate completion and commissioning of a multi-isotope\nenrichment plant in Pretoria, South Africa in mid-2024. As of December 31, 2023, we employed 47 persons at this facility.\n6\nTable of Contents\nSupply Contracts\nIn July 2023, we entered into a supply agreement with a U.S. customer to supply a highly enriched metal. This contract has an annual sales value of $9 million, which\nwe expect to realize during 2024. In September 2023, we received a prepayment of approximately $900,000 for this contract.\nIn July 2023, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with a U.S. Small Modular Reactor company to supply HALEU. The MOU focused on\nformalizing a collaboration to develop a HALEU production facility with financial support from the customer.\nIn June 2023, we entered into a multi-year supply agreement with a Canadian Customer for the supply of Carbon-14, which will be produced from our facility that was\ncompleted in March 2023. The customer will supply carbon-14 in the form of carbon-dioxide gas. We will then convert the carbon dioxide gas into methane under a chemical\nconverting contract entered in June 2023. We will then enrich the methane to greater than 85% C-14 under a tolling agreement, also entered in June 2023. Finally, we will\nconvert the enriched methane back into enriched carbon dioxide under a chemical converting contract. The tolling agreement has a minimum “take or pay” amount of\napproximately $2.5 million per year, supported by a bank letter of guarantee. In September 2023, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the same\ncustomer to separate Deuterium and Tritium currently stored at nuclear sites within Canada. The timing and commercial implications of this MOU are subject to future\nagreement between the parties.\nIn November 2022, our wholly owned subsidiary, ASP Isotopes Guernsey Limited (“ASP Guernsey”), entered into an Amended Agreement with Klydon (Proprietary)\nLtd (“Klydon”) related to a 25-year supply agreement for up to $27 million per annum of highly enriched Molybdenum-100 entered into by and between Klydon and Beijing\nBRICEM Science and Technology Co. Ltd. (“Bricem”) in August 2021 (the “August 2021 Purchase Agreement”). Under the Amended Agreement, Klydon assigned all of its\nrights under the August 2021 Purchase Agreement to ASP Guernsey.\nOur Segments\nAs of December 31, 2023, we managed our operations as a single segment, specialist isotopes and related services. Beginning in 2024, primarily as a result of the\nincreased business activities of our subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC, we will have two operating segments: (i) nuclear fuels, and (ii) specialist isotopes and related\nservices:\n· Nuclear Fuels. This segment is focused on research and development of technologies and methods used to produce high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU)\nand Lithium-6 for the advanced nuclear fuels target end market.\n· Specialist Isotopes and Related Services. This segment is focused on research and development of technologies and methods used to separate high-value, low-\nvolume isotopes (such as C-14, Mo-100 and Si-28) for highly specialized target end markets other than advanced nuclear fuels, including pharmaceuticals and\nagrochemicals, nuclear medical imaging and semiconductors, as well as services related to these isotopes, and this segment includes PET Labs.\nOur Strategy\nComplete development and commissioning of our enrichment facilities in Pretoria, South Africa.\nWe intend to complete the development and construction of our second enrichment facility located in Pretoria, South Africa, in mid-2024. Our first facility, which will\nbe ready for production upon the final installation of essential components, is designed to enrich light isotopes such as Carbon-14. The second facility, which is substantially\nlarger than the first, should have the potential to enrich kilogram quantities of relatively heavier isotopes, including but not limited to Molybdenum-100 and Silicon-28.\nIn October 2021, we acquired physical assets, including equipment, of Molybdos (Pty) Limited (Molybdos) located at the plant after having been declared the winner\nof a competitive auction process under Section 45 of the South Africa Consumer Protection Act, 2008 (the Molybdos Business Rescue Auction). We licensed the ASP\ntechnology for the production of Mo-100 from Klydon. We subsequently entered into a turnkey contract with Klydon, pursuant to which Klydon agreed to provide us with a first\ncommercial-scale isotope enrichment plant. The activities to be undertaken or performed by Klydon included taking control of the assets acquired by us in the Molybdos\nBusiness Rescue Auction; the design of an enrichment facility; the supply of required components, equipment, and labor; the installation, testing, and commissioning of the\nenrichment facility; securing all required approvals, regulatory authorizations and other required consents for the operation of the plant; providing training to local ASP Isotopes\nSouth Africa (Proprietary) Limited personnel to enable them to operate the plant going forward; and providing warranties in relation to the performance targets of the plant\nwhich are required to be met. Klydon was also responsible for liaising with the relevant South African authorities, including the South African Non-Proliferation Council, the\nNuclear Suppliers Group, and International Atomic Energy Agency, to ensure that the enrichment plant complied with international laws and guidelines.\nIn July 2022, we acquired a pilot plant previously used by Klydon to enrich Silicon-28 up to an abundance of 96.6%. This enriched Silicon-28 was then used for\nexperimental work in the solar and electronics industries. Since then we have been refurbishing and upgrading the facility to produce commercial quantities of Carbon-14. In\nJune 2023, we entered into a tolling agreement with a North American customer for the entire capacity of this facility, under which we will supply the customer with C-14\nenriched to 85%.\n7\nTable of Contents\nDemonstrate the capability to produce C-14, Mo-100, and Si-28 using the ASP technology and capitalize on the opportunity to solve many supply chain challenges that\ncurrently exist.\nWe intend to demonstrate the capability to produce C-14, Mo-100, and Si-28 at a scale that can support anticipated customer demand for all three isotopes.\nHistorically, Russia has been the sole supplier of C-14, which is used as a tracer in the development of new pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. The supply chain has\nbeen inherently fragile with inconsistent service. Subject to the supply of feedstock from our customer, we intend to start the enrichment of C-14 during 2024.\nMo-100 as an alternative and potentially more convenient production route for Tc-99m used in nuclear medical diagnostic procedures. Mo-99’s decay product,\ntechnetium-99m (Tc-99m), is used in 80-85% of the world’s single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) procedures, which is used to diagnose heart disease and\ncancer, to study organ structure and function, and to perform other critical medical applications. We intend to offer our Mo-100 to customers who may convert Mo-100 into\nMo-99 or directly into Tc-99m, and we believe that the use of Mo-100 in this way will be an attractive alternative route to the production of Tc-99m for several reasons.\n· Only a small number of major reactors located around the world (e.g., Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, and South Africa) produce large-scale amounts of Mo-\n99. These reactors are taken off-line periodically for refueling and maintenance and go off-line on an unscheduled basis due to the need for extended repairs, which\nresults in a global Mo-99 supply chain that is lengthy, complex, and prone to interruption and has experienced supply shortages. Customers that could use and\nstockpile Mo-100 due to its stable profile when compared to Mo-99 would not have to manage the periodic shortages and supply chain challenges related to Mo-\n99.\n· Mo-99 (a radioisotope with a 66-hour half-life) decays and loses activity in transit, so it must be moved through the supply chain quickly to minimize decay\nlosses, and it cannot be stockpiled. Mo-100 (a stable isotope of molybdenum) will not decay in transit, so the supply chain would not depend on elapsed time from\nthe production of Mo-100 to the delivery of a Tc-99m dose to a hospital or clinic.\n· Mo-99 (with decay product Tc-99m) must be shipped in shielded transport containers that comply with the regulatory requirements for the safe transport of\nradioactive material. Mo-100 is stable (non-radioactive) and, therefore, does not have the same handling and shipping requirements.\nIsotopically enriched silicon is regarded as a promising material for semiconductor quantum information due to its very long coherence times and its compatibility with\nthe readily available industrial platform. We believe that the ASP technology is ideally suited to the production of this isotope because it has the ability to enrich molecules of\nlow molecular mass. Other electronic gasses that can likely be enriched using ASP Technology include disilane and germane.\nContinue identifying potential offtake customers and strategic partners for our isotopes.\nWe have already seen significant interest from potential offtake customers for the isotopes that we intend to produce. In November 2022, we entered a 25-year supply\nagreement for highly enriched Mo-100 with BRICEM (Beijing Research Institute of Chemical Engineering Metallurgy). The contract has a value of up to $27.0 million per\nannum. In July 2023, we entered into a supply agreement for a highly enriched metal with a U.S. customer. This contract has an annual sales value of $9 million. We have had\nor are currently in active dialogue with many other potential customers who could use the entire anticipated annual capacity of an initial plant. In June 2023, we entered into a\ntolling agreement with a Canadian customer for the entire capacity of our C-14 production facility. We are currently in discussions with potential customers that have an\ninterest in entering into long-term supply agreements for kilogram quantities of Si-28 and larger quantities of Xe-129, Ge 72, Ge-74, Zn-68, and Cl-37.\nDemonstrate the capability to produce high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) using Quantum Enrichment and meet anticipated demand for the new generation of\nHALEU-fueled small modular reactors and advanced reactor designs that are now under development for commercial and government uses.\nWe plan to begin research and development for the enrichment of uranium to demonstrate our capability to produce HALEU using Quantum Enrichment technology.\nWe anticipate a future demand for HALEU for the new generation of HALEU-fueled small modular reactors (SMRs) and advanced reactor designs that are now under\ndevelopment for commercial and government uses. SMRs are viewed as being cheaper, safer, and more versatile than traditional large-scale nuclear reactors, and development\nof the new technology is receiving considerable funding from the U.S. Department of Energy, as well as from the governments of other countries. There is currently no\ncommercial production of HALEU in the United States. We are currently conducting a feasibility study with respect to constructing an enrichment facility in either South Africa\nor the United Kingdom. We are currently in discussions with both the UK Atomic Energy Authority, UK Office of Nuclear Regulation (ONR), Nuclear Energy Corporation of\nSouth Africa (NECSA) as well as the South African Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) pursuing an approval to conduct nuclear research in either of these\ncountries. We would need to obtain approval from one of these regulatory bodies in order to proceed with our nuclear research. Alongside our talks with regulators, we are\ncurrently discussing with multiple counterparties involved in the SMR space to produce HALEU to further their research efforts and, later, their commercial endeavors.\n8\nTable of Contents\nInitiate the R&D efforts of the Quantum Enrichment Process via the Company’s subsidiary, Enlightened Isotopes, for the enrichment of Ytterbium 176\nWe anticipate furthering our commercial development of the Quantum Enrichment process through the development of enriching Ytterbium-176 for the medical\noncology market. Enriched Ytterbium-176 can be irradiated to produce Lutetium-177, which has been identified for use in oncology, particularly in targeted radionuclide\ntherapy (TRT). TRT is used in the treatment of various types of cancers, including neuroendocrine tumors, prostate cancer, and bone metastases, among others. There are 11\nongoing clinical trials studying Lutetium-177 PSMA-617 in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We have obtained all necessary licenses within South\nAfrica to proceed with the commercial development of this product. We anticipate that this continued R&D and later clinical applicability will help to refine the Quantum\nEnrichment process for broader commercial applicability in the future.\nDemonstrate the effectiveness and value in the use of Mo-100 and other stable isotopes in the downstream radiopharmacy market, after acquiring 51% ownership interest\nin PET Labs, the leading radiopharmacy in South Africa. This investment will address the radioisotope needs of South Africa as well as certain neighboring countries.\nUnder the terms of a Share Purchase Agreement, dated October 30, 2023, we acquired 51% of the issued share capital of Pet Labs Pharmaceuticals Proprietary Limited,\na company incorporated in the Republic of South Africa (“PET Labs”). PET Labs is a South African radiopharmaceutical operations company, dedicated to nuclear medicine\nand the science of radiopharmaceutical production. As a result of this transaction, we entered into the downstream radiopharmacy market that we intend to service in the future.\nThis transaction will help provide the market with adequate proof of concept of the value of utilizing Mo-100 in downstream SPECT imaging procedures while providing\nsupply chain stability to the region of South Africa and neighboring countries. We intend to expand PET Labs’ existing operations by adding two new cyclotrons to its service\nfootprint, enabling the company to properly expand its other revenue generation mediums, which is anticipated to drive free cash flow to the company.\nOur Strengths\nASP technology initially developed by Klydon and further developed by ASPI (S.Africa).\nThe aerodynamic separation technique has its origins in the South African uranium enrichment program in the 1980s, and the ASP technology has been developed\nduring the last 18 years by the scientists at Klydon. To date, the scientists at Klydon have constructed two ASP plants for the enrichment of oxygen-18 and silicon-28 in\nPretoria, South Africa, which were commissioned in October 2015 and July 2018, respectively. While the technology has not yet been used to enrich either Molybdenum or\nUranium or heavier isotopes, we believe the success of the enrichment process for oxygen-18 and silicon-28 has demonstrated the efficacy and commercial scalability of the\nASP technology. If our research and development is successful (and subject to obtaining applicable regulatory approvals and appropriate licenses), we plan to commercialize\nmany different isotopes produced using the ASP technology. To date, we have completed the construction of one isotope enrichment facility, but we have not yet produced any\ncommercial quantities of isotopes and we have not yet demonstrated the ability to produce any isotope in commercial quantities using ASP technology.\nExtensive R&D Experience in Aerodynamic Separation Technology and Processes.\nSubject to successful research and development, our ASP technology has the potential to produce many different types of isotopes. Klydon has spent the last 18 years\nand tens of millions of dollars developing the aerodynamic separation technique used in the ASP technology, generating critical trade secrets. We believe our competitors lag\nbehind us in terms of the technical expertise of our senior management and the know-how contained in the aerodynamic separation technique and will be unable to replicate the\nexpected results of the ASP technology, even as we expect to continue to improve the existing technology and processes. Additionally, the high capital costs of development of\nproprietary technologies, significant lead times required to construct new enrichment facilities, as well as stringent regulatory and operating requirements applicable to\nenrichment facilities, adds to the significant barriers to entry for smaller competing market participants.\n9\nTable of Contents\nASP technology is a flexible platform with the potential to produce many different isotopes that could serve a large addressable markets.\nASP technology is a flexible platform, compact in size and weight, and could be easily scaled to an industrial level with number of separation devices added in parallel.\nThe ASP technology also has few moving parts, with low capital and operating costs in comparison to alternatives. The technology is particularly efficient at enriching isotopes\nof low atomic mass. We believe that, assuming receipt of required regulatory approvals and governmental permits, the ASP technology can be deployed quickly and with a\nrelatively minimal capital cost, to enrich many different isotopes that we believe consumers require both today and in the future in end markets such as healthcare, technology\nand energy.\nASP technology is designed to be low cost, low energy, and environmentally friendly.\nWe recently completed the construction of our first isotope enrichment facility using ASP technology located in Pretoria, South Africa. The ASP technology is\ndesigned to be scalable, low cost, low energy, and environmentally friendly, with no radioactive waste or hazardous materials produced in the process and planned arrangements\nto reuse chemical by-products.\nExperienced team\nOur board of directors and advisers have specialized expertise in isotope enrichment, R&D, technology, plant development, and manufacturing. Dr. Einar Ronander,\nwho serves as Chief Scientific Adviser to our board of directors, and Dr Hendrik Strydom, one of our directors, previously co-founded Klydon. The scientific team at Klydon\ncombined has decades of experience in research and development of isotope enrichment and amassed deep knowledge in the field.\nOur board of directors and our management team also have broad experience and successful track records in fusion technology and fusion materials, biopharmaceutical\nresearch, chemicals, manufacturing and commercialization, as well as in business, operations, and finance. Our board of directors’ and management team’s experience was\ngained at leading companies and financial institutions that include, Bear Stearns, Deutsche Bank, Highbridge Capital, Investec Bank, Morgan Stanley and Soros Fund\nManagement.\nTechnical Background\nWhat are Isotopes?\nIsotopes are two or more types of atoms that have the same atomic number (number of protons in their nuclei) and position in the periodic table (and hence belong to\nthe same chemical element), and that differ in nucleon numbers (mass numbers) due to different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei. While all isotopes of a given element have\nalmost the same chemical properties, they have different atomic masses and physical properties.\nThe number of protons within the atom’s nucleus is called atomic number and is equal to the number of electrons in the neutral (non-ionized) atom. Each atomic\nnumber identifies a specific element, but not the isotope; an atom of a given element may have a wide range in its number of neutrons. The number of nucleons (both protons\nand neutrons) in the nucleus is the atom’s mass number, and each isotope of a given element has a different mass number. For example, carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14\nare three isotopes of the element carbon with mass numbers 12, 13, and 14, respectively. The atomic number of carbon is 6, which means that every carbon atom has 6 protons\nso that the neutron numbers of these isotopes are 6, 7, and 8 respectively.\nThere are 23 isotopes of Silicon, all of which have 14 protons and 14 neutrons but have between 8 and 30 neutrons. The table below shows a selection of those isotopes.\nThree isotopes are stable which have mass numbers of 28, 29 and 30 which have 14, 15 and 16 neutrons respectively. The other 20 isotopes are radioactive and decay with short\nhalf-lives and are therefore do not typically exist in naturally occurring silicon. In naturally occurring silicon, the isotope with atomic mass of 28 is usually the most abundant,\ntypically accounting for approximately 92.22% of the material. The isotope with atomic mass of 29 typically accounts for 4.69% of the material and the isotope with atomic\nmass of 30 typically accounts for 3.09% of the material.\nMolybdenum has 33 known isotopes, ranging in atomic mass from 83 to 115, as well as four metastable nuclear isomers. Seven isotopes occur naturally, with atomic\nmasses of 92, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, and 100. All unstable isotopes of molybdenum decay into isotopes of zirconium, niobium, technetium, and ruthenium.\n10\nTable of Contents\nUranium is a naturally occurring radioactive element that has no stable isotope. It has two primordial isotopes, uranium-238 and uranium-235, which have long half-\nlives and are found in appreciable quantity in the Earth’s crust. The decay product, uranium-234 is also found. Other isotopes such as uranium-233 have been produced in\nbreeder reactors. In addition to isotopes found in nature or nuclear reactors, many isotopes with far shorter half-lives have been produced, ranging from U-214 to U-242 (with\nthe exception of U-220 and U-241). The standard atomic weight of natural uranium is 238.02891 with 99.27% of naturally occurring uranium being the isotope with an atomic\nmass of 238.\nSelected isotopes of Silicon Selected isotopes of Molybdenum Selected isotopes of Uranium\nIsotopic Half Natural Isotopic Half Natural Isotopic Half Natural\nNuclideProtonsNeutrons Mass Life abundanceNuclideProtonsNeutrons Mass Life abundanceNuclideProtonsNeutrons Mass Life abundance\n22 14 8 22.036 29 ms 91 42 49 90.912 15.49 225 92 133 225.02962 ms\nmin\n23 14 9 23.025 42.3 ms 92 42 50 91.907 Stable 14.65% 226 92 134 226.029269\nms\n24 14 10 24.012 140 ms 93 42 51 92.907 4000 y 227 92 135 227.031 1.1 m\n25 14 11 25.004 220 ms 94 42 52 93.905 Stable 9.19% 228 92 136 228.031 9.1 m\n26 14 12 25.992 2.245 s 95 42 53 94.906 Stable 15.87% 229 92 137 229.03457.8\nm\n27 14 13 26.987 4.15 s 96 42 54 95.905 Stable 16.67% 230 92 138 230.03420.23\nd\n28 14 14 27.977 Stable 92.22% 97 42 55 96.906 Stable 9.58% 231 92 139 231.036 4.2 d\n29 14 15 28.977 Stable 4.69% 98 42 56 97.905 Stable 24.29% 232 92 140 232.03768.9\ny\n30 14 16 29.974 Stable 3.09% 99 42 57 98.908 2.75 d 233 92 141 233.04 1.592 Trace\ne5 y\n31 14 17 30.975 157.36 100 42 58 99.907 Stable 9.74% 234 92 142 234.0412.455 Trace\nmin e5 y\n32 14 18 31.974 153 y trace 101 42 59 100.910 14.61 235 92 143 235.0447.038 0.72%\nm e8 y\n33 14 19 32.978 6.18 s 102 42 60 101.910 11.3 m 236 92 144 236.0462.342 Trace\ne7 y\n34 14 20 33.979 2.77 s 103 42 61 102.913 67.5 s 237 92 145 237.0496.752 Trace\nd\n35 14 21 34.985 780 ms 104 42 62 103.914 60 s 238 92 146 238.0514.468 99.27%\ne9 y\n36 14 22 35.987 450 ms 105 42 63 104.917 35.6 s 239 92 147 239.05423.45\nm\n37 14 23 36.993 90 ms 106 42 64 105.918 8.73 s 240 92 148 240.05714.1 Trace\nh\n38 14 24 37.996 90 ms 107 42 65 106.922 3.5 s 242 92 150 242.06316.8\nm\nMethods of Separation and Enrichment of Isotopes\nIsotope enrichment is the process of concentrating specific isotopes of a chemical element by removing other isotopes. During the last century, a number of different\nmethods have been developed to separate and enrich isotopes. The current separation or enrichment processes are based either on the atomic weight of the isotope, small\ndifferences in chemical reaction rates produced by different atomic weights or are based on properties not directly connected to atomic weight such as nuclear resonances.\n11\nTable of Contents\nDiffusion\nOften performed on gases, but also on liquids, the diffusion method relies on the fact that in thermal equilibrium, two isotopes with the same energy will have different\naverage velocities. The lighter atoms (or the molecules containing them) will travel more quickly and be more likely to diffuse through a membrane. The difference in speeds is\nproportional to the square root of the mass ratio, so the amount of separation is small, and many cascaded stages are needed to obtain high purity. This method is expensive due\nto the work needed to push gas through a membrane and the many stages necessary.\nCentrifugal\nCentrifugal methods rapidly rotate the material allowing the heavier isotopes to go closer to an outer radial wall. This too is often done in gaseous form using a Zippe-\ntype centrifuge.\nA Zippe-type centrifuge relies on the force resulting from centripetal acceleration to separate molecules according to their mass, and can be applied to most fluids. The\ndense (heavier) molecules move towards the wall and the lighter ones remain close to the center. The centrifuge consists of a rigid body rotor rotating at full period at high\nspeed. Concentric gas tubes located on the axis of the rotor are used to introduce feed gas into the rotor and extract the heavier and lighter separated streams. For U-235\nproduction, the heavier stream is the waste stream and the lighter stream is the product stream. Modern Zippe-type centrifuges are tall cylinders spinning on a vertical axis, with\na vertical temperature gradient applied to create a convective circulation rising in the center and descending at the periphery of the centrifuge. Diffusion between these opposing\nflows increases the separation by the principle of countercurrent multiplication.\nIn practice, since there are limits to how tall a single centrifuge can be made, several such centrifuges are connected in series. Each centrifuge receives one input and\nproduces two output lines, corresponding to light and heavy fractions. The input of each centrifuge is the output (light) of the previous centrifuge and the output (heavy) of the\nfollowing stage. This produces an almost pure light fraction from the output (light) of the last centrifuge and an almost pure heavy fraction from the output (heavy) of the first\ncentrifuge.\nElectromagnetic\nElectromagnetic separation is mass spectrometry on a large scale, so it is sometimes referred to as mass spectrometry. It uses the fact that charged particles are deflected\nin a magnetic field and the amount of deflection depends upon the particle’s mass. It is very expensive for the quantity produced, as it has an extremely low throughput, but it\ncan allow very high purities to be achieved. This method is often used for processing small amounts of pure isotopes for research or specific use (such as isotopic tracers), but is\nimpractical for industrial use.\nLaser\nIn this method, a laser is tuned to a wavelength which excites only one isotope of the material and ionizes those atoms preferentially. The resonant absorption of light\nfor an isotope is dependent upon its mass and certain hyperfine interactions between electrons and the nucleus, allowing finely tuned lasers to interact with only one isotope.\nAfter the atom is ionized it can be removed from the sample by applying an electric field. This method is often abbreviated as AVLIS (atomic vapor laser isotope separation).\nThis method has only recently been developed as laser technology has improved, and is currently not used extensively.\nChemical Methods\nAlthough isotopes of a single element are normally described as having the same chemical properties, this is not strictly true. In particular, reaction rates are very\nslightly affected by atomic mass. Techniques using this are most effective for light atoms such as hydrogen. Lighter isotopes tend to react or evaporate more quickly than heavy\nisotopes, allowing them to be separated. This is how heavy water is produced commercially.\nGravity\nIsotopes of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen can be purified by chilling these gases or compounds nearly to their liquefaction temperature in very tall (200 to 700 feet (61\nto 213 m)) columns. The heavier isotopes sink and the lighter isotopes rise, where they are easily collected.\n12\nTable of Contents\nThe Aerodynamic Separation Process (ASP) Technology\nASP technology is proprietary technology licensed from Klydon which succeeds earlier work, first detailed in the scientific media in the mid-1970s, relating to an\nindustrial scale enrichment plant for uranium that was constructed utilizing the so-called “stationary-wall centrifuge”. The original technology was highly energy consuming and\nwas not able to compete on an economic basis with other methods of isotope separation. The innovative development of the ASP technology over the past 18 years has\nculminated in a more advanced separation device that we believe can compete on a commercial scale with other methods of isotope separation. The ASP separation device\nseparates both gas species and isotopes in a volatile state via an approximate flow pattern as shown below.\nGas flow pattern inside ASP separation device.\nThe ASP enrichment process uses an aerodynamic technique similar to a stationary wall centrifuge. The isotope material in raw gas form enters the stationary tube at\nhigh speed by tangential injection through finely placed and sized openings in the surface of the tube. The gas then follows a flow pattern that results in two gas vortexes\noccurring around the geometrical axis of the separator. The isotope material becomes separated in the radial dimension as a result of the spin speed of the isotope material\nreaching several hundred meters per second. An axial mass flow component in each tube feeds isotope material to the respective ends of the separator where the collection of\nthe portions of isotope material is accomplished.\nThe advantages of ASP technology are as follows:\n· No moving parts, with low capital and operating costs in comparison to alternatives.\n· Compact in size and weight.\n· Easily scaled to industrial level with number of separation devices added in parallel.\n· The separation process occurs inside a closed cylindrical container and is a volume technology, i.e., the process efficiency is not affected by poisoning of surface\ncontaminates as is the case for surface separation processes.\n· ASP operates very efficiently at molecular masses below 100 atomic mass units, unlike other separation processes which are more efficient higher masses, which\nASP can achieve equally well or to a superior degree.\n· ASP easily separates hydrogen gas from other gas components, e.g., harvesting hydrogen gas from carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide and altering the ratio of\nsyngas mixture.\n· With the right material choice ASP handles even the most corrosive gases.\n· ASP can separate any isotopes that have a gaseous or volatile chemical compound.\n· Most of the subsystems are procured from off-the-shelf components.\n· An ASP plant can be constructed in any country that adheres to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) protocols for the protection of dual use\ntechnology.\n13\nTable of Contents\nASP Plant Configuration\nThe figure below shows a schematic of an ASP cascade in operation. The cascade consists of several enrichment stages, connected in a 1-up-1-down cascade\nconfiguration. The stages can be grouped into segments. (This method of organizing stages is not reflected in the figure)\nThe bold blue arrows represent flows of the element into and out of the cascade:\n· H is the product, enriched in the isotope\n· L is the tails, stripped of the isotope\n· F = FX + FY is the feed stream at natural isotopic composition:\n· FX is the feed into the product stream of an adjoining stage.\n· FY is the feed into the tails stream of an adjoin\nEach stage in the cascade is operated in one of two configurations:\n(1) A net backward flow of the isotope: Xi > Yi. These stages are referred to as “product”, situated in the so-called “product cascade section”, and their flows\nare marked with an “H” subscript.\n(2) A net forward flow of isotope: Xi < Yi. These stages are referred to as “tails”, situated in the so-called “tails cascade section”, and their flows are marked\nwith an “L” subscript.\nThe red arrows represent the addition or extraction of carrier gas from the process. The arrows have been added for clarity and orientation, but the mass flows of the\ncarrier gas will be ignored in the rest of the discussion as it pertains to the isotope mass flows only (as represented by the blue arrows). The carrier gas mass flows can be\nsuperimposed on any isotope mass balance using the molar mass characteristics of the ASP stages (see below).\nThe block marked “GS” represents the gas separator: a piece of equipment used to separate the carrier gas from the element of interest to the degree necessary to\nprovide a suitable reflux stream to the tails cascade section.\nThe blue squares are simply suitable areas where streams can be split or mixed.\nAn ASP stage is characterized by functions of Y, the flow of isotope in its tails stream. The characteristics of interest are:\n· α(Y): the separation factor between the tails and product streams.\n· MY(Y): the molar mass of the tails stream.\n· MX(Y): the molar mass of the product stream.\n· P(Y): the stage’s power usage.\n· X(θ,Y): the flow of Zinc in the product stream, where θ = Y/(X+Y) is the cut defined in terms of isotope flows.\nNote the following:\n· α is the ratio of the tails and product stream abundance ratios.\n· Y, X(θ,Y) and α(Y) describe the stage’s behaviour with regards to Zinc, while MY(Y) and MX(Y) defines its behaviour with regards to the carrier gas.\n· P, the stage’s power usage, depends on the ASP separator, but also on factors such as compressor efficiency, friction losses etc. It is therefore a partial function of\nstage design.\n· It is possible to define Pmin, the theoretical minimum energy usage of a stage, by assuming 100% efficient compressors and no losses in the stage. Pmin is a\nfunction of the ASP separator only. In practice P is a more useful metric, as the contribution of compressor inefficiencies to power consumption is significant.\n· Except for X, the stage’s characteristics are not defined in terms of the cut θ, as they are simply not sensitive to it above a certain lower limit θmin. In practice\nθmin is small enough that it has no influence on the normal operating envelope of the stage.\n· X is per definition a function of Y via θ as indicated.\n14\nTable of Contents\nThe cut of an ASP stage can be dynamically adjusted to any value larger than θmin, allowing its operating point to be changed online during production.\nAll stages in the product cascade section are operated at the same point < XH,YH >, where XH > YH, ensuring that a net backward flow of the process element, H =\nXH — YH is achieved. This corresponds to a cut of less than 50% and ensures a positive flow of enriched product.\nAll stages in the tails cascade section are operated at the same point < XL,YL >, where XL < YL, ensuring that a net backward flow of the process element, L =\nXL — YL is achieved. This corresponds to a cut of more than 50% and ensures a positive flow of stripped tails.\nDepending on the production requirements of the cascade the product and tails section operation points can be moved relative to each other during production,\nobtaining different combinations of H and L (and therefore different feeds F = H + L). The smaller H (or L) is chosen, the closer the product (or tails) section cut moves to 50%.\nIf all stages are operated at a cut of 50%, the cascade is operated at full reflux, no product, tails, or feed streams are present, and the maximum process element concentration\ngradient will exist.\nASP Technology In Use\nTo date, the scientists at Klydon have constructed two ASP plants for the enrichment of oxygen-18 and silicon-28 in Pretoria, South Africa, which were commissioned\nin October 2015 and July 2018, respectively,. We believe the success of the enrichment of oxygen-18 and silicon-28 has demonstrated the efficacy and commercial scalability\nof the ASP technology. We are currently constructing two enrichment plants, which, if successful, will be able to produce a range of isotopes, including but not limited to C-14,\nMo-100 and Si-28.\nNuclear Medicine\nNuclear medicine is a medical specialty that utilizes radioactive isotopes, referred to as radionuclides, to diagnose and treat disease. These radionuclides are\nincorporated into radiopharmaceuticals and introduced into the body by injection, swallowing, or inhalation. Physiologic/metabolic processes in the body concentrate the tracers\nin specific tissues and organs; the radioactive emissions from the tracers can be used to noninvasively image these processes or kill cells in regions where radionuclides have\nconcentrated.\nOther types of noninvasive diagnostic procedures — for example, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) — can detect anatomical\nchanges in tissues and organs as the result of disease. Nuclear medicine procedures can often detect the physiological and metabolic changes associated with disease before any\nanatomical changes occur. Such procedures can be used to identify disease at early stages and evaluate patients’ early responses to therapeutic interventions.\nSingle Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) generates three-dimensional (3D) images of tissues and organs using radionuclides that emit gamma rays;\nthe most used radionuclide is Technitium-99m (Tc-99m), often referred to as the ‘work-horse’ of nuclear medicine. Individual gamma rays emitted from the decay of these\nradionuclides (i.e., single photon emissions) are detected using a gamma camera. This camera technology is used to obtain two-dimensional (2D) images; 3D SPECT images\nare computer generated from many 2D images recorded at different angles.\nPositron Emission Tomography (PET) generates 3D images of tissues and organs using tracers that emit positrons (i.e., positive electrons): for example, fluorine-18 (F-\n18). Annihilation reactions between the positrons from these radionuclides and electrons present in tissues and organs produce photons. (Two photons are emitted\nsimultaneously for each annihilation reaction and essentially travel in opposite directions.) The photon pairs are detected with a camera having a ring of very fast detectors and\nelectronics. PET images generally have a higher contrast and spatial resolution than do SPECT images. However, PET equipment is more expensive and therefore not as widely\navailable as SPECT equipment. Additionally, most PET tracers have short half-lives (e.g., nitrogen-13 (N-13): 10 minutes, carbon-11 (C-11): 20 minutes, and F-18: 110\nminutes), so they must be produced close to their point of use.\n15\nTable of Contents\nTechnetium-99m (Tc-99m)–the most widely used radioisotope in Nuclear Imaging\nTc-99m is used in approximately 80 percent of all nuclear medicine procedures performed worldwide each year.\nTc-99m is a particularly useful imaging radionuclide because it:\n· Has a sufficiently long half-life (~6 hours) to be usable in nuclear medicine procedures.\n· Emits energetic gamma rays (140 kiloelectron volts [keV]) that can be detected efficiently with widely available camera technologies.\n· Provides low patient doses for some procedures because of its short half-life and lack of alpha or beta radiations.\nTc-99m-based radiopharmaceuticals are used to diagnose disease in many tissue and organ systems, including bone, brain, heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs. About 50\npercent of Tc-99m utilization in the United States is in nuclear cardiology, predominantly for myocardial perfusion imaging which images blood flow through heart muscle.\nBecause Tc-99m has a half life of just 6 hours, it cannot be stored or shipped long distances and it is currently produced using a technetium generator, which contains\nMolybdenum-99 which has a half-life of about 66-hours. In the reactor, Mo-99 decays to Tc-99m by emitting a beta particle (an electron). About 88 percent of the decays\nproduce Tc-99m, which subsequently decays to the ground state, Tc-99g, by emitting a gamma ray. About 12 percent of the decays produce Tc-99g directly. Tc-99g decays to\nstable (i.e., nonradioactive) ruthenium-99 (Ru-99) after emitting a beta particle.\nTechnetium generators are systems that store Mo-99 and allow its decay product, Tc-99m, to be recovered for use. Most technetium generators are designed to be used\nwith high-specific-activity Mo-99 (>1,000 Ci/g) produced by U-235 fission. The generator consists of an alumina (Al2O3) column having the diameter of a large pencil along\nwith associated filters and tubing for obtaining Tc-99m.\nThis apparatus is installed into radiation-shielded packages for shipment to Tc-99m suppliers. The generator includes both the package and its contained apparatus.\nTechnetium generators can contain from 1 to 19 Ci of Mo-99, matched to address the needs and workloads of Tc-99m suppliers.\nIt takes 18-24 hours to prepare technetium generators for shipment. Preparation involves loading the molybdate solution onto the columns and sterilizing them;\ninstalling the columns, tubing, and filters into the shielded generator package; and packaging the generators for shipment. Tc-99m generators are typically shipped to Tc-99m\nsuppliers within a day of their manufacture. Generators are shipped in regulatory-compliant boxes. The delivery methods can be air, ground, or a combination of both depending\non customer location and contracted transportation network.\nThe Mo-99 Market\nThe global medical community depends on a reliable supply of the radioisotope Mo-99 for nuclear medical diagnostic procedures. As previously described, Mo-99’s\ndecay product, technetium-99m (Tc-99m), is used in over 40,000 medical procedures in the United States each day to diagnose heart disease and cancer, to study organ structure\nand function, and to perform other important medical applications.\nIn 2020, it is estimated (by Future Market Insights Inc, a global market research firm), that the Molybdenum 99 market generated revenues of approximately $3.8\nbillion. North America accounted for almost half of the Mo-99 demand. Approximately 62% of Mo-99 was used in hospitals while approximately 38% of Mo-99 use was in\ndiagnostic centers.\nThe Mo-99 Supply Chain\nThe global Mo-99 supply chain is inherently fragile. The fragility stems primarily from two factors:\n1. Mo-99 and its daughter isotope Tc-99m have short half-lives (66 and 6 hours, respectively) and therefore cannot be stockpiled. These radioisotopes need to be\nproduced and delivered to the supply chain on a weekly or more frequent basis.\n2. Global supply of Mo-99 currently relies on a small number of aging reactors worldwide and a small number of suppliers.\nThe current Mo-99 supply chain is also lengthy and prone to interruption throughout its course.\nRecent Government Efforts to Increase Mo-99 Availability\nGiven the regular supply side shortages in the Mo-99 market, and widely anticipated shutdown of many of the current reactors, there is considerable focus on\nalternative methods of Tc-99m production. In 2012, Congress passed the American Medical Isotopes Production Act (AMIPA), which directed the National Nuclear Security\nAdministration (NNSA) to establish a technology-neutral program to support the establishment of domestic supplies of Mo-99 without the use of HEU. NNSA has implemented\nthis by competitively awarding 50%/50% cost-shared cooperative agreements to commercial entities and providing funds to the Department of Energy’s (DOE) National\nLaboratories to support development of non-HEU Mo-99 production technologies.\n16\nTable of Contents\nNNSA currently manages cooperative agreements with three U.S. companies, all developing diverse Mo-99 production technologies:\n· NorthStar Medical Radioisotopes, LLC (Beloit, Wisconsin)\no Neutron capture technology using molybdenum-98 targets\no Accelerator-based technology using molybdenum-100 targets\n· SHINE Technologies, LLC (Janesville, Wisconsin)\no Accelerator with fission technology to produce Mo-99 with an LEU solution target\n· Niowave, Inc. (Lansing, Michigan)\no Superconducting electron linear accelerator with fission technology to produce Mo-99 with LEU targets\nMo-100 as an Alternative Intermediate to Produce Mo-99 and Tc-99m\nMo-100 is a stable isotope of molybdenum. Naturally occurring molybdenum contains approximately 9.74% molybdenum-100. When highly enriched so that the\nMolybdenum contains >95% of the Mo-100 isotope, it can be used to produce either Mo-99 or Tc-99 via either photon-induced transmutation of Mo-100 into Mo-99 or via\nproton bombardment of Mo-100 into Tc-99m. The use of particle accelerators for the production of Mo-99 and direct production of Tc-99m has been studied extensively and\nthe use of a particle accelerator conveys certain advantages and disadvantages. Accelerators produce ion beams and accelerate ions to higher energies by using oscillating\nelectromagnetic fields. The accelerated particle beams have the capability of irradiating specific targets to produce Mo-99 and/or Tc-99m.\nWe intend to offer our Mo-100 to customers that may convert Mo-100 into Mo-99 or Mo-100 directly into Tc-99m. We believe that customers will be able to convert\nMo-100 into Mo-99 using a cyclotron or a linear accelerator. The Mo-99 can then be converted into Tc-99m using a technetium generator. The technetium generators that are\ncurrently available will likely require some modifications in order to use the Mo-99 that has been produced via a cyclotron or a linear accelerator. These modifications will\nlikely mean that new generator will require approval by healthcare regulators such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States and the European Medicines\nAgency (EMA) in Europe.\nCustomers may convert Mo-100 directly into Tc-99m using a cyclotron, which would eliminate the need for a technetium generator. To date, only one healthcare\nregulator (Health Canada) has approved the use of Tc-99m that has been directly produced from Mo-100 in a low powered cyclotron. We believe it is likely that healthcare\nregulators in other countries will also require clinical data to support the use of Tc-99m that is produced directly from Mo-100.\nASP Technology for Carbon-14 Enrichment\nC-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon with a half-life of 5,700 years that has a natural abundance of 1 part per trillion. The different isotopes of carbon do not differ\nappreciably in their chemical properties. This resemblance is used in chemical and biological research, in a technique called carbon labelling: carbon-14 atoms can be used to\nreplace nonradioactive carbon, in order to trace chemical and biochemical reactions involving carbon atoms from any given organic compound.\nCarbon-14 could be obtained from waste by-products in certain nuclear reactors. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year supply agreement with a Canadian\nCustomer for the supply of Carbon-14, which will be produced from our facility that was completed in March 2023. The customer will supply carbon-14 in the form of carbon-\ndioxide gas. We will then convert the carbon dioxide gas into methane under a chemical converting contract entered in June 2023. We will then enrich the methane to greater\nthan 85% C-14 under a tolling agreement, also entered in June 2023. Finally, we will convert the enriched methane back into enriched carbon dioxide under a chemical\nconverting contract. The tolling agreement has a minimum “take or pay” amount of approximately $2.5 million per year, supported by a bank letter of guarantee. In September\n2023, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the same customer to separate Deuterium and Tritium currently stored at nuclear sites within Canada. The\ntiming and commercial implications of this MOU are subject to future agreement between the parties.\n17\nTable of Contents\nASP Technology for Silicon-28 Enrichment\nSi-28 is a stable isotope of silicon. Isotopically enriched Si-28 is regarded as an ideal host material for semiconducting quantum computing due to the lack of Si-29\nnuclear spins. The presence of Si-29 in concentrations above 500 parts per million (ppm) (0.05%) prevents effective performance. The lower the concentration of Si-29, the\nbetter a silicon quantum processor will perform in terms of computational power, accuracy and reliability. Unlike traditional centrifuges, which are suited to enriching gases\nwith a high molecular mass, ASP Technology is highly suited to of enriching gases with a low molecular mass such as silane (SiH4).\nQuantum computers are expected to be thousands or millions of times more powerful than the most advanced of today’s conventional computers, opening new frontiers\nand opportunities in many industries, including medicine, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, global logistics and global financial systems.\nQuantum Enrichment Technology for Uranium Enrichment\nWe believe our Quantum Enrichment technology is capable of enriching Uranium, which we may be able to commercialize as a nuclear fuel component for use in the\nnew generation of HALEU-fueled small modular reactors that are now under development for commercial and government uses.\nUranium is a naturally occurring element and is mined from deposits located in Kazakhstan, Canada, Australia, and several other countries including the United States.\nAccording to the World Nuclear Association (“WNA”), there are adequate measured resources of natural uranium to fuel nuclear power at current usage rates for about 90 years.\nIn its natural state, uranium is principally comprised of two isotopes: uranium-235 (“U-235”) and uranium-238 (“U-238”). The concentration of U-235 in natural uranium is\nonly 0.711% by weight. Most commercial nuclear power reactors require LEU fuel with a U-235 concentration greater than natural uranium and up to 5% by weight. Future\nreactor designs currently under development will likely require higher U-235 concentration levels of up to 20%. Uranium enrichment is the process by which the concentration\nof U-235 is increased (see discussion on HALEU demand below).\nSeparative work units(“SWU”) is a standard unit of measurement that represents the effort required to transform a given amount of natural uranium into two\ncomponents: enriched uranium having a higher percentage of U-235 and depleted uranium having a lower percentage of U-235. The SWU contained in LEU is calculated using\nan industry standard formula based on the physics of enrichment. The amount of enrichment deemed to be contained in LEU under this formula is commonly referred to as its\nSWU component and the quantity of natural uranium deemed to be contained in LEU under this formula is referred to as its uranium or “feed” component. Currently, it is fairly\ncommon practice to purchase both the SWU and uranium components of LEU from the enrichment company. Therefore, LEU prices typically consist of three components:\nSWU, Conversion and uranium ore concentrate.\nThe following outlines the steps for converting natural uranium into LEU fuel, commonly known as the nuclear fuel cycle:\n· Mining and Milling. Natural, or unenriched, uranium is removed from the earth in the form of ore and then crushed and concentrated.\n· Conversion. Uranium ore concentrates (“UO”) are combined with fluorine gas to produce uranium hexafluoride (“UF”), a solid at room temperature and a gas\nwhen heated. UF is shipped to an enrichment plant.\n· Enrichment. UF is enriched in a process that increases the concentration of the U isotope in the UF from its natural state of 0.711% up to 5%, or LEU, which is\nusable as a fuel for current light water commercial nuclear power reactors. Future commercial reactor designs may use uranium enriched up to 20% U-235, or\nHALEU.\n· Fuel Fabrication. LEU is then converted to uranium oxide and formed into small ceramic pellets by fabricators. The pellets are loaded into metal tubes that form\nfuel assemblies, which are shipped to nuclear power plants. As the advanced reactor market develops, HALEU may be converted to uranium oxide, metal,\nchloride or fluoride salts, or other forms and loaded into a variety of fuel assembly types optimized for the specific reactor design.\n· Nuclear Power Plant. The fuel assemblies are loaded into nuclear reactors to create energy from a controlled chain reaction. Nuclear power plants generate\napproximately 20% of U.S. electricity and 10% of the world’s electricity.\n· Used Fuel Storage. After the nuclear fuel has been in a reactor for several years, its efficiency is reduced and the assembly is removed from the reactor’s core.\nThe used fuel is warm and radioactive and is kept in a deep pool of water for several years. Many utilities have elected to then move the used fuel into steel or\nconcrete and steel casks for interim storage.\nThe World is Transitioning to Newer Smaller Reactors\nAs the world transitions to a decarbonized electric grid, society is gradually decreasing its reliance on fossil fuels and increasing its reliance on “clean energy”. There\nappears to be bipartisan support for the growth of nuclear energy and the Biden Administration has identified carbon-free nuclear power as an essential part of achieving a net-\nzero CO2 economy by 2050. Nuclear power, through the operating light water reactor fleet and the deployment of advanced reactors, is poised to be an increasing contributor to\ncarbon free energy in the U.S. and internationally. The United States leads the world in technology innovation with more developers of advanced reactors than any other\ncountry.\n18\nTable of Contents\nSmall modular reactors (SMRs) are advanced nuclear reactors that have a power capacity of up to 300 MW(e) per unit, which is about one-third of the generating\ncapacity of traditional nuclear power reactors. SMRs, which can produce a large amount of low-carbon electricity, are:\n· Small — physically a fraction of the size of a conventional nuclear power reactor.\n· Modular — making it possible for systems and components to be factory-assembled and transported as a unit to a location for installation.\n· Reactors — harnessing nuclear fission to generate heat to produce energy.\nMany of the benefits of SMRs are inherently linked to the nature of their design — small and modular. Given their smaller footprint, SMRs can be sited on locations\nnot suitable for larger nuclear power plants. Prefabricated units of SMRs can be manufactured and then shipped and installed on site, making them more affordable to build\nthan large power reactors, which are often custom designed for a particular location, sometimes leading to construction delays. SMRs offer savings in cost and construction\ntime, and they can be deployed incrementally to match increasing energy demand.\nIn comparison to existing reactors, proposed SMR designs are generally simpler, and the safety concept for SMRs often relies more on passive systems and inherent\nsafety characteristics of the reactor, such as low power and operating pressure. This means that in such cases no human intervention or external power or force is required to\nshut down systems, because passive systems rely on physical phenomena, such as natural circulation, convection, gravity and self-pressurization. These increased safety\nmargins, in some cases, eliminate or significantly lower the potential for unsafe releases of radioactivity to the environment and the public in case of an accident.\nSMRs have reduced fuel requirements. Power plants based on SMRs may require less frequent refueling, every 3 to 7 years, in comparison to between 1 and 2 years for\nconventional plants. Some SMRs are designed to operate for up to 30 years without refueling. SMRs are under construction or in the licensing stage in Argentina, Canada,\nChina, Russia, South Korea and the United States of America.\nWithin the last five years significant legislation supporting the development and deployment of advanced reactors has been enacted: the Nuclear Innovation and\nModernization Act, the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Capabilities Act, the Energy Act of 2020 and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. In addition, Congress\nestablished and funded the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program which now supports two advanced reactor demonstrations to be deployed within seven years and eight\nother advanced reactor projects.\nSMRs will require a different grade of enriched Uranium\nMany advanced reactors, including the majority of the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program awardees, will require High Assay Low Enriched Uranium\n(HALEU), and fuel forms very different from those manufactured for the current Light Water Reactors (LWRs). For example, the current generation of LWRs uses fuel\nenriched to less than 5% uranium-235. In contrast, many advanced non-LWR designs require enrichments between 5% and 20% with most above 10%.\nCurrently it is not possible to purchase HALEU between 10% and 20% from a commercial enricher in the United States. In the U.S., the infrastructure for the front-end\nof the fuel cycle for the utilization of low enriched uranium up to 5% U-235 is well defined. The U.S. has mining, conversion, enrichment, fabrication, and transportation\ncapability. However, the infrastructure for producing and utilizing HALEU, in particular enrichments above 10%, is not established in the U.S. The mining and conversion\ninfrastructure are common to all enrichment levels.\nIn 2020, the Department of Energy (DOE) selected two companies for awards under the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) Pathway 1: Advanced\nReactor Demonstrations. Both reactor designs require HALEU and can be operational in about seven years. Today, it is estimated that the companies selected for the\ndemonstration pathway will require HALEU for their reactors beginning in 2024 to support fuel fabrication ahead of reactor startup. In addition, one of the companies under\nPathway 2: Risk Reduction for Future Demonstrations will require HALEU in the 2024-2025 timeframe and other companies in Pathway 2 and 3 of the ARDP will also require\nHALEU. Privately funded companies are also working to deploy HALEU fueled reactors by the mid-2020s.\nThe Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) believes that it is virtually impossible for HALEU to be provided to these companies in the needed quantities and timeframes from\nDOE inventories or commercial enrichers located in the U.S or Western Europe. Therefore, acquiring HALEU from other international suppliers will be required in the near\nterm to support the larger goal of deploying advanced reactors in the U.S. in a timely manner. Deploying these reactors before 2030 will support climate goals and position the\nU.S. to be a strong exporter of advanced reactor technology. Per the recent NEI white paper, a robust domestic HALEU infrastructure is necessary to support both the domestic\ndeployment of advanced reactors and the export of U.S. advanced reactor technologies requiring HALEU.\nIn a letter to the DOE captioned “Updated Need for High-Assay Low Enriched Uranium” dated December 20, 2021, the NEI provided an estimate of what\nU.S. HALEU demand may be during the next 15 years by companies denoted A to J:\n19\nTable of Contents\nEstimated Annual Requirements for High Assay Low Enriched Uranium to 2035 (MTU/yr)\nCompany A B C D E F G H I J Total Cumulative\nYear\n2022 0.1 0.4 0.2 1.1 0.0 1.8 1.8\n2023 0.1 3.1 4.4 0.1 7.7 9.5\n2024 1.0 5.6 0.2 3.0 1.5 6.6 0.1 18.0 27.5\n2025 1.0 3.8 0.4 3.0 5.0 11.0 1.6 25.8 53.3\n2026 1.0 15.1 4.9 10.0 2.0 24.2 13.2 1.7 72.1 125.4\n2027 1.0 26.5 7.9 4.0 24.2 13.2 1.9 78.7 204.1\n2028 1.0 37.8 16.6 13.0 23.0 24.2 13.2 2.0 130.8 334.9\n2029 1.0 26.3 1.8 30.5 17.0 18.0 14.0 24.2 16.5 2.4 151.7 486.6\n2030 1.0 34.4 1.8 40.4 46.0 18.0 30.0 24.2 16.5 2.7 215.0 701.6\n2031 23.0 42.5 6.2 53.0 29.0 22.0 33.0 24.2 16.5 2.9 252.3 954.0\n2032 35.0 52.9 12.5 67.6 46.0 40.0 50.0 48.4 19.8 3.1 375.3 1329.2\n2033 47.0 63.5 32.2 82.1 46.0 32.0 80.0 48.4 19.8 3.2 454.2 1783.4\n2034 58.0 76.1 62.4 96.7 46.0 36.0 80.0 48.4 19.8 3.7 527.1 2310.5\n2035 70.0 90.9 96. 112.4 91.0 29.0 50.0 48.4 22.0 4.1 613.8 2924.3\nNotes:\n· The material needs listed above are in metric tons of uranium per year and are a small amount compared to the approximately 2000 MTU used annually by the\nexisting fleet of reactors.\n· The material needs listed above include enrichments between 10.9% and 19.75% U-235.\n· The year the material is needed is for fuel fabrication.

Our innovative isotope enrichment process has a\nnumber of advantages over traditional gas centrifuges and other novel approaches currently being explored by other companies: cheaper in Capex, faster in construction, more\nflexible in design and location.\nWe estimate that the capital cost of constructing Quantum Enrichment plant for uranium enrichment is approximately 75% cheaper than that of a traditional gas\ncentrifuge enrichment facility. Our manufacturing plants are modular, so our construction time is likely faster and more flexible than competing technologies. Our enrichment\nfacilities are smaller than traditional gas centrifuges which means we can place them near fuel fabrication facilities for enhanced security of production and transportation. Our\noperating costs of enriching uranium to 15.5% - 19.75% U-235 should be comparable to or cheaper than costs for other methods of uranium enrichment.\n20\nTable of Contents\nThe table below represents management’s estimated comparison of the Quantum Enrichment process with a traditional gas centrifuge.\nQuantum Enrichment Plant Gas Centrifuge\nSeparation mechanism Enhanced resonant multiphoton ionization Differential diffusion\nCapital Cost per plant <$100 million >$800 million\nEnergy use (kWh) per SWU <40 50-240\nConstruction time 2-3 years 2-3 years\nLevelized cost per SWU* <$50 $140\n___________\n* for enrichment from 0.71% U235 to 5% U235\nWe are currently constructing a Ytterbium-176 enrichment facility using the Quantum Enrichment technology in Pretoria, South Africa. We received a manufacturing\npermit for this facility from the South African Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) during 3Q 2023. The construction of this plant will provide us with\nvaluable experience in the construction of Quantum Enrichment facilities in the future. Many of the control systems, compressors, lasers and hardware used in a uranium\nenrichment facility would be similar to parts used in this ytterbium-176 enrichment facility.\nWe expect the construction of a Uranium Enrichment facility would take approximately 30 months and the production volume would gradually ramp up to the final\ncapacity of 20 metric tons per year. Importantly, subject to licensure, we believe we can produce commercial quantities of HALEU by 2027 that would satisfy the anticipated\ndemand from all the advanced reactor currently in development. We believe that we can supply HALEU at a price lower than the HALEU currently imported from international\nenrichers and considerably lower than any potential domestic supply that may evolve.\nIntellectual Property\nOur business will depend on the proprietary ASP technology that was developed by and originally licensed to us from Klydon. To date, we have relied exclusively on\ntrade secrets and other intellectual property laws, non-disclosure agreements with our respective employees, consultants, vendors, potential customers and other relevant\npersons and other measures to protect our intellectual property, and intend to continue to rely on these and other means. As we intend to transition into the commercialization of\nisotopes, we envision our intellectual property and its security becoming more vital to our future. Pursuing patent protection remains part of the intellectual property protection\nphilosophy and strategy and the advisability of establishing provisional patent rights is continuously assessed on a case-by-case basis in respect of both conceptual aspects and\nthe specific applications thereof. Such assessments are made in consultation with regulatory bodies and with due consideration to the prospects of successfully obtaining patent\nprotection in light of any disclosure constraints that are imposed by such bodies.\nRegulatory Environment\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including but not limited to those of the United States and South Africa, that impose regulatory systems that govern\nmany aspects of our operations, including our research and development activities involving the enrichment of isotopes in South Africa. In addition, these jurisdictions impose\ntrade controls requirements that restrict trade to comply with applicable export controls and economic sanctions laws and requirements, and legal requirements that are intended\nto curtail bribery and corruption.\nThere are a number of regulators and treaties that govern and control our business and industry. The two principal ones that control and regulate the manufacturing of\nisotopes at our isotope enrichment facility in South Africa are the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).\nThe IAEA is an international organization that seeks to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and to inhibit its use for any military purpose, including nuclear\nweapons. The IAEA was established as an autonomous organization on 29 July 1957. Though established independently of the United Nations through its own international\ntreaty, the IAEA Statute, the IAEA reports to both the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council. The IAEA statute currently has 173 member states, including\nSouth Africa.\nThe IAEA is authorized to conclude agreements with member states, in terms of which agreements the agency would perform certain functions and the relevant\nmember states would be placed under certain obligations. The IAEA has concluded an extensive suite of agreements with South Africa. These agreements can be viewed on the\nwebsite of the IAEA (https://www.iaea.org/resources/legal/country-factsheets) and include agreements that govern the physical protection of nuclear material, the notification\nof nuclear accidents, assistance in the case of nuclear accidents, nuclear safety, civil liability, and technical cooperation.\n21\nTable of Contents\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, commonly known as the Non-Proliferation Treaty or NPT, is an international treaty whose objective is to\nprevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, to promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and to further the goal of achieving nuclear\ndisarmament and general and complete disarmament. Our South African subsidiary is registered with the South African Council for the Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass\nDestruction in terms of the Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction Act, 1993. Our registration certificate is valid until September 3, 2023. Representatives from the\nSouth African Council for the Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction regularly inspect our facility and conduct tests to monitor the activities that are taking place at\nour facilities.\nIn South Africa, government Notice 493 relates to nuclear-related dual-use equipment, materials and software and related technologies which can be used in their\nentirety or in part for the separation of uranium isotopes. ASP is classified as a dual use technology under the protocols of the IAEA and, as such, is subject to the controls that\nare implemented under these protocols. These controls comprise requirements that include:\n· membership of the IAEA and adherence to its protocols;\n· membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and adherence to its protocols;\n· agreement to an “additional protocol” in light of uranium enrichment capabilities;\n· local laws that require permits for possession, operation and commercialization and regular reporting;\n· ad hoc inspections by the IAEA on 24 hour and in some cases 2 hours pre-warning;\n· requirement for proposed patent applications to be approved at ministerial level; and\n· cross-border technology transfer to be handled by the respective governments and approved by IAEA.\nThese regulations place strict limitations on what we can and cannot do. Security measures at our production facility and our offices are stringent. Access to our\nmanufacturing plant is highly controlled. All employees and all visitors to the manufacturing plant are pre-screened by the South African Council for the Non-Proliferation of\nWeapons of Mass Destruction before being allowed employment or entry into the facility. Some of our suppliers also need to be registered with the South African Council for\nthe Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction. Many of our computer systems are not connected to the external internet and confidential information is secured at a\ncontrolled location.\nCurrently, the production, distribution or sale of Mo-100 or Zn-68 is not regulated by a healthcare regulator such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the\nUSA, Health Canada in Canada, the European Medicines Agency in Europe and similar regulators in other countries. However, products that are produced from Mo-100 or Zn-\n68 (such as Mo-99 and Tc-99m in a linear accelerator or cyclotron and Ga-67 in a cyclotron) are regulated by healthcare regulators and our customers are required to operate\nunder the licensure of these healthcare regulators. Currently, the production and use of Tc-99m from Mo-100 in a cyclotron is only approved in one country (Canada).\nSome of our future isotopes may also be regulated by healthcare regulators such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA, Health Canada in Canada, the\nEuropean Medicines Agency in Europe and similar regulators in other countries.\nU.S. laws restrict the ability of U.S. companies, U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents, or U.S. persons, from involvement in certain types of transactions with\ncountries, businesses and individuals that have been targeted by U.S. economic sanctions. For example, U.S. persons are precluded from undertaking virtually any activity of\nany kind on the part of any U.S. person with regard to any potential or actual transactions involving Cuba, Iran and Sudan without the prior approval of the U.S. Department of\nTreasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. OFAC also administers U.S. sanctions against a lengthy list of entities and individuals, wherever they may be located,\nthat the United States considers to be closely associated with these sanctioned countries or that are considered terrorists or traffickers in either narcotics or weapons of mass\ndestruction. Furthermore, U.S. economic sanctions forbid U.S. persons from circumventing direct U.S. restrictions or from facilitating transactions by non-U.S. persons if those\nactivities are forbidden to U.S. persons. Penalties for violating provisions such as these can include significant civil and criminal fines, imprisonment and loss of tax credits or\nexport privileges.\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or the FCPA, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 and the International Anti-Bribery and\nFair Competition Act of 1998, makes it a criminal offense for a U.S. corporation or other U.S. domestic concern to make payments, gifts or give anything of value directly or\nindirectly to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or to obtain any other unfair or improper advantage. In addition, the FCPA imposes accounting\nstandards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of\nbribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of “off books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. We are also subject to laws\nand regulations covering subject matter similar to that of the FCPA that have been enacted by countries outside of the United States. For example, the Convention on\nCombating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions was signed by the members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment and certain other countries in December 1997. The Convention requires each signatory to enact legislation that prohibits local persons and firms from making\npayments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining business or securing other unfair advantages from foreign governments. Failure to comply with these laws could\nsubject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses, which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\n22\nTable of Contents\nCompliance with the myriad of export control laws of the various jurisdictions in which we do business is a challenge for any company involved in export activities\nwithin the nuclear and defense end markets. We have compliance systems in our U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries to identify those products and technologies that are subject to\nexport control regulatory restrictions and, where required, we obtain authorization from relevant regulatory authorities for sales to foreign buyers or for technology transfers to\nforeign consultants, companies, universities or foreign national employees. We also have a compliance system that is intended to proactively address potential compliance\nissues including those related to export control, trade sanctions and embargoes, as well as anti-bribery situations, and we are implementing this through such mechanisms as\ntraining, formalizing contracting processes, performing diligence on agents and continuing to improve our record-keeping and auditing practices with respect to third-party\nrelationships and otherwise. Thus far, as part of our compliance system, for instance, we have developed a Code of Ethics and Conduct that informs all of our employees of\ntheir compliance obligations. Furthermore, we have developed an ethics and conduct training program that all of our employees are required to undertake, as well as other\ntargeted compliance training relevant to their position, such as specific FCPA training for all of our worldwide controllers. Violations of any of the various U.S. or non-\nU.S. export control laws can result in significant civil or criminal penalties, or even loss of export privileges, as mentioned above. We recognize that an effective compliance\nprogram can help protect the reputation and relationship of a regulated company with the regulatory agencies administering these laws and regulations. In the United States,\neach of the regulatory agencies administering these laws and regulations has a voluntary disclosure program that offers the possibility of significantly reduced penalties, if any\nare applicable, and we intend to use these programs as part of our overall compliance program, as necessary.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employed 76 people on a full-time basis. Of the total employees, 6 employees are in research and development, 33 employees are in\nengineering, construction and manufacturing, 20 employees are in plant operations and 17 employees are in general management. None of our employees are subject to\ncollective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.\nFacilities\nWe lease five facilities in Pretoria, South Africa for production, research and development and offices. One lease is under automatic monthly extensions, another lease\nwhich expired on March 31, 2024 is now under automatic monthly extensions and the other three leases have terms that expire between March 30, 2026 and December 31,\n2030. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet our current needs.\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are currently not a party to any material legal proceedings.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risk factors below together with the information contained elsewhere in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations,” and in our other public filings in evaluating our business. Before you decide to invest in our common stock, you should\nconsider carefully the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the related notes. We\nbelieve the risks described below are the risks that are material to us as of the date of this Annual Report. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could\ndecline, and our stockholders may lose all or part of their investment.\n23\nTable of Contents\nSummary of the Material and Other Risks Associated with Our Business\nOur business is subject to numerous material and other risks and uncertainties that you should be aware of in evaluating our business. These risks include, but are not\nlimited to, the following:\n· We have incurred significant net losses since inception, and we expect to continue to incur significant net losses for the foreseeable future.\n· We have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate our prospects and likelihood of success.\n· Our business is tied directly to the nuclear medicine industry and depends on our ability to successfully introduce our Mo-100 and other medical isotopes to\nchanging technology and a changing medical practice landscape.\n· Our business is dependent on our ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, including our acquisition of assets of Molybdos (Pty) Limited in the\n“business rescue” auction, the assets and intellectual property we acquired from Klydon Proprietary Ltd, and our investment in PET Labs Pharmaceuticals;\n· We currently have no sales attributable to isotopes, but we expect to be heavily dependent on a few large customers to generate a majority of our revenues from\nsales of our future isotopes. Our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction in business with our future significant customers.\n· We are still conducting research and development efforts for isotopes such as Mo-100, Zinc-68, Silicon-28, Xenon-129/136, Germanium-70/72/74 and Chlorine-\n37 using the ASP technology. If we are unable to advance our future isotopes in development, obtain applicable regulatory approval and ultimately commercialize\nour future isotopes, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\n· We are awaiting the approvals necessary to conduct early research and development efforts for isotopes such as Uranium-235 utilizing the Quantum Enrichment\nprocess. The necessary approvals may take a significant amount of time and may never fail to materialize. As a result, we will not be able to enter into the nuclear\nenergy space utilizing our technology.\n· Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedures, document submissions, fee payments and other requirements\nimposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\n· Since our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market in November 2022, there has been only a limited prior public market for our Common Stock, the stock price of\nour Common Stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance and you may not be able to resell your shares quickly or at the market\nprice if trading in shares of our common stock is not active.\n· If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nAs a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our Common\nStock.\n· Our independent registered public accounting firm’s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a\n“going concern.”\nThe material and other risks summarized above should be read together with the text of the full risk factors below and in the other information set forth in this Annual\nReport, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, as well as in other documents that we file with the SEC. If any such material and other risks and\nuncertainties actually occur, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The risks summarized above or\ndescribed in full below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also\nmaterially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n24\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Limited Operating History, Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have a very limited operating history, and we have incurred losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable\nfuture. We may never generate any revenue attributable to sales of enriched isotopes or become profitable or, if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it.\nWe were incorporated in September 2021, and we have a very limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. Our operations to date\nhave been primarily focused on acquiring the assets of Molybdos (after participating in and being declared the winner of a competitive auction process under Section 45 of\nthe South Africa Consumer Protection Act, 2008 for ZAR 11,000,000, which at the then current exchange rate was approximately $734,000) and in-licensing intellectual\nproperty rights related to the production of Molybdenum-100 (a non-radioactive isotope we believe may have applications primarily in the medical industry) and Uranium-235\n(an isotope of uranium we believe may have application in the clean, efficient and carbon-free energy industry) using the ASP technology, organizing and staffing our\ncompany, research and development activities, business planning, raising capital, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. In July 2022, we\nacquired assets comprising a dormant Silicon-28 aerodynamic separation processing plant from Klydon. We have not yet built a manufacturing plant that is producing\ncommercial quantities of isotopes or even demonstrated the ability to produce commercial quantities of isotopes using the ASP technology or quantum enrichment technology.\nWe have not yet demonstrated an ability to overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in the medical, technology and energy\nindustries, including an ability to obtain applicable regulatory approvals, manufacture any isotopes at commercial scale, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for\nsuccessful isotope commercialization. In addition, we have not yet sought any regulatory approval that may be necessary for application of Mo-100 that we may produce using\nthe ASP process in the medical industry or the production of U-235 that we may produce using quantum enrichment. Consequently, any predictions about our future\nperformance may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing isotopes.\nInvestment in isotope enrichment technology is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential\nisotopes will fail to demonstrate adequate utility or effectiveness in the targeted application (or for medical indications, an acceptable safety profile), gain regulatory approval, if\napplicable, and become commercially viable. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue to date attributable to isotopes (and only\nlimited revenues attributable to PET Labs), and we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we\nare not profitable and have incurred losses since our inception in September 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we reported a net loss of $16.3 million\nand $4.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $23.8 million.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we:\n· continue to invest in our research and development activities;\n· seek applicable regulatory approvals for any future isotopes that we may successfully develop;\n· experience any delays or encounter any issues with any of the above, including but not limited to failed research and development activities, safety issues, or other\nregulatory challenges;\n· hire additional engineering and production personnel and build our internal resources, including those related to audit, patent, other legal, regulatory and tax-\nrelated services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance premiums and investor and\npublic relations costs;\n· obtain, expand, maintain, enforce and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n· establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and establish manufacturing capabilities, whether alone or with third parties, to commercialize future\nisotopes (assuming receipt of applicable regulatory approvals), if any; and\n· operate as a public company.\nWe expect limited commercial activity for our isotopes in the United States during the next two to three years and we anticipate that most of our initial revenues from\nfuture sales of our Mo-100 will be derived from countries in Asia and EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa). To become and remain profitable, we must succeed in\ndeveloping and eventually commercializing enriched isotopes that generate significant revenue. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities,\nincluding completing research and development activities relating to our ASP technology, obtaining applicable regulatory approval for future isotopes, if any, and\nmanufacturing, marketing and selling any future isotopes (assuming receipt of applicable regulatory approvals). We are only in the preliminary stages of most of these activities.\nWe may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenues that are significant enough to achieve profitability. Because of the numerous risks\nand uncertainties associated with chemical isotopes separation, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to\nachieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain\nprofitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify\nour future isotopes or even continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\n25\nTable of Contents\nOur future prospects are tied directly to the end markets that use our isotopes including the diagnostic medical imaging industry and depend on our ability to successfully\nintroduce our isotopes and adapt to a changing technology and medical practice landscape.\nThe field of diagnostic medical imaging is dynamic, with new products, including equipment, software and products, continually being developed and existing products\ncontinually being refined. New hardware (scanners), software or agents in a given diagnostic modality may be developed that provide benefits superior to the then-dominant\nhardware, software and agents in that modality, resulting in commercial displacement of the existing radiotracers. For example, alternate scanners and radiotracers could be\nintroduced. Similarly, changing perceptions about comparative efficacy and safety, as well as changing availability of supply may favor one agent over another or one modality\nover another. In addition, new or revised appropriate use criteria developed by professional societies, to assist physicians and other health care providers in making appropriate\nimaging decisions for specific clinical conditions, can and have reduced the frequency of and demand for certain imaging modalities and imaging agents. Technological\nobsolescence in any of the medical imaging products that would use the Mo-100 that we plan to manufacture could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of previous acquisitions.\nThe success of the company will depend in large part on the success of our management in integrating the acquired assets into the company. In October 2021, our\nsubsidiary in South Africa acquired the assets of Molybdos after participating in and being declared the winner of a competitive auction process under Section 45 of the South\nAfrica Consumer Protection Act, 2008 for ZAR 11,000,000 (which at the then current exchange rate was approximately $734,000), plus value added tax (VAT) levied by the\ngovernment of South Africa at the rate of 15% and auctioneers’ commission at the rate of 10%. In July 2022, we acquired assets comprising a dormant Silicon-28 aerodynamic\nseparation processing plant from Klydon located in Pretoria, South Africa for ZAR 6,000,000 (which at the then current exchange rate was approximately $364,000). In\naddition, in April 2023, we perfected our interest under the Acknowledgement of Debt Agreement, under which we acquired specific intellectual property from Klydon. To\ndate, we have completed the construction of one isotope enrichment facility, but we have not yet produced any commercial quantities of isotopes and we have not yet\ndemonstrated the ability to produce any isotope in commercial quantities using ASP technology. We will not know whether the assets that we acquired will work according to\nour expectations until we have produced commercial quantities of isotopes at our enrichment facilities. Our failure to achieve the integration of the acquired assets into the\ncompany and to commercialize the assets could result in our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of those acquisitions and could impair our results of operations,\nprofitability and financial results.\nThe acquisition of a controlling interest in Pet Labs Pharmaceuticals may fail to result in anticipated benefits but has involved significant investment of financial and other\nresources.\nIn October 2023, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Nucleonics Imaging Proprietary Limited, a company incorporated in South Africa, to purchase 51%\nof the ordinary shares (the “initial shares”) in Nucleonics’ wholly-owned subsidiary, Pet Labs Pharmaceuticals Proprietary Limited, a company incorporated in South Africa\nand dedicated to nuclear medicine and the science of radiopharmaceutical production. We agreed to pay a total of $2,000,000 for the initial shares in two installments. The first\ninstallment of $500,000 was paid in November 2023. The remaining balance of $1,500,000 is due upon demand any time after October 31, 2024 and is expected to be paid in\nNovember 2024. In addition, we have an option to purchase the remaining 49% of the ordinary shares (the “option shares”). If we exercise our option to purchase the option\nshares (which option is exercisable until January 31, 2027, provided that the initial shares have been paid for in full), we have agreed to pay $2,200,000 for the option shares.\nAcquisitions generally create risks such as (i) the need to integrate and manage the businesses and products acquired with our own business and products; (ii)\nadditional demands on our resources, systems, procedures and controls; (iii) disruption of our ongoing business; (iv) potential unknown or unquantifiable liabilities associated\nwith the target company; and (v) diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns. Moreover, this acquisition involves substantial investment of funds. This\nacquisition may not be successful in generating material revenue, income or other returns, and any resources we committed will not be available to us for other purposes. Our\ninability to take advantage of growth opportunities or address risks associated with this acquisition and investment may negatively affect our operating results. This acquisition\nmay not result in its anticipated benefits, and we may not be able to properly integrate the business with our future products and operations or successfully combine personnel\nand cultures. Failure to do so could deprive us of the intended benefits of this acquisition.\n26\nTable of Contents\nWe currently have no sales attributable to enriched isotopes, but we expect to be heavily dependent on a few large customers to generate a majority of our revenues. Our\noperating results could be adversely affected by a reduction in business with our future significant customers.\nWe currently have no sales attributable to enriched isotopes. However, we expect to rely on a limited number of customers to purchase any isotopes that we produce\nusing the ASP technology or quantum enrichment under long-term contracts. Our future key customers may stop ordering our isotopes at any time or may become bankrupt or\notherwise unable to pay. The loss of any of our future key customers could result in lower revenues than we anticipate and could harm our business, financial condition or\nresults of operations.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm’s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a “going\nconcern.”\nWe generated an accumulated deficit totaling approximately $23.8 million through December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $7.9 million\nin cash. Prior to our acquisition of 51% of PET Labs Pharmaceuticals, we had yet to generate any revenues, and we anticipate that our losses will continue for the foreseeable\nfuture. We cannot assure you that our plans to commercialize enriched isotopes that we may produce will be successful. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt\nabout our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements contained elsewhere in this report do not include any adjustments that might result from our inability\nto continue as a going concern. Unless we can begin to generate material revenue from production and sale of enriched isotopes or raise capital from equity offerings, we may\nnot be able to remain in business. We cannot assure you that we will raise enough money or generate sufficient sales to meet our future working capital needs.\nWe will require substantial additional capital to finance our operations, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital\nwhen needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate certain of our product development efforts or other operations.\nWe expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing and planned activities, particularly as we continue our research and development\nactivities, seek applicable regulatory approvals for any future isotopes that we may successfully develop, and expand our organization by hiring additional personnel. In\naddition, we expect to continue incurring significant costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our cash was approximately $7.9 million. Subsequent to the end of 2023, in March 2024, QLE sold unsecured promissory notes for\naggregate cash consideration of approximately $20.5 million. In addition, in April 2024, the Company received approximately $5.5 million from the issuance of 3,164,557\nshares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants. We believe, based on our current operating plan, that the net proceeds from our IPO, private placements completed in\nMarch 2023, October 2023, promissory notes issued in March 2024, and the exercise of warrants in April 2024 together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will not be\nsufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months from the date the financial statements are issued. Therefore, we may need to seek additional funds through\npublic or private equity or debt financings, third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing\narrangements, or any combination of these approaches.\nIn any event, we will require substantial additional capital to support our business operations as we pursue additional research and development activities related to our\nASP technology and seek applicable regulatory approval of our any future isotopes, and otherwise to support our continuing operations. In addition, we expect to incur\nsignificant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution (assuming receipt of applicable regulatory approvals for our future\nisotopes). Even if we believe we have sufficient capital for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or if we have\nspecific strategic considerations. Any additional capital raising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to\ndevelop and commercialize our future isotopes (assuming receipt of applicable regulatory approvals).\nAdditionally, as a result of severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, increased interest rates, inflationary pressures, declines in consumer confidence,\ndeclines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability, the global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme\nvolatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability. The financial markets and the global economy may also be adversely affected by the\ncurrent or anticipated impact of military conflict. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly or\nmore dilutive. If we do not raise additional capital in sufficient amounts, we may be prevented from pursuing development and commercialization efforts, which will harm our\nbusiness, operating results and prospects.\n27\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to credit counterparty risk which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company maintains cash balances at many financial institutions in multiple geographies. While the majority of cash balances are currently held in USD at U.S.\nfinancial institutions, our cash balances at those institutions may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limit of $250,000 per depositor, per\ninsured bank for each account ownership category. Our non-US banking counterparties might not have protections offered to their customers that are considered standard in the\nU.S. and even if such deposit insurances do exist, there is no guarantee that the insurer will honor those insurance policies. Although the Company currently believes that the\nfinancial institutions with whom it does business, will be able to fulfill their commitments to the Company, there is no assurance that those institutions will be able to continue\nto do so. Any credit losses that may occur could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRaising additional capital or acquiring or licensing assets by issuing equity or debt securities may cause dilution to our stockholders, and raising funds through lending\nand licensing arrangements may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nWe may plan to seek additional capital through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing\narrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may\ninclude liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations\nand could involve certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property\nrights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise additional capital through future collaborations, strategic\nalliances or third-party licensing arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our intellectual property, future revenue streams, research programs or future\nisotopes, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization\nefforts, or grant rights to develop and market our future isotopes (assuming receipt of applicable regulatory approvals for our future isotopes) that we would otherwise develop\nand market ourselves.\nRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of Our Future Isotopes\nWe are early in our research and development efforts for isotopes using the ASP technology and the quantum enrichment process. If we are unable to advance our future\nisotopes in development, obtain applicable regulatory approval and ultimately commercialize our future isotopes, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business\nwill be materially harmed.\nWe are still conducting research and development efforts using ASP technology to produce a wide array of isotopes, and have not yet produced any isotope at\ncommercial scale. It is possible that the research and development, proof-of-concept, construction of a plant and commercialization will take longer than anticipated due to\nunexpected delays.\nWe also plan to begin researching the enrichment of uranium, which is a chemical element we believe may have application in the clean, efficient and carbon-free\nenergy industry, using quantum enrichment. Quantum enrichment has never been used to produce isotopes at a commercial scale and the research that has been conducted using\nthis technique has never been published. The IAEA has never inspected any facility that leverages this technology and there is no proof that this technology has ever been used\nto enrich uranium. There are significant regulatory hurdles associated with enabling our research and development efforts to enter the nuclear energy market. Multiple\nregulatory agencies need to provide approvals to allow us to proceed with the research and development necessary to show proof of concept to the market. If we demonstrate\nproof of concept, we anticipate that there will be further approvals needed to expand to a larger footprint to support commercial demand. We may not ever obtain these\napprovals. If we are unable to advance our future isotopes in development, obtain applicable regulatory approval and ultimately commercialize our future isotopes (assuming\nreceipt of applicable regulatory approvals), or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nOur ability to generate product revenues will depend heavily on the success of our research and development activities, receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, and\neventual commercialization of our future isotopes (assuming receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and compliance with all applicable regulatory authorities).\nThe success of our business, including our ability to finance our company and generate any revenue in the future, will primarily depend on the successful development,\nregulatory approval and commercialization of our currently planned future isotopes, which may never occur.\nWe will have to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing research and development activities relating to our ASP technology, obtaining\napplicable regulatory approval for future isotopes, if any, and manufacturing, marketing and selling any future isotopes (assuming receipt of applicable regulatory approvals).\nWe are only in the preliminary stages of most of these activities. If we are unable to succeed in these activities, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our\nbusiness.\n28\nTable of Contents\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide us components and a material interruption in supply could prevent or limit our ability to execute our strategic plan and\ndevelopment programs in the expected timeframe.\nWe depend upon a limited number of third-party suppliers for certain components required to construct the centrifuges and other equipment for the enrichment plants\nthat are being constructed in South Africa. To date, we have been able to obtain the required components for our centrifuges without any significant delays or interruptions,\nexcept for certain delays related to COVID-19. If we lose any of these suppliers, we may be required to find and enter into supply arrangements with one or more replacement\nsuppliers. Obtaining alternative sources of supply could involve significant delays and other costs, and these supply sources may not be available to us on reasonable terms or at\nall. Any disruption of supplies could delay completion of the enrichment plant in South Africa, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic plan and\ndevelopment programs in the expected timeframe.\nDevelopment activities at our facility in South Africa could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, which could prevent us from completing our development activities.\nA disruption in development activities at our facility in South Africa could have a material adverse effect on our business. Disruptions could occur for many reasons,\nincluding power outages, fire, natural disasters, weather, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems, public health crises, disease, strikes or other labor unrest,\ntransportation interruption, government regulation, political unrest or terrorism. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost\nsubstantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. South Africa struggles with\nlimited electricity supply and regions of the country regularly undergo load-shedding, during which electricity is not available. This uncertain supply of electricity could impact\nour ability to operate and produce commercial products and could negatively affect the financial position of the Company.\nRisks associated with the development of ASP technology for enrichment of isotopes could cause substantial delays in production of our future isotopes.\nPrior to October 2021, as a company, we had no involvement with or control over the research and development of the ASP technology. We relied on Klydon to\nconduct such research and development in accordance with the applicable legal, regulatory and scientific standards. If the research and development processes or the results of\nthe development programs associated with the ASP technology for development of isotopes prove to be unreliable, this could result in increased costs and delays in the\ndevelopment of our future isotopes, which could adversely affect any future revenue from these future isotopes (assuming receipt of applicable regulatory approvals).\nRegulatory approval for production and distribution of radiopharmaceuticals used for medical imaging and therapeutic treatments may involve a lengthy and expensive\nprocess with an uncertain outcome.\nCurrently, the sale or use of Mo-100 is not regulated by a healthcare regulator, such as the FDA, European Medicines Agency (EMA) or comparable foreign regulatory\nauthorities. However, products such as Mo-99 and Tc-99m that are produced from Mo-100 in a cyclotron or a linear accelerator are regulated by healthcare regulators. We\nexpect radiopharmacies, hospitals, clinics and others in the medical community to produce the widely used medical radioisotope technetium-99m (Tc-99m) from the Mo-100\nthat we may produce using our ASP technology. Tc-99m is a diagnostic agent that is used by health care professionals with FDA-approved imaging devices to detect potential\ndiseases like coronary artery disease and cancer, as well as evaluate lung, liver, kidney and brain function. When used with the appropriate diagnostic scanner device, such as a\nSPECT imaging system, the Tc-99m emits signals that are captured and produces an image of internal organs to detect various medical problems and contribute to diagnosis and\ntreatment decisions. Our future customers who may use Mo-100 to produce radiopharmaceuticals will likely require regulatory approval for their products. To date, only one\nhealthcare regulator (Canada) has approved the use of Tc-99m produced from Mo-100 via a cyclotron. Obtaining regulatory approval is expensive and can take many years to\ncomplete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Our customers’ regulatory approval process may not be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all, and failure\ncan occur at any time during the process.\nIn the future, we may need to obtain approval from the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities prior to the sale of Mo-100 that we may produce using\nour ASP technology for use in medical imaging and therapeutic treatments. If we require FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities to approve the sale of\nMo-100 that we may produce using our ASP technology for medical imaging and therapeutic treatments, we must demonstrate the safety and utility or efficacy of our Mo-100.\nObtaining regulatory approval is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Our regulatory approval process may not be\nconducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all, and failure can occur at any time during the process.\nOther isotopes that we intend to produce in the future may also require approvals from healthcare regulators such as FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory\nauthorities.\n29\nTable of Contents\nOur success depends on our future customers’ ability to successfully commercialize products that are produced from our isotopes.\nOur customers operate in a competitive environment. If our customers are unable to successfully commercialize products that they produce from our isotopes, our\nbusiness will be negatively impacted. Our customers may fail for a number of reasons, including but not limited to pricing pressure from competing products and failure to gain\nregulatory approval for the production of their products from healthcare regulators.\nOur success depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing competitive environment in the nuclear industry.\nThe nuclear industry in general, and the nuclear fuel industry in particular, is in a period of significant change, which could significantly transform the competitive\nlandscape we face. The uranium and isotope enrichment sector is competitive. Changes in the competitive landscape may adversely affect pricing trends, change customer\nspending patterns, or create uncertainty. To address these changes, we may seek to adjust our cost structure and efficiency of operations and evaluate opportunities to grow our\nbusiness organically or through acquisitions and other strategic transactions. We are actively considering, and expect to consider from time to time in the future, potential\nstrategic transactions, which could involve, without limitation, changes in our capital structure, acquisitions and/or dispositions of businesses or assets, joint ventures or\ninvestments in businesses, products or technologies.\nIn connection with any such transaction, we may seek additional debt or equity financing, contribute or dispose of assets, assume additional indebtedness, or partner\nwith other parties to consummate a transaction. Any such transaction may not result in the intended benefits and could involve significant commitments of our financial and\nother resources. Legal and consulting costs incurred in connection with debt or equity financing transactions in development are deferred and subject to immediate expensing if\nsuch a transaction becomes less likely to occur. If the actions we take in response to industry changes are not successful, our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition may be adversely affected.\nWe may explore strategic collaborations that may never materialize or may fail.\nWe intend to accelerate the development of our enriched uranium program by selectively collaborating with energy companies in the United States. We intend to retain\nsignificant technology, economic and commercial rights to our programs in key geographic areas that are core to our long-term strategy. As a result, we intend to periodically\nexplore a variety of possible additional strategic collaborations in an effort to gain access to additional resources. At the current time, we cannot predict what form such a\nstrategic collaboration might take. We are likely to face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic collaborators, and negotiations are difficult and time-consuming.\nWe may not be able to negotiate strategic collaborations on acceptable terms, or at all. We are unable to predict when, if ever, we will enter into any additional strategic\ncollaborations because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with establishing them.\nIf the market opportunities for our future enriched isotopes are smaller than we estimate (even assuming receipt of any required regulatory approval), our business may\nsuffer.\nWe are currently focused on producing enriched isotopes using our ASP technology to meet critical needs in society. We also plan to research the production of\nenriched uranium using quantum enrichment to meet the future needs of developers of U.S. advanced reactor technologies requiring HALEU. Our projections of the potential\nmarkets are based on estimates that have been derived from a variety of sources, including scientific literature and market research, and which may prove to be incorrect. We\nmust be able to successfully acquire a significant market share in our potential markets to achieve profitability and growth. Customers may become difficult to gain access to,\nwhich would adversely affect our results of operations and our business.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing enriched isotopes before or more successfully than us.\nThe development and commercialization of radioisotopes and chemical elements is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to all the enriched isotopes\nthat we may produce using our ASP technology from established biotechnology and nuclear medicine technology companies and will face competition with respect to enriched\nuranium that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future from innovative technology and energy companies. There are a number of large biotechnology and nuclear\nmedicine technology companies that currently market and sell radioisotopes to radiopharmacies, hospitals, clinics and others in the medical community (Mo-99 is the active\ningredient for Tc-99m-based radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine procedures). There are also a number of technology and energy companies that are currently\nseeking to develop HALEU. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct\nresearch, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.\n30\nTable of Contents\nMore established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their greater size, resources and institutional experience. In particular, these companies\nhave greater experience and expertise in securing reimbursement, government contracts, relationships with key opinion leaders, obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals\nand distribution relationships to market products. These companies also have significantly greater research and marketing capabilities than we do. If we are not able to compete\neffectively against existing and potential competitors, our business and financial condition may be harmed.\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may complete development of isotopes before we are able to, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize our\nfuture isotopes. Our competitors may also develop radioisotopes or technologies that are safer, more effective, more widely accepted and cheaper than ours, and may also be\nmore successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their isotopes. These appreciable advantages could render our future isotopes obsolete or non-competitive before we\ncan recover the expenses of their development and commercialization.\nMergers and acquisitions in the technology and energy industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors.\nSmaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.\nThese third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary\nto, or necessary for, our programs.\nEven if the products that we or our customers may produce using the ASP technology receives regulatory approval, it may fail to achieve market acceptance by\nradiopharmacies, hospitals, clinics or others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nEven if the isotopes that we may produce using the ASP technology for the medical industry, or the radioisotopes that we expect our future customers to produce using\nthe stable isotopes that we plan to offer, receives regulatory approval, the isotopes may fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by radiopharmacies, hospitals, clinics and\nothers in the medical community. If it does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and may not become profitable. The\ndegree of market acceptance of isotopes that we may produce using the ASP technology, or the radioisotopes that our future customers may produce, will depend on a number\nof factors, including but not limited to:\n· the potential advantages compared to alternative radioisotopes;\n· the timing of market introduction of the product as well as competitive products;\n· effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts;\n· the strength of our relationships with radiopharmacies, hospitals, clinics and others in the medical community;\n· the cost in relation to alternative radioisotopes;\n· our ability to offer isotopes that we may produce using the ASP technology for sale at competitive prices;\n· the convenience and ease of use compared to alternative radioisotopes;\n· the willingness of radiopharmacies, hospitals, clinics and others in the medical community to try an innovative radioisotope; and\n· the strength of marketing and distribution support.\nOur efforts to educate radiopharmacies, hospitals, clinics and others in the medical community on the benefits of our isotopes that we may produce using the ASP\ntechnology may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nBecause we expect sales of isotopes that we may produce using the ASP technology (assuming receipt of applicable regulatory approvals for commercial sale) to\ngenerate substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of these isotopes that we may produce using the ASP technology (assuming receipt of applicable\nregulatory approvals for commercial sale) to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing.\n31\nTable of Contents\nWe currently have no marketing and sales organization for our future isotopes and have no experience as a company in commercializing products, and we may have to\ninvest significant resources to develop these capabilities. If we are unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market\nand sell our products, we may not be able to generate product revenue.\nWe have no internal sales, marketing or distribution capabilities for our future isotopes, nor have we commercialized any isotopes. If the isotopes that we may produce\nusing our ASP technology gains market acceptance and our customers receive regulatory approval for the isotopes they produce, we must build a marketing and sales\norganization with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize such product in the markets that we target, which will be expensive and time-\nconsuming, or collaborate with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or\nin lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems. We currently plan to independently commercialize the isotopes that we may produce using our ASP technology\n(assuming receipt of applicable regulatory approvals) in the United States by establishing a focused sales force and marketing infrastructure. We may opportunistically seek\nadditional strategic collaborations to maximize the commercial opportunities for our medical isotopes business outside of the United States. We have no prior experience as a\ncompany in the marketing, sale and distribution of isotopes and there are significant risks involved in building and managing a sales organization, including our ability to hire,\nretain and incentivize qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel and effectively manage a geographically\ndispersed sales and marketing team. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the\ncommercialization of these products. We may not be able to enter into collaborations or hire consultants or external service providers to assist us in sales, marketing and\ndistribution functions on acceptable financial terms, or at all. In addition, our product revenues and our profitability, if any, may be lower if we rely on third parties for these\nfunctions than if we were to market, sell and distribute any products that we develop ourselves. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may\nfail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we are not successful in commercializing our isotopes, either on our own or\nthrough arrangements with one or more third parties, we may not be able to generate any future product revenue and we would incur significant additional losses.\nObtaining regulatory approval for either the Mo-100 that we may produce using the ASP technology, or the Tc-99m or Mo-99 that our future customers may produce\nusing the Mo-100 that we plan to offer, in one jurisdiction does not mean that we or they will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of such future products in\nother jurisdictions.\nCurrently, the production and distribution of Mo-100 does not require any regulatory licenses from healthcare regulators. Healthcare regulators frequently change such\nrequirements, and it is possible that in the future Mo-100 may be regulated as a healthcare product. Obtaining such regulatory licenses, if required, may be a timely and costly\nprocess and could materially impact our ability to commercialize the Mo-100 that we plan to offer. Obtaining regulatory approval of the Mo-100 that we may produce using the\nASP technology in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval in any other jurisdiction. For example, even if the FDA grants\nregulatory approval of the Mo-100 that we may produce using the ASP technology, comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions must also approve the\nmanufacturing, marketing and promotion and reimbursement of such future product in those countries. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one\njurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and\nadministrative review periods different from those in the United States.\nObtaining foreign regulatory approvals and establishing and maintaining compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties\nand costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of the Mo-100 that we may produce using the ASP technology. Products such as Tc-99m and Mo-99 that may be\nproduced by our future customers using the Mo-100 that we plan to offer will likely require regulatory licenses in most regions. Healthcare regulators frequently change such\nrequirements and it is unclear what each healthcare regulator will require. To date, only one region (Canada) has approved the use of Tc-99m that has been produced from Mo-\n100 in a cyclotron. Obtaining such regulatory licenses, if required, may be a timely and costly process and could materially impact the ability of our future customers to operate\nand use the Mo-100 that we plan to offer. Obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that we or they will be able to obtain regulatory approval in any\nother jurisdiction.\nIf we or any future collaborator fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets or fail to receive applicable marketing approvals, our target\nmarket will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of the Mo-100 that we may produce using the ASP technology will be harmed.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization of any isotopes that we may produce.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure if we commercialize any isotopes that we may produce. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims\nthat any such isotopes caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n· decreased demand for any isotopes that we may produce;\n· loss of revenue;\n· substantial monetary awards to patients;\n· significant time and costs to defend the related litigation;\n· a diversion of management’s time and our resources;\n· initiation of investigations by regulators;\n· the inability to commercialize any isotopes that we may produce;\n· injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention; and\n· a decline in our share price.\n32\nTable of Contents\nAny product liability insurance coverage that we obtain and maintain may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We anticipate that we will need to\nincrease our insurance coverage each time we commence a clinical trial and if we successfully commercialize any isotopes. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We\nmay not be able to obtain or maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Compliance\nOur business is and could become subject to a wide variety of extensive and evolving laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations and failure to\nobtain licenses, approvals and permits that may be required to execute on our strategy and develop our company’s business could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations relating to various aspects of our business, including with respect to the development of the ASP technology\nand our future isotopes, employment and labor, health care, tax, privacy and data security, health and safety, and environmental issues. Laws and regulations at the South\nAfrican and foreign, federal, state and local levels frequently change, especially in relation to new and emerging industries, and we cannot always reasonably predict the impact\nof, or the ultimate cost of compliance with, current or future regulatory or administrative changes. In South Africa, our isotope enrichment facilities are heavily regulated. South\nAfrica is a signatory to the International Atomic Energy Agency (“IAEA”) conventions and has adopted safety standards from the IAEA. The design, construction and operation\nof the isotope enrichment plants are highly regulated and require government licenses, approvals and permits, and may be subject to the imposition of conditions. In some cases,\nthese licenses, approvals and permits entail periodic review and inspections. While we and Klydon have received all licenses, approvals and permits required to build and\noperate our isotope enrichment facilities in South Africa, we cannot predict whether the conditions associated with such licenses, approvals and permits will be maintained. For\nexample, each of Klydon and ASP Isotopes South Africa (Proprietary) Limited has received from the South African Council for The Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass\nDestruction (1) a registration certificate (which are valid for two years from the date of issuance) and (2) a Manufacturing and Services Permit. The permits provide that the\nNon-Proliferation Secretariat will conduct at least two industry visits in June and November (or as arranged) of every year. Each of the permits includes numerous conditions,\nincluding, for example, the obligation to keep the Council updated or informed on all separation projects at all times and at least through biannual declarations, which must be\ndone through correspondence to the Council at the end of April and September every year. The permit issued to ASP Isotopes South Africa (Proprietary) Limited includes\nadditional specific information requirements related to (i) the progress on the design and construction of the isotope separation plant, (ii) the progress on the manufacturing of\nisotope separation elements, and (iii) the commissioning of the plant. Each of the permits further provides that (i) any potential export of controlled goods and technology\nshould be requested at an early stage through a Provisional Export Guidance Request, (ii) all isotope separation applications remain controlled regardless of the isotope atomic\nmass and will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, and (iii) any ultimate transfer of these controlled goods and technology will be subject to the issuance of a permit by the\nCouncil as required in terms of the Non-Proliferation Act and related Government Notices and Regulations.\nIn addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain, on a timely basis or at all, any additional licenses, approvals and permits that may be required to\nexecute on our strategy and develop our company’s business, including any such licenses, approvals and permits that may be required to introduce isotopes produced using ASP\ntechnology into the market and to begin the enrichment of uranium to demonstrate our capability to produce HALEU using the Quantum Enrichment technology.\nChanges in law or the imposition of new or additional regulations or permit requirements that impact our business could negatively impact our performance in various\nways, including by limiting our ability to collaborate with partners or customers or by increasing our costs and the time necessary to obtain required authorization. We monitor\nnew developments and devote a significant amount of management’s time and external resources to compliance with these laws and regulations. We cannot assure you,\nhowever, that we are and will remain in compliance with all such requirements and, even when we believe we are in compliance, a regulatory agency may determine that we are\nnot. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all licenses, approvals and permits that may be required to execute on our strategy and develop our\ncompany’s business as currently contemplated. Failure by us, our employees, affiliates, partners or others with whom we work to comply with applicable laws and regulations\nor to obtain or comply with necessary licenses, approvals and permits could result in administrative, civil, commercial or criminal liabilities, including suspension or debarment\nfrom government contracts or suspension of our export/import privileges. Failure by us, our employees, affiliates, partners or others with whom we work to comply with the\npermits issued to us by the South African Council for The Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction could result in disruption of our development activities at our\nfacility in South Africa, which could prevent us from completing our development activities.\n33\nTable of Contents\nIf technology developed for the purposes of enriching isotopes can be applied to the creation or development of weapons-grade materials, then our technology may be\nconsidered “dual use” technology and be subject to limitations on public disclosure or export.\nOur research and development of isotope enrichment is dedicated not only to producing enriched isotopes for use in nuclear medical diagnostic procedures and\nconcentrating uranium in the isotope uranium-235 for use in nuclear energy, but also to safeguarding any information with broad, dual-use potential that could be\ninappropriately applied. Enrichment is among the most sensitive nuclear technologies because it can produce weapon-grade materials. The ASP technology and the Quantum\nEnrichment technology may be considered dual use and could be subject to export control, for example, under the Wassenaar Arrangement.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur intellectual property is not protected through patents or formal copyright registration. As a result, we do not have the full benefit of patent or copyright laws to prevent\nothers from replicating the ASP technology.\nWe have not yet protected our intellectual property rights through patents or formal copyright registration, and we currently have no patent applications pending. To\ndate, we have relied exclusively on trade secrets and other intellectual property laws, non-disclosure agreements with our respective employees, consultants, vendors, potential\ncustomers and other relevant persons and other measures to protect our intellectual property, and intend to continue to rely on these and other means. As we intend to transition\ninto the commercialization of isotopes, we envision our intellectual property and its security becoming more vital to our future. Until we protect our intellectual property\nthrough patent, trademarks and registered copyrights, we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and trade secrets or prevent others from independently developing\nsubstantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or from otherwise gaining access to our intellectual property or trade secrets. In such an instance, our\ncompetitors could produce products that are nearly identical to ours, resulting in us selling less products or generating less revenue from our sales.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and prevent others from making unauthorized use of our products and technology.\nOur success and competitiveness depend, in significant part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including the ASP technology and the Quantum\nEnrichment technology and certain other practices, tools, technologies and technical expertise we utilize in designing, developing, implementing and maintaining processes used\nin the development of our future isotopes. To date, we have relied exclusively on trade secrets and other intellectual property laws, non-disclosure agreements with our\nrespective employees, consultants, vendors, potential customers and other relevant persons and other measures to protect our intellectual property, and intend to continue to rely\non these and other means.\nFor strategic reasons, we have not yet protected our intellectual property by filing patent applications related to our technology, inventions and improvements. Even if\nwe filed patent applications and patents were granted, we cannot assure you we would be fully protected against third parties as those patents may not be sufficiently broad in\ntheir coverage, may not be economically significant, or may not provide us with any competitive advantage. Competitors may be able to design around any patents and develop\nisotope production techniques comparable or superior to the ASP technology or the Quantum Enrichment technology. Furthermore, the filing of a patent would entail the\ndisclosure of our know-how, and breaches of patent rights related to a wrongful use of this know-how would be difficult to enforce in the international landscape. We believe\nthat our intellectual property strategy differs significantly from the strategies of others involved in the medical isotope industry, many of whom have extensive patent portfolios\nand rely heavily on intellectual property registrations to enforce their intellectual property rights. As a result of this discrepancy in strategy, we may be at a competitive\ndisadvantage with respect to the strength of our intellectual property protection. Unlike others involved in the medical isotope industry, who generally have patents providing\nexclusive control over their innovations, we have no recourse against any entity that independently creates the same technology as ours or legitimately reverse-engineers our\ntechnology.\nWe generally enter into non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants and other parties with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances.\nWe cannot, however, assure you that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our technology and proprietary information. Since we do not\nprotect our intellectual property by filing patent applications, we rely on our personnel to protect our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information to a greater\ndegree than we would if we had patent protection for our intellectual property. In any jurisdiction in which our research and development is not protected by similar agreements,\nthere is no protection against the manufacture and marketing of identical or comparable research and development by third parties, who are generally free to use, independently\ndevelop, and sell our developments and technologies without paying license or royalty fees. Furthermore, our former employees may perform work for our competitors and use\nour know-how in performing this work. In the event we scale our business by hiring additional personnel and entering into contracts with third parties, the risks associated with\nbreaches of non-disclosure agreements, confidentiality agreements and other agreements pertaining to our technology and proprietary information will increase, and such\nbreaches could have an adverse effect on our business and competitive position.\n34\nTable of Contents\nWe may come to believe that third parties are infringing on, or otherwise violating, our intellectual property or other proprietary rights. To prevent infringement or\nunauthorized use, we may need to file infringement and/or misappropriation suits, which are expensive and time-consuming, could result in meritorious counterclaims against us\nand would distract management’s attention. In addition, in an infringement or misappropriation proceeding, a court may decide that one or more of our intellectual property\nrights is invalid, unenforceable, or both, in which case third parties may be able to use our technology without paying license fees or royalties. If we are unable to protect our\nintellectual property and proprietary rights, we may be unable to prevent competitors from using our own inventions and intellectual property to compete against us, and our\nbusiness may be harmed.\nOur ASP technology may be found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights.\nThird parties may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to their intellectual property rights in technology that is important to us, including the ASP\ntechnology. For example, on October 25, 2022, we received a letter (the “NMS Letter”) from a law firm acting on behalf of Norsk Medisinsk Syklotronsenter AS (“NMS”),\nasserting, among other things, that the grant of the former license to the ASP technology to us by Klydon violated a pre-existing exclusive sub-license to the ASP technology\ngranted to Radfarma. In November 2023, we entered into a mutual release with NMS, Radfarma, and certain board members and shareholders of Radfarma related to the claims\nasserted in the NMS letter and other matters, without any payment or license of any rights by any party to the release. Any future claims alleging infringement of intellectual\nproperty rights with respect to the ASP technology on which our company relies could be time-consuming, resulting in costly arbitration or litigation and diversion of technical\nand management personnel, or require us to develop non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. We cannot assure you that licenses will be available on\nacceptable terms, if at all. Furthermore, because of the potential for significant damage awards, which are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably\nunmeritorious claims resulting in large settlements. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to\ndevelop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results and financial condition\ncould be materially adversely affected.\nIf the ASP technology infringes the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs, and we may have to take certain actions, including the\nfollowing:\n· obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n· redesign our technology or processes to avoid infringement;\n· stop using the subject matter claimed to be held by others;\n· pay damages; or\n· defend arbitration, litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose (and may be prohibitively expensive, particularly for a\ncompany of our size), and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nIn addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court or tribunal may decide that our asserted intellectual property is not valid or is unenforceable. An adverse\ndetermination in any litigation, arbitration or defense proceedings could put our intellectual property at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. If our intellectual\nproperty rights are found to be invalid or unenforceable (in whole or in part), our ability to commercialize our future isotopes would suffer and our business, results of\noperations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe may enter into collaboration agreements and strategic alliances, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such collaborations or alliances.\nWe may wish to form collaborations in the future with respect to our future isotopes but may not be able to do so or to realize the potential benefits of such\ntransactions, which may cause us to alter or delay our development and commercialization plans. Research and development collaborations are subject to numerous risks, which\nmay include the following:\n· collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to a collaboration and may not commit sufficient efforts and\nresources or may misapply those efforts and resources;\n· collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of future isotopes or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization\nprograms;\n· collaborators may delay, provide insufficient resources to, or modify or stop development activities for future isotopes;\n· collaborators could develop or acquire products outside of the collaboration that compete directly or indirectly with our future isotopes;\n35\nTable of Contents\n· collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that\ngives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability;\n· disputes may arise between us and a collaborator that cause the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our future isotopes, or\nthat result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;\n· collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital and personnel to pursue further development or commercialization\nof the applicable future isotopes; and\n· collaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering our products that results from our collaborating with them, and in such cases, we may not have\nthe exclusive right to commercialize such intellectual property.\nThe development and potential commercialization of our future isotopes will require substantial additional capital to fund expenses. We may form or seek further\nstrategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations, or enter into additional licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our\ndevelopment and commercialization efforts with respect to our future isotopes, including in territories outside the United States or for certain indications. These transactions can\nentail numerous operational and financial risks, including exposure to unknown liabilities, disruption of our business and diversion of our management’s time and attention in\norder to manage a collaboration or develop acquired products or technologies, incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay transaction\nconsideration or costs, higher than expected collaboration, acquisition or integration costs, write-downs of assets or goodwill or impairment charges, increased amortization\nexpenses, difficulty and cost in facilitating the collaboration or combining the operations and personnel of any acquired business, impairment of relationships with key\nsuppliers, manufacturers or customers of any acquired business due to changes in management and ownership and the inability to retain key employees of any acquired\nbusiness. As a result, if we enter into acquisition or in-license agreements or strategic partnerships, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable\nto successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture, or if there are materially adverse impacts on our or the counterparty’s operations, which could\ndelay our timelines or otherwise adversely affect our business. We also cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or\nspecific net income that justifies such transaction or such other benefits that led us to enter into the arrangement.\nIn addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. We may not be\nsuccessful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for our future isotopes because they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of\ndevelopment for collaborative effort and third parties may not view our future isotopes as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. If and when we\ncollaborate with a third-party for development and commercialization of a future isotope, we can expect to relinquish some or all of the control over the future success of that\nfuture isotope to the third-party. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator’s\nresources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator’s evaluation of our technologies, future isotopes and market\nopportunities. The collaborator may also consider alternative isotopes or technologies for similar applications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a\ncollaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our future isotope. We may also be restricted under any license agreements from entering into agreements on\ncertain terms or at all with potential collaborators.\nAs a result of these risks, we may not be able to realize the benefit of our existing collaborations or any future collaborations or licensing agreements we may enter into.\nIn addition, we may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of\nsuch future isotope, reduce or delay one or more of our other development programs, delay the potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any planned sales or\nmarketing activities for such future isotope, or increase our expenditures and undertake development, manufacturing or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we\nelect to increase our expenditures to fund development, manufacturing or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be\navailable to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our future isotopes or bring them to market and generate\nproduct revenue.\n36\nTable of Contents\nWe may be dependent on intellectual property licensed or sublicensed to us from, or for which development was funded or otherwise assisted by, government agencies, for\ndevelopment of our technology and future isotopes. Failure to meet our own obligations to any licensor or upstream licensors, including such government agencies, may\nresult in the loss of our rights to such intellectual property, which could harm our business.\nGovernment agencies may provide funding, facilities, personnel or other assistance in connection with the development of the intellectual property rights owned by or\nlicensed to us. Such government agencies may have retained rights in such intellectual property, including the right to grant or require us to grant mandatory licenses or\nsublicenses to such intellectual property to third parties under certain specified circumstances, including if it is necessary to meet health and safety needs that we are not\nreasonably satisfying or if it is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by federal regulations, or to manufacture products in the United States. Any exercise of\nsuch rights, including with respect to any such required sublicense of these licenses could result in the loss of significant rights and could harm our ability to commercialize\nlicensed products.\nIf we are unable to obtain patent protection for our future isotopes, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, we may not be able to compete\neffectively in our markets.\nWe anticipate that we may file patent applications both in the United States and in other countries, as appropriate. However, we cannot predict:\n· if and when any patents will issue;\n· the degree and scope of protection any issued patents will afford us against competitors, including whether third parties will find ways to invalidate or otherwise\ncircumvent our patents;\n· whether others will apply for or obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications;\n· whether we will need to initiate litigation or administrative proceedings to defend our patent rights, which may be costly whether we win or lose; or\n· whether the patent applications that we own or in-license will result in issued patents with claims that cover our future isotopes or uses thereof in the United States\nor in foreign countries.\nWe currently rely upon a combination of trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our isotope development\ntechniques and future isotopes. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect\nto the ASP technology and the Quantum Enrichment technology. We may seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad\nrelated to its current and future development programs and future isotopes to the extent permitted by applicable law. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-\nconsuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner.\nIt is possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. The patent\napplications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our future isotopes in the United States or in foreign countries. There is no\nassurance that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, which can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from being\nissued from a pending patent application. Even if patents are successfully issued and even if such patents cover the ASP technology and the Quantum Enrichment technology,\nthird parties may challenge their scope, validity, or enforceability, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable. Any successful\nopposition to these patents or any other patents owned by or licensed to us could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of any future isotopes using\nthe ASP technology or the Quantum Enrichment technology. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a future\nisotope could be reduced.\nIf the patent applications we hold or have in-licensed with respect to our development programs fail to issue, if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, or if\nthey fail to provide meaningful exclusivity for the ASP technology or the Quantum Enrichment technology, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us, and\nthreaten our ability to commercialize, isotopes produced using the ASP technology or the Quantum Enrichment technology. Any such outcome could have a negative effect on\nour business.\nEven if we obtain patents covering the ASP technology or the Quantum Enrichment technology or our methods, we may still be barred from making, using and selling\nsuch technology or methods because of the patent rights of others. Others may have filed, and in the future may file, patent applications covering technology or methods that are\nsimilar or identical to ours, which could materially affect our ability to successfully develop our technology or to successfully commercialize any isotopes alone or with\ncollaborators.\nPatent applications in the United States and elsewhere are generally published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such\nearliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority date. Therefore, patent applications covering our platform technologies and methods could have been filed by\nothers without our knowledge. Additionally, pending claims in patent applications which have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner\nthat could cover our platform technologies. These patent applications may have priority over patent applications filed by us.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed\nby government patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\n37\nTable of Contents\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other government fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various\ngovernment patent agencies outside of the United States over the lifetime of our owned and licensed patents and/or applications and any patent rights we may own or license in\nthe future. We will rely on our outside counsel, patent annuity service providers, or our licensing partners to pay these fees due to non-U.S. patent agencies. The USPTO and\nvarious non-U.S. government patent agencies require compliance with several procedural, documentary, and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We\nwill employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in\naccordance with the applicable rules. There are situations, however, in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in\npartial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, potential competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance could harm\nour business.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a\nnegative impact on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, upon our ability and the ability of our current or future collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our future\nisotopes and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights and intellectual property of third parties. The technology industry is characterized by\nextensive and complex litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our future isotopes and other proprietary technologies we may develop may infringe\nexisting or future patents owned by third parties. We may in the future become party to, or be threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual\nproperty rights with respect to our future isotopes and technology, including interference proceedings, post-grant review and inter partes review before the USPTO. Third parties\nmay assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future, regardless of their merit. There is a risk that third parties may\nchoose to engage in litigation with us to enforce or to otherwise assert their patent rights against us. Even if we believe such claims are without merit, a court of competent\njurisdiction could hold that these third-party patents are valid, enforceable and infringed, which could have a negative impact on our ability to commercialize our future\nisotopes. In order to successfully challenge the validity of any such U.S. patent in federal court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity. As this burden is a high\none requiring us to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of any such U.S. patent claim, there is no assurance that a court of competent jurisdiction would\ninvalidate the claims of any such U.S. patent. If we are found to infringe a third party’s valid and enforceable intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a\nlicense from such third party to continue developing, manufacturing and marketing our future isotope(s) and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required\nlicense on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors and other third parties\naccess to the same technologies licensed to us, and it could require us to make substantial licensing and royalty payments. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease\ndeveloping, manufacturing and commercializing the infringing technology or future isotope. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble\ndamages and attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right. A finding of infringement could prevent us from\nmanufacturing and commercializing our future isotopes or force us to cease some or all of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we\nhave misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations\nand prospects.\nThird parties asserting their patent or other intellectual property rights against us may seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block\nour ability to further develop and commercialize our future isotopes or force us to cease some of our business operations. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit,\nwould involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of management and other employee resources from our business, cause development delays,\nand may impact our reputation. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys’\nfees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties, or redesign our infringing products, which may be impossible on a cost-effective\nbasis or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize our future isotopes, which could harm our\nbusiness significantly. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims asserting that our employees, consultants or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former\nemployers or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nCertain of our employees, consultants or advisors are currently, or were previously, employed at universities or other technology companies. Although we try to ensure\nthat our employees, consultants and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these\nindividuals or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such individual’s current or former employer.\nLitigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual\nproperty rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\n38\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute\nagreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual\nproperty that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be\nforced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nReliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be\nmisappropriated or disclosed.\nIf we rely on third parties to manufacture or commercialize our future isotopes, or if we collaborate with additional third parties for the development of our future\nisotopes, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. We may also conduct joint research and development programs that may require us to share trade secrets under the\nterms of our research and development partnerships or similar agreements. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and,\nif applicable, material transfer agreements, services agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and\nconsultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential\ninformation, including our trade secrets. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential\ninformation increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in\nviolation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor’s discovery of our trade secrets or other\nunauthorized use or disclosure could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, these agreements typically restrict the ability of our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants to publish data potentially relating to our\ntrade secrets. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, our competitors may discover our trade secrets, either through breach of our agreements with third parties,\nindependent development or publication of information by any third-party collaborators. A competitor’s discovery of our trade secrets could harm our business.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and third parties may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we seek to rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not\npatentable or that we elect not to patent, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce, and any other elements of our future isotopes, technology and product discovery and\ndevelopment processes that involve proprietary know-how, information, or technology that is not covered by patents. Any disclosure, either intentional or unintentional, by our\nemployees, the employees of third parties with whom we share our facilities or third-party consultants and vendors that we engage, or misappropriation by third parties (such as\nthrough a cybersecurity breach) of our trade secrets or proprietary information could enable competitors to duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding\nour competitive position in our market. Because we expect to rely on third parties in the development and manufacture of our future isotopes, we must, at times, share trade\nsecrets with them. Our reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets\nwill be misappropriated or disclosed.\nTrade secrets and confidential information, however, may be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our trade secrets, know-how and confidential information, including\nour proprietary processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific advisors, contractors, and collaborators. With\nour consultants, contractors, and outside scientific collaborators, these agreements typically include invention assignment obligations. We cannot guarantee that we have entered\ninto such agreements with each party that may have or has had access to our trade secrets or proprietary technology and processes. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect\nour trade secrets, our employees, consultants, outside scientific advisors, contractors, and collaborators might intentionally or inadvertently disclose our trade secret information\nto competitors. In addition, competitors may otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Despite\nthese efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate\nremedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is\nunpredictable. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third-party, we would have no right to prevent them\nfrom using that technology or information to compete with us. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same\nmanner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and\nabroad. If we are unable to prevent unauthorized material disclosure of our intellectual property to third parties, or misappropriation of our intellectual property by third parties,\nwe may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial\ncondition.\n39\nTable of Contents\nIf we use hazardous and chemical materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages.\nOur research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including chemical materials. We are subject to international\nand local laws and regulations in South Africa governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of radioactive and hazardous materials. Although we believe that\nour procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination\nor injury resulting from radioactive or hazardous materials. As a result of any such contamination or injury, we may incur liability or local, city, state or federal authorities may\ncurtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability\ncould exceed our resources. We do not have any insurance for liabilities arising from radioactive or hazardous materials. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and\nregulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development, and production efforts, which could harm our business,\nprospects, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations, Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nWe are highly dependent on the services of our senior management team, and if we are not able to retain these members of our management team and recruit and retain\nadditional management, clinical and scientific personnel, our business will be harmed.\nWe are highly dependent on our senior management team. The employment agreements we have with these officers do not prevent such persons from terminating their\nemployment with us at any time. The loss of the services of any of these persons could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nIn addition, we will need to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified additional management and scientific personnel. If we are not able to retain our management\nand to attract, on acceptable terms, additional qualified personnel necessary for the continued development of our business, we may not be able to sustain our operations or\ngrow.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical\nand other businesses. Many of the other pharmaceutical companies that we compete against for qualified personnel and consultants have greater financial and other resources,\ndifferent risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of\nthese characteristics may be more appealing to high-quality candidates and consultants than what we have to offer. If we are unable to continue to attract, retain and motivate\nhigh-quality personnel and consultants to accomplish our business objectives, the rate and success at which we can develop future isotopes and our business will be limited, and\nwe may experience constraints on our development objectives.\nOur future performance will also depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate newly hired executive officers into our management team and our ability to\ndevelop an effective working relationship among senior management. Our failure to integrate these individuals and create effective working relationships among them and\nother members of management could result in inefficiencies in the development and commercialization of our future isotopes, harming future regulatory approvals, sales of our\nfuture isotopes and our results of operations. Additionally, we do not currently maintain “key person” life insurance on the lives of our executives or any of our employees.\nWe will need to expand our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employed 76 people on a full-time basis, 69 of whom are located in South Africa. We rely on service providers for certain general\nadministrative, financial, accounting, tax, intellectual property and other legal services, and we will need to expand our organization to hire qualified personnel to perform these\nfunctions internally. Our management may need to divert significant attention and time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the\nexpansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, operational inefficiencies, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced\nproductivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as\nthe development of our future isotopes. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate\nand grow revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance, our ability to commercialize future isotopes,\ndevelop a scalable infrastructure and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.\n40\nTable of Contents\nOur employees, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and\nrequirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, consultants and commercial partners. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional\nfailures to comply with FDA regulations or the regulations applicable in other jurisdictions, provide accurate information to the FDA and other regulatory authorities, report\nfinancial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we\ntake to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from government investigations or other\nactions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending\nourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including the imposition of\nsignificant fines or other sanctions.\nWe and our contractors are highly dependent on the performance of sub-contractors and other third parties.\nWe and our contractors are highly dependent on the performance of sub-contractors and other third parties. If these contractors, sub-contractors and third parties are\nunable to deliver the results that we require, our operating results could be adversely affected and our business could be materially harmed.\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems or data security incidents could result in significant financial, legal, regulatory, business and reputational\nharm to us.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure, including mobile technologies, to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business,\nwe collect, store, process and transmit large amounts of sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, personal information and other\nconfidential information. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of such sensitive information. We have also\noutsourced elements of our operations (including elements of our information technology infrastructure) to third parties, and as a result, we manage a number of third-party\nvendors who may or could have access to our computer networks or our confidential information. In addition, many of those third parties, in turn, subcontract or outsource some\nof their responsibilities to third parties. While all information technology operations are inherently vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional security breaches, incidents, attacks\nand exposures, the accessibility and distributed nature of our information technology systems, and the sensitive information stored on those systems, make such systems\npotentially vulnerable to unintentional or malicious, internal and external attacks on our technology environment. In addition, some of our employees work remotely, which\nmay make us more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Potential vulnerabilities can be exploited from inadvertent or intentional actions of our employees, third-party vendors, business\npartners, or by malicious third parties. Attacks of this nature are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by\nsophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage) and expertise, including organized criminal\ngroups, “hacktivists,” nation states and others. In addition to the extraction of sensitive information, such attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware,\nransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.\nIn addition, the prevalent use of mobile devices increases the risk of data security incidents.\nSignificant disruptions of our, our third-party vendors’ and/or our business partners’ information technology systems or other similar data security incidents could\nadversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss, misappropriation, and/or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, sensitive\ninformation, which could result in financial, legal, regulatory, business and reputational harm to us. In addition, information technology system disruptions, whether from\nattacks on our technology environment or from computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures, could result in a material\ndisruption of our development programs and our business operations. Additionally, theft of our intellectual property or proprietary business information could require\nsubstantial expenditures to remedy. If we or our third-party collaborators, consultants, contractors, suppliers, or service providers were to suffer an attack or breach, for example,\nthat resulted in the unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of personal or health information, we may have to notify consumers, partners, collaborators, government\nauthorities, and the media, and may be subject to investigations, civil penalties, administrative and enforcement actions, and litigation, any of which could harm our business\nand reputation.\n41\nTable of Contents\nThere is no way of knowing with certainty whether we have experienced any data security incidents that have not been discovered. While we have no reason to believe\nthis to be the case, attackers have become very sophisticated in the way they conceal access to systems, and many companies that have been attacked are not aware that they\nhave been attacked. Any event that leads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information, including but not limited to personal information regarding our\npatients or employees, could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with applicable federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law\nequivalents, subject us to time-consuming, distracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the\ncorrectness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of\npersonal information. This could result in increased costs to us, and result in significant legal and financial exposure and/or reputational harm. In addition, any failure or\nperceived failure by us or our vendors or business partners to comply with our privacy, confidentiality or data security-related legal or other obligations to third parties, or any\nfurther security incidents or other inappropriate access events that result in the unauthorized access, release or transfer of sensitive information, which could include personally\nidentifiable information, may result in governmental investigations, enforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation, or public statements against us by advocacy groups or\nothers, and could cause third parties, including clinical sites, regulators or current and potential partners, to lose trust in us or we could be subject to claims by third parties that\nwe have breached our privacy- or confidentiality-related obligations, which could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects. Moreover, data security incidents\nand other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. While we have implemented\nsecurity measures intended to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such measures will successfully prevent service\ninterruptions or security incidents.\nOur international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nOur primary operations are located outside the U.S. (primarily the construction of isotope enrichment plants in South Africa), and we plan to sell our isotopes to\ncustomers outside the U.S. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions. Risks inherent in international operations include the following:\n· fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services we\nprovide in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency;\n· transportation and other shipping costs may increase, or transportation may be inhibited;\n· increased cost or decreased availability of raw materials;\n· changes in foreign laws and tax rates or U.S. laws and tax rates with respect to foreign income may unexpectedly increase the rate at which our income is taxed,\nimpose new and additional taxes on remittances, repatriation or other payments by subsidiaries, or cause the loss of previously recorded tax benefits;\n· foreign countries in which we do business may adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls;\n· trade sanctions by or against these countries could result in our losing access to customers and suppliers in those countries;\n· unexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements may occur;\n· our agreements with counterparties in foreign countries may be difficult for us to enforce and related receivables may be difficult for us to collect;\n· compliance with the variety of foreign laws and regulations may be unduly burdensome;\n· compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws (such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) as well as anti-money- laundering laws may be costly;\n· unexpected adverse changes in export duties, quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses may occur;\n· general economic conditions in the countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations in those countries;\n· our foreign operations may experience staffing difficulties and labor disputes;\n· termination or substantial modification of international trade agreements may adversely affect our access to raw materials and to markets for our products outside\nthe U.S.;\n· foreign governments may nationalize or expropriate private enterprises;\n· increased sovereign risk (such as default by or deterioration in the economies and creditworthiness of local governments) may occur; and\n· political or economic repercussions from terrorist activities, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and political instability, may occur in certain\ncountries in which we do business.\nUnanticipated events, such as geopolitical changes, could result in a write-down of our investment in the affected joint venture or a delay or cause cancellation of those\ncapital projects, which could negatively impact our future growth and profitability. Our success as a global business will depend, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing\nlegal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions by developing, implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and\nour joint ventures do business.\n42\nTable of Contents\nFurthermore, we will be subject to rules and regulations related to anti-bribery and anti-trust prohibitions of the U.S. and other countries, as well as export controls and\neconomic embargoes, violations of which may carry substantial penalties. For example, export control and economic embargo regulations limit the ability of our subsidiaries to\nmarket, sell, distribute or otherwise transfer their products or technology to prohibited countries or persons. Failure to comply with these regulations could subject our\nsubsidiaries to fines, enforcement actions and/or have an adverse effect on our reputation and the value of our Common Stock.\nOur tangible assets may be subject to defects in title.\nWe have investigated our rights to the assets we have purchased and developed, and, to the best of our knowledge, those rights are in good standing. However, no\nassurance can be given that such rights will not be revoked, or significantly altered, to our detriment. There can also be no assurance that our rights will not be challenged or\nimpugned by third parties, including by governments and non-governmental organizations.\nWe are subject to foreign currency risks.\nOur operations are subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Our current operating expenses are primarily transacted in U.S. dollars, while our current revenues and\nsome of our cash balances and expenses are measured in other currencies. As our business expands internationally, the U.S. dollar may or may not be our primary current for\noperating expenses. Any strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the currencies of other countries or vice versa can have a material impact on our cash\nflows and profitability and affect the value of our assets and shareholders’ equity.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe do not know whether an active, liquid and orderly trading market will develop for our Common Stock or what the market price of our Common Stock will be and as a\nresult it may be difficult for you to sell your shares of our Common Stock.\nPrior to our IPO in November of 2022, there was no public market for shares of our Common Stock. Although our Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital\nMarket (Nasdaq), only a limited trading market for our shares has developed, and an active market may never develop or if developed be sustained in the future. You may not\nbe able to sell your shares quickly or at the market price if trading in shares of our Common Stock is not active. Further, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise\ncapital by selling shares of our Common Stock and may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnerships or acquire companies or products by using our shares of Common\nStock as consideration.\nThe price of our stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Common Stock is volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control,\nincluding limited trading volume. In addition to the factors discussed in this “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, these factors include:\n· adverse results or delays in our development activities;\n· adverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval for our future isotopes;\n· changes in laws or regulations applicable to our future isotopes, including but not limited to requirements for approvals;\n· any changes to our relationship with any manufacturers, suppliers, licensors, future collaborators or other strategic partners;\n· our inability to obtain adequate product supply for any future isotope or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n· our inability to establish collaborations if needed;\n· our failure to commercialize our future isotopes;\n· additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n· unanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of our future isotopes;\n· introduction of new products or services offered by us or our competitors;\n· announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n· our ability to effectively manage our growth;\n· actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n· our cash position;\n· our failure to meet the estimates and projections of the investment community or that we may otherwise provide to the public;\n43\nTable of Contents\n· publication of research reports about us or our industry or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n· changes in the market valuations of similar companies;\n· overall performance of the equity markets;\n· issuances of debt or equity securities;\n· sales of our Common Stock by us or our stockholders in the future or the perception that such sales may occur;\n· trading volume of our Common Stock;\n· changes in accounting practices;\n· ineffectiveness of our internal controls;\n· disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n· significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n· general political and economic conditions, including military conflict or the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n· other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been\nunrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our Common Stock,\nregardless of our actual operating performance, and you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment. In the past, securities\nclass action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities. This type of litigation, if\ninstituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which would harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our Common Stock, so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our Common Stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation,\nand expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders would therefore be limited to\nthe appreciation, if any, of their stock.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder\napproval.\nOur executive officers, current directors, greater than 5% holders, and their affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 43.3% of our Common Stock as\nof December 31, 2023. Therefore, these stockholders will have the ability to influence us through this ownership position. These stockholders may be able to determine all\nmatters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval\nof any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our Common Stock that you\nmay feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock by our existing stockholders in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause\nour stock price to fall.\nAs of April 1, 2024, we had a total of 48,923,276 shares of Common Stock outstanding. If our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial\namounts of our Common Stock in the public market, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline.\nOf our outstanding Common Stock, the shares held by directors, executive officers, and other affiliates are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the\nSecurities Act. In addition, 3,254,606 shares of Common Stock that are either subject to outstanding options or reserved for future issuance under our employee benefit plans\nwill become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules, and Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act. If\nthese additional shares of Common Stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline. Any\nsales of securities by our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our Common Stock.\n44\nTable of Contents\nFuture sales and issuances of our Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution\nof the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that we will need significant additional capital in the future to continue our planned operations, including development activities, commercialization efforts if\nwe are able to obtain marketing approval of future isotopes, research and development activities, and costs associated with operating a public company. To raise capital, we may\nsell Common Stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner that we determine from time to time. If we sell\nCommon Stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our\nexisting stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to the holders of our Common Stock.\nPursuant to our 2022 Plan, our management is authorized to grant stock options to our employees, directors and consultants. Additionally, the number of shares of our\nCommon Stock reserved for issuance under our 2022 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 2023 and continuing through and\nincluding January 1, 2032, by 5% of the total number of shares of our capital stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year (determined on an as-converted\nto voting Common Stock basis, without regard to any limitations on the conversion of the non-voting Common Stock), or a lesser number of shares determined by our board of\ndirectors. Such issuances will result in dilution to our stockholders.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of our existing cash and cash equivalents and may not use them effectively.\nOur management has broad discretion in the application of our existing cash and cash equivalents. Because of the number and variability of factors that will determine\nour use of our existing cash and cash equivalents, their ultimate use may vary substantially from their currently intended use. Our management might not apply our existing\ncash and cash equivalents in ways that ultimately increase the value of our Common Stock. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could harm our\nbusiness. We intend to invest our existing cash and cash equivalents that are not used as described above in short- and medium-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing\ninstruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. These investments may not yield a favorable return to our stockholders. If we do\nnot invest or apply our existing cash and cash equivalents in ways that enhance stockholder value, we may fail to achieve expected financial results, which could cause our stock\nprice to decline.\nWe are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company, and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller\nreporting companies may make our Common Stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of\nexemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply\nwith the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and\nproxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute\npayments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company until December 31, 2027, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier,\nincluding if we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act or if we have total annual gross revenue of $1.235 billion or more during\nany fiscal year before that time, in which cases we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31 or, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in\nnon-convertible debt during any three year period before that time, we would cease to be an emerging growth company immediately. Even after we no longer qualify as an\nemerging growth company, we may still qualify as a “smaller reporting company” which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure\nrequirements including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations\nregarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. Investors may find our Common Stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions.\nIf some investors find our Common Stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Common Stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised\naccounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private\ncompanies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards,\nand therefore we will not be subject to the same requirements to adopt new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an\nemerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these\nscaled disclosures for so long as our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second\nfiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-\naffiliates is less than $700.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter.\n45\nTable of Contents\nDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended, could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing\nthe trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions of certificate of incorporation and bylaws as amended may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in our control or change\nin our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem\nto be in their best interests. Therefore, these provisions could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Among other things, our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation and amended and restated bylaws:\n· permit our board of directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate (including the\nright to approve an acquisition or other change in our control);\n· provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors;\n· provide that our board of directors or any individual director may only be removed with cause and the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the\nvoting power of all of our then-outstanding shares of the capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class;\n· provide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of\ndirectors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n· divide our board of directors into three classes;\n· require that any action to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and not be taken by written\nconsent;\n· provide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of\nstockholders must provide notice in writing in a timely manner and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder’s notice;\n· do not provide for cumulative voting rights (therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors\nto elect all of the directors standing for election, if they should so choose);\n· provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chair of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer or by the board of directors\npursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors; and\n· provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under state,\nstatutory and common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any\nof our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General\nCorporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; (iv) any action as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction to the Court\nof Chancery of the State of Delaware; and (v) any action governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases subject to the court’s having personal jurisdiction over\nthe indispensable parties named as defendants; provided these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws\nwill not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction;\nand provided that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United\nStates of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended\n(Securities Act), including all causes of action asserted against any defendant to such complaint. For the avoidance of doubt, this provision is intended to benefit and\nmay be enforced by us, our officers and directors, the underwriters to any offering giving rise to such complaint, and any other professional or entity whose\nprofession gives authority to a statement made by that person or entity and who has prepared or certified any part of the documents underlying the offering.\nThese provisions, with the exception of the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and designate any rights, preferences and privileges\nthereto, would require approval by the holders of at least 66-2/3% of our then-outstanding common stock.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in\nparticular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time. A Delaware corporation may opt out of\nthis provision by express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or by amendment to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws approved by its stockholders.\nHowever, we have not opted out of this provision.\n46\nTable of Contents\nThese and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended, and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential\nacquirors to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including delay or impede a merger, tender offer\nor proxy contest involving our company. The existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of our common stock and limit opportunities for you to realize value\nin a corporate transaction.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain disputes between\nus and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to the court’s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as\ndefendants, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for the\nfollowing types of actions or proceedings:\n· any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n· any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders;\n· any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or bylaws;\n· any action as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and\n· any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates\nconcurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To\nprevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and\nrestated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint\nasserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder\nmay nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the\nvalidity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated\nwith resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors,\nofficers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive forum provision\nin our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with\nresolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could seriously harm our business.\nWe are currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. If we are unable to maintain listing of our securities on Nasdaq or any stock exchange, our stock price could be\nadversely affected and the liquidity of our stock and our ability to obtain financing could be impaired and it may be more difficult for our shareholders to sell their\nsecurities.\nAlthough our Common Stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, we may not be able to continue to meet the exchange’s minimum listing requirements\nor those of any other national exchange. If we are unable to maintain listing on Nasdaq or if a liquid market for our Common Stock does not develop or is sustained, our\nCommon Stock may remain thinly traded.\nThe Listing Rules of Nasdaq require listing issuers to comply with certain standards in order to remain listed on its exchange. If, for any reason, we should fail to\nmaintain compliance with these listing standards and Nasdaq should delist our securities from trading on its exchange and we are unable to obtain listing on another national\nsecurities exchange, a reduction in some or all of the following may occur, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our shareholders:\n· the liquidity of our Common Stock;\n· the market price of our Common Stock;\n· our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations;\n· the number of investors that will consider investing in our Common Stock;\n· the number of market makers in our Common Stock;\n· the availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of our Common Stock; and\n· the number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our Common Stock.\n47\nTable of Contents\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe will incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance\ninitiatives.\nWe became a public company in November of 2022, and as a public company we will incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a\nprivate company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which require, among other things, that we file with the SEC annual, quarterly, and current\nreports with respect to our business and financial condition. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently adopted by the SEC and Nasdaq to implement\nprovisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and\nfinancial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Further, in July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act)\nwas enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and\nregulations in these areas such as “say on pay” and proxy access. Emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies are exempted from certain of these\nrequirements, but we may be required to implement these requirements sooner than budgeted or planned and thereby incur unexpected expenses. Stockholder activism, the\ncurrent political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations,\nwhich may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate.\nWe expect the rules and regulations applicable to public companies to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more\ntime-consuming and costly. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect\non our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The increased costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss, and may require us to reduce costs in\nother areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive\nfor us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. We cannot predict or estimate\nthe amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and\nretain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If our remediation of this material weakness is not effective, or if we experience\nmaterial weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately report\nour financial condition or results of operations which may adversely affect investor confidence in us, and as a result, the value of our Common Stock.\nOur Common Stock was listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange on November 10, 2022. Prior to listing, we were a privately-held company, we were not required to\nevaluate our internal control over financial reporting in a manner that meets the standards of publicly traded companies required by Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,\nor Section 404. As a public company, we are subject to significant requirements for enhanced financial reporting and internal controls. The process of designing and\nimplementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments\nand to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. In addition, we are\nrequired, pursuant to Section 404, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the annual\nreport. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a\ndeficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s\nannual and interim financial statements will not be detected or prevented on a timely basis.\nThe rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant\ndocumentation, testing, and possible remediation. Testing and maintaining internal controls may divert management’s attention from other matters that are important to our\nbusiness. Once we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” or a “smaller reporting company”, our auditors will be required to issue an attestation report on the\neffectiveness of our internal controls on an annual basis.\n48\nTable of Contents\nIn the course of preparing the financial statements that are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management has determined that a material weakness exists\nwithin the internal controls over financial reporting. The material weakness identified relates to the lack of formal control documentation and consistent execution of control\nprocedures, and the lack of a sufficient complement of personnel within the finance and accounting function with an appropriate degree of knowledge, experience and training.\nWe also noted a material weakness related to logical security and privileged access in the area of information technology. We concluded that the material weaknesses in our\ninternal control over financial reporting information technology occurred because, prior to our IPO, we were a private company and did not have the necessary business\nprocesses, systems, personnel, and related internal controls necessary to satisfy the accounting and financial reporting requirements of a public company.\nIn order to remediate the material weaknesses, we expect to enhance our formal documentation over internal control procedures and management controls infrastructure\nto allow for more consistent execution of control procedures and hire additional accounting, finance and information technology resources or consultants with public company\nexperience.\nWe may not be able to fully remediate the identified material weakness until the steps described above have been completed and our internal controls have been\noperating effectively for a sufficient period of time. We believe we have already and will continue to make progress in our remediation plan but cannot assure you that we will\nbe able to fully remediate the material weakness by such time. If the steps we take do not correct the material weakness in a timely manner, we will be unable to conclude that\nwe maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, there could continue to be a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial\nstatements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We also may incur significant costs to execute various aspects of our remediation plan but cannot provide a\nreasonable estimate of such costs at this time.\nIn accordance with the provisions of the JOBS Act, we and our independent registered public accounting firm were not required to, and did not, perform an evaluation\nof our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 nor any period subsequent in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Accordingly,\nwe cannot assure you that we have identified all material weaknesses. Material weaknesses may still exist when we report on the effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nIn the future, it is possible that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may be identified that we may be unable to remedy before the requisite\ndeadline for these reports. Our ability to comply with the annual internal control reporting requirements will depend on the effectiveness of our financial reporting and data\nsystems and controls across our company. Any weaknesses or deficiencies or any failure to implement new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the\nimplementation or operation of these controls, could harm our operating results and cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, or result in material\nmisstatements in our consolidated financial statements, which could adversely affect our business and reduce our stock price.\nIf we are unable to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404, our independent\nregistered public accounting firm may not issue an unqualified opinion. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, investors\ncould lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our Common Stock. Failure to remedy any\nmaterial weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict\nour future access to the capital markets.\nWe could be subject to securities class action litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially\nrelevant for us because biopharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial\ncosts and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could harm our business.\nOur failure to meet Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements could result in a delisting of our Common Stock.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq\nmay take steps to delist our Common Stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock and would impair your ability to sell or\npurchase our Common Stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we can provide no assurance that any action taken by us to restore compliance with listing\nrequirements would allow our Common Stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our Common Stock, prevent our Common Stock\nfrom dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with the listing requirements of Nasdaq.\n49\nTable of Contents\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could\ndecline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Securities\nand industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on our company. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading\nprice for our stock would likely be negatively impacted. In the event securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades\nour stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price may decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or\nfails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nDue to the size of our company, we have not yet developed robust policies and processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risk from cybersecurity threats. We\nhave implemented access controls with respect to our systems, which we monitor regularly and audit annually. Our most sensitive data is stored in offline air-gapped devices.\nWe currently rely heavily on products and services provided by third-party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including without limitation, cloud-based\ninfrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, email, and other functions. We rely on third party providers and outsourced IT services to monitor and address\ncybersecurity related risks, including installing software for threat protection and malware. Such third party providers are tasked with notifying management of any material\nrisks or cybersecurity concerns that they identify, which management then assesses and may bring to our board of directors to discuss if deemed necessary or appropriate.\nBased on the results of our risk assessments, if deemed necessary or appropriate, we take steps to re-design, implement, and maintain reasonable safeguards to minimize\nidentified risks; reasonably address any identified gaps in existing safeguards; and regularly monitor the effectiveness of our safeguards.\nWe intend to work with outside counsel and third party service providers in the near term to further develop our expertise, processes and procedures with respect to\ncybersecurity protection and our response plan.\nTo date, we have not (to our knowledge) encountered cybersecurity challenges that have materially impaired our operations or financial standing. For additional information\nregarding risks from cybersecurity threats, please refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in this Report.\nGovernance\nOur management team is primarily responsible for assessing and managing our strategic risk exposures, including material risks from cybersecurity threats, with assistance\nfrom third-party service providers. Management oversees our cybersecurity process on a day-to-day basis, including those described under the heading “Cybersecurity Risk\nManagement and Strategy” above.\nOur audit committee is tasked with general oversight of our risk management process, including risks from cybersecurity threats. Members of management provide periodic\nbriefings to the audit committee of our board of directors regarding our cybersecurity risks and activities, including any recent cybersecurity incidents and related responses,\ncybersecurity systems testing, activities of third parties, and the like. In furtherance thereof, the committee is responsible for monitoring and assessing strategic risk exposure.\nOur audit committee provides regular updates to the board of directors on such reports.\nItem 2.

Legal Proceedings\nWe are not party to any material legal matters or claims. In the future, we may become party to legal matters and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We\ncannot predict the outcome of any such legal matters or claims, and despite the potential outcomes, the existence thereof may have an adverse impact on us because of defense\nand settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\n51\nTable of Contents\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information and Holders of Record\nOur common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “ASPI” since November 10, 2022.\nAs of April 8, 2024, we had 30 record holders of record of our common stock. The actual number of shareholders is greater than this number of record holders and\nincludes shareholders who are beneficial owners but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees. The number of holders of record also does not include\nshareholders whose shares may be held in trust by other entities.\nDividends\nWe have never declared or paid a cash dividend on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the\nforeseeable future. Any future determinations to pay cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on a\nnumber of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, general business conditions, and any other factors that\nour board may deem relevant.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nInformation regarding the Securities Authorized for Issuance under our Equity Compensation Plans will be included in an amendment to this Annual Report in Form\n10-K or incorporated by reference from our definitive proxy statement to be filed pursuant to Rule 14A.\nStock Performance Graph\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information requested by this item pursuant to Item 201 of Regulation S-K.\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nUnregistered sales of equity securities\nNone.\nUse of proceeds from registered securities\nOn November 15, 2022, we completed our IPO, in which we issued and sold 1,250,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share at a price to the public of\n$4.00 per share. The offer and sale of the shares in the IPO was registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-267392),\nwhich was filed with the SEC on September 12, 2022 and amended subsequently and declared effective on November 9, 2022. The underwriter of the offering Revere\nSecurities, LLC. The Form S-1 registered 2,057,500 shares of common stock held by selling stockholders. We did not receive proceeds from the sale of the shares by the selling\nstockholders.\nWe raised approximately $3.8 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of $1.2 million. No offering\nexpenses were paid directly or indirectly to any of our directors of officers (or their associates) or persons owning ten percent or more of any class of our equity securities or to\nany other affiliates.\nThrough December 31, 2023, we have used all of the net proceeds from our IPO for matters described in our final IPO prospectus filed with the SEC on November 14,\n2022, or our IPO prospectus. There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our IPO, as described in our IPO prospectus.\nRepurchases of equity securities by the issuer\nNone.\n52\nTable of Contents\nItem 6. [Reserved]\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to enhance the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with Part\nI, Item I, “Business” and Item 8, ‘Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” For information on risks and uncertainties related to our business that may make past\nperformance not indicative of future results or cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, see “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements,” and Part I, Item 1A, ‘Risk Factors.”\nOverview\nWe are a development stage advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes that, if successful, will allow for the enrichment of\nnatural isotopes into higher concentration products, which could be used in several industries. Our proprietary technology, the Aerodynamic Separation Process (“ASP\ntechnology”), originally developed by Klydon Proprietary Ltd (“Klydon”), is designed to enable the production of isotopes used in several industries. Our initial focus is on the\nproduction and commercialization of enriched Carbon-14 (“C-14”), Molybdenum-100 (“Mo-100”) and Silicon-28 (“Si-28”). We have commissioned an isotope enrichment\nplant for the enrichment of C-14 located in Pretoria, South Africa, which will be ready for production upon the final installation of essential components. We anticipate\ncompletion and commissioning of a multi-isotope enrichment plant in Pretoria, South Africa in mid-2024. In addition, we have started planning additional isotope enrichment\nplants. We believe the C-14 we may produce using the ASP technology could be used in the development of new pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. We believe the Mo-100\nwe may produce using the ASP technology could have significant potential advantages for use in the preparation of nuclear imaging agents by radiopharmacies and others in the\nmedical industry. We believe the Si-28 we may produce using the ASP technology may be used to create advanced semiconductors and in quantum computing. In addition, we\nare considering the future development of the ASP technology for the separation of Zinc-68, Xenon-129/136 for potential use in the healthcare end market, Germanium\n70/72/74 for possible use in the semiconductor end market, and Chlorine -37 for potential use in the nuclear energy end market.\nWe are also developing Quantum Enrichment technology to produce enriched Ytterbium-176, Nickel-64, Lithium 6, Lithium7 and Uranium-235 (“U-235”). Quantum\nenrichment is an advanced isotope enrichment technique that is currently in development that uses lasers. We believe that the U-235 we may produce using quantum\nenrichment technology may be commercialized as a nuclear fuel component for use in the new generation of HALEU- fueled small modular reactors that are now under\ndevelopment for commercial and government uses.\nOn November 15, 2022, we completed an IPO of our common stock and issued and sold 1,250,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $4.00 per\nshare, resulting in net proceeds of $3.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\nIn March 2023, we issued 3,164,557 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $1.58 per share and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,164,557\nshares of our common stock with an exercise price of $1.75 per share for gross proceeds of $5.0 million. We incurred $506,390 in cash issuance costs and issued warrants to\npurchase up to an aggregate of 221,519 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $1.975 per share to the placement agent with an initial fair value of $179,116.\nIn October 2023, the Company entered into Securities Purchase Agreements with certain institutional and other accredited investors and certain directors of the\nCompany to issue and sell an aggregate of 9,952,510 shares of the Company’s common stock, for aggregate cash consideration of $9,129,461, as follows: (i) 8,459,093 shares\nto investors at a purchase price per share of $0.9105, (ii) 1,190,239 shares to investors at a purchase price per share of $0.9548, and (iii) 303,178 shares to directors at a\npurchase price per share of $0.96. The Company incurred issuance costs equivalent to 5% of the gross proceeds from new investors which was settled in stock through the\nissuance of 472,582 shares to the placement agent and additional cash issuance costs totaling $57,083.\nAcquisition of 51% of PET Labs Pharmaceuticals\nIn October 2023, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Nucleonics Imaging Proprietary Limited, a company incorporated in South Africa, to\npurchase 51% of the ordinary shares in Nucleonics’ wholly-owned subsidiary, Pet Labs Pharmaceuticals Proprietary Limited, a company incorporated in South Africa and\ndedicated to nuclear medicine and the science of radiopharmaceutical production.\n53\nTable of Contents\nPer the Share Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to pay a total of $2,000,000 for the shares in two installments. The first installment of $500,000 was paid\nin November 2023. The remaining balance of $1,500,000 is due upon demand any time after October 31, 2024 and is expected to be paid in November 2024.\nIn March 2024, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary Quantum Leap Energy received gross proceeds of $20,550,000 through the issuance of Convertible\nPromissory Notes with a stated interest rate of 6% for the first year and 8% thereafter. The maturity date of the Convertible Promissory Notes is March 7, 2029. The\nConvertible Promissory Notes automatically convert into common shares upon Quantum Leap Energy’s closing of an IPO or other qualifying public transaction at 80% of the\nshare price taking into consideration a valuation cap.\nIn April 2024, the Company received approximately $5.5 million from the issuance of 3,164,557 shares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants.\nAcquisition of Assets and Agreements with Klydon\nTo date, we have purchased certain assets of Molybdos Proprietary Limited, a South Africa company (Molybdos), and entered into a number of agreements with\nKlydon (Pty) Limited, a South Africa company (Klydon). Below is a summary of the key terms for our former licenses and other agreements with Klydon.\nAcquisition of Molybdos Assets. On September 30, 2021, our subsidiary, ASP Isotopes South Africa (Proprietary) Limited (“ASP South Africa”), participated in and\nwas declared the winner of a competitive auction process under Section 45 of the South Africa Consumer Protection Act, 2008 related to the sale and assignment of the assets of\nMolybdos (the “Molybdos Business Rescue Auction”). On October 12, 2021, ASP South Africa acquired the assets of Molybdos for ZAR 11,000,000 (which at the then current\nexchange rate was approximately $734,000), plus value added tax (VAT) levied by the government of South Africa at the rate of 15% and auctioneers’ commission at the rate\nof 10%.\nAcquisition of Silicon-28 Plant Assets.

The limit of cover is equal to or in excess of the projected amount of investment required to complete the initial stage of\nthe first planned Molybdenum enrichment plant. The limit of cover is capable of being increased and extended by mutual agreement with the insurer.\n55\nTable of Contents\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nEffective with the acquisition of 51% of PET Labs Pharmaceuticals, the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold associated with the sale of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning consist of labor, delivery and materials.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of (i) research and development expenses and (ii) selling, general and administrative expenses.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of direct and indirect costs incurred in connection with the development activities for our future isotopes.\nDirect costs include:\n· external research and development expenses; and\n· costs related to designing the development processes of isotope production.\nIndirect costs include:\n· personnel-related costs, which include salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and other employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for\npersonnel engaged in research and development functions; and\n· facilities and other various expenses.\nResearch and development expenses are recognized as incurred and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are\ncapitalized until the goods or services are received.\nAs described above, Klydon charged us for expenses associated with these research and development functions under the Turnkey Contract. We expect that our\nresearch and development expenses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our future isotopes. We cannot determine with\ncertainty the timing of initiation, the duration or the completion costs of development activities. Actual development timelines, the probability of success and development costs\ncan differ materially from expectations.\nWe will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future. In addition, we cannot forecast which future isotopes may be subject to future collaborations, when\nsuch arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements.\nOur research and development expenses may vary significantly based on a variety of factors, such as:\n· the scope, rate of progress, expense and results of our development activities;\n· the phase of development of our future isotopes;\n· the timing, receipt, and terms of any approvals from applicable regulatory authorities including the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities;\n· significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance;\n· the cost and timing of designing the development processes of isotope production;\n· the extent to which we establish additional strategic collaborations or other arrangements; and\n· the impact of any business interruptions to our operations or to those of the third parties with whom we work.\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our future isotopes could significantly change the costs and timing\nassociated with the development of that future isotope.\n56\nTable of Contents\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, which include salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and other employee-\nrelated costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, sales, finance and other administrative functions. Other significant costs include legal fees\nrelating to corporate matters, professional fees for accounting and consulting services and facility-related costs.\nWe expect that our ongoing selling, general and administrative expenses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future to support our increased research and\ndevelopment activities and increased costs of operating as a public company and in building our internal resources. These increased costs will include increased expenses related\nto audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance premiums\nand investor and public relations costs associated with operating as a public company.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended Year Ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nRevenue $ 433,026 $ -\nCost of goods sold 294,056 -\nGross margin 138,970 -\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development 764,581 1,273,536\nSelling, general and administrative 15,416,388 3,825,512\nTotal operating expenses 16,180,969 5,099,048\nOther (expense) income:\nForeign exchange transaction gain 45,753 -\nChange in fair value of share liability (194,540) 150,527\nInterest expense (118,547) -\nInterest income 9,074 3,382\nTotal other (expense) income (258,260) 153,909\nLoss before income tax expense $ (16,300,259) $ (4,945,139)\nRevenue and Cost of Goods Sold\nEffective with the acquisition of 51% of PET Labs Pharmaceuticals, the Company has recognized revenue from the sale of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning for\nthe two month period since the acquisition was effective on October 31, 2023 and December 31, 2023. In addition, the Company has recognized the related cost of goods sold,\noperating expenses and other income and expenses for the same period.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended Year Ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nDirect costs:\nMo-100 $ - $ 6,645\nIndirect costs:\nPersonnel-related costs 495,034 429,270\nLicense fees - 495,503\nConsulting, facility and other expenses 269,547 342,118\nTotal research and development expenses $ 764,581 $ 1,273,536\n57\nTable of Contents\nResearch and development expenses were $764,581 for the year ended December 31, 2023. These expenses include $495,034 of personnel-related costs, including\n$364,924 in stock-based compensation, and $269,547 in consulting, facility and other expenses.\nResearch and development expenses were $1,273,536 for the year ended December 31, 2022. These expenses include $6,645 in consulting expenses related to\nadvancing development activities for Mo-100, $429,270 of personnel-related costs, including $201,270 in stock-based compensation, $495,503 in license fees and $342,118 in\nconsulting, facility and other expenses.\nThe increase in stock-based compensation is due to a full year of expense in 2023 versus a partial year in 2022 since a majority of the awards were made in the second\nhalf of 2022. The decrease in consulting, facility and other expenses is mainly due to lower consulting costs in 2023 as the Company focused its activities in 2023 on\ncompleting the construction of the plant.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $15,416,388 for the year ended December 31, 2023. These expenses include $10,422,994 of personnel-related costs,\nincluding $8,378,875 in stock-based compensation, $2,747,486 of professional services and legal related fees and $2,245,909 in facility and other corporate expenses.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $3,825,512 for the year ended December 31, 2022. These expenses include $560,789 of personnel-related costs,\n$1,798,043 in stock-based compensation, $1,010,187 of professional services and legal related fees and $456,493 in facility and other corporate expenses.\nThe increase in stock-based compensation is due to a full year of expense in 2023 versus a partial year in 2022 since a majority of the awards were made in the second\nhalf of 2022. The increase in professional services and legal related fees and in facility and other expenses is mainly due to increased costs related to being a public entity and\nthe expansion of our operations in 2023.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $258,260, which includes a $194,540 change in the fair value of the share liability related to the shares\nissuable to a placement agent and other consultants and interest expense of $118,547.\nOther income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $153,909, which includes a $150,527 change in the fair value of the share liability related to the shares\nissuable to a placement agent.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nWe have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing net losses for the\nforeseeable future. We have principally financed our operations to date through the issuance of our common stock, including our IPO. On March 7, 2024, the Company’s\nwholly owned subsidiary Quantum Leap Energy received gross proceeds of $20,550,000 through the issuance of Convertible Promissory Notes with a stated interest rate of 6%\nfor the first year and 8% thereafter. The maturity date of the Convertible Promissory Notes is March 7, 2029. The Convertible Promissory Notes automatically convert into\ncommon shares upon Quantum Leap Energy’s closing of an IPO or other qualified public transaction at 80% of the share price taking into consideration a valuation cap. On\nApril 9, 2024, the Company received approximately $5,500,000 from the issuance of 3,164,557 shares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash of $7.9 million. We do not have any isotopes approved for sale, we have not generated any revenue from the sale of isotopes,\nand our ability to generate product revenue from the sale of isotopes sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual\ncommercialization of one or more of our current or future isotopes.\nEffective with the acquisition of 51% of PET Labs Pharmaceuticals on October 31, 2023, we have begun to recognize revenue from the sale of nuclear medical doses\nfor PET scanning in South Africa. Our ability to generate product revenue from the sale of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning sufficient to achieve profitability will depend\non the successful expansion of production capabilities and commercialization of the results of that expansion.\n58\nTable of Contents\nFuture Funding Requirements\nBased on our current operating plan, we estimate that our existing cash, will not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements\nthrough at least the next 12 months from the date the financial statements are issued. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be\nadequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on\nassumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of developing isotopes is costly, and the\ntiming of progress and expenses in these development activities is uncertain.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n· the type, number, scope, progress, expansions, results, costs and timing of, our development activities for our future isotopes;\n· the outcome, timing and costs of regulatory review of our future isotopes;\n· the costs and timing of manufacturing for our future isotopes;\n· our efforts to enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel to satisfy our obligations as a public company, including enhanced internal controls over\nfinancial reporting;\n· the costs associated with hiring additional personnel and consultants as our preclinical and clinical activities increase;\n· the costs and timing of establishing or securing sales and marketing and distribution capabilities, whether alone or with third parties, to commercialize future\nisotopes for which we may obtain regulatory approval, if any;\n· our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share and revenue for any\napproved products;\n· the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements;\n· the costs of obtaining, expanding, maintaining and enforcing our patent and other intellectual property rights; and\n· costs associated with any products or technologies that we may in-license or acquire.\nDeveloping isotopes is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never achieve the necessary results required or\nobtain applicable regulatory approval for any isotopes or generate revenue from the sale of any future isotopes (assuming applicable regulatory approval is received). In\naddition, our future isotopes (assuming applicable regulatory approval is received) may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from\nsales of isotopes that we do not expect to be commercially available in substantial quantities until at least 2024. If we receive permits and licenses to enrich U-235 (which in\nitself is highly uncertain), we do not expect U-235 to be commercially available for at least several years, if ever. As a result, we may need substantial additional financing to\nsupport our continuing operations and further the development of and commercialization of our future isotopes.\nExpansion of the production and distribution of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that may take years to\ncomplete. As a result, we may need substantial additional financing to support our continuing operations and further the development of and commercialization of future\nnuclear medical doses for PET scanning.\nUntil such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our future isotopes or nuclear medical doses for PET scanning, if ever, we expect to finance our\ncash needs through public or private equity or debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. However, we\nmay be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely\nimpacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide\nresulting severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, increased interest rates, inflationary pressures, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth,\nincreases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. The financial markets and the global economy may also be adversely affected by the current or\nanticipated impact of military conflict. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our\nstockholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common\nstockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as\nincurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may\nhave to relinquish valuable rights to our future isotopes, future revenue streams or research programs or may have to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us\nand/or may reduce the value of our common stock. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit,\nreduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our future isotopes even if we would otherwise prefer to\ndevelop and market such isotopes ourselves.\n59\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:\nYear Ended Year Ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ (5,412,392) $ (2,939,893)\nInvesting activities (2,453,191) (4,473,164)\nFinancing activities 13,385,491 6,641,052\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 5,519,908 $ (772,005)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $5,412,392 for the year ended December 31, 2023 and was primarily due to our net loss of $16,294,126, adjusted for stock-\nbased compensation expense of $8,743,799, amortization of right-of-use asset of $104,528, issuance of common stock to a consultant with a fair value of $669,700, change in\nfair value of share liability of $194,540, and a $1,176,383 change in our operating assets and liabilities.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $2,939,893 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and was primarily due to our net loss of $4,945,139, adjusted for stock-\nbased compensation expense of $1,999,313, amortization of right-of-use asset of $72,570, issuance of common stock to a consultant with a fair value of $50,000 and change in\nfair value of share liability of $150,527, partially offset by a $33,890 change in our operating assets and liabilities.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2,453,191 for the year ended December 31, 2023 and was comprised of the purchase of machinery and equipment and\nconstruction in progress totaling $2,331,343 and $121,848 for the acquisition of PET Labs net of cash acquired.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $4,473,164 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and was comprised of construction in progress.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $13,385,491 for the year ended December 31, 2023 and was comprised primarily of net proceeds of $13,566,022 from the\nsale and issuance of 13,117,067 shares of our common stock.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $6,641,052 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and was comprised primarily of net proceeds of $3,790,504 from the\nsale and issuance of 1,250,000 shares of our common stock in our IPO, net proceeds of $2,863,595 from the sale and issuance of 1,559,780 shares of our common stock prior to\nour IPO and the repayment of notes payable of $13,046.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe lease our main facility in Pretoria, South Africa under a lease with a base monthly rent payment of approximately $8,000 with a term expiring on December 31,\n2030. We also lease additional space on a short term basis in Pretoria, South Africa under a lease with a base monthly rent payment of approximately $12,000 with an initial\nterm that expired on March 31, 2024 and the Company is continuing to occupy that space under the monthly extensions. We also lease additional space in Pretoria, South Africa\nunder a lease with a base monthly rent payment of approximately $2,000 with a term expiring on October 30, 2026.\nPET Labs Pharmaceuticals operates in a facility in Pretoria, South Africa is under a lease with a base monthly rent payment of approximately $28,000 with a term\nexpiring on March 30. 2026 with automatic monthly extension afterwards. PET Labs Pharmaceuticals also rents space at a local hospital in Pretoria, South Africa for which\nthere was a lease with a base monthly rent payment of approximately $5,000 which expired on December 31, 2023 and is currently in automatic monthly extensions.\nIn addition, we enter into contracts in the normal course of business with vendors for services and products for operating purposes. These contracts do not contain any\nminimum purchase commitments and generally provide for termination after a notice period and, therefore, are not considered long-term contractual obligations. Payments due\nupon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided and expenses incurred up to the date of cancellation.\n60\nTable of Contents\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements which discusses new accounting pronouncements.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our cash consists of cash in readily available checking accounts. We do not hold any short-term investments. As a result, the fair\nvalue of our portfolio is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had no bank debt outstanding and are therefore not exposed to\ninterest rate risk with respect to debt. We believe a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates during the period presented would not have had a material\nimpact on our financial results.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nOur expenses are generally denominated in U.S. dollars but our operations are currently primarily located outside the United States and we have entered into a number\nof contracts with vendors that are denominated in foreign currencies. We are subject to foreign currency transaction gains or losses on our contracts denominated in foreign\ncurrencies. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not been material to our financial statements, and we have not had a formal hedging program with\nrespect to foreign currency. We believe a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in exchange rates during the period presented would not have had a material impact\non our financial results.\nEffects of Inflation\nInflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and research and development costs. We do not believe that inflation and changing prices had a significant\nimpact on our results of operations for the period presented herein.\n61\nTable of Contents\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nASP Isotopes Inc.\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID 274) 63\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 64\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 65\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 66\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 67\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements 68\n62\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nASP Isotopes Inc\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ASP Isotopes Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the\nrelated consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes\n(collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the\nCompany as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial\nstatements, the Company has incurred recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a\ngoing concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the\noutcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance\nabout whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,\nan audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for\nthe purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our\naudits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ EisnerAmper LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2022.\nEISNERAMPER LLP\nIselin, New Jersey\nApril 10,

Organization\nDescription of Business\nASP Isotopes Inc. was incorporated in the state of Delaware on September 13, 2021 and has its principal operations in Washington, DC. ASP Isotopes Inc.’s subsidiary,\nASP Isotopes Holdings Limited (“ASP Guernsey”), has its principal operations in Guernsey. ASP Guernsey’s subsidiary, ASP Isotopes Holdings South Africa Proprietary\nLimited (“ASP South Africa”), has its principal operations in South Africa. ASP Isotopes UK Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was incorporated in July 2022.\nEnriched Energy, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was incorporated in January 2022. ASP Rentals Proprietary Limited (“ASP Rentals”) a variable interest\nentity (“VIE”) of ASP South Africa, has its principal operations in South Africa. ASP Isotopes Inc., its subsidiaries and ASP Rentals are collectively referred to as “the\nCompany” throughout these consolidated statements.\nThe Company is a development stage advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes that, if successful, will allow for the\nenrichment of natural isotopes into higher concentration products, which could be used in several industries. The Company has an exclusive license to use proprietary\ntechnology, the Aerodynamic Separation Process (“ASP technology”), originally developed and licensed to the Company by Klydon Proprietary Ltd (“Klydon”), for the\nproduction, distribution, marketing and sale of all isotopes. The Company’s initial focus is on the production and commercialization of enriched Carbon-14 (“C-14”),\nMolybdenum-100 (“Mo-100”) and Silicon-28 (“Si-28”). Klydon has agreed to provide the Company a first commercial-scale isotope enrichment plant located in South Africa.\nThe Company believes the C-14 it may develop using the ASP technology may be used in the development of new pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. The Company believes\nthat the Mo-100 it may develop using the ASP technology has significant potential advantages for use in the preparation of nuclear imaging agents by radiopharmacies and\nothers in the medical industry. The Company believes the Si-28 it may develop using the ASP technology may be used to develop advanced semiconductors and in quantum\ncomputing.\nThe Company also intends to use the ASP technology to produce enriched Uranium-235 (“U-235”). The Company believes that the U-235 it may develop using the\nASP technology may be commercialized as a nuclear fuel component for use in the new generation of HALEU-fueled small modular reactors that are now under development\nfor commercial and government uses. In addition, the Company is considering future development of the ASP technology for the separation of Zinc-68, Ytterbium-176, Zinc-67,\nNickel-64 and Xenon-136 for potential use in the healthcare target end market, and Chlorine -37 and Lithium-6 for potential use in the nuclear energy target end market.\nIn November 2022, the Company completed its IPO, selling an aggregate of 1,250,000 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $4.00 per share. The\nCompany received net proceeds from the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting offering costs, of approximately $3.8 million.\nLiquidity and Going Concern Uncertainty\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis which assumes the Company is a going concern and do not include any adjustments\nto reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from any uncertainty related\nto the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Such adjustments could be material. The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operating\nactivities since its inception. The Company incurred net losses of $16,294,126 and $4,945,139 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company\nanticipates it will need to continue to raise capital through additional equity and/or debt financings and/or collaborative development agreements to fund its operations.\nThe Company currently expects that its cash of $7,908,181 as of December 31, 2023, along with gross proceeds of $20,550,000 received in March 2024 through the\nissuance of convertible promissory notes and gross proceeds of approximately $5,500,000 received in April 2024 through the issuance of common stock from the exercise of\nwarrants (see Note 16), will not be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital requirements for more than 12 months from the date the financial statements are issued.\nThese conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Additional funding will be necessary to complete construction of the first\nenrichment facility and begin operations, and although the Company has plans to seek additional funding, these plans are not currently probable.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will achieve or sustain positive cash flows from operations or profitability. The Company is in the process of seeking\nadditional debt and equity financing. However, such funding may not be available on a timely basis on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. If the Company is unable to\nraise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, the Company may be required to further scale back or discontinue the advancement of product candidates, further\nreduce headcount, reorganize, merge with another entity, or cease operations.\n68\nTable of Contents\nASP Isotopes Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Use of Estimates\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The\npreparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities\nand expenses and disclosure in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The most significant estimates in the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements relate to stock based compensation and the accounting for the acquisition. Although these estimates are based on the Company’s knowledge of current\nevents and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may materially differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ASP Isotopes Inc., its subsidiaries and, beginning in 2023, the 80% owned Enlightened\nIsotopes, the 51% owned PET Labs Pharmaceuticals (see Note 11) and the 24% owned ASP Rentals (see Note 11). All intercompany balances and transactions have been\neliminated in consolidation. For the year ended December 2023, there was no corporate activity for Enlightened Isotopes other than its formation and therefore there was no\nnon-controlling interest to report on the consolidated balance sheet and no net loss attributable to non-controlling interest on the consolidated statement of operations and\ncomprehensive loss to report. See Note 10.\nCurrency and Currency Translation\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the Company’s reporting currency. The functional currency of ASP Isotopes Inc. and ASP\nGuernsey is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the Company’s subsidiary ASP South Africa and PET Labs Pharmaceuticals is the South African Rand. Adjustments\nthat arise from exchange rate changes on transactions of each group entity denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in other income and\nexpense in the consolidated statements of operations. Assets and liabilities of ASP South Africa and PET Labs Pharmaceuticals are recorded in their South African Rand\nfunctional currency and translated into the U.S. dollar reporting currency of the Company at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue, when recorded, and expenses\nof ASP South Africa and PET Labs Pharmaceuticals are recorded in their South African Rand functional currency and translated into the U.S. dollar reporting currency of the\nCompany at the average exchange rate prevailing during the reporting period. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded to other comprehensive income (loss).\nConcentration of Credit Risk and other Risks\nCash balances are maintained at U.S. financial institutions and may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limit of $250,000 per\ndepositor, per insured bank for each account ownership category. Although the Company currently believes that the financial institutions with whom it does business, will be\nable to fulfill their commitments to the Company, there is no assurance that those institutions will be able to continue to do so. The Company has not experienced any credit\nlosses associated with its balances in such accounts for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nOur foreign subsidiaries held cash of approximately $1,963,000 and $38,000 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which is included in cash on the\nconsolidated balance sheets. Our strategic plan does not require the repatriation of foreign cash in order to fund our operations in the U.S., and it is our current intention to\nindefinitely reinvest our foreign cash outside of the U.S. If we were to repatriate foreign cash to the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes in accordance with\napplicable U.S. tax rules and regulations as a result of the repatriation.\nCash\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash\nequivalents are stated at fair value and may include money market funds, U.S. Treasury and U.S. government-sponsored agency securities, corporate debt, commercial paper\nand certificates of deposit. The Company had no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n69\nTable of Contents\nASP Isotopes Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nSegment Information\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company manages its operations as a single segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions,\nspecialist isotopes and related services. The financial information is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources.\nThe Company’s CODM is its chief executive officer.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nAccounting guidance defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category\nmeasured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions\nthat market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the accounting guidance establishes a three-tier fair value\nhierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\nLevel 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThere was no share liability as of December 31, 2023. The Company’s share liability (Note 12) measured at Level 3 fair value on a recurring basis was 1$40,455 as of\nDecember 31, 2022. There was a transfer of the share liability from Level 3 to Level 1 as a result of our IPO in the year ended December 31, 2022. The following table\nprovides a reconciliation of the Company’s liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 1):\nShare\nLiability\nBalance as of December 31, 2021 $ 116,200\nAdditional liability for issuance of common stock 174,782\nFair value adjustment (150,527)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 140,455\nAdditional liability for issuance of common stock 669,700\nSettlement of share liability with issuance of common stock (1,004,695)\nFair value adjustment 194,540\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ -\nThe carrying amounts of accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes payable are considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the short-\nterm nature of those instruments.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company’s revenue relates to PET Labs Pharmaceuticals, in which the Company acquired 51% ownership on October 31, 2023 (Note 11). The Company\nrecognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). The Company enters into transactions with radiopharmacy\ncompanies that are within the scope of ASC 606. The terms of these transactions include payment for delivery of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning in South Africa.\n70\nTable of Contents\nASP Isotopes Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nUnder ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the\nentity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the\nscope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the\npromised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including\nthe constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies\neach performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect consideration it is entitled to in exchange\nfor the goods or services it transfers to the customer.\nThe Company’s evaluates a transaction’s performance obligations to determine if promised goods or services in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the\ncustomer and are considered distinct when (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources and (ii) the\npromised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. In assessing whether promised goods or services are distinct, the Company considers\nwhether the goods or services are integral or dependent to other goods or services in the contract.\nThe Company determines the transaction price based on the agreed government rates for the promised goods in the contract.\nThe consideration is recognized as revenue when control is transferred for the related goods.\nThe Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The\nCompany receives payments from its customers based on billing schedules established in each contract. Upfront payments and fees are recorded as deferred revenue upon\nreceipt or when due until the Company performs its obligations under these arrangements. Amounts are recorded as accounts receivable when the Company’s right to\nconsideration is unconditional.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. An allowance for expected credit losses is estimated for those\naccounts receivable considered to be uncollectible based upon historical experience and management's evaluation of outstanding accounts receivable. We maintain an\nallowance for expected credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable, and changes in such are classified as selling, general and\nadministrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis\nwhere similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In determining the amount of the\nallowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status and make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit\nevaluations. We also consider customer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Bad debts are\nwritten off against the allowance when identified. At December 31, 2023 and 2022 there was no allowance for expected credit losses.\n71\nTable of Contents\nASP Isotopes Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment include costs of assets constructed, purchased or leased under a finance lease, related delivery and installation costs and interest incurred on\nsignificant capital projects during their construction periods. Expenditures for renewals and betterments also are capitalized, but expenditures for normal repairs and\nmaintenance are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with yearly planned major maintenance are generally deferred and amortized over 12 months or until the same major\nmaintenance activities must be repeated, whichever is shorter. The cost and accumulated depreciation applicable to assets retired or sold are removed from the respective\naccounts, and gains or losses thereon are included in the statement of operations.\nWe assign the useful lives of our property and equipment based upon our internal engineering estimates, which are reviewed periodically. The estimated useful lives of\nour property and equipment range from 3 to 8 years, or the shorter of the useful life or remaining life of the lease for leasehold improvements. Depreciation is recorded using the\nstraight-line method.\nConstruction in progress (see Note 4) is carried at cost and consists of specifically identifiable direct and indirect development and construction costs. While under\nconstruction, costs of the property are included in construction in progress until the property is placed in service, at which time costs are transferred to the appropriate property\nand equipment account, including, but not limited to, leasehold improvements or other such accounts.\nProperty and equipment acquired from the PET Labs Pharmaceutical Acquisition was measured at fair value on October 31, 2023. The fair value forms the new basis\nof these assets and is depreciated over the remaining estimated useful lives of the related assets.\nBusiness Combination and Asset Acquisitions\nThe Company evaluates acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions to assess whether or not the transaction should be accounted for as a business combination\nor asset acquisition by first applying a screen to determine if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of\nsimilar identifiable assets. If the screen is met, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If the screen is not met, further determination is required as to whether or\nnot the Company has acquired inputs and processes that have the ability to create outputs, which would meet the requirements of a business. If determined to be a business\ncombination, the Company accounts for the transaction under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations, which requires the\nacquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the fair value of all assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and establishes\nthe acquisition date as the fair value measurement point. Accordingly, the Company recognizes assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including\ncontingent assets and liabilities, and non-controlling interest in the acquiree based on the fair value estimates as of the date of acquisition. In accordance with ASC 805, the\nCompany recognizes and measures goodwill as of the acquisition date, as the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identified net assets\nacquired.\nThe consideration for the Company’s business acquisitions may include future payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of a particular event or events. The\nobligations for such contingent consideration payments are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. The contingent consideration obligations are then evaluated each\nreporting period. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, other than changes due to payments, are recognized as a gain or loss and recorded within change in the\nfair value of deferred and contingent consideration liabilities in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\nIf determined to be an asset acquisition, the Company accounts for the transaction under ASC 805-50, which requires the acquiring entity in an asset acquisition to\nrecognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the cost to the acquiring entity on a relative fair value basis, which includes transaction costs in addition to\nconsideration given. No gain or loss is recognized as of the date of acquisition unless the fair value of non-cash assets given as consideration differs from the assets’ carrying\namounts on the acquiring entity’s books. Consideration transferred that is non-cash will be measured based on either the cost (which shall be measured based on the fair value of\nthe consideration given) or the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever is more reliably measurable. Goodwill is not recognized in an asset acquisition\nand any excess consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated to the identifiable assets based on relative fair values.\nContingent consideration payments in asset acquisitions are recognized when the contingency is resolved and the consideration is paid or becomes payable (unless the\ncontingent consideration meets the definition of a derivative, in which case the amount becomes part of the basis in the asset acquired). Upon recognition of the contingent\nconsideration payment, the amount is included in the cost of the acquired asset or group of assets.\n72\nTable of Contents\nASP Isotopes Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the amount of consideration paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired as a result of the Company’s business acquisitions accounted for\nusing the acquisition method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized and is subject to impairment testing at a reporting unit level on an annual basis or when a triggering event\noccurs that may indicate the carrying value of the goodwill is impaired. An entity is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is\nnecessary. Further testing is only required if the entity determines, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is\nless than its carrying amount. The Company will perform its annual test for goodwill as of October 31.\nLeases\nThe Company accounts for leases in accordance with ASC 842, Leases. At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or\ncontains a lease based on specific facts and circumstances, the existence of an identified asset(s), if any, and the Company’s control over the use of the identified asset(s), if\napplicable. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of future lease payments over the expected lease term.\nThe interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As such, the Company will utilize the incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to\nborrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment, and considering the region in which the ROU\nasset and liabilities are located.\nThe Company has elected to combine lease and non-lease components as a single component. Operating leases are recognized on the balance sheet as ROU lease assets,\noperating lease liabilities current and operating lease liabilities non-current. Fixed rents are included in the calculation of the lease balances, while variable costs paid for certain\noperating and pass-through costs are excluded. Lease expense is recognized over the expected term on a straight-line basis.\nFinance leases are recognized on the balance sheet as property and equipment, finance lease liabilities current and finance lease liabilities non-current. Finance lease\nROU assets and the related lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. The\nfinance lease ROU assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term with the related interest expense of the lease liability payment recognized over the lease term\nusing the effective interest method.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment. The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the\nfuture undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the\namount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Fair value would be assessed using a discounted cash flows or other appropriate measures\nof fair value. The Company did not recognize any impairment losses for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs consist primarily of fees paid to consultants, license fees and facilities costs. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services\nthat will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the\npayment is made. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nSelling, General and Administrative Costs\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, including stock-based compensation, related to our executive, finance,\nbusiness development, legal, human resources and support functions. Other general and administrative expenses include professional fees for auditing, tax, consulting and\npatent-related services, rent and utilities and insurance.\n73\nTable of Contents\nASP Isotopes Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense represents the cost of the grant date fair value of employee stock awards recognized over the requisite service period of the awards\n(usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis. The Company estimates the fair value of each stock-based award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The Black-Scholes option pricing model incorporates various assumptions, such as the value of the underlying common stock, the risk-free interest rate, expected\nvolatility, expected dividend yield, and expected life of the options. Forfeitures are recognized as a reduction of stock-based compensation expense as they occur.\nThe Company also awards restricted stock to employees and directors. Restricted stock is generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the\ncompletion of the vesting restrictions. The Company expenses the cost of the restricted stock, which is determined to be the fair market value of the shares of common stock\nunderlying the restricted stock at the date of grant, ratably over the period during which the vesting restrictions lapse.\nEquity-based compensation expense is classified in the statement of operations in the same manner in which the award recipients’ payroll costs are classified or in\nwhich the award recipients’ service payments are classified.\nPrior to the Company’s IPO, there was no public market of the Company’s common stock. The fair value of the shares of common stock underlying the Company’s\nshare-based awards was estimated on each grant date by the Company’s board of directors based on then current facts and circumstances. To determine the fair value of the\nCompany’s common stock underlying option grants, the board of directors considered, among other things, input from management and recent third-party financings\nconsummated by the Company.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences associated with differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and\nliabilities, as measured by the enacted tax rates, which are expected to be in effect when these differences reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nPrior to the acquisition of 51% of PET Labs Pharmaceuticals, the Company had generated net losses since inception and accordingly had not recorded a provision for\nincome taxes. Subsequent to the acquisition of 51% of PET Labs Pharmaceuticals, the Company records the provision for income taxes for the activity from PET Labs\nPharmaceuticals operations.\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10, Uncertainty in Income Taxes, or ASC 740-10. The Company has not recognized a liability for any uncertain tax\npositions. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits has not been provided since there is no unrecognized benefit since the date of\nadoption. The Company has not recognized interest expense or penalties as a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10. If there were an unrecognized tax benefit, the\nCompany would recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in income tax expense.\nThe Company has identified the United States, South Africa and Guernsey as its major tax jurisdictions. Refer to Note 15 for further details.\nComprehensive Loss\nComprehensive loss is defined as a change in equity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources.

The Company is obligated\nto purchase this equipment and recorded the other asset and other liability for the full cost of $1,653,000 on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023.\nKlydon Proprietary Limited\nIn November 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with Klydon Proprietary Limited (“Klydon”) to design and build a plant to enrich Molybdenum in South\nAfrica. The initial phase of the project includes the building of a plant that can support the production of at least 5kgs of Mo-100, and is expected to be completed in the second\nhalf of 2023. The contracted cost for this phase is $6,800,000. The second phase of the project includes the production to be increased to 20kgs of Mo-100 with an additional\ncost of $6,000,000. The Company can modify the contract scope and overall costs and the contract can be cancelled by either party. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\napproximately $7,233,000 and $1,800,000, respectively, has been paid under this contract and recorded as construction in progress within property and equipment.\nKlydon performed a portion of the services required under the Turnkey Contract; however, services were incomplete and many of the services were not completed\nwithin the time frame required. As a result, Klydon and ASP South Africa entered into an Acknowledgement of Debt Agreement dated November 30, 2022, whereby Klydon (i)\nagreed to pledge its assets (the “Pledged Assets”) to ASP South Africa to secure its performance of the Turnkey Contract by December 31, 2022, and (ii) acknowledged that\nASP South Africa would suffer damages in the amount of $6,050,000 (“Damage Amount”) should it fail to perform. Under the Acknowledgement of Debt Agreement, the\nPledged Assets would serve as collateral for Klydon’s obligation to pay the Damage Amount should Klydon fail to perform. In connection therewith, also on November 30,\n2022, ASP South Africa and Klydon entered into a Deed of Security Agreement whereby, if Klydon failed to complete its obligations under the Turnkey Contract by December\n31, 2022, all of Klydon’s rights of any nature to and interests of any nature in the Pledged Assets would be transferred to ASP South Africa. Klydon failed to complete its\nobligations under the Turnkey Contract by December 31, 2022, however, the Company did not perfect its interests in the assets until April 4, 2023. The Company did not\nbelieve that the amounts owed by Klydon were realizable, nor did the Company know the timing of any recovery payments. Therefore, a loss recovery receivable was not\nrecorded at any time prior to April 4, 2023.\nOn April 4, 2023, the Company perfected its interest under the Acknowledgement of Debt Agreement, pursuant to which the Company acquired certain intellectual\nproperty from Klydon (“Klydon Settlement”). In addition, the Company acquired Klydon’s interest in four entities which are inactive and in the process of being dissolved. The\nCompany has concluded that the Klydon Settlement is accounted for under ASC 805, Business Combinations as an asset acquisition since the assets acquired were concentrated\nin a single identifiable asset from a related party. In conjunction with the Klydon Settlement, the Company recorded an increase to additional paid-in capital for the settlement of\nall liabilities owed to Klydon at the time of settlement totaling $626,223.\nTwo individuals who are officers and board members of Klydon, one who is now an officer of ASP Isotopes Inc. and the other who is now a scientific advisor of ASP\nIsotopes Inc., received warrants to purchase common stock of the Company and therefore are considered related parties. See Notes 10 and 12.\n76\nTable of Contents\nASP Isotopes Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company may have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. The Company accrues liabilities for\nsuch matters when future expenditures are probable and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated.\nOn October 25, 2022, the Company received a letter from a law firm acting on behalf of Norsk medisinsk syklotronsenter AS (“NMS”), asserting, among other things,\nthat the grant of a license to the ASP technology to the Company by Klydon violates a pre-existing exclusive sub-license to the ASP technology granted to Radfarma. The\nasserted claims, arbitration and/or litigation could include claims against the Company, the Company’s licensor (Klydon), or Klydon’s present or former sub-licensors alleging\ninfringement of intellectual property rights with respect to the ASP technology on which our company relies. The Company recorded legal costs totaling $78,304 which was\npaid to Klydon’s attorneys to settle this claim. As of December 31, 2023, Radfarma has relinquished all claims and ASP Isotopes owns the rights to the licenses originally held\nby Klydon and acquired by ASP Isotopes.\n9.

Any development efforts improving the intellectual property performed by either\nKlydon or the Company will be the property of Klydon. There are no upfront, milestone payments, nor royalties on product sales over the term of the license. Two individuals\nwho are officers and board members of Klydon received warrants to purchase common stock of the Company.

Net Loss Per Share\nThe Company has reported losses since inception and has computed basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders by dividing net loss attributable to\ncommon stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding for the period, without consideration for potentially dilutive securities. The\nCompany computes diluted net loss per share of Common Stock after giving consideration to all potentially dilutive shares of common stock, including options to purchase\ncommon stock and warrants to purchase common stock, outstanding during the period determined using the treasury-stock and if-converted methods, except where the effect of\nincluding such securities would be antidilutive. Because the Company has reported net losses since inception, these potential shares of Common Stock have been anti-dilutive\nand basic and diluted loss per share were the same for all periods presented.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share:\nYear Ended Year Ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nNumerator:\nNet loss attributable to ASP Isotopes shareholders $ (16,286,234) $ (4,945,139)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average common stock outstanding, basic and diluted 33,066,708 26,793,745\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted $ (0.49) $ (0.18)\n85\nTable of Contents\nASP Isotopes Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe following table sets forth the potentially dilutive securities that have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because to include them\nwould be anti-dilutive:\nYear Ended Year Ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nOptions to purchase common stock 2,766,000 2,901,000\nRestricted stock 4,489,186 7,000,000\nWarrants to purchase common stock 3,386,076 —\nTotal shares of common stock equivalents 10,641,262 9,901,000\n15.

The\nCompany has no income tax expense due to operating losses incurred for the year ended December 31, 2022. The valuation allowance increased by $1,182,177 and $926,104 in\n2023 and 2022, respectively, due to the increase in the net deferred tax assets by the same amount; primarily due to net operating loss carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has federal, state and South Africa NOLs available of $5,993,571, $332,933 and $2,271,489, respectively, to offset future\ntaxable income, if any, for federal and state income tax purposes. The state NOLs are carried forward indefinitely until used and never expire. Under the Tax Act, federal NOLs\nutilized are limited to 80% of taxable income in any year where taxable income is determined without regard to the NOL deduction itself. The Tax Act generally eliminates the\nability to carry back any net operating loss to prior taxable years, while allowing unused net operating losses to be carried forward indefinitely.\nThe Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including\nresolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be\nrecognized. The Company’s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company had no accrual for interest and\npenalties on the Company’s balance sheets and has not recognized interest and/or penalties in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the years ended December\n31, 2023 and 2022. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Subsequent changes in judgment based\nupon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing\nauthorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were no uncertain tax positions.\nOwnership changes, as defined in the IRC, may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income\npursuant to IRC Section 382 or similar provisions. Subsequent ownership changes could further affect the limitation in future years. The Company has not completed a study to\nassess whether a change of control has occurred or whether there have been multiple changes of control since the Company’s formation due to the significant complexity and\ncost associated with such study and because there could be additional changes in control in the future. As a result, the Company is not able to estimate the effect of the change in\ncontrol, if any, on the Company’s ability to utilize net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards in the future.\n16. Subsequent Events\nOn March 7, 2024, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary Quantum Leap Energy received gross proceeds of $20,550,000 through the issuance of Convertible\nPromissory Notes with a stated interest rate of 6% for the first year and 8% thereafter. The maturity date of the Convertible Promissory Notes is March 7, 2029. The\nConvertible Promissory Notes automatically convert into common shares upon Quantum Leap Energy’s closing of an IPO or other qualifying public transaction at 80% of the\nshare price taking into consideration a valuation cap.\nOn April 9, 2024, the Company received approximately $5,500,000 from the issuance of 3,164,557 shares of common stock upon the exercise of a warrant held by an\ninstitutional investor. In conjunction with the exercise of the warrants, the same investor received a new warrant to purchase 1,225,000 shares of common stock at $3.90 per\nshare. This new warrant becomes exercisable 6 months after issuance and expires on the fifth anniversary of the initial exercise date.\n87\nTable of Contents\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures as of December 31, 2023. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, mean controls and\nother procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls include, without limitation, controls and\nprocedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company on the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management, including, our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their\nobjectives and management necessarily applies its judgement in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as a result of a material weakness\nidentified in our internal control over financial reporting, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2023.\nIn the course of preparing the financial statements that are included in this Form 10-K, management has determined that a material weakness exists within the internal\ncontrols over financial reporting. The material weakness identified relates to the lack of formal control documentation and consistent execution of control procedures, and the\nlack of a sufficient complement of personnel within the finance and accounting function with an appropriate degree of knowledge, experience and training. We also noted a\nmaterial weakness related to logical security and privileged access in the area of information technology. We concluded that the material weaknesses in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting information technology occurred because, prior to becoming a public company, we were a private company and did not have the necessary business\nprocesses, systems, personnel, and related internal controls necessary to satisfy the accounting and financial reporting requirements of a public company.\nIn order to remediate the material weaknesses, we expect to enhance our formal documentation over internal control procedures and management controls infrastructure\nto allow for more consistent execution of control procedures and hire additional accounting, and finance and information technology resources or consultants with public\ncompany experience.\nWe may not be able to fully remediate the identified material weakness until the steps described above have been completed and our internal controls have been\noperating effectively for a sufficient period of time. We believe we have already and will continue to make progress in our remediation plan during the year ending December\n31, 2023, but cannot assure you that we will be able to fully remediate the material weakness in 2024. If the steps we take do not correct the material weakness in a timely\nmanner, we will be unable to conclude that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, there could continue to be a reasonable possibility that a\nmaterial misstatement of our financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We also may incur significant costs to execute various aspects of our\nremediation plan but cannot provide a reasonable estimate of such costs at this time.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-\n15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Due to inherent limitations, internal control over\nfinancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods\nare subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control\nover financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K based on the framework in Internal Control---Integrated Framework (2013\nframework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. Based on such evaluation, our management concluded that our\ninternal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n88\nTable of Contents\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public\naccounting firm.

Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath to faithfully\nexecute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability.\n2.10 Stockholder Business (Other Than the Election of Directors).\n(a) Only such business (other than nominations for election of directors, which is governed by Section 3.16 of these Bylaws) shall be\nconducted as shall have been properly brought before an annual meeting.

Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or\nproceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (“proceeding”), by reason of the fact that such person or a person of whom he or she is\nthe legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of\nanother Corporation, or as a controlling person of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit\nplans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director or officer, or in any other capacity while serving as a\ndirector or officer, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may\nhereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader\nindemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment) against all expenses, liability and loss reasonably\nincurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or\nofficer and shall inure to the benefit of his heirs, executors and administrators; provided, that except as provided in Section 8.2 of this Article VIII, the\nCorporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnity in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if (a) such\nindemnification is expressly required to be made by law, (b) the proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board, (c) such indemnification is\nprovided by the Corporation, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Corporation under the DGCL, or (d) the proceeding (or part\nthereof) is brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification or advancement under an indemnity agreement or any other statute or law or\notherwise as required under Section 145 of the DGCL.

If a claim under Section 8.1 is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written\nclaim has been received by the Corporation, or twenty (20) days in the case of a claim for advancement of expenses, the claimant may at any time\nthereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if such suit is not frivolous or brought in bad faith, the\nclaimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to\nenforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any, has been\ntendered to this Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to\nindemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders)\nto have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because the\nclaimant has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board,\nindependent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create\na presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of\nexpenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final judicial decision from which\nthere is no further right to appeal that the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. In any suit brought\nby the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an\nadvancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such\nadvancement of expenses, shall be on the Corporation.\n8.3 Indemnification of Employees and Agents. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board, grant rights to\nindemnification, and to the advancement of related expenses, to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this\nArticle VIII with respect to the indemnification of and advancement of expenses to directors and officers of the Corporation.\n8.4 Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any person in this Article VIII shall not be exclusive of any other right which such\npersons may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or\ndisinterested directors or otherwise.\n8.5 Indemnification Contracts. The Board is authorized to enter into a contract with any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation,\nor any person serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or\nother enterprise, including employee benefit plans, providing for indemnification rights equivalent to or, if the Board so determines, greater than, those\nprovided for in this Article VIII.\n8.6 Insurance. The Corporation shall maintain insurance to the extent reasonably available, at its expense, to protect itself and any such director,\nofficer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability\nor loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.\n8.7 Effect of Amendment. Any amendment, repeal or modification of any provision of this Article VIII shall not adversely affect any right or\nprotection of an indemnitee or his successor in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment, repeal or modification.\n8.8 Reliance. Persons who after the date of the adoption of this provision become or remain directors or officers of the Corporation or who,\nwhile a director or officer of the Corporation, become or remain a director, officer, employee or agent of a subsidiary, shall be conclusively presumed to\nhave relied on the rights to indemnity, advance of expenses and other rights contained in this Article VIII in entering into or continuing such service. The\nrights to indemnification and to the advance of expenses conferred in this Article VIII shall apply to claims made against an indemnitee arising out of acts\nor omissions which occurred or occur both prior and subsequent to the adoption hereof.\n* * *\n16\nEXHIBIT 4.1\nDESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK\nREGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12\nOF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nThe following description of the common stock of ASP Isotopes Inc. (“we,” “us” and “our”) is a summary and does not purport to be complete.\nIt is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (“Certificate of Incorporation”) and\nour Amended and Restated Bylaws (“Bylaws”). This description also summarizes relevant provisions of General Corporation Law of the State of\nDelaware (the “DGCL”). We encourage you to read these materials for additional information.\nGeneral\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 500,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred\nstock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which shares of preferred stock are undesignated.\nCommon Stock\nThe holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the stockholders. The holders of our\ncommon stock are entitled to receive ratably those dividends, if any, that may be declared from time to time by our board of directors out of funds legally\navailable, subject to preferences that may be applicable to preferred stock, if any, then outstanding. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up\nof our company, the holders of common stock will be entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities, subject to prior\ndistribution rights of preferred stock, if any, then outstanding. Our common stock has no preemptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights or\nredemption or sinking fund provisions.\nPreferred Stock\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our board of directors to establish one or more series of preferred stock (including convertible\npreferred stock). Unless required by law or any stock exchange, the authorized shares of preferred stock will be available for issuance without further\naction by the holders of our common stock. Our board of directors will be able to determine, with respect to any series of preferred stock, the powers\n(including voting powers), preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations, or restrictions\nthereof. No shares of preferred stock have been issued or are outstanding as of the date of the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this\nDescription forms a part, and we have no present plan to issue any shares of preferred stock.\nAnti-Takeover Matters in our Governing Documents and Under Delaware Law\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws contain, and the DGCL contains, provisions that are intended to enhance the likelihood of\ncontinuity and stability in the composition of our board of directors. These provisions are intended to avoid costly takeover battles, reduce our\nvulnerability to a hostile or abusive change of control, and enhance the ability of our board of directors to maximize stockholder value in connection with\nany unsolicited offer to acquire us. However, these provisions may have an antitakeover effect and may delay, deter, or prevent a merger or acquisition by\nmeans of a tender offer, a proxy contest, or other takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that\nmight result in a premium over the prevailing market price for the shares of common stock held by stockholders.\nAuthorized But Unissued Capital Stock\nThe authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval, subject\nto any limitations imposed by the listing standards of Nasdaq. These additional shares may be used for a variety of corporate finance transactions,\nacquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could make more\ndifficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger, or otherwise.\nClassified Board of Directors\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that our board of directors be divided into three classes, with the classes as nearly equal in number as\npossible and each class serving three-year staggered terms. Directors may only be removed from our board of directors for cause by the affirmative vote\nof at least 66-2/3% of the voting power of all of our then-outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting\ntogether as a single class. In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation provides that, subject to the rights granted to one or more series of preferred stock\nthen outstanding, any newly created directorship on the board of directors that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancies on\nour board of directors will be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole\nremaining director. A director chosen to fill a position resulting from an increase in the number of directors will hold office until the next election of the\ndirector’s class and until the director’s successor is duly elected and qualified, or until the director’s earlier death, resignation or removal. These\nprovisions may have the effect of deferring, delaying, or discouraging hostile takeovers, changes in control of us or changes in our management.\nDelaware Anti-Takeover Law\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which is an anti-takeover law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware\ncorporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the person became\nan interested stockholder, unless the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a\nprescribed manner. Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or another transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the\ninterested stockholder. Generally, an interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns 15% or more of the\ncorporation’s outstanding voting stock or is the corporation’s affiliate or associate and was the owner of 15% or more of the corporation’s outstanding\nvoting stock at any time within the three-year period immediately before the date of determination. The existence of this provision may have an anti-\ntakeover effect with respect to transactions that are not approved in advance by our board, including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium\nover the market price for the shares of common stock held by stockholders.\nNo Cumulative Voting\nUnder Delaware law, the right to vote cumulatively does not exist unless the certificate of incorporation specifically authorizes cumulative\nvoting. Our Certificate of Incorporation does not authorize cumulative voting. Therefore, stockholders holding a majority of the shares of our stock\nentitled to vote generally in the election of directors are able to elect all of our directors.\nSpecial Stockholder Meetings\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that special meetings of our stockholders may be called at any time only by or at the direction of the\nboard of directors, the chair of the board of directors or our Chief Executive Officer. Our Bylaws prohibit the conduct of any business at a special meeting\nother than as specified in the notice for such meeting. These provisions may have the effect of deferring, delaying, or discouraging hostile takeovers or\nchanges in control or management.\n2\nDirector Nominations and Stockholder Proposals\nOur Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors,\nother than nominations made by or at the direction of the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors. In order for any matter to be\n“properly brought” before a meeting, a stockholder will have to comply with advance notice requirements and provide us with certain information.\nGenerally, to be timely, a stockholder’s notice must be received at our principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to\nthe first anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders. Our Bylaws also specify requirements as to the form and content\nof a stockholder’s notice. Our Bylaws allow the chair of a meeting of the stockholders to adopt rules and regulations for the conduct of that meeting that\nmay have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at that meeting if the rules and regulations are not followed. These provisions may also\ndefer, delay, or discourage a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise\nattempting to influence or obtain control.\nStockholder Action by Written Consent\nPursuant to Section 228 of the DGCL, any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders may be taken without\na meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is or are signed by the holders of\noutstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all\nshares of our stock entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Our Certificate of\nIncorporation precludes stockholder action by written consent.\nAmendment of Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws\nThe DGCL provides generally that the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote on any matter is required to amend a\ncorporation’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, unless a corporation’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as the case may be, requires a greater\npercentage. Our Bylaws may be amended or repealed by a majority vote of our board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least\n662⁄3% of the votes which all our stockholders would be entitled to cast in any annual election of directors. In addition, the affirmative vote of the holders\nof at least 66-2⁄3% of the votes which all our stockholders would be entitled to cast in any election of directors will be required to amend or repeal or to\nadopt any provisions inconsistent with any of the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation described above.\nThe foregoing provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or\nprevent a change in control. These provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of our board of\ndirectors and in the policies formulated by our board of directors and to discourage certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened\nchange of control. These provisions are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The provisions also are intended to\ndiscourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights. However, such provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender\noffers for our shares and, as a consequence, they also may inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our shares of common stock that could result from\nactual or rumored takeover attempts. Such provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in our management or delaying or preventing a\ntransaction that might benefit you or other minority stockholders.\nExclusive Forum\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the\nState of Delaware be the sole and exclusive forum for: (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our company, (2) any action asserting\na claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, agent, or other employee or stockholder of our company to us or our stockholders,\n(3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our Certificate of Incorporation or our Bylaws or as to which the DGCL\nconfers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each\ncase subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. It further provides that,\nunless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent\npermitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolutions of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended (the “Securities Act”). The exclusive forum clauses described above shall not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Although we believe these\nprovisions benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of applicable law in the types of lawsuits to which they apply, the provisions\nmay have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other\ncompanies’ certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings and there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such\nprovisions. In addition, investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. It is possible that, in\nconnection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation to\nbe inapplicable or unenforceable in such action. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be\ndeemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation.\n3\nLimitations of Liability and Indemnification\nThe DGCL authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their stockholders for monetary\ndamages for breaches of directors’ fiduciary duties, subject to certain exceptions. Our Certificate of Incorporation includes a provision that eliminates the\npersonal liability of directors for monetary damages to the corporation or its stockholders for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the\nextent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL. The effect of these provisions is to eliminate the rights of us\nand our stockholders, through stockholders’ derivative suits on our behalf, to recover monetary damages from a director for breach of fiduciary duty as a\ndirector, including breaches resulting from grossly negligent behavior. However, exculpation does not apply to any breaches of the director’s duty of\nloyalty, any acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, any authorization of dividends or stock\nredemptions or repurchases paid or made in violation of the DGCL, or for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.\nOur Bylaws generally provide that we must indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized by the\nDGCL. We also are expressly authorized to carry directors’ and officers’ liability insurance providing indemnification for our directors, officers and\ncertain employees for some liabilities. We believe these indemnification and advancement provisions and insurance are useful to attract and retain\nqualified directors and executive officers.\nThe limitation of liability, indemnification and advancement provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws may discourage\nstockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the\nlikelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our\nstockholders. In addition, your investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors\nand officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions.\nThere is currently no pending material litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers or employees for which indemnification is\nsought.\nWe have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities\narising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors or executive officers, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such\nindemnification is against public policy and is therefore unenforceable.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Equinity Trust Company, LLC (formerly, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company,\nLLC). The transfer agent’s address is 6201 15th Avenue Brooklyn, New York 11219.\nListing\nOur common stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “ASPI.”\n4\nEXHIBIT 21.1\nASP Isotopes Inc.\nSubsidiaries of the Registrant\nSubsidiaries* Place of Incorporation\nASP Isotopes Guernsey Limited (formerly, PDS-Photonica Holdings (Guernsey) Limited) Guernsey\nASP Isotopes South Africa (Proprietary) Limited (formerly, PDS Photonica Holdings South Africa (PTY) South Africa\nLimited)\nEnriched Energy LLC Delaware, U.S.\nASP Isotopes UK Ltd England & Wales\nEnlightened Isotopes (Pty) Ltd South Africa\nASP Isotopes EHF Iceland\nQuantum Leap Energy LLC Delaware, U.S.\nQuantum Leap Energy Limited England & Wales\nQuantum Leap Energy (Pty) Ltd South Africa\nPET Labs Pharmaceuticals (Pty) Ltd South Africa\n* Please note that this list includes all subsidiaries of ASP Isotopes Inc. without regard to whether they would constitute a \"significant\nsubsidiary\" pursuant to Item 601(b)(21)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nEXHIBIT 23.1\nCONSENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nWe consent to the incorporation by reference in the Registration Statements of ASP Isotopes, Inc. on Form S-1 (Nos. 333-275686 and 333-271137) and\nForm S-8 (No. 333-268421) of our report dated April 10, 2024, on our audits of the financial statements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and for each\nof the years then ended, which report is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to be filed on or about April 10, 2024.

INTRODUCTION\nASP Isotopes Inc. (the “Company”) is adopting this policy (this “Policy”) to provide for the Company’s recovery of certain Incentive\nCompensation (as defined below) erroneously awarded to Affected Officers (as defined below) under certain circumstances. This Policy is effective as of\nOctober 2, 2023 (the “Effective Date”).\nThis Policy is administered by the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”). The\nCommittee shall have full and final authority to make any and all determinations required or permitted under this Policy. Any determination by the\nCommittee with respect to this Policy shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties. The Board may amend or terminate this Policy at any time.\nThis Policy is intended to comply with Section 10D of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), Rule 10D-1\nthereunder and the applicable rules of any national securities exchange on which the Company’s securities are then listed (the “Exchange”) and will be\ninterpreted and administered consistent with that intent.\n2. EFFECTIVE DATE\nThis Policy shall apply to all Incentive Compensation received by an Affected Officer on or after the Effective Date to the extent permitted or\nrequired by applicable law or the rules of the Exchange.\n3. DEFINITIONS\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:\n“Affected Officer” means any current or former “officer” as defined in Exchange Act Rule 16a-1.\n“Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means the amount of Incentive Compensation received that exceeds the amount of Incentive\nCompensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the Restatement, computed without regard to any taxes paid. In\nthe case of Incentive Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not\nsubject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the Restatement, the amount shall reflect a reasonable estimate of the effect of the\nRestatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive Compensation was received, as determined by the Committee in its\nsole discretion. The Committee may determine the form and amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in its sole discretion.\n“Financial Reporting Measure” means any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in\npreparing the Company’s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures, whether or not such measure is\npresented within the financial statements or included in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Stock price and total shareholder return are\nalso Financial Reporting Measures.\n“Incentive Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based in whole or in part on the attainment of a Financial\nReporting Measure. For purposes of clarity, base salaries, bonuses or equity awards paid solely upon satisfying one or more subjective standards, strategic\nor operational measures, or continued employment are not considered Incentive Compensation, unless such awards were granted, paid or vested based in\npart on a Financial Reporting Measure.\n“Restatement” means an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement\nunder the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the\npreviously issued financial statements (i.e., a “Big R” restatement), or that would result in a material misstatement if the error was corrected in the current\nperiod or left uncorrected in the current period (i.e., a “little r” restatement).\n4. RECOVERY\nIf the Company is required to prepare a Restatement, the Company shall seek to recover and claw back reasonably promptly all Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation that is received by an Affected Officer:\n(I) on and after the Effective Date;\n(ii) after the person begins service as an Affected Officer;\n(iii) who served as an Affected Officer at any time during the performance period for that Incentive Compensation;\n(iv) while the Company has a class of securities listed on the Exchange; and\n(v) during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company was required to prepare the Restatement\n(including any transition period within or immediately following those years that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year,\nprovided that a transition period of nine to 12 months will be deemed to be a completed fiscal year).\nFor purposes of this Policy:\n· Erroneously Awarded Compensation is deemed to be received in the Company’s fiscal year during which the Financial Reporting Measure\nspecified in the Incentive Compensation is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive Compensation occurs after the end of that\nperiod; and\n· the date the Company is required to prepare a Restatement is the earlier of (x) the date the Board, the Committee or any officer of the\nCompany authorized to take such action concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare the\nRestatement, or (y) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare the Restatement.\nTo the extent required by applicable law or the rules of the Exchange, any profits realized from the sale of securities of the Company are subject\nto recoupment under this Policy.\nFor purposes of clarity, in no event shall the Company be required to award any Affected Officers an additional payment or other compensation\nif the Restatement would have resulted in the grant, payment or vesting of Incentive Compensation that is greater than the Incentive Compensation\nactually received by the Affected Officer. The recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not dependent on if or when the Restatement is filed.\n2\n5. SOURCES OF RECOUPMENT\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, the Committee may, in its discretion, seek recoupment from the Affected Officer(s) through any\nmeans it determines, which may include any of the following sources: (i) prior Incentive Compensation payments; (ii) future payments of Incentive\nCompensation; (iii) cancellation of outstanding Incentive Compensation; (iv) direct repayment; and (v) non-Incentive Compensation or securities held by\nthe Affected Officer. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company may offset such amount against any compensation or other amounts owed\nby the Company to the Affected Officer.\n6. LIMITED EXCEPTIONS TO RECOVERY\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee, in its discretion, may choose to forgo recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation under the\nfollowing circumstances, provided that the Committee (or a majority of the independent members of the Board) has made a determination that recovery\nwould be impracticable because:\n(i) The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the recoverable amounts; provided that the Company\nhas made a reasonable attempt to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, has documented such attempt and has (to the extent\nrequired) provided that documentation to the Exchange;\n(ii) Recovery would violate home country law where the law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022, and the Company provides an opinion\nof home country counsel to that effect to the Exchange that is acceptable to the Exchange; or\n(iii) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan to fail to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of\n1986, as amended.\n7. NO INDEMNIFICATION OR INSURANCE\nThe Company will not indemnify, insure or otherwise reimburse any Affected Officer against the recovery of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation.\n8. NO IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER REMEDIES\nThis Policy does not preclude the Company from taking any other action to enforce an Affected Officer’s obligations to the Company, including\ntermination of employment, institution of civil proceedings, or reporting of any misconduct to appropriate government authorities. This Policy is in\naddition to the requirements of Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that are applicable to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer.\n3"
