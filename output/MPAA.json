( **Nasdaq: MPAA** ) today reported results for its fiscal 2025 second quarter and six-month period ended September 30, 2024, with a continued favorable full-year outlook supported by record sales and gross profit, and the ongoing benefits of strategic initiatives to further enhance profitability. \n\nKey highlights for the fiscal second quarter. \n\n  * Net sales increased 5.9 percent to a record $208.2 million. \n  * Gross profit increased to a record $41.3 million, impacted by certain one-time expenses of $2.7 million for onboarding new business, and $1.3 million of transition expenses related to the recent strategic relocation of certain operations with expected annualized savings of $7.1 million. \n  * Generated cash from operating activities of $22.9 million and reduced net bank debt by $22.0 million. \n  * Results were impacted by non-cash items totaling $10.6 million as detailed in the exhibits. \n\n\n\n**Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Results**\n\n**Net sales** for the fiscal 2025 second quarter increased 5.9 percent to an all-time record $208.2 million from $196.6 million in the prior year. \n\n**Gross profit** for the fiscal 2025 second quarter increased to a record $41.3 million from $41.1 million a year earlier. Gross margin for the fiscal 2025 second quarter was 19.8 percent compared with 20.9 percent a year earlier. Gross margin for the fiscal 2025 second quarter was impacted by $3.8 million, or 1.8 percent, of non-cash expenses, and $1.3 million, or 0.6 percent, of one-time cash expenses, as detailed in Exhibit 3. In addition to the items detailed in Exhibit 3, gross profit for the current quarter was also impacted by $2.7 million, or 1.3 percent, of certain one-time expenses for onboarding new business. \n\nInterest expense for the fiscal second quarter decreased by $1.2 million to $14.2 million from $15.4 million a year ago, primarily due to lower average outstanding balances under the company’s credit facility and lower interest rates. \n\nNet loss for the fiscal 2025 second quarter was $3.0 million, or $0.15 per share, impacted by non-cash expenses of $8.0 million, or $0.40 per share, and one-time cash expenses of $1.1 million, or $0.06 per share, compared with a net loss of $2.0 million, or $0.10 per share, a year ago, impacted by various items detailed in Exhibit 1. In addition to the items detailed in Exhibit 1, as previously explained, results for the current quarter were also impacted by $2.7 million, or $0.10 per share, of certain one-time expenses for onboarding new business. \n\n“As we enter the second half of fiscal 2025, we remain optimistic about our year-over-year outlook. We anticipate continued improvements to gross margins, gross profit and cash flow in the quarters ahead, supported by opportunities to further leverage our leadership position within the non-discretionary aftermarket parts market. Our ongoing strategic actions throughout the entire organization are gaining traction as expected, enhanced by volume increases and improved operating efficiencies. \n\n“While there are a variety of factors related to financial performance beyond our control, such as non-cash items and interest rates, which are improving, the underlying fundamentals of our business continue to be strong. We remain focused on enhancing shareholder value and continued success in the second half,” said Selwyn Joffe, chairman, president, and chief executive officer. \n\nThe company generated approximately $22.9 million of cash from operating activities during fiscal 2025 second quarter and reduced net bank debt by $22.0 million to $114.3 million from $136.3 million. \n\n**Six-Month Results**\n\n**Net sales** for the fiscal 2025 six-month period increased 6.1 percent to a record $378.1 million from $356.3 million a year ago. \n\n**Gross profit** for the fiscal 2025 six-month period increased to a record $70.5 million from $67.7 million a year earlier. Gross margin for the fiscal 2025 six-month period was 18.6 percent compared with 19.0 percent a year earlier. Gross margin for the fiscal 2025 six-month period was impacted by $6.9 million, or 1.8 percent, of non-cash expenses, and $1.3 million, or 0.3 percent, of one-time cash expenses, as detailed in Exhibit 4. In addition to the items detailed in Exhibit 4, gross profit for the current six-month period was also impacted by $2.7 million, or 0.7 percent, of certain one-time expenses for onboarding new business. \n\nInterest expense increased by $1.5 million for the six months to $28.6 million from $27.1 million a year ago, primarily due to increased collection of receivables utilizing accounts receivable discount programs resulting from higher sales, partially offset by lower average outstanding balances under the company’s credit facility and lower interest rates. \n\nNet loss for the fiscal 2025 six-month period was $21.0 million, or $1.07 per share, impacted by non-cash expenses of $17.4 million, or $0.88 per share, and one-time cash expenses of $3.3 million, or $0.17 per share, compared with a net loss of $3.4 million, or $0.17 per share, a year ago, impacted by various items detailed in Exhibit 2. In addition to the items detailed in Exhibit 2, as previously explained, results for the current six-month period were also impacted by $2.7 million, or $0.10 per share, of certain one-time expenses for onboarding new business. \n\n**Further Considerations**\n\n  * Continued sales volume increases: \n    * Ordering activity has gained momentum. \n    * The company’s fundamentals are improving. \n  * Margin improvement: \n    * Enhanced by multiple rounds of price increases. \n    * Improving overhead absorption as brake-related business gains further momentum. \n    * Improving operational efficiencies. \n  * Positive cash flow outlook. \n\n\n\n**Fiscal 2025 Guidance**\n\nAs noted in the company’s prior fiscal year 2024 earnings press release, net sales for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 are estimated to be between $746 million to $766 million, representing between 3.9 percent and 6.7 percent year-over-year growth. The company expects gross margin accretion from operating efficiencies, increased volume and cost absorption. Operating income is expected to be between $79 million and $84 million, before certain non-cash items and one-time expenses. The company estimates depreciation and amortization will be approximately $11 million. \n\n**_Use of Non-GAAP Measure_ **\n\n_This press release includes the following non-GAAP measure – EBITDA, which is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance. The company believes this non-GAAP measure, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to the company’s results of operations. However, this non-GAAP measure has significant limitations in that it does not reflect all the costs and other items associated with the operation of the company’s business as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the company’s non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently and are therefore not comparable to similar measures by other companies. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP. For a definition and reconciliation of EBITDA to net income, its corresponding GAAP measure, see the financial tables included in this press release. Also, refer to our Form 8-K to which this release is attached, and other filings we make with the SEC, for further information regarding this measure._\n\n**Earnings Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nSelwyn Joffe, chairman, president and chief executive officer, and David Lee, chief financial officer, will host an investor conference call today at 10:00 a.m. Pacific time to discuss the company’s financial results and operations.

( **Nasdaq: MPAA** ) today reported results for its fiscal 2025 second quarter and six-month period ended September 30, 2024, with a continued favorable full-year outlook supported by record sales and gross profit, and the ongoing benefits of strategic initiatives to further enhance profitability. \n\nKey highlights for the fiscal second quarter. \n\n  * Net sales increased 5.9 percent to a record $208.2 million. \n  * Gross profit increased to a record $41.3 million, impacted by certain one-time expenses of $2.7 million for onboarding new business, and $1.3 million of transition expenses related to the recent strategic relocation of certain operations with expected annualized savings of $7.1 million. \n  * Generated cash from operating activities of $22.9 million and reduced net bank debt by $22.0 million. \n  * Results were impacted by non-cash items totaling $10.6 million as detailed in the exhibits. \n\n\n\n**Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Results**\n\n**Net sales** for the fiscal 2025 second quarter increased 5.9 percent to an all-time record $208.2 million from $196.6 million in the prior year. \n\n**Gross profit** for the fiscal 2025 second quarter increased to a record $41.3 million from $41.1 million a year earlier. Gross margin for the fiscal 2025 second quarter was 19.8 percent compared with 20.9 percent a year earlier. Gross margin for the fiscal 2025 second quarter was impacted by $3.8 million, or 1.8 percent, of non-cash expenses, and $1.3 million, or 0.6 percent, of one-time cash expenses, as detailed in Exhibit 3. In addition to the items detailed in Exhibit 3, gross profit for the current quarter was also impacted by $2.7 million, or 1.3 percent, of certain one-time expenses for onboarding new business. \n\nInterest expense for the fiscal second quarter decreased by $1.2 million to $14.2 million from $15.4 million a year ago, primarily due to lower average outstanding balances under the company’s credit facility and lower interest rates. \n\nNet loss for the fiscal 2025 second quarter was $3.0 million, or $0.15 per share, impacted by non-cash expenses of $8.0 million, or $0.40 per share, and one-time cash expenses of $1.1 million, or $0.06 per share, compared with a net loss of $2.0 million, or $0.10 per share, a year ago, impacted by various items detailed in Exhibit 1. In addition to the items detailed in Exhibit 1, as previously explained, results for the current quarter were also impacted by $2.7 million, or $0.10 per share, of certain one-time expenses for onboarding new business. \n\n“As we enter the second half of fiscal 2025, we remain optimistic about our year-over-year outlook. We anticipate continued improvements to gross margins, gross profit and cash flow in the quarters ahead, supported by opportunities to further leverage our leadership position within the non-discretionary aftermarket parts market. Our ongoing strategic actions throughout the entire organization are gaining traction as expected, enhanced by volume increases and improved operating efficiencies. \n\n“While there are a variety of factors related to financial performance beyond our control, such as non-cash items and interest rates, which are improving, the underlying fundamentals of our business continue to be strong. We remain focused on enhancing shareholder value and continued success in the second half,” said Selwyn Joffe, chairman, president, and chief executive officer. \n\nThe company generated approximately $22.9 million of cash from operating activities during fiscal 2025 second quarter and reduced net bank debt by $22.0 million to $114.3 million from $136.3 million. \n\n**Six-Month Results**\n\n**Net sales** for the fiscal 2025 six-month period increased 6.1 percent to a record $378.1 million from $356.3 million a year ago. \n\n**Gross profit** for the fiscal 2025 six-month period increased to a record $70.5 million from $67.7 million a year earlier. Gross margin for the fiscal 2025 six-month period was 18.6 percent compared with 19.0 percent a year earlier. Gross margin for the fiscal 2025 six-month period was impacted by $6.9 million, or 1.8 percent, of non-cash expenses, and $1.3 million, or 0.3 percent, of one-time cash expenses, as detailed in Exhibit 4. In addition to the items detailed in Exhibit 4, gross profit for the current six-month period was also impacted by $2.7 million, or 0.7 percent, of certain one-time expenses for onboarding new business. \n\nInterest expense increased by $1.5 million for the six months to $28.6 million from $27.1 million a year ago, primarily due to increased collection of receivables utilizing accounts receivable discount programs resulting from higher sales, partially offset by lower average outstanding balances under the company’s credit facility and lower interest rates. \n\nNet loss for the fiscal 2025 six-month period was $21.0 million, or $1.07 per share, impacted by non-cash expenses of $17.4 million, or $0.88 per share, and one-time cash expenses of $3.3 million, or $0.17 per share, compared with a net loss of $3.4 million, or $0.17 per share, a year ago, impacted by various items detailed in Exhibit 2. In addition to the items detailed in Exhibit 2, as previously explained, results for the current six-month period were also impacted by $2.7 million, or $0.10 per share, of certain one-time expenses for onboarding new business. \n\n**Further Considerations**\n\n  * Continued sales volume increases: \n    * Ordering activity has gained momentum. \n    * The company’s fundamentals are improving. \n  * Margin improvement: \n    * Enhanced by multiple rounds of price increases. \n    * Improving overhead absorption as brake-related business gains further momentum. \n    * Improving operational efficiencies. \n  * Positive cash flow outlook. \n\n\n\n**Fiscal 2025 Guidance**\n\nAs noted in the company’s prior fiscal year 2024 earnings press release, net sales for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 are estimated to be between $746 million to $766 million, representing between 3.9 percent and 6.7 percent year-over-year growth. The company expects gross margin accretion from operating efficiencies, increased volume and cost absorption. Operating income is expected to be between $79 million and $84 million, before certain non-cash items and one-time expenses. The company estimates depreciation and amortization will be approximately $11 million. \n\n**_Use of Non-GAAP Measure_ **\n\n_This press release includes the following non-GAAP measure – EBITDA, which is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance. The company believes this non-GAAP measure, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to the company’s results of operations. However, this non-GAAP measure has significant limitations in that it does not reflect all the costs and other items associated with the operation of the company’s business as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the company’s non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently and are therefore not comparable to similar measures by other companies. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP. For a definition and reconciliation of EBITDA to net income, its corresponding GAAP measure, see the financial tables included in this press release. Also, refer to our Form 8-K to which this release is attached, and other filings we make with the SEC, for further information regarding this measure._\n\n**Earnings Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nSelwyn Joffe, chairman, president and chief executive officer, and David Lee, chief financial officer, will host an investor conference call today at 10:00 a.m. Pacific time to discuss the company’s financial results and operations.
