Our initial goal is to deliver sebetralstat as the first oral, on-demand treatment for HAE in people aged 12 years and older. In addition, we are studying the potential of sebetralstat for the on-demand treatment of HAE in children aged 2 to 11 years. We believe that, if approved, sebetralstat has the potential to become the foundational therapy for HAE disease management globally. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking\" statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
