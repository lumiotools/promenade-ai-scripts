(Nasdaq: OMGA) (“Omega”), a biotechnology company pioneering the development of a new class of programmable epigenomic medicines, today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and multiple strategic and leadership updates, including the appointment of Kaan Certel, Ph.D., an industry veteran with extensive experience in corporate strategy and business development, as Chief Executive Officer. Dr. Certel succeeds Mahesh Karande as CEO, who has decided to leave Omega for personal reasons. In addition, the Company shared updated clinical data from the Phase 1 MYCHELANGELO™ I clinical trial and a strategic prioritization of its pipeline to focus resources on programs in which the Company believes epigenomic controllers have the potential to demonstrate therapeutic advantages over existing modalities, address significant unmet needs and unlock rapid value creation.\n\n“Kaan Certel has demonstrated outstanding business and scientific leadership as our Chief Business Officer since joining Omega earlier this year. We are excited to welcome him to his new role as Omega’s Chief Executive Officer,” said Chris Schade, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Omega Therapeutics. “His deep scientific expertise and strong track record of driving strategic partnerships will be invaluable as we advance our pipeline of impactful programs and expand our business development efforts. On behalf of the entire board, I want to extend our sincere gratitude to Mahesh for his efforts in establishing a strong foundation for Omega and advancing epigenomic controllers to clinical proof-of-mechanism.”\n\n“I am excited to work with the board and our team to build on the progress Omega has made harnessing the power of epigenomic controllers. The compelling data that we have generated both clinically and pre-clinically gives us greater confidence in the potential of programmable epigenomic medicines to address a broad range of diseases,” said Kaan Certel, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Omega Therapeutics. “The industry-first data from our recently completed, first-in-human clinical trial provide clear proof-of-mechanism, having demonstrated highly specific, on-target engagement with the intended epigenomic state change. We believe these data validate epigenomic controllers as a potential new class of medicines. In parallel, we have deepened our technical capabilities with a focus on upregulation and exquisite multiplexed control, which we believe may hold therapeutic advantages over existing modalities.”\n\nDr. Certel continued, “Together with our new Chief Scientific Officer, Jennifer Nelson, Ph.D., we are focusing our pipeline on three programs with significant opportunities in obesity, regenerative medicine and metabolic indications that fully leverage our unique value proposition in epigenomic modulation. Going forward, we plan to focus our resources on these prioritized programs and on cultivating strategic partnerships to advance existing and new development candidates as a core component of our corporate strategy. We are actively engaged in ongoing dialogue with potential partners to further support and expand our pipeline in an accelerated and capital-efficient manner.”\n\n**_Prioritized Pipeline_**\n\nOmega is prioritizing select preclinical programs in three areas where precision epigenomic control offers clear potential therapeutic advantages over existing modalities, including trans-differentiation for cellular reprogramming and durable upregulation of gene expression of intracellular proteins or secreted proteins where naturally occurring protein production may offer advantages over traditional biologics. Program advancement will be disciplined and data-driven to maximize shareholder value, capital efficiency and strategic partnering opportunities.\n\n_Obesity_\n\n  * In collaboration with Novo Nordisk, Omega continues to advance the development of an epigenomic controller for obesity. This program leverages Omega’s platform capabilities in trans-differentiation to transition the epigenetic state of white adipose cells to metabolically active brown adipose cells, with the goal of enhancing metabolic activity as a part of a potential new treatment approach for obesity management.\n\n\n\n_Regenerative Medicine_\n\n  * _HNF4A_ : Multiple liver diseases such as MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis) are characterized by fibrosis secondary to chronic inflammation. HNF4A is a nuclear receptor and master regulator of liver development and function. Upregulation of the HNF4A gene holds the potential to mitigate fibrosis and restore liver function. Omega has generated _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ data demonstrating the ability of epigenomic controllers to significantly upregulate HNF4A gene expression and reduce key measures of fibrosis.\n\n\n\n_Metabolic_\n\n  * _FGF21_ : A hormone involved in multiple metabolic processes, FGF21 has been implicated in hyperlipidemia and obesity. Well established preclinical models have demonstrated clear translatability to clinical studies and provide an opportunity to rapidly advance candidates to clinical proof-of-concept studies. Upregulation of FGF21 through precision epigenomic control may offer a compelling approach to address multiple metabolic indications where upregulation of natural protein expression cannot be mimicked by existing modalities.\n\n\n\n_Other Programs_\n\n  * The Phase 1 MYCHELANGELO trial of OTX-2002 has been completed and the Company is engaged in discussions with potential partners to further advance clinical development into Phase 2 or may choose to resume development through internal efforts with additional funding.\n  * The OTX-2101 and CXCL1-8 programs have been deprioritized in order to focus resources and capital on the three selected programs described above. The Company is pursuing strategic partnership opportunities to advance these programs or may choose to resume development through internal efforts with additional funding.\n\n\n\n“Our prioritized pipeline leverages the differentiated capabilities of our platform and reflects the diverse potential applications of Omega’s technology. We are excited by the opportunity to demonstrate the power of precision epigenomic control in these select high-value programs and build on the clinical progress we have made,” said Jennifer Nelson, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Omega Therapeutics. “Our first-in-human study clearly demonstrated our ability to prospectively design an epigenomic controller capable of inducing prespecified changes in epigenetic signatures that alter gene expression with high specificity. Expanding on these results, we have an incredible opportunity to establish epigenomic controllers as a new class of medicines with unparalleled versatility.”\n\n**_Topline Data from Completed Phase 1 MYCHELANGELO™ Trial_**\n\nThe Phase 1 monotherapy dose escalation portion of MYCHELANGELO I was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of OTX-2002 in patients with relapsed or refractory hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other solid tumor types known for association with the MYC oncogene. \n\nTwenty-four patients, including 19 with HCC, were enrolled across six dose cohorts (spanning 0.02 mg/kg to 0.3 mg/kg) and were treated with OTX-2002 intravenously once every two weeks.\n\nTopline data from the completed Phase 1 trial showed:\n\n  * _Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics_ : \n    * Highly specific on-target engagement with intended epigenetic changes at the target genomic loci, as evidenced by a robust increase in cell-free DNA MYC methylation signal following administration of study drug. The signal was dose dependent within the tolerated dose range. Pre-dose levels of MYC methylation were non-detectable. The increased methylation signal persisted throughout the two-week dosing interval and downregulation of MYC expression was observed.\n    * Predictable and consistent pharmacokinetics profile with rapid clearance, minimal variability observed within and between patients, and no accumulation observed with repeat administration.\n  * _Safety and tolerability_ : \n    * At the recommended dose for expansion (0.12 mg/kg), OTX-2002 showed a favorable safety profile, with infusion-related reactions being the most common adverse event, generally consistent with the known profile of other FDA-approved LNP-delivered therapeutics.\n  * _Preliminary clinical activity in HCC_ : \n    * The observed disease control rate (DCR) for response-evaluable HCC patients was 50%, with a best overall response of stable disease. This DCR is in-line with the historical benchmark range for completed Phase 1 trials for approved TKIs and PD-1 monotherapies in HCC (29-65%).\n\n\n\nThe Company plans to present the Phase 1 dataset at an upcoming scientific conference.\n\n**_Corporate Updates_**\n\nThe Board of Directors has appointed Kaan Certel, Ph.D., as Omega’s Chief Executive Officer, and Jennifer Nelson, Ph.D., as Chief Scientific Officer.\n\n  * Dr. Certel is a recognized leader with over 20 years of experience in the biopharmaceutical industry and academia with a track record of successfully driving strategic partnerships, corporate development, growth and innovation in the biopharmaceutical industry. He was previously Chief Business Officer at Omega and before that served as Chief Business Officer at BioCity Biopharma and Head of Oncology External Innovation at Sanofi.\n  * Dr. Nelson was Omega’s Senior Vice President of Research and, prior to that, was Vice President of Research at Flagship Pioneering, where she helped launch and develop bio-platform companies. She has previously served as Head of Vaccines at Laronde and played a leading role in advancing novel approaches to leveraging mRNA for therapeutic purposes at Moderna Therapeutics.\n\n\n\nAn updated corporate presentation is available on the Investors section of the Company’s website at [https://ir.omegatherapeutics.com/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9UtJEMIOLBQzXTry4wBQixFWHBLDW8XNMFX3ZUO8zhDLVdlxAy95x3qedOQSznA1HZby-vWPFWEPsg7cCO-MZU7W6nY--Ie0eYcuOqlCSjrhYgJyyzY7xk43_Nwvx4W3).\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results_**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $30.4 million, which is expected to fund operations into Q2 2025.\n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $12.8 million, compared to $16.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. The $3.7 million decrease in R&D expenses was primarily driven by a decrease in personnel-related expenses.\n\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $6.2 million, compared to $7.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The $1.0 million decrease in G&A expenses was primarily driven by a decrease in personnel-related expenses and consulting and professional fees.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $16.4 million, compared to $22.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in net loss was driven predominantly by the decrease in R&D and G&A expenses.\n\n**_About Omega Therapeutics_**\n\nOmega Therapeutics is a biotechnology company pioneering the development of a new class of programmable epigenomic medicines to treat or cure a broad range of diseases.

(Nasdaq: OMGA) (“Omega”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of a new class of programmable epigenomic mRNA medicines, today announced the publication of preclinical data from studies of OTX-2002 in _Nature Communications._ The article highlights the potential of Omega’s approach to precision epigenomic control and the ability of OTX-2002 to controllably regulate the historically undruggable MYC gene in multiple models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of primary liver cancer.\n\n“These proof-of-concept data demonstrate that by combining cutting edge understanding of DNA architecture and epigenomic regulation with our OMEGA platform, we can rapidly and prospectively design an epigenomic controller to lay intended epigenetic marks to controllably target nearly any gene and tune its expression,” said Mahesh Karande, President and Chief Executive Officer of Omega Therapeutics. “These preclinical data show OTX-2002’s exquisitely specific engagement of c-MYC, a master oncogene that has proven challenging to regulate by other modalities, resulting in its downregulation at the mRNA and protein level and robust anti-tumor effects across multiple preclinical HCC models. We believe this publication, along with the promising preliminary clinical data generated from our ongoing MYCHELANGELO™ I trial, further validates the capabilities of the OMEGA platform to develop programmable epigenomic mRNA therapeutics to potentially address a broad spectrum of diseases.”\n\nOTX-2002 is a first-in-class, bicistronic mRNA-encoded epigenomic controller (EC) delivered via liver-targeting lipid nanoparticles that is designed to durably downregulate MYC expression pre-transcriptionally via two different epigenetic modifications at two distinct genomic loci within the MYC gene. MYC is a master transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis and plays a significant role in more than 50% of all human cancers.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\nThe publication, titled “[ _Targeted Transcriptional Downregulation of MYC Using Epigenomic Controllers Demonstrates Antitumor Activity in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Models_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=s7W0WYWQQHdEWe-7ilTG-kX2PZXzIeCPBpAVCt8K0Pob_-N6c285SvEZNT04sGGoJSDW7Ln62QUyHxMrFhageyyPM3U3Ci19AgVlb4z4mazaXC8m-HR8I7LGimcKUD5opOx3TcEmzrzYYo0kMhQ4ceLK0LoDXcmB9286cBKScjnJTAjGydaqNASS8Hjl1KvMSu2NUbwk9hnddym2mNblndB3kJXBeUHLKfgQj1rHYpI3kxPSmhbZccjTOPU2QC9i_9xU4-1LY067ic1y6sYnoeXEMgrYX8jBjpoFV5XGaZs=) _,”_ describes OTX-2002 and its effects on tumor growth in cellular and animal models of HCC. Treatment with OTX-2002 resulted in the following:\n\n  * Rapid reduction in both MYC mRNA and protein levels \n  * Decreased viability of multiple HCC cell lines\n  * Dose-dependent reduction in tumor size and growth rate in preclinical models of HCC\n  * Antitumor activity and mechanism of action that is synergistic when combined with either tyrosine kinase inhibitors or immune checkpoint inhibitor agents\n  * Beneficial impact on the tumor microenvironment in immune-competent mice bearing HCC tumors as evidenced by a decrease in inhibitory regulatory T cells\n\n\n\nOTX-2002 is currently under clinical evaluation in the Phase 1/2 MYCHELANGELO™ I trial in adult patients with HCC and other MYC-associated solid tumors ([NCT05497453](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3npAySXww_WNtoMUlk_l7DA9CQP7WZDASXQIm_wytX2WND7s5TJKZ8_cZ3csav_GDC5IY4nFTxBykuRWtBOdPfyK5RKdWQpRsX5PT1N7P_K3TKoWTezT5Rc6lYF9DhE7yh53j8RtfAG8AaFYd8tnaw==)).\n\n**_About the OMEGA platform_** The OMEGA platform leverages the Company’s deep understanding of gene regulation, genomic architecture and epigenetic mechanisms to design programmable epigenomic mRNA medicines that precisely target and modulate gene expression at the pre-transcriptional level. Combining world-class data science capabilities with rational drug design and customized delivery, the OMEGA platform enables control of fundamental epigenetic processes and reprogramming of cellular physiology to address the root cause of disease. Omega’s modular and programmable mRNA medicines, called epigenomic controllers, target specific genomic loci within insulated genomic domains with high specificity to durably tune single or multiple genes to treat and cure diseases through unprecedented precision epigenomic control.\n\n**_About Omega Therapeutics_** Omega Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of a new class of programmable epigenomic mRNA medicines to treat or cure a broad range of diseases.
