(\"TELA Bio\"), a commercial-stage medical technology company focused on providing innovative soft-tissue reconstruction solutions, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Recent Highlights**\n\n  * Reported revenue of $19.0 million in the third quarter, representing growth of 26% over the prior year period;\n  * Increased demand for OviTex® and OviTex PRS Reinforced Tissue Matrix products during the third quarter, resulting in a year-over-year growth in unit sales volume for each product of approximately 39% and 44%, respectively;\n  * Closed on an underwritten public offering yielding gross proceeds of approximately $46.0 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses;\n  * Implemented certain operating efficiency improvements that are expected to reduce operating expenses in 2025 by between $5.0 million to $10.0 million from annualized first half of 2024 operating expenses; and\n  * Reiterated full year 2024 revenue guidance of $74.5 million to $76.5 million, representing 27% to 31% year-over-year growth. Impact from IV fluid shortages resulting from recent natural disasters may affect this projection but is currently unpredictable.\n\n\n\n“Third quarter revenue of $19 million was the highest in TELA Bio’s history and indicates a healthy demand for our products and a return to normalized growth across the OviTex portfolio following the second quarter’s external market disruptions,” said Antony Koblish, President and CEO of TELA Bio. “Our commercial leadership is prioritizing growth, and we are confident in our ability to demonstrate increased operating leverage going forward. With an additional $43 million in net proceeds following the recent underwritten public offering, and actions already taken to reduce operating expenses for 2025, we believe that we are amply funded to attain profitability with current resources.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue was $19.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 26% compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in unit sales of our products due to the addition of new customers and growing international sales. This growth was partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices caused by product mix as the share of smaller-sized units increased with the introduction of robotically compatible OviTex IHR and our increased focus in growing market share in high-volume minimally invasive and robotic procedures.\n\nGross profit was $12.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, or 68% of revenue, compared to $10.4 million, or 69% of revenue, in the same period in 2023. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a higher charge for excess and obsolete inventory as a percentage of revenue.\n\nOperating expenses were $22.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $20.6 million in the same period in 2023. The increase was due to higher compensation costs, including increased severance costs and additional employee-related expenses, as well as increased travel and consulting.\n\nLoss from operations was $9.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to a loss from operations of $10.2 million in the same period in 2023.\n\nNet loss was $10.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to a net loss of $11.0 million in the same period in 2023.\n\nCash and cash equivalents on September 30, 2024 totaled $17.3 million.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nTELA Bio will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, November 7, 2024, to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results. Investors interested in listening to the conference call should [_register online_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=NthYstOdBBNc4H9ds-6PKPUFcaA7y5xIUUdNUghLMQoNmin2jWhpvfWZscu-qF6dtbZAAzKBo9n07qWdAfc_vMl2vD-gcrDuooFpoSzpRY1iyBV1L3TBqdOPTVgFqud-XVB51zVVVn-2Wq_SnchZ0z6e7EOZJoBTKcihUsK8wA_grvXUzYn-6g8QpLSo6rED93csEOaaM34eVCZ3vJxMgOFKo22bAj_W-BDpbqKC8o6WG5OA1SDu4XsOs07pQ0F8dYCssmJxhLGnz7pBKBoim-d7syfOF3zpmeDQKUVIkCkiA5iZTmpyXtiIqCIj1qmtZPDeECnc_FDh64_k_Lrtn3vkIpHzsWctzYtgkwRtVPPVWIkgb62eu9rmYr6_yDg8JC6s48cBva7_hXONjfFB2djEspTNU58gWnWrhdAzy0g=).
