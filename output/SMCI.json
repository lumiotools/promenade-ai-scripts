Nasdaq Non-Compliance Update\n\nNovember 20, 2024\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  As previously announced, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (Nasdaq:SMCI) (“SMCI” or the “Company”), a Total IT Solution Provider for AI, Cloud, Storage and 5G/Edge, submitted a compliance plan to Nasdaq on November 18, 2024 with respect to supporting its request for an extension of time to regain compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements. In the compliance plan, the Company indicated that it believes it will be able to file both its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 (the “2024 Form 10-K”) and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 (the “Q1 2025 Form 10-Q”), and become current with its periodic filings within the discretionary period available to the Nasdaq staff to grant. \n\nConsistent with prior announcements, and in accordance with Nasdaq marketplace rules, the Company today announced that the Company received a notification letter from Nasdaq (the “Letter”) stating that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq listing rule 5250(c)(1), which requires timely filing of reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Letter was sent as a result of the Company’s delay in filing its Q1 2025 Form 10-Q and its continued delay in filing its 2024 Form 10-K. The 2024 Form 10-K was due on August 29, 2024 and the Q1 2025 Form 10-Q was due on November 12, 2024. The Company filed Form 12b-25s regarding the 2024 Form 10-K and the Q1 2025 Form 10-Q on August 30, 2024 and November 13, 2024, respectively. \n\nThe Letter has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. \n\n**Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements**\n\nStatements contained in this press release that are not historical fact may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
