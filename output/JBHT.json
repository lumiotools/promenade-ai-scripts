Hunt Corporate Drive Senior Vice President – Finance\nLowell, Arkansas 72745 (479) 820-2723\n(NASDAQ: JBHT)\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nJ.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. REPORTS U.S. GAAP REVENUES, NET EARNINGS AND\nEARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER 2024\n Third Quarter 2024 Revenue: $3.07 billion; down 3%\n Third Quarter 2024 Operating Income: $224.1 million; down 7%\n Third Quarter 2024 EPS: $1.49 vs. $1.80; down 17%\nLOWELL, Ark., October 15, 2024 - J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., (NASDAQ: JBHT) announced third\nquarter 2024 U.S. GAAP (United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net earnings of $152.1\nmillion, or diluted earnings per share of $1.49 versus third quarter 2023 net earnings of $187.4 million, or $1.80\nper diluted share.\nTotal operating revenue for the current quarter was $3.07 billion, a decrease of 3% compared with $3.16\nbillion for the third quarter 2023. The decline in revenue was primarily driven by a 5% and 6% decrease in\ngross revenue per load in Intermodal (JBI) and Truckload (JBT), respectively, a decline in load volume of 10%\nand 6% in Integrated Capacity Solutions (ICS) and Dedicated Contract Services® (DCS®), respectively, and\n6% fewer stops in Final Mile Services® (FMS). These items were partially offset by JBI load growth of 5%,\nwhich included growth in both the transcontinental and eastern networks, and a 3% increase in revenue per\nload in ICS. Current quarter total operating revenue, excluding fuel surcharge revenue, decreased less than\n1% versus the comparable quarter 2023.\nOperating income for the current quarter decreased 7% to $224.1 million versus $241.7 million for the third\nquarter 2023. Operating income decreased primarily due to lower revenue in all segments excluding JBI, and\nhigher personnel-related, insurance and claims, and equipment-related expense compared to third quarter\n2023. On a consolidated basis, operating income as a percentage of gross revenue decreased year-over-year\nas a result of the same aforementioned expense items, partially offset by lower rail and truck purchased\ntransportation costs as a percentage of gross revenue.\nNet interest expense for the current quarter increased compared to third quarter 2023 due primarily to higher\ninterest rates and the prior year including an interest component of a discrete income tax benefit.\nThe effective income tax rate in the current quarter was 25.2% versus 18.2% in the third quarter 2023. The\nincrease was due to the recording of a discrete benefit recognized in the prior-year quarter. We expect our\n2024 annual tax rate to be approximately 24.5%.\nSegment Information:\nIntermodal (JBI)\n Third Quarter 2024 Segment Revenue: $1.56 billion; flat\n Third Quarter 2024 Operating Income: $111.8 million; down 13%\nIntermodal volume increased 5% over the same period in 2023. Transcontinental network loads increased 7%,\nwhile eastern network loads increased 3% compared to the third quarter 2023. Demand for our intermodal\nservice improved throughout the quarter across both the transcontinental and eastern networks, supported by\nseasonal activity and strong performance from our rail providers. Demand was particularly strong on eastbound\ntranscontinental loads out of Southern California which increased by a double digit percentage as compared to\nthe prior year period. Segment gross revenue was flat from the prior-year period, reflecting the 5% increase in\nvolume and a 5% decrease in gross revenue per load, resulting from changes in customer rates, fuel surcharge\nrevenue, and the mix of freight. Revenue per load excluding fuel surcharge revenue decreased 2% year-over-\nyear.\nOperating income decreased 13% in the third quarter primarily from lower yields, which was only partially offset\nby the resulting impact of absorbing network and equipment costs with higher volume. During the quarter,\nnetwork imbalance and repositioning costs were elevated, along with driver hiring costs to meet peak season\ndemand for customers in the quarter. JBl segment operating income as a percentage of segment gross revenue\ndeclined versus the prior-year period as a result of increases in professional driver and non-driver wages and\nbenefits, higher insurance and claims cost, and higher equipment-related and maintenance expenses as a\npercentage of gross revenue. During the period, we onboarded 308 new pieces of trailing equipment. We ended\nthe quarter with approximately 121,500 containers and 6,500 power units in the dray fleet.\nDedicated Contract Services (DCS)\n Third Quarter 2024 Segment Revenue: $846 million; down 5%\n Third Quarter 2024 Operating Income: $95.5 million; down 7%\nDCS revenue decreased 5% during the current quarter over the same period 2023 driven by a 3% decline in\naverage trucks combined with a 3% decline in productivity (revenue per truck per week). Productivity excluding\nfuel surcharge revenue was flat from a year ago driven primarily from lower utilization and increases in idled\nequipment, offset by contracted indexed-based price escalators. On a net basis, there were 498 fewer revenue\nproducing trucks in the fleet by the end of the quarter compared to the prior-year period, and 128 fewer versus\nthe end of the second quarter 2024. Customer retention rates are approximately 87%, largely reflecting\ndownsizing of fleets and to a lesser extent account losses.\nOperating income decreased 7% from the prior-year quarter primarily from lower revenue, higher insurance\nand claims and new-account start-up costs as compared to the prior-year period. These items were partially\noffset by lower personnel, bad debt and equipment-related expenses and the maturing of new business\nonboarded over the trailing twelve months. DCS segment operating income as a percentage of segment gross\nrevenue declined versus the prior-year period as a result of increases in professional driver and non-driver\nwages and benefits, insurance and claims expense, and higher equipment and maintenance costs, as a\npercentage of gross revenue.\nIntegrated Capacity Solutions (ICS)\n Third Quarter 2024 Segment Revenue: $278 million; down 7%\n Third Quarter 2024 Operating (Loss): $(3.3) million; vs. $(9.4) million in Q3'23\nICS revenue declined 7% during the current quarter versus the third quarter 2023. Overall segment volume\ndecreased 10% versus the prior-year period. Revenue per load increased 3% compared to the third quarter\n2023 due to increases in both contractual and transactional rates as well as changes in customer mix.\nContractual volume represented approximately 62% of the total load volume and 61% of the total revenue in\nthe current quarter compared to 68% and 67%, respectively, in third quarter 2023.\nOperating loss was $3.3 million compared to an operating loss of $9.4 million in the third quarter 2023. The\ndecrease in operating loss was largely driven by an $11.7 million increase in gross profit and lower cargo\nclaims and personnel-related expenses, partially offset by integration and transition costs related to the\npurchase of the brokerage assets of BNSF Logistics. Gross profit increased 31% as a result of higher gross\nprofit margins compared to the prior-year period. Gross profit margins increased to 17.9% in the current period\nversus 12.8% in the prior period as a result of our disciplined bid strategy, effective sourcing of capacity and\nsome project-related work. ICS’ carrier base decreased 18% year-over-year, largely driven by changes to\ncarrier qualification requirements to mitigate cargo theft.\nFinal Mile Services (FMS)\n Third Quarter 2024 Segment Revenue: $218 million; down 3%\n Third Quarter 2024 Operating Income: $12.0 million; down 7%\nFMS revenue decreased 3% compared to the same period 2023 primarily driven by general weakness in\ndemand across many of the end markets served. The decline in revenue was partially offset by multiple new\ncustomer contracts implemented over the trailing twelve months, as well as improved revenue quality on the\noverall business portfolio.\nOperating income decreased 7% compared to the prior-year period primarily driven by the decline in segment\nrevenue along with higher purchased transportation costs and insurance premiums as compared to the prior-\nyear period. These items were partially offset by lower personnel-related expenses.\nTruckload (JBT)\n Third Quarter 2024 Segment Revenue: $173 million; down 12%\n Third Quarter 2024 Operating Income: $8.2 million; up 6%\nJBT segment gross revenue decreased 12% compared to the same period in the previous year. Segment gross\nrevenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue decreased 9% due to a 6% decline in load volume and a 3% decline\nin gross revenue per load excluding fuel surcharge revenue. Total average effective trailer count decreased by\napproximately 300 units, or 2% versus the prior-year period. Trailer turns in the quarter were down 4% from\nthe prior-year period primarily due to softer overall freight demand as compared to the third quarter 2023.\nJBT segment operating income increased 6% to $8.2 million versus the third quarter 2023. The increase in\noperating income was primarily driven by improved network balance and lower trailing capacity costs. JBT\nsegment operating income as a percentage of segment gross revenue increased year-over-year due to the\naforementioned items, partially offset by higher personnel-related expenses and higher insurance premiums\nas a percentage of revenue. JBT continues to leverage the J.B. Hunt 360°® platform to grow third-party power\ncapacity and capability for the 360box® service offering.\nCash Flow and Capitalization:\nAt September 30, 2024, we had approximately $1.53 billion outstanding on various debt instruments compared\nto $1.45 billion at September 30, 2023 and $1.58 billion at December 31, 2023.\nOur net capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 approximated $488 million\ncompared to $1.32 billion for the same period 2023.

Demand for\nour intermodal service improved throughout the quarter across both\n$7,022 the transcontinental and eastern networks, supported by seasonal\n$7,000\nactivity and strong performance from our rail providers. Demand was\n$6,207 particularly strong on eastbound transcontinental loads out of\nSouthern California which increased by a double digit percentage as\n$6,000\ncompared to the prior year period. Segment gross revenue was flat\n$5,454\nfrom the prior-year period, reflecting the 5% increase in volume and\n$5,000 a 5% decrease in gross revenue per load, resulting from changes in\n$4,717 $4,745 $4,675\ncustomer rates, fuel surcharge revenue, and the mix of freight.\nRevenue per load excluding fuel surcharge revenue decreased 2%\n$4,084\n$4,000 $3,687 $3,796 year-over-year.\n$3,665\nOperating income decreased 13% in the third quarter primarily from\n$3,000 lower yields, which was only partially offset by the resulting impact of\nabsorbing network and equipment costs with higher volume. During\nthe quarter, network imbalance and repositioning costs were\n$2,000 elevated, along with driver hiring costs to meet peak season demand\n$1,555 $1,557\nfor customers in the quarter. JBl segment operating income as a\npercentage of segment gross revenue declined versus the prior-year\n$1,000 period as a result of increases in professional driver and non-driver\nwages and benefits, higher insurance and claims cost, and higher\nequipment-related and maintenance expenses as a percentage of\n$-\ngross revenue. During the period, we onboarded 308 new pieces of\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 3Q 23 3Q 24\ntrailing equipment.

The decrease in\noperating loss was largely driven by an $11.7 million increase\n$1,500\n$1,390\n$1,335 $1,348 in gross profit and lower cargo claims and personnel-related\nexpenses, partially offset by integration and transition costs\n$1,250\nrelated to the purchase of the brokerage assets of BNSF\n$1,025 Logistics. Gross profit increased 31% as a result of higher\n$1,000\ngross profit margins compared to the prior-year period. Gross\n$852\nprofit margins increased to 17.9% in the current period versus\n$718 $699\n$750 12.8% in the prior period as a result of our disciplined bid\nstrategy, effective sourcing of capacity and some project-\n$500 related work.

General\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information. We believe such statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring\nadjustments) necessary for the fair statement of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows at the dates and for the periods indicated. Pursuant\nto the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) applicable to quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, the accompanying financial statements do\nnot include all disclosures required by GAAP for annual financial statements. While we believe the disclosures presented are adequate to make the information\nnot misleading, these unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial\nStatements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Our\nbusiness is somewhat seasonal with slightly higher freight volumes typically experienced during August through early November in our full-load freight\ntransportation business.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies – Property and Equipment\nIn January 2024, we changed the estimated useful lives of certain trailing equipment used in our Intermodal segment from 20 years to 25 years. This\nchange did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Segment Reporting:\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires disclosure of significant segment expense categories and amounts for each of our reportable\nsegments. The new standard is effective retrospectively for us on January 1, 2024, for annual periods, and January 1, 2025, for interim periods, with early\nadoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this accounting pronouncement on our financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which enhances income tax disclosures to\nprovide more transparency about income tax information, primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid by jurisdiction information. These\ndisclosures will include consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and require income taxes paid to be\ndisaggregated by jurisdiction as well as additional amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The new standard is effective\nprospectively for us on January 1, 2025, with retrospective adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this accounting\npronouncement on our financial statements.\nRecent Disclosure Rules\nIn March 2024, the SEC adopted new rules that will require registrants to provide certain climate-related information in their registration statements and\nannual reports. These rules will require information about our climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our business, results\nof operations, or financial condition. The required information about climate-related risks will also include disclosure of our greenhouse gas emissions. In\naddition, the rules will require us to present certain climate-related financial metrics in our audited financial statements. We are currently evaluating the impact\nof the adoption of these rules on our financial statements and related disclosures and monitoring the status of the rules while legal challenges are pending.\n7\n2. Earnings Per Share\nWe compute basic earnings per share by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the actual weighted average number of common\nshares outstanding for the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if holders of unvested restricted and\nperformance share units converted their holdings into common stock. The dilutive effect of restricted and performance share units was 0.8 million shares\nduring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.1 million and 1.0 million shares during the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2023.\n3. Share-based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes the components of our share-based compensation program expense (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRestricted share units:\nPretax compensation expense $ 13,842 $ 14,433 $ 39,659 $ 41,886\nTax benefit 3,654 3,722 10,470 10,802\nRestricted share unit expense, net of tax $ 10,188 $ 10,711 $ 29,189 $ 31,084\nPerformance share units:\nPretax compensation expense $ 5,971 $ 6,240 $ 17,717 $ 18,632\nTax benefit 1,576 1,609 4,677 4,805\nPerformance share unit expense, net of tax $ 4,395 $ 4,631 $ 13,040 $ 13,827\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $67.2 million and $34.6 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted share units and\nperformance share units, respectively, that is to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of approximately 3.0 years for restricted share units\nand 2.2 years for performance share units. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 104,033 shares for vested restricted share units and\n138,115 shares for vested performance share units. Of this total, 67,173 shares for vested restricted share units and zero shares for vested performance share\nunits were issued during the third quarter 2024.\n4. Financing Arrangements\nOutstanding borrowings, net of unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance cost, under our current financing arrangements consist of the\nfollowing (in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nSenior credit facility $ 833.5 $ 627.9\nSenior notes 698.8 948.2\nLess current portion of long-term debt (500.0) (250.0)\nTotal long-term debt $ 1,032.3 $ 1,326.1\nSenior Credit Facility\nAt September 30, 2024, we were authorized to borrow up to $1.5 billion through a revolving line of credit and committed term loans, which is supported\nby a credit agreement with a group of banks. The revolving line of credit authorizes us to borrow up to $1.0 billion under a five-year term expiring September\n2027 and allows us to request an increase in the revolving line of credit total commitment by up to $300 million and to request two one-year extensions of the\nmaturity date. The committed term loans authorized us to borrow up to an additional $500 million during the nine-month period beginning September 27, 2022,\ndue September 2025, which we exercised in June 2023. The applicable interest rates under this agreement are based on either the Secured Overnight Financing\nRate (SOFR) or a Base Rate, depending upon the specific type of borrowing, plus an applicable margin and other fees. At September 30, 2024, we had $335\nmillion outstanding on the revolving line of credit and a $500 million outstanding balance of term loans, at an average interest rate of 6.07%, under this\nagreement.\n8\nSenior Notes\nOur senior notes consist of $700 million of 3.875% senior notes due March 2026, issued in March 2019. Interest payments under these notes are due\nsemiannually in March and September of each year beginning September 2019. These senior notes were issued by J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., a parent-\nlevel holding company with no significant tangible assets or operations. The notes are guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by our wholly-owned\noperating subsidiary. All other subsidiaries of the parent are minor. We registered these offerings and the sale of the notes under the Securities Act of 1933,\npursuant to a shelf registration statement filed in January 2019. These notes are unsecured obligations and rank equally with our existing and future senior\nunsecured debt. We may redeem for cash some or all of the notes based on a redemption price set forth in the note indenture. Our $250 million of 3.85% senior\nnotes matured in March 2024. The entire outstanding balance was paid in full at maturity.\nOur financing arrangements require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios at\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n5. Capital Stock\nOn July 20, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $500 million of our common stock. On August 16, 2024, our Board of Directors\nauthorized the purchase of up to an additional $1 billion of our common stock to be effective upon our purchase of the remaining balance under the July 2022\nauthorization. At September 30, 2024, the July 2022 authorization was fully exhausted, and $967 million of the August 2024 authorization was remaining. We\npurchased 2,551,033 shares, or $428 million, including applicable taxes, of our common stock under our repurchase authorizations during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, of which 1,200,330 shares, or $200 million, including applicable taxes, were purchased in the third quarter 2024. On July 17, 2024,\nour Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.43 per common share, which was paid on August 16, 2024, to shareholders of record on\nAugust 2, 2024. On October 17, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.43 per common share, which will be paid on\nNovember 22, 2024, to shareholders of record on November 8, 2024.\n6. Fair Value Measurements\nOur assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on valuation techniques which consider prices and other relevant information generated by\nmarket transactions involving identical or comparable assets and liabilities. These valuation methods are based on either quoted market prices (Level 1) or\ninputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2).\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following assets are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions):\nAsset\nBalance\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Input Level\nTrading investments $ 33.5 $ 31.6 1\nThe fair value of trading investments has been measured using the market approach (Level 1) and reflects quoted market prices. Trading investments are\nclassified in other assets in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe carrying amount of our senior credit facility and senior notes was $1.53 billion and $1.58 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. The estimated fair value of these liabilities using the income approach (Level 2), based on their net present value, discounted at our current\nborrowing rate, was $1.53 billion and $1.57 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n9\nThe carrying amounts of all other instruments at September 30, 2024, approximate their fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\n7. Income Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate was 25.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 18.2% for the three months ended September 30,\n2023, which included a discrete income tax benefit. Our effective income tax rate was 26.8% for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 23.2% in 2023. In\ndetermining our quarterly provision for income taxes, we use an estimated annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items. This rate is based on our\nexpected annual income, statutory tax rates, best estimate of nontaxable and nondeductible items of income and expense, and the ultimate outcome of tax\naudits.\nAt September 30, 2024, we had a total of $81.4 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits, which are a component of other long-term liabilities on our\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Of this amount, $66.0 million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact\nour effective tax rate. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties for such unrecognized tax benefits was $14.5 million at September 30, 2024.\n8. Commitments and Contingencies\nAs the result of state use tax audits, we have been assessed amounts owed from which we are vigorously appealing. We have recorded a liability for the\nestimated probable exposure under these audits and await resolution of the matter.\nWe purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to vehicular collisions and accidents. These policies include a level of self-insurance\n(deductible) coverage applicable to each claim, as well as certain coverage-layer-specific, aggregated reimbursement limits of covered excess claims. Our\nclaims from time to time exceed some of these existing coverage-layer, aggregated reimbursement limits, and accordingly, we have recorded a liability for the\nestimated probable exposure for these occurrences.\nWe are involved in certain other claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business. Based on present knowledge of the facts and,\nin certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, we believe the resolution of these claims and pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\n9. Acquisitions\nOn September 14, 2023, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire substantially all of the brokerage assets and assume certain specified\nliabilities of BNSF Logistics, LLC (BNSFL), an affiliate of Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC, subject to customary closing conditions. The closing of the\ntransaction was effective on September 30, 2023, with a purchase price of $85.0 million. Total consideration paid in cash under the BNSFL agreement was\n$81.2 million and consisted of the agreed upon purchase price reduced for estimated work capital adjustments. Transaction costs incurred were not material.\nThe BNSFL acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and operates within our Integrated Capacity Solutions business segment. Assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed were recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at their estimated fair values, as of the closing date, using cost, market data and\nvaluation techniques that reflect management’s judgment and estimates. As a result of the acquisition, we recorded approximately $38.5 million of definite-\nlived intangible assets and approximately $13.6 million of goodwill. Goodwill consists of acquiring and retaining the BNSFL existing brokerage network and\nexpected synergies from the combination of operations.\n10\n10. Business Segments\nWe reported five distinct business segments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. These segments included Intermodal (JBI),\nDedicated Contract Services® (DCS®), Integrated Capacity Solutions (ICS), Final Mile Services® (FMS), and Truckload (JBT). The operation of each of\nthese businesses is described in Note 13, Segment Information, of our Annual Report (Form 10-K) for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nA summary of certain segment information is presented below (in millions):\nAssets\n(Excludes intercompany accounts)\nAs of\nSeptember 30,\n2024 December 31, 2023\nJBI $ 3,577 $ 3,391\nDCS 2,297 2,355\nICS 301 350\nFMS 556 634\nJBT 396 419\nOther (includes corporate) 1,199 1,389\nTotal $ 8,326 $ 8,538\nOperating Revenues\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nJBI $ 1,557 $ 1,555 $ 4,360 $ 4,584\nDCS 846 892 2,557 2,659\nICS 278 298 834 1,026\nFMS 218 226 683 675\nJBT 173 196 519 594\nSubtotal 3,072 3,167 8,953 9,538\nInter-segment eliminations (4) (3) (12) (12)\nTotal $ 3,068 $ 3,164 $ 8,941 $ 9,526\nOperating Income/(Loss)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nJBI $ 111.8 $ 128.0 $ 312.9 $ 439.5\nDCS 95.5 102.4 285.6 318.6\nICS (3.3) (9.4) (34.1) (19.2)\nFMS 12.0 13.0 46.9 34.4\nJBT 8.2 7.7 12.9 16.5\nOther (includes corporate) (0.1) - - 0.1\nTotal $ 224.1 $ 241.7 $ 624.2 $ 789.9\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nJBI $ 62.2 $ 64.7 $ 184.0 $ 188.8\nDCS 82.7 84.8 247.1 240.5\nICS 6.2 1.1 13.8 3.4\nFMS 11.1 11.9 34.2 35.8\nJBT 8.9 10.9 27.1 32.8\nOther (includes corporate) 16.9 14.3 49.4 42.2\nTotal $ 188.0 $ 187.7 $ 555.6 $ 543.5\n11\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should refer to the attached interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes and also to our Annual Report (Form 10-K) for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, as you read the following discussion. We may make statements in this report that reflect our current expectation regarding\nfuture results of operations, performance, and achievements. These are “forward-looking” statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act\nof 1995 and are based on our belief or interpretation of information currently available. When we use words like “may,” “plan,” “contemplate,” “anticipate,”\n“believe,” “intend,” “continue,” “expect,” “project,” “goals,” “strategy,” “future,” “predict,” “seek,” “estimate,” “likely,” “could,” “should,” “would,” and\nsimilar expressions, you should consider them as identifying forward-looking statements, although we may use other phrasing. Forward-looking statements are\ninherently uncertain, subject to risks, and should be viewed with caution. These statements are based on our belief or interpretation of information currently\navailable. Shareholders and prospective investors are cautioned that actual results and future events may differ materially from these forward-looking\nstatements as a result of many factors. Some of the factors and events that are not within our control and that could have a material impact on future operating\nresults include the following: general economic and business conditions; competition and competitive rate fluctuations; excess capacity in the intermodal or\ntrucking industries; a loss of one or more major customers; cost and availability of diesel fuel; interference with or termination of our relationships with certain\nrailroads; rail service delays; disruptions to U.S. port-of-call activity; ability to attract and retain qualified drivers, delivery personnel, independent contractors,\nand third-party carriers; retention of key employees; insurance costs and availability; litigation and claims expense; determination that independent contractors\nare employees; new or different environmental or other laws and regulations; volatile financial credit markets or interest rates; terrorist attacks or actions; acts\nof war; adverse weather conditions; potential business or operational disruptions resulting from the effects of a national or international health pandemic;\ndisruption or failure of information systems; inability to keep pace with technological advances affecting our information technology platforms; operational\ndisruption or adverse effects of business acquisitions; increased costs for and availability of new revenue equipment; increased tariffs assessed on or disruptions\nin the procurement of imported revenue equipment; decreases in the value of used equipment; and the ability of revenue equipment manufacturers to perform\nin accordance with agreements for guaranteed equipment trade-in values. Additionally, our business is somewhat seasonal with slightly higher freight volumes\ntypically experienced during August through early November in our full-load transportation business. You should also refer to Part I, Item 1A of our Annual\nReport (Form 10-K) for the year ended December 31, 2023, for additional information on risk factors and other events that are not within our control. Our\nfuture financial and operating results may fluctuate as a result of these and other risk factors or events as described from time to time in our filings with the\nSEC. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to the extent we become aware that it will not be achieved for any reason.\nGENERAL\nWe are one of the largest surface transportation, delivery, and logistics companies in North America. We operate five distinct, but complementary, business\nsegments and provide a wide range of reliable transportation, brokerage, and delivery services to a diverse group of customers and consumers throughout the\ncontinental United States, Canada, and Mexico. Our service offerings include transportation of full-truckload containerized freight, which we directly transport\nutilizing our company-controlled revenue equipment and company drivers, independent contractors, or third-party carriers. We have arrangements with most of\nthe major North American rail carriers to transport freight in containers or trailers, while we perform the majority of the pickup and delivery services. We also\nprovide customized freight movement, revenue equipment, labor, systems, and delivery services that are tailored to meet individual customers’ requirements\nand typically involve long-term contracts. These arrangements are generally referred to as dedicated services and may include multiple pickups and drops,\nfreight handling, specialized equipment, and freight network design. In addition, we provide or arrange for local and home delivery services, generally referred\nto as last-mile delivery services, to customers through a network of cross-dock and other delivery system locations throughout the continental United States.\nUtilizing thousands of reliable third-party carriers, we also provide comprehensive freight transportation brokerage and logistics services. In addition to dry-\nvan, full-load operations, we also arrange for these unrelated outside carriers to provide flatbed, refrigerated, less-than-truckload (LTL), and other specialized\nequipment, drivers, and services. Also, we utilize a combination of company-owned and contracted power units to provide traditional over-the-road full\ntruckload delivery services. Our customers, who include many Fortune 500 companies, have extremely diverse businesses. Many of them are served by J.B.\nHunt 360°®, an online platform that offers shippers and carriers greater access, visibility and transparency of the supply chain. We account for our business on\na calendar year basis, with our full year ending on December 31 and our quarterly reporting periods ending on March 31, June 30, and September 30. The\noperation of each of our five business segments is described in Note 10, Business Segments, in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Note 13, Segment Information, of our Annual Report (Form 10-K) for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n12\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts\nreported in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Therefore, the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,\nexpenses, and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis, utilizing\nhistorical experience, consultation with experts, and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may\ndiffer significantly from our estimates. Any effects on our business, financial position, or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are\nrecognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.\nInformation regarding our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates can be found in our Annual Report (Form 10-K). The critical accounting policies that\nwe believe require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements include those relating to self-insurance\naccruals, revenue equipment, revenue recognition and income taxes. We have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and\nestimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. In addition, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the financial statements in\nour Annual Report (Form 10-K) for the year ended December 31, 2023, contains a summary of our critical accounting policies. There have been no material\nchanges to the methodology we apply for critical accounting estimates as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nComparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nSummary of Operating Segment Results\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions)\nOperating Revenues Operating Income/(Loss)\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nJBI $ 1,557 $ 1,555 $ 111.8 $ 128.0\nDCS 846 892 95.5 102.4\nICS 278 298 (3.3) (9.4)\nFMS 218 226 12.0 13.0\nJBT 173 196 8.2 7.7\nOther (includes corporate) - - (0.1) -\nSubtotal 3,072 3,167 224.1 241.7\nInter-Segment eliminations (4) (3) - -\nTotal $ 3,068 $ 3,164 $ 224.1 $ 241.7\nTotal consolidated operating revenues were $3.07 billion for the third quarter 2024, a 3% decrease from $3.16 billion in the third quarter 2023. This\ndecrease was primarily the result of decreased revenue per load in JBI and JBT, lower volumes in ICS, JBT, and DCS, and a decrease in stops in FMS when\ncompared to the third quarter 2023. These decreases were partially offset by load volume growth in JBI and an increase in ICS revenue per load in the current\nquarter over the past year. Total consolidated operating revenue, excluding fuel surcharge revenue, decreased less than 1%.\n13\nJBI segment reported revenue of $1.56 billion during the third quarter 2024, which was flat compared to third quarter 2023, resulting from a 5% increase\nin load volume being fully offset by a 5% decrease in revenue per load, which is determined by the combination of customer rates, fuel surcharges, and freight\nmix. The increase in load volumes was primarily driven by increased customer demand, seasonal activity, and rail network improvements. Transcontinental\nloads increased 7% and eastern network load volume increased 3% compared to the third quarter 2023. Revenue per load, excluding fuel surcharge revenue,\ndecreased 2% compared to the third quarter 2023. JBI segment operating income decreased 13% to $111.8 million in third quarter 2024 from $128.0 million in\n2023. The decrease was primarily due to increased network imbalance and repositioning cost and higher driver wages to meet peak season customer demand as\nwell as increased maintenance and equipment-related costs, higher insurance premium and claims expense, and higher other personnel-related expenses,\ncompared to third quarter 2023. The current quarter ended with approximately 121,500 units of trailing capacity and 6,500 power units assigned to the dray\nfleet.\nDCS segment revenue decreased 5% to $846 million in the third quarter 2024 from $892 million in 2023. Productivity, defined as revenue per truck per\nweek, decreased 3% when compared to the third quarter 2023. Productivity, excluding fuel surcharge revenue, remained flat, primarily due to decreased asset\nutilization and increased idle equipment, offset by contractual index-based rate increases. On a net basis, revenue-producing trucks in the fleet at the end of the\nthird quarter 2024 decreased by 498 trucks, or 4%, compared to the prior-year period. DCS segment operating income decreased 7% to $95.5 million in the\nthird quarter 2024, from $102.4 million in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to decreased revenue, increased insurance premium and claims expense, and\nhigher new account start-up costs, partially offset by lower maintenance and equipment-related costs, lower bad debt expense, and the maturing of new\nbusiness onboarded over the past year when compared to the third quarter 2023. Customer retention rates are approximately 87%, primarily due to fleet\ndownsizing and customer account losses.\nICS segment revenue decreased 7% to $278 million in the third quarter 2024, from $298 million in 2023. Overall volumes decreased 10% compared to the\nthird quarter 2023, while revenue per load increased 3%, primarily due to higher contractual and spot rates and changes in customer freight mix. Contractual\nbusiness represented approximately 62% of total load volume and 61% of total revenue in the third quarter 2024, compared to 68% and 67%, respectively, in\n2023. Approximately $92 million of third quarter 2024 ICS revenue was executed through the Marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360, compared to $169 million in the\nthird quarter 2023. ICS segment had an operating loss of $3.3 million in the third quarter 2024, compared to an operating loss of $9.4 million in 2023. The\ndecrease in operating loss was driven primarily by a 31% increase in gross profit, lower cargo claims expense, and lower personnel-related expenses, partially\noffset by integration and transition costs related to the purchase of the brokerage assets of BNSF Logistics, LLC (BNSFL). Gross profit margin increased to\n17.9% in the third quarter 2024, compared to 12.8% in 2023, reflecting focused bid season yield management, improved capacity procurement, and certain\nproject-related activity. ICS’s carrier base decreased 18% compared to third quarter 2023, primarily due to changes in carrier qualification requirements.\nFMS segment revenue decreased 3% to $218 million in the third quarter 2024 from $226 million in 2023, primarily due to general weakness in customer\ndemand, partially offset by the addition of multiple new customer contracts implemented over the past year as well as internal efforts to improve revenue\nquality across certain accounts. FMS segment operating income decreased to $12.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $13.0 million in 2023. This\ndecrease was primarily due to decreased revenue, higher purchased transportation costs and higher insurance premiums expense, partially offset by decreased\npersonnel-related expenses compared to the third quarter 2023.\nJBT segment revenue decreased 12% to $173 million in the third quarter 2024, from $196 million in 2023. Revenue, excluding fuel surcharge revenue,\ndecreased 9% primarily due to a 6% decrease in load volume and a 3% decrease in revenue per load, excluding fuel surcharge revenue, compared to third\nquarter 2023. JBT average effective trailer count in third quarter 2024 decreased 2% to 12,588, compared to third quarter 2023. Trailer turns in third quarter\n2024 decreased 4% compared to third quarter 2023, due to weakened overall customer demand. At the end of third quarter 2024, the JBT power fleet consisted\nof 1,989 tractors. JBT segment operating income increased to $8.2 million in 2024, compared with $7.7 million during third quarter 2023. The increase is\nprimarily due to improved network balance, decreased trailing capacity costs, and overall cost management initiatives, partially offset by higher insurance\npremiums expense.\n14\nConsolidated Operating Expenses\nThe following table sets forth items in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage\nincrease or decrease of those items as compared with the prior period.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nDollar Amounts as a Percentage Change\nPercentage of Total of Dollar Amounts\nOperating Revenues Between Quarters\n2024 2023 2024 vs. 2023\nTotal operating revenues 100.0% 100.0% (3.0)%\nOperating expenses:\nRents and purchased transportation 45.0 45.6 (4.4)\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits 26.4 25.4 0.8\nDepreciation and amortization 6.1 5.9 0.1\nFuel and fuel taxes 5.2 6.2 (19.0)\nOperating supplies and expenses 4.2 4.1 (2.3)\nInsurance and claims 2.6 2.0 25.2\nGeneral and administrative expenses, net of asset dispositions 2.2 2.3 4.3\nOperating taxes and licenses 0.6 0.6 (5.5)\nCommunication and utilities 0.4 0.3 7.3\nTotal operating expenses 92.7 92.4 (2.7)\nOperating income 7.3 7.6 (7.3)\nNet interest expense 0.7 0.4 64.9\nEarnings before income taxes 6.6 7.2 (11.3)\nIncome taxes 1.6 1.3 23.0\nNet earnings 5.0% 5.9% (18.9)%\nTotal operating expenses decreased 2.7%, while operating revenues decreased 3.0% during the third quarter 2024 from the comparable period 2023.\nOperating income decreased to $224.1 million during the third quarter 2024 from $241.7 million in 2023.\nRents and purchased transportation costs decreased 4.4% in the third quarter 2024. This decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in rail and truck\ncarrier purchased transportation rates within JBI, ICS, and JBT segments and decreased ICS and JBT load volumes, which decreased services provided by\nthird-party rail and truck carriers during the third quarter 2024 compared to 2023.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits costs increased 0.8% during the third quarter 2024, compared with 2023. This increase was primarily due to\nincreased group medical benefit expenses, partially offset by a decrease in non-driver employee headcounts.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased 0.1% in third quarter 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to the addition of trailing equipment\nwithin JBI and additional depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the recent business acquisition, partially offset by the impact of the change in\nexpected useful lives of our container fleet and equipment reductions within DCS. Fuel costs decreased 19.0% in the third quarter 2024, compared with 2023,\ndue primarily to a decrease in the price of fuel and decreased road miles.\nOperating supplies and expenses decreased 2.3%, driven primarily by decreased tolls expense, lower towing costs, and decreased other operating supply\ncosts, partially offset by higher equipment maintenance costs. Insurance and claims expenses increased 25.2% in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to\nhigher insurance policy premiums expense. General and administrative expenses increased 4.3% for the current quarter from the comparable period in 2023,\nprimarily due to higher building and yard rental expense and increased professional services expense, partially offset by a decrease in net loss from sale or\ndisposal of assets and lower bad debt expense. Net loss from sale or disposal of assets was $0.8 million in 2024, compared to a net loss from sale or disposal of\nassets of $7.7 million in 2023.\n15\nNet interest expense increased 64.9% in 2024 due to an increase in effective interest rates on our debt and an increase in our average debt balance\ncompared to third quarter 2023. In addition, third quarter 2023 interest expense included an interest component of a discrete income tax benefit recognized in\nthe quarter. Income tax expense increased 23.0% in 2024, compared with 2023, primarily due to a higher effective income tax rate in the third quarter 2024\ncompared with 2023, which included the recording of a discrete benefit, partially offset by lower taxable earnings. Our effective income tax rate was 25.2% for\nthe third quarter of 2024, compared to 18.2% in 2023. Our annual tax rate for 2024 is expected to be approximately 24.5.%. In determining our quarterly\nprovision for income taxes, we use an estimated annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items. This rate is based on our expected annual income,\nstatutory tax rates, best estimate of nontaxable and nondeductible items of income and expense, and the ultimate outcome of tax audits.\nComparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nSummary of Operating Segment Results\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions)\nOperating Revenues Operating Income/(loss)\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nJBI $ 4,360 $ 4,584 $ 312.9 $ 439.5\nDCS 2,557 2,659 285.6 318.6\nICS 834 1,026 (34.1) (19.2)\nFMS 683 675 46.9 34.4\nJBT 519 594 12.9 16.5\nOther (includes corporate) - - - 0.1\nSubtotal 8,953 9,538 624.2 789.9\nInter-segment eliminations (12) (12) - -\nTotal $ 8,941 $ 9,526 $ 624.2 $ 789.9\nTotal consolidated operating revenues were $8.94 billion for the first nine months of 2024, a 6% decrease from $9.53 billion for the comparable period\n2023. Fuel surcharge revenue decreased to $1.16 billion during the first nine months of 2024, compared with $1.39 billion in 2023. Total consolidated\noperating revenue, excluding fuel surcharge revenue, decreased 5% for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior-year period.\nJBI segment revenue decreased 5% to $4.36 billion during the first nine months of 2024, compared with $4.58 billion in 2023. Load volume during the\nfirst nine months of 2024 increased 1% and revenue per load decreased 6%, compared to a year ago. Revenue per load, excluding fuel surcharge revenue,\ndecreased 5% compared to the first nine months of 2023. JBI segment operating income decreased 29% to $312.9 million in the first nine months of 2024,\nfrom $439.5 million in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to decreased revenue and higher driver wages and benefits, increased maintenance and equipment-\nrelated costs, and higher insurance premiums expense.\nDCS segment revenue decreased 4% to $2.56 billion during the first nine months of 2024, from $2.66 billion in 2023. Productivity, defined as revenue per\ntruck per week, decreased 2% from a year ago. Productivity, excluding fuel surcharge revenue, for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 1% from a year ago.\nThe decrease in productivity was primarily due to decreased utilization of equipment, partially offset by contractual index-based rate increases during the\ncurrent period. Operating income of our DCS segment decreased to $285.6 million in the first nine months of 2024, from $318.6 million in 2023. The decrease\nis primarily due to decreased revenue, higher insurance premiums expense, and higher new account start-up costs, partially offset by decreased equipment-\nrelated costs, lower personnel costs, decreased loss on equipment sales, and the maturing of new business onboarded over the past year, when compared to the\nfirst nine months of 2023.\n16\nICS revenue decreased 19% to $834 million during the first nine months of 2024, from $1.03 billion in 2023. Overall volumes decreased 20%, while\nrevenue per load increased 1% compared to 2023. Approximately $302 million of ICS revenue for the first nine months of 2024 was executed through the\nMarketplace for J.B. Hunt 360 compared to $644 million in 2023. ICS segment had an operating loss of $34.1 million in the first nine months of 2024\ncompared to an operating loss of $19.2 million in 2023, primarily due to decreased gross profit and integration and transition costs related to the purchase of\nthe brokerage assets of BNSFL. These items were partially offset by lower salary, wages, and benefits expenses and reduced equipment rental expense during\nthe first nine months of 2024. Gross profit margin increased to 15.7% in the current period compared to 13.1% in 2023, reflecting our focused bid season yield\nmanagement and improved capacity procurement.\nFMS revenue increased 1% to $683 million during the first nine months of 2024, from $675 million in 2023, primarily due to the addition of multiple new\ncustomer contracts implemented over the past year, partially offset by internal efforts to improve revenue quality across certain accounts and general weakness\nin customer demand. FMS segment had operating income of $46.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to $34.4 million in 2023. This increase\nwas primarily due to increased revenue and decreased personnel expenses as well as a $4.2 million net benefit from offsetting claim settlements, partially offset\nby higher insurance premiums expense compared to the first nine months of 2023.\nJBT segment revenue decreased 13% to $519 million for the first nine months of 2024, from $594 million in 2023. Revenue, excluding fuel surcharge\nrevenue, decreased 12%, primarily due to a 5% decrease in revenue per load, excluding fuel surcharge revenue, and a 7% decrease in load volume compared to\nthe first nine months of 2023. Operating income of our JBT segment decreased to $12.9 million in the first nine months of 2024, from $16.5 million in 2023.\nThe decrease in operating income was driven primarily by the decrease in revenue and higher insurance premiums expense, partially offset by overall cost\nmanagement initiatives.\nConsolidated Operating Expenses\nThe following table sets forth items in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage\nincrease or decrease of those items as compared with the prior period.\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nDollar Amounts as a Percentage Change\nPercentage of Total of Dollar Amounts\nOperating Revenues Between Periods\n2024 2023 2024 vs 2023\nTotal operating revenues 100.0% 100.0% (6.1)%\nOperating expenses:\nRents and purchased transportation 44.0 45.3 (8.8)\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits 27.1 25.7 (1.2)\nDepreciation and amortization 6.2 5.7 2.2\nFuel and fuel taxes 5.6 5.9 (11.9)\nOperating supplies and expenses 4.2 4.1 (4.4)\nInsurance and claims 2.5 2.1 15.5\nGeneral and administrative expenses, net of asset dispositions 2.4 2.0 17.0\nOperating taxes and licenses 0.6 0.6 (5.3)\nCommunication and utilities 0.4 0.3 7.1\nTotal operating expenses 93.0 91.7 (4.8)\nOperating income 7.0 8.3 (21.0)\nNet interest expense 0.7 0.4 34.8\nEarnings before income taxes 6.3 7.9 (24.1)\nIncome taxes 1.7 1.9 (12.1)\nNet earnings 4.6% 6.0% (27.7)%\nTotal operating expenses decreased 4.8%, while operating revenues decreased 6.1%, during the first nine months of 2024, from the comparable period of\n2023. Operating income decreased to $624.2 million during the first nine months of 2024, from $789.9 million in 2023.\nRents and purchased transportation costs decreased 8.8% in 2024. This decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in rail and truck carrier purchased\ntransportation rates within JBI, ICS, and JBT segments and decreased ICS and JBT load volume, which decreased services provided by third-party rail and\ntruck carriers during the current period.\n17\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits costs decreased 1.2% in 2024 from 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in driver and office\nemployee headcounts, partially offset by an increase in group medical benefit expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased 2.2% in 2024 primarily due to equipment purchases related to the addition of tractors and trailing\nequipment within JBI and additional depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the recent business acquisition, partially offset by the impact of the\nchange in expected useful lives of our container fleet and equipment reductions within DCS. Fuel costs decreased 11.9% in 2024, compared with 2023, due\nprimarily to a decrease in the price of fuel and decreased road miles.\nOperating supplies and expenses decreased 4.4% primarily due to lower equipment maintenance costs, decreased towing expenses, lower tolls expense,\ndecreased other operating supply costs, and lower travel and entertainment expenses. Insurance and claims expense increased 15.5% in 2024 compared with\n2023, primarily due to higher insurance policy premium expense, partially offset by decreased cost per claim and lower claim volume in the current period.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased 17.0% from the comparable period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in building and yard rental expense,\nhigher professional services expense, increased technology costs, and higher bad debt expense, partially offset by lower advertising costs and lower net losses\nfrom sale or disposal of assets. Net loss from sale or disposal of assets was $13.3 million in 2024, compared to a net loss from sale or disposal of assets of\n$17.2 million in 2023.\nNet interest expense increased 34.8% in 2024, due primarily to an increase in effective interest rates on our debt and an increase in our average debt\nbalance. Income tax expense decreased 12.1% during the first nine months of 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to decreased taxable earnings, partially\noffset by a higher effective income tax rate in the first nine months of 2024. Our effective income tax rate was 26.8% for the first nine months of 2024,\ncompared to 23.2% in 2023 due to discrete tax items. Our annual tax rate for 2024 is expected to be approximately 24.5.%. In determining our quarterly\nprovision for income taxes, we use an estimated annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items. This rate is based on our expected annual income,\nstatutory tax rates, best estimate of nontaxable and nondeductible items of income and expense, and the ultimate outcome of tax audits.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flow\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.17 billion during the first nine months of 2024, compared with $1.53 billion for the same period 2023.\nOperating cash flows decreased primarily due to decreased earnings, partially offset by the timing of general working capital activities. Net cash used in\ninvesting activities totaled $477.5 million in 2024, compared with $1.40 billion in 2023. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in equipment\npurchases, net of proceeds from the sale of equipment in the current period. Net cash used in financing activities was $621.3 million in 2024, compared with\n$101.4 million in 2023. This increase resulted primarily from the retirement of long-term debt that matured in the first quarter of 2024 and an increase in\ntreasury stock purchased during the current period.\nLiquidity\nOur need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of containers and chassis, trucks, tractors, and trailers required to support our growth and\nthe replacement of older equipment, as well as periodic business acquisitions and real estate transactions. We are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a\nportion of equipment replacements or other capital expenditures depending on market and overall economic conditions. In recent years, we have obtained\ncapital through cash generated from operations, revolving lines of credit, and long-term debt issuances. We have also periodically utilized operating leases to\nacquire revenue equipment. For our senior credit facility term loans maturing in 2025, it is our intent to pay the entire outstanding balances in full, on or before\nthe maturity dates, using our existing cash balance, revolving line of credit or other sources of long-term financing.\n18\nWe believe our liquid assets, cash generated from operations, and revolving line of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital\nrequirements for the foreseeable future. At September 30, 2024 we were authorized to borrow up to $1.5 billion through a revolving line of credit and\ncommitted term loans, which is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks. The revolving line of credit authorizes us to borrow up to $1.0 billion\nunder a five-year term expiring September 2027 and allows us to request an increase in the revolving line of credit total commitment by up to $300 million and\nto request two one-year extensions of the maturity date. The committed term loans authorized us to borrow up to an additional $500 million during the nine-\nmonth period beginning September 27, 2022, due September 2025, which we exercised in June 2023. The applicable interest rates under this agreement are\nbased on either the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), or a Base Rate, depending upon the specific type of borrowing, plus an applicable margin and\nother fees. At September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance of $120.0 million. Under our senior credit facility, we had a $335 million outstanding balance on the\nrevolving line of credit and a $500 million outstanding balance of term loans at an average interest rate of 6.07%.\nWe continue to evaluate the possible effects of current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts on operational cash flows,\nincluding the risks of declines in the overall freight market and our customers' liquidity and ability to pay. We regularly monitor working capital and maintain\nfrequent communication with our customers, suppliers and service providers. A large portion of our cost structure is variable. Purchased transportation expense\nrepresents more than half of our total costs and is heavily tied to load volumes. Our second largest cost item is salaries and wages, the largest portion of which\nis driver pay, which includes a large variable component.\nOur financing arrangements require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios. At September 30, 2024, we were compliant with all covenants\nand financial ratios.\nOur net capital expenditures were approximately $488.1 million during the first nine months of 2024, compared with $1.32 billion for the same period\n2023. Our net capital expenditures include net additions to revenue equipment and non-revenue producing assets that are necessary to contribute to and support\nthe future growth of our various business segments. Capital expenditures in 2024 were primarily for tractors, intermodal containers and chassis and other\ntrailing equipment. We expect to spend approximately $625 million for net capital expenditures during the full calendar year 2024. We are currently committed\nto spend approximately $385 million, net of proceeds from sales or trade-ins, during the years 2024 and 2025, as well as an additional $237 million thereafter.\nThese expenditures will relate primarily to the acquisition of tractors, containers and chassis, and other trailing equipment. At September 30, 2024, our\naggregate future minimum lease payments under operating lease obligations totaled $370 million, related primarily to the rental of maintenance and support\nfacilities, cross-dock and delivery system facilities, office space, parking yards, and equipment.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements, other than our net purchase commitments of $622 million, as of September 30, 2024.\nRisk Factors\nYou should refer to Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report (Form 10-K) for the year ended December 31, 2023, under the caption “Risk Factors” for specific\ndetails on the following factors and events that are not within our control and could affect our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\n● Our business is significantly impacted by economic conditions, customer business cycles, and seasonal factors.\n● Extreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations, impact freight volumes, and increase our costs, all of which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business results.\n19\n● Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including legislative and regulatory responses to climate change.\nCompliance with environmental requirements could result in significant expenditures and the violation of these regulations could result in substantial\nfines or penalties.\n● We depend on third parties in the operation of our business.\n● Rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results.\n● Insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings.\n● We operate in a regulated industry, and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future\nregulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n● Difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers and delivery personnel could affect our profitability and ability to grow.\n● Our business is significantly impacted by the effects of national or international health pandemics on general economic conditions and the operations\nof our customers and third-party suppliers and service providers.\n● We operate in a competitive and highly fragmented industry. Numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to\ncompete with other carriers and private fleets.\nRisks Related to Our Business\n● We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on\nour business.\n● A determination that independent contractors are employees could expose us to various liabilities and additional costs.\n● We may be subject to litigation claims that could result in significant expenditures.\n● We rely significantly on our information technology systems, a disruption, failure or security breach of which or inability to keep pace with\ntechnological advances could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n● Acquisitions or business combinations may disrupt or have a material adverse effect on our operations or earnings.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest rate risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a near-term adverse increase in short-term interest rates on variable-rate debt\noutstanding. Our total long-term debt consists of both fixed and variable interest rate facilities. Our senior notes have a fixed interest rate of 3.875%. These\nfixed-rate facilities reduce the impact of changes to market interest rates on future interest expense. Our senior credit facility has variable interest rates, which\nare based on either SOFR or a Base Rate, depending upon the specific type of borrowing, plus an applicable margin and other fees. At September 30, 2024, the\naverage interest rate under our senior credit facility was 6.07%. Our earnings would be affected by changes in these short-term variable interest rates. At our\ncurrent level of borrowing, a one-percentage-point increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by $8.4 million.\nAlthough we conduct business in foreign countries, foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024. Accordingly, we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange\nrate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment. As of September\n30, 2024, we had no foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates.\n20\nThe price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production, seasonality, weather, and other\nmarket factors. Historically, we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges. We cannot\npredict the extent to which high fuel price levels may occur in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nWe maintain controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in the reports we file with the SEC is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC rules, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of\nthe end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in\nRules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nPart II. Other Information\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe are involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business. Based on present knowledge of the facts and, in\ncertain cases, opinions of outside counsel, we believe the resolution of these claims and pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInformation regarding risk factors appears in Part I, Item 2, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of\nthis report on Form 10-Q and in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n21\nITEM 2.
